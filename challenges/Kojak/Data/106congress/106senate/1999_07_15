Mr. President, I have sought recognition in this special \norder to introduce legislation, on behalf of Senator Helms, the \nChairman of the Foreign Relations Committee; Senator Biden, the ranking \nDemocrat; Senator Dorgan and Senator Schumer, which would provide for \nelectronic filing of Shippers' Export Declarations. This legislation \ntakes up a recommendation of the Commission on Weapons of Mass \nDestruction and is directed to assist in our export control to stop \nthose who would acquire the material for weapons of mass destruction \nfrom accumulating those weapons. At the present time, there are very \nsophisticated ways of ordering the component parts of weapons of mass \ndestruction which are not known and cannot be readily ascertained \nbecause of the voluminous paper filings.\n  This legislation would call for electronic filing and would enable \nour Government to be able to regulate in a desirable fashion, without \nundue burden on exporters, materials which can be used for nuclear, \nbiological, or chemical weapons. This is a recommendation of the \nCommission on Weapons of\n\n[[Page S8532]]\n\nMass Destruction which filed its report yesterday with copies to the \nPresident and to the legislative leaders.\n  This Commission was established by legislation under the Intelligence \nAuthorization Act signed into law in October of 1996 when I chaired the \nSenate Intelligence Committee. This legislation was designed to deal \nwith the enormous threat posed to the United States by weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  When I chaired the Intelligence Committee in 1995 and 1996, I was \naghast at the kinds of problems which I saw with respect to rogue \nnations having ballistic capabilities for the delivery of nuclear \nweapons. Since that time, it has been publicly commented that North \nKorea has nuclear capability; that they have trajectory and ballistic \ncapability to reach parts of the United States; that they pose an \nenormous threat. It is well known that other rogue nations seek \nballistic capability as well. We now find that a nuclear device can be \ncarried across national borders in a suitcase. We have seen in the \nexperience of the Tokyo subway catastrophe the potential for biological \nand chemical warfare.\n  Those capabilities are so important that there needs to be preventive \naction to deal with them in advance of a catastrophe. Regrettably, our \nGovernment customarily reacts, instead of acting in anticipation.\n  The Commission was formed because there are now some 96 separate \nagencies dealing with weapons of mass destruction, and the Commission \nfiled in its report a recommendation urging Presidential action with \nthe suggestion that the authority be concentrated in the hands of the \nVice President. There have been jurisdictional disputes, turf battles, \nbut the Vice President would have the clout to adjudicate disputes and \nto coordinate the efforts on this matter of such enormous national and \ninternational importance.\n  The Commission recommended providing staffing, with a director to the \nNational Security Council, a top level position, to preside over a \ncouncil of representatives from the various Departments--State, Energy, \nDefense, Commerce, et cetera--with ranking officials who have been \nconfirmed by the Senate.\n  One of the key recommendations of the Commission on Weapons of Mass \nDestruction was to mandate electronic filing on export items which are \nin the category that they could provide component parts for weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  My staff, Dobie McArthur, has already taken the lead in circulating \nthis legislation among a number of Senators. We have had a favorable \nresponse from Senator Helms and Senator Biden, chairman and ranking \nmember of the Foreign Relations Committee. There is an excellent \nopportunity that this provision could be included in a markup of \nForeign Relations this month. As noted earlier, Senator Dorgan and \nSenator Schumer have also joined as cosponsors.\n  What this legislation does is to provide for the electronic filing of \nwhat is known and currently required as a shipper's export declaration. \nIn 1995, the Customs Service and the Census Bureau created the \nautomated export system, but that system has been utilized by only \nabout 10 percent of the filers.\n  This legislation provides that the electronic filing requirement \nwould come into operation 180 days after the Secretary of Commerce and \nthe Secretary of Treasury certify that a secure Internet-based filing \nsystem is up and running. The requirements would be directed toward \ncomponents which could be used in the manufacture of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  The problem is illustrated by action taken by Iraq in the acquisition \nof weapons of mass destruction. In a very sophisticated way, when Iraq \nwas purchasing its component parts, instead of buying them all at one \ntime and all from a single supplier, or quite a number of items from a \nsingle supplier a few times, the Iraqis would buy an item here, an item \nthere, an item somewhere else, from a wide variety of suppliers, so it \nwas impossible, without some tracking system, to find out exactly what \nIraq was doing as they were acquiring these components for weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  As we all know, there is dual use on many of these items; that is to \nsay, they can be used for peaceful purposes or they can be used for \nputting together weapons of mass destruction. In this way, with a \nsophisticated system, a purchaser may acquire the ingredients to \nproduce weapons of mass destruction.\n  Electronic filing will put the matter all under one umbrella. Without \nundue burden on shippers, there can be a determination as to what is \nbeing purchased which has the potential for being turned into a nuclear \nweapon, a biological weapon, or a chemical weapon of mass destruction.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on my allotment of 15 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes 14 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I will use that time on another subject \nof currency and importance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/15/senate-section/article/S8532-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8532-S8533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             GATHERING EVIDENCE FOR THE WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the War Crimes Tribunal, which was \ncreated by United Nations resolution for prosecuting crimes against \nhumanity arising in the former Yugoslavia, has brought very significant \nindictments out of the events in Bosnia. There have been indictments; \nthere have been some convictions. The work of the War Crimes Tribunal \nhas taken on even greater significance as a result of what has happened \nin the war with Kosovo, with the very noteworthy and important \nindictment against President Milosevic of Yugoslavia.\n  The Tribunal is now in the process of gathering evidence in Kosovo. \nJustice Louise Arbour, who is head of the War Crimes Tribunal and has \ngiven notice of her intention to leave to become a justice in the \nCanadian judicial system, visited the Senate back on April 30, 1999. \nShe met with a group of Senators, including myself, and pointed out the \nneed for the acquisition of evidence.\n  There had been a preliminary allocation of some $5 million. That was \nsupplemented in the emergency appropriations bill with the direction \nfor an additional $13 million, for a total of $18 million to go towards \nthe Tribunal.\n  The FBI dispatched a group of investigators to acquire evidence in \nKosovo, but they have run out of money. Those funds, I believe, are \navailable in the Department of State. I have discussed this matter with \nthe FBI Director Louis Freeh. I compliment the FBI and Director Freeh \nfor their very prompt action in going to Kosovo to gather evidence.\n  From my own experience as district attorney of Philadelphia, I can \npersonally attest to the fact that evidence has to be acquired when it \nis fresh. If you do not get it with immediacy, it disappears.\n  A part of the evidence acquisition has been to question women who \nwere subjected to rape. In conversations with officials of the State \nDepartment yesterday, I found that the $50 million which has been \nappropriated for the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees has \nnot been released. So there is an urgency in making those funds \navailable for a variety of purposes, including a substantial part of \nthe $50 million to give attention to the women who have been rape \nvictims--in part to counsel them for their own mental health and in \nsignificant part to acquire their testimony in the prosecution of those \nviolent perpetrators of the rapes.\n  So I make these comments and urge that we move ahead with this \nfunding which has been authorized by the Congress, $50 million to the \nU.N. High Commissioner on Refugees, and also urge that funding be \nprovided in accordance with the direction of the Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations Bill so the FBI can have the funding to proceed \nimmediately to Kosovo to gather this very important evidence.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Will the Senator from Pennsylvania yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. First, I congratulate the Senator from Pennsylvania on \nhis leadership in this area. As he knows, we have worked together, but \nhe has certainly been in the forefront on the war crimes issue in \nparticular, the issue of rape as a war crime. We thank him for that.\n  Does the Senator from Pennsylvania know why the money is not being \nreleased?\n\n[[Page S8533]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my distinguished colleague from Maryland for \nthose kind remarks.\n  In response, I am advised by officials of the State Department that \nearly on were some problems in the United Nations agency. There is \nchaos, as one might expect, in Kosovo. The Kosovars are returning to \ntheir homes. Some have raised a point that the money was not being \nofficially utilized. I have been advised by the State Department that \nthe issue has now been corrected; so when I made inquiries of the State \nDepartment yesterday to liberate $2 million for the FBI, I was told \nthat they had this collateral problem and have begun discussions on the \nmatter with our appropriate colleagues to get the funds released.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Just for a point of information and clarification back \nto the Senator from Pennsylvania, in a meeting yesterday with the women \nof the Senate--a bipartisan meeting, I might add--I believe we were \ntold there is a hold on this among our colleagues. Perhaps we can work \ntogether to lift that hold to ensure that the bureaucracy concerns are \ndealt with so we can go on with the mutual humanitarian concerns that I \nknow we share on both sides of the aisle.\n  Again, I thank the Senator for his leadership on this in the most \nsincere, kind way.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may respond, that is consistent with what I was \ntold. I did not want to use the expression ``hold'' because of the \npejorative connotation in this Chamber. I made the same point by saying \nthat there were obstacles to getting the funds released. But I think it \nis a matter of enormous importance. I am glad to hear the bipartisan \ngroup of women were meeting yesterday to exercise their leadership. \nThis business about crimes against humanity and rape is just \nhorrendous. We have to act, and act promptly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from West Virginia is now \nrecognized for 15 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/15/senate-section/article/S8533-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8533-S8534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE STEEL IMPORT CRISIS: ANOTHER 1,800 U.S. JOBS AT RISK\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  For months now, I and many of my colleagues, including the very \ndistinguished senior Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, have been \nalerting this Congress to the devastating nature of the steel import \ncrisis that has plagued this Nation since the end of 1997.\n  A year and a half later, in yesterday's Wheeling Intelligencer \nheadlines, we see the statement: ``Sixth Steelmaker Claims \nBankruptcy.'' Let me repeat that headline from the Wheeling, WV, \nnewspaper: a sixth U.S. steel mill has declared bankruptcy.\n  With that announcement, U.S. steelworkers in West Virginia, and \nelsewhere, are wondering when the Clinton administration and this \nCongress will realize that enough is enough. I have no doubt that the \n1,800 people who are employed at Gulf States Steel, Inc., in Gadsden, \nAL--the sixth U.S. steel mill to declare bankruptcy since the steel \nimport crisis began--are also wondering why no one is acting on a long-\nterm basis to prevent the illegal steel dumping that has jeopardized \ntheir jobs.\n  I say enough is enough. Six companies declare bankruptcy, more than \n6,200 jobs are jeopardized, and this Administration and this Congress \nstill fail to act:\n  1,800 jobs in Gadsden, Alabama;\n  200 jobs in Alton, Illinois;\n  140 jobs in Holsapple, Pennsylvania;\n  2,400 jobs in Vineyard, Utah; and\n  540 jobs in Washington, Pennsylvania, and Massillon, Ohio.\n  For those who believe that the steel industry is not in difficulty, \ntell it to these families. Tell it to those workers who have lost their \njobs. These men and women and their families are the human faces of the \nsteel crisis. They are not just numbers. They are not just statistics. \nThese are real faces. These are real men and women. These are real \nchildren of the steel crisis.\n\n  While we do nothing, the list of the victims of the steel import \ncrisis grows ever longer. I hear from U.S. steelworkers. They want to \nknow how many more bankruptcies it will take to make the President of \nthe United States and the Congress understand that immediate action \nmust be taken against the tide of cheap and illegal steel imports into \nthis country. How many more U.S. jobs must be lost before we tell our \ntrading partners that enough is enough?\n  We already know that there will be no quota bill passed by this \nCongress. The House passed a quota bill. The Senate has not passed a \nquota bill and will not pass a quota bill. Penalties are not likely \nagainst Brazil and Russia, even though the Commerce Department and the \nInternational Trade Commission found them to be guilty of dumping steel \nillegally on American shores. Instead of finding a long-term, global \nsolution, this administration chooses to promote piecemeal solutions \nand negotiate suspension agreements with those two countries. Changes \nin U.S. trade laws to strengthen enforcement seem even more unlikely.\n  According to the Wheeling, WV, Intelligencer, the U.S. steel industry \nis still holding on to the thin hope that the steel loan guarantee \nprogram, which the Senate has already approved twice, will quickly, \nhopefully, be approved in the House of Representatives. While this is \nonly a short-term program to help U.S. steel mills that have been hurt \nby the steel import crisis, I thank my colleagues for passing the \nEmergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program, authored by me, and a similar \nprogram, the Emergency Oil and Gas Guaranteed Loan Program, authored by \nSenator Domenici.\n  On June 21, the Senate requested a conference with the House on H.R. \n1664, which contains the steel loan guarantee and the oil and gas loan \nguarantee, and conferees have been appointed by the Senate. I am \nhopeful that this conference will take place soon, and we have every \nright to expect that that conference will take place soon.\n  There was a commitment entered into not too long ago, at the time the \nemergency supplemental appropriations bill was in conference between \nthe two Houses. A commitment was entered into by the leadership of both \nthe House and Senate to call up the bill in the Senate. That was done. \nThe majority leader of the Senate and the minority leader kept their \ncommitments. The bill was called up in the Senate, and the steel loan \nguarantee program and the oil and gas loan guarantee program were \npassed by the Senate for the second time and sent to the House. It is \nto be expected that a conference will take place, as the Senate has \nrequested. Hopefully, that conference will then meet and act, and act \nquickly, and hopefully, further, both Houses will quickly adopt a \nconference report and send it on to the President for his signature.\n  Illegal steel dumping has created exigent circumstances for the U.S. \nsteel industry, and the loan guarantees will provide help to companies, \nsmall and middle-sized steel companies that employ thousands of hard-\nworking Americans. These loan guarantees would work through the private \nmarket, help to sustain good-paying jobs, support our national \nsecurity, and save taxpayers millions of dollars from lost tax revenues \nand increased public assistance payments for things such \nas unemployment compensation, food stamps, and worker retraining.\n\n  The fate of the loan programs rests today in the hands of the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives. With great respect, I urge the House to act \nquickly. On behalf of U.S. steel mills and U.S. steelworkers, for those \n1,800 steelworkers at great risk with Gulf States Steel in Alabama, for \nthe thousands of other steelworkers and their families across the \ncountry who cry out for help, I urge the other body to take action and \nto support the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes 28 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. Does the distinguished Senator from Alabama wish time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could interrupt my friend from West \nVirginia, the Senator from Maine has requested 5 minutes and there \nisn't time left for that unless he would yield to the Senator. \nOtherwise, she would--\n  Mr. BYRD. I would be very happy to yield to the Senator. First, I \nwould like\n\n[[Page S8534]]\n\nto inquire of the distinguished Senator from Alabama if he wishes some \nof my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from West Virginia. I do not. I \nexpect to follow the Senator from New Hampshire. I do not seek the \nfloor now.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I do appreciate the leadership of the Senator from West \nVirginia on the steel question. It is important; a company in critical \ncondition, with 1,800 employees in Alabama and a 30-year record of \nbusiness success, which has, in just the last week, gone into \nbankruptcy.\n  And I do believe the loan guarantee could help save that historic \ncompany. I thank the Senator for his leadership.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator. With my remaining time, \nI am very glad to yield to the Senator from Maine, Ms. Snowe, if she \nwishes to have my remaining minutes.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Senator from West Virginia. I appreciate that. \nHow much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes 4 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that in addition to \nthe 4 minutes she would be receiving from the Senator from West \nVirginia, the Senator from Maine receive 5 additional minutes in \nmorning business.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I don't want to be obstreperous, but we have \nto get to the bill. That is why I urged the Senator from West Virginia \nto give his time to the Senator from Maine. I have no problem with \nthat. But as far as extending time, it would have to come off the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is objection. Does the Senator from \nMaine desire to have the remaining time?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Yes, I do. I thank the Senator from West Virginia for \nyielding.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, my time is rapidly dwindling. I would like \nto know whether or not she wishes my remaining time.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 141, a resolution \nsubmitted earlier by Senator Snowe, Senator Reid, and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 141) to congratulate the United \n     States Women's Soccer Team on winning the 1999 Women's World \n     Cup Championship.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \nalong with Senators Reid, Murray, Mikulski, Collins, Landrieu, \nFeinstein, Boxer, Hutchison, and Lincoln honoring the U.S. Women's \nNational Soccer Team for their outstanding performance and dramatic \nvictory in winning the 1999 Women's World Cup. This is a resolution \nthat I've worked on with Senator Reid, who spoke eloquently earlier in \nthe week on the World Cup victory, and I want to thank him for his \nstrong support for the team and its accomplishments.\n  The U.S. Womens' National Soccer Team has got to be the single \ngreatest sports story this year, and certainly of this decade. \nCapturing the hearts and the imagination of America with remarkable \nplay and even higher levels of teamwork and good sportsmanship, the \nU.S. Women's Soccer Team has ushered in a new era in women's athletics.\n  We are not just talking about talented athletes here--we're talking \nabout role models who are driven to play by the thrill of victory and \nthe excitement of competition. And perhaps therein lies the true appeal \nof this team--in a time when money and commercialism often seem to \noverwhelm the true spirit of sport, along comes these extraordinary \nwomen who restore our faith in the virtues of athletic competition and \ntruly give us something to cheer about.\n  Is it any wonder, then, that these women--as well as women from other \nnations who have come to the United States in search of World Cup \nglory--have been ``packing them in'' wherever they have played. Indeed, \nThe Boston Globe reported that only the Pope has drawn more people to \nGiants Stadium in New Jersey, and all 65,080 seats at Soldier Field in \nChicago were sold-out for the United States-Nigeria game--the largest \ncrowd ever to see a soccer game at that venue.\n  For the final, over 90,000 fans were on hand to see the national \nteam's dramatic victory over China--a record for an all-women sporting \nevent. Not only has women's soccer arrived, it's taken the nation by \nstorm.\n  From coast to coast, Americans tuned in to watch our team play world-\nclass soccer--and they weren't disappointed. In fact, it's estimated \nthat about 40 million viewers watched all or part of that nail-biting \nfinal match. That's nearly double the rating for the men's World Cup \nfinal last year between Brazil and Italy, and bests even the average \nnational ratings for the recent NBA finals between the New York Knicks \nand the San Antonio Spurs.\n  Those of us who viewed the tournament were rewarded with victory \nafter victory, as well as the joy of watching athletes who truly love \nto play. And if Saturday's real-life finale had instead been the ending \nto a Hollywood movie, it would have been panned for being utterly \nunbelievable. Who would have thought that after 120 minutes of \nregulation play, the score would still be tied at zero-zero, with \npenalty kicks the only thing standing between defeat and victory?\n  Throughout all that time--with the nation watching, waiting, hoping, \nand anticipating, with 90,000 chanting fans hanging on every kick, \nevery header, every pass, and every breakaway--our team never gave up \nor gave in. Goalkeeper Briana Scurry was nothing short of remarkable, \nrobbing the Chinese team of a critical penalty kick. And at the end, \nwhen Brandi Chastain's shot came to rest at the back of the opposing \nteam's net, it all paid off in one of those incredible sporting moments \nthat will go down not only in the history of sports, but in the history \nof womens' struggles for recognition and equality.\n  There is no question, Mr. President, that sports are just as \nimportant an activity for girls and women as they are for boys and men. \nThrough sports, girls and women can experience a positive competitive \nspirit applicable to any aspect of life.\n  They can truly learn how to ``take the ball and run with it'', not \nonly on the playing fields, but in classrooms, boardrooms, and, yes, \neven the Committee rooms of Congress. Through athletics, girls and \nwomen can achieve a healthy body and a healthy mind. They gain the \nself-esteem to say ``give me the ball'' with the clock running out and \nthe game on the line.\n  You know, when I was growing up, girls and women did not have much \nopportunity to participate in competitive athletics. But the enactment \nof Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 changed all that for \ngood. Finally, with the passage of this landmark legislation, women \nwould be afforded equitable opportunities to participate in high school \nand college athletics.\n  And the results are indisputable. Since Title IX's enactment, women \nand girls across the nation have met the challenge of participating in \ncompetitive sports in record numbers. In the past 28 years, the number \nof college women participating in competitive athletics has gone from \nfewer than 32,000 to over 128,000 in 1997. Before Title IX, fewer than \n300,000 high school girls played competitive sports. As of 2 years ago, \nthat number had climbed to almost 2.6 million.\n  The U.S. Women's Soccer Team has not only underscored the \nachievements of Title IX, but has encouraged even more young women to \nget into the arena and onto the playing fields. You know, it used to be \nsaid that girls were made of ``sugar and spice and everything nice.'' \nWell, the U.S. Women's Soccer Team proved that there is room for being \nboth ``nice'' and determined. There is room for being both a woman and \na competitor.\n\n[[Page S8535]]\n\n  Indeed, it astounds me when I think of how far we have come since I \nintroduced the original joint resolution of Congress establishing the \nvery first National Girls and Women in Sports Day back in 1986. Where \ndreams of athletic glory were once almost the exclusive domain of boys, \ntoday--thanks in large part to out Women's National Soccer Team--girls \nnow have aspirations of their own.\n  Watching this team has inspired a whole generation of girls to \nbelieve that they can go as high and as far as their talent--and their \ndrive--will take them. Indeed, I have no doubt that girls across \nAmerica will be running around the soccer fields this summer pretending \nto be Briana Scurry, Michelle Akers, Mia Hamm, or whoever their \nparticular heroine may be. Certainly, on this team, there are plenty \nfrom which to choose.\n  The U.S. Women's National Soccer Team is but one more example of how, \nwhen it comes to athletics, women are ``coming off the bench,'' as it \nwere, and taking their rightful place on the fields, on the courts, in \nthe schoolyards and in our stadiums. They prove, once again, that women \nare just as surefooted in cleats as they are in heels or whatever other \nshoes they decide to fill.\n  In addition to commending the team for all they've done, I would like \nto take this opportunity to thank the organizers and sponsors of the \nentire event for the extraordinary job they did in making this \ntournament a success beyond anyone's wildest dreams. I have no doubt \nthese past few weeks will have an impact on sports in America that will \nresonate for years.\n  Again, let me just express my most sincere appreciation to each and \nevery member of the U.S. Women's World Cup Team for making us so proud. \nThey have honored their nation with their sportsmanship, and they have \nhonored themselves with their commitment to each other and their \ndedication to excellence. Now it is our turn to honor them, and I am \npleased to have my colleagues' support for this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . PROTECTING PATIENTS AND ACCELERATING THEIR TREATMENT \n                   AND CARE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings with \n     respect to the expansion of medical malpractice liability \n     lawsuits in Senate bill 6 (106th Congress):\n       (1) The expansion of liability in S. 6 (106th Congress) \n     would not benefit patients and will not improve health care \n     quality.\n       (2) Expanding the scope of medical malpractice liability to \n     health plans and employers will force higher costs on \n     American families and their employers as a result of \n     increased litigation, attorneys' fees, administrative costs, \n     the costs of defensive coverage determinations, liability \n     insurance premium increases, and unlimited jury verdicts.\n       (3) Legal liability for health plans and employers is the \n     largest expansion of medical malpractice in history and the \n     most expensive provision of S. 6 (106th Congress), and would \n     increase costs ``on average, about 1.4 percent of the \n     premiums of all employer-sponsored plans,'' according to the \n     Congressional Budget Office.\n       (4) The expansion of medical malpractice lawsuits would \n     force employers to drop health coverage altogether, rather \n     than take the risk of jeopardizing the solvency of their \n     companies over lawsuits involving health claims.\n       (5) Seven out of 10 employers in the United States have \n     less than 10 employees, and only 26 percent of employees in \n     these small businesses have health insurance. Such businesses \n     already struggle to provide this coverage, and would be \n     devastated by one lawsuit, and thus, would be discouraged \n     from offering health insurance altogether.\n       (6) According to a Chamber of Commerce survey in July of \n     1998, 57 percent of small employers would be likely to drop \n     coverage if exposed to increased lawsuits. Other studies have \n     indicated that for every 1 percent real increase in premiums, \n     small business sponsorship of health insurance drops by 2.6 \n     percent.\n       (7) There are currently 43,000,000 Americans who are \n     uninsured, and the expansion of medical malpractice lawsuits \n     for health plans and employers would result in millions of \n     additional Americans losing their health insurance coverage \n     and being unable to provide health insurance for their \n     families.\n       (8) Exposing health plans and employers to greater \n     liability would increase defensive\n\n[[Page S8536]]\n\n     medicine and the delivery of unnecessary services that do not \n     benefit patients, and result in decisions being based not on \n     best practice protocols but on the latest jury verdicts and \n     court decisions.\n       (9) In order to minimize their liability risk and the \n     liability risk for the actions of providers, health plans and \n     employers would constrict their provider networks, and micro \n     manage hospitals and doctors. This result is the opposite of \n     the very goal sought by S. 6 (106th Congress).\n       (10) The expansion of medical malpractice liability also \n     would reduce consumer choice because it would drive from the \n     marketplace many of the innovative and hybrid care delivery \n     systems that are popular today with American families.\n       (11) The provisions of S. 6 (106th Congress) that greatly \n     increase medical malpractice lawsuits against private health \n     programs and employers are an ineffective means of \n     compensating for injury or loss given that patients \n     ultimately receive less than one-half of the total award and \n     the rest goes to trial lawyers and court costs.\n       (12) Medical malpractice claims will not help patients get \n     timely access to the care that they need because such claims \n     take years to resolve and the payout is usually made over \n     multiple years. Trial lawyers usually receive their fees up \n     front and which can be between one-third and one-half of any \n     total award.\n       (13) Expanding liability lawsuits is inconsistent with the \n     recommendations of President Clinton's Advisory Commission on \n     Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry, \n     which specifically rejected expanded lawsuits for health \n     plans and employers because they believed it would have \n     serious consequences on the entire health industry.\n       (14) At the State level, legislatures in 24 States have \n     rejected the expansion of medical malpractice lawsuits \n     against health plans and employers, and instead 26 States \n     have adopted external grievance and appeals laws to protect \n     patients.\n       (15) At a time when the tort system of the United States \n     has been criticized as inefficient, expensive and of little \n     benefit to the injured, S. 6 (106th Congress) would be bad \n     medicine for American families, workers and employers, \n     driving up premiums and rewarding more lawyers than patients.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) Americans families want and deserve quality health \n     care;\n       (2) patients need health care before they are harmed rather \n     than compensation provided long after an injury has occurred;\n       (3) the expansion of medical malpractice liability lawsuits \n     would divert precious resources away from patient care and \n     into the pockets of trial lawyers;\n       (4) health care reform should not result in higher costs \n     for health insurance and fewer insured Americans; and\n       (5) providing a fast, fair, efficient, and independent \n     grievances and appeals process will improve quality of care, \n     patient access to care, and is the key to an efficient and \n     innovative health care system in the 21st Century.\n       (c) Nullification of Provision.--Section 302 of this Act \n     shall be null and void and the amendments made by such \n     section shall have no effect.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this amendment goes to one of the critical \nissues in the Kennedy health care bill that we have been debating for \nthe last few days, which is the fact that the bill dramatically expands \nlawsuits in this country.\n  Our Nation is already far too litigious; 2.2 percent of our gross \nnational product goes into lawsuits every year. That is literally \nhundreds of billions of dollars every year absorbed in our legal \nsystem--dollars that could be used much more productively.\n  Compared to other nations in the world, we are the most litigious by \nfar. For example, Japan only uses about .8 percent of its gross \nnational product for lawsuits. Canada, our neighbor, uses about .5 \npercent of its gross national product for lawsuits. These lawsuits that \nhave, for years, been used against individuals and manufacturers \naccomplish some good, but in many instances they end up chilling \nevents, creating greater costs for consumers and causing such things as \nresearch to be retarded, especially in the area of health care. This is \na sensitive issue because things such as the development of new devices \nand the need for doctors to practice defensive medicine are issues that \nare highlighted and aggressively expanded by the expensive use of \nlawsuits.\n  Just this week, for example, we saw a $4 billion judgment--$4 \nbillion--against one manufacturer in this country. That type of \njudgment against a medical manufacturer, for example, would end up \nbeing passed on to the consumers through an increase in premiums and an \nincrease in the cost of insurance.\n  We are as a society simply too litigious. In many areas we as a \nsociety--as a government--have decided that lawsuits should be not cut \noff but at least curtailed to some degree.\n  However, the other side of the aisle has come forward with a bill \nwhich would dramatically expand the number of lawsuits available in \nthis country. It would essentially be the ``Kennedy Annuity for \nAttorneys Act'' rather than a health care bill. This bill, as proposed \nby the other side, would create the opportunity for 48 million more \nincidents of lawsuits involving 48 million more individuals, which \ncould then be multiplied in a geometric progression.\n  Let's just take one situation. Right here, we have the example of how \n137 different doctors might treat one simple type of medical problem, \n``uncomplicated urinary tract infection.'' There are 82 different \ntreatments from 137 different treating physicians. If one of these \ndoctors picked a treatment which didn't work, under the Kennedy bill \nthat would immediately open a brand new lawsuit against a variety of \ndifferent individuals, including the employer, the HMO, and the \ninsurer. That lawsuit could be multiplied literally by hundreds of \ndifferent treatments and hundreds of different opportunities, because \nthis bill dramatically expands the opportunity for lawsuits.\n  Another example of the expansion of lawsuit opportunity under this \nbill is this chart. All these different blue lines are new regulatory \nactions which are available under the Kennedy bill. Fifty-six new \ncauses of action are created under this bill. It is truly an explosion \nof opportunity for attorneys to bring lawsuits.\n  There would be a whole new business enterprise created in this \ncountry, and it would be a massive enterprise, the purpose of which \nwould be to bring lawsuits under the Kennedy bill. And the practical \nimplications of this are that the cost of health care in this country \nwould go up dramatically.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that this bill, the \nKennedy bill, because of the lawsuit language which allows attorneys to \ngo out and sue in a variety of different areas--which right now they do \nnot have the opportunity to sue in--would increase the cost of premiums \nby 1.4 percent.\n  What does that mean? That means that approximately 600,000 Americans \nwould be thrown off the insurance rolls. The practical effect of this \nexpansion in lawsuits is that you would see a dramatic expansion in the \ncost of health care in this country and an equally dramatic expansion \nin the number of uninsured in this country.\n  In addition, the cost of insurance for doctors would go up \ndramatically. Under a study done by the doctors' insurance agents--not \nnecessarily the HMO insurance agents or the health plan insurance \nagents but, rather, the doctors--it is estimated that the premiums on \nthe errors and omissions policies of doctors would go up somewhere \nbetween 8 and 20 percent relative to the ERISA part of their insurance.\n  This means we would see a massive expansion of defensive medicine \nbeing practiced. We already know that defensive medicine is practiced \nexcessively in this country, which means procedures undertaken not \nbecause the doctor believes they have to be undertaken but they are \nundertaken to protect a doctor from a lawyer. We would see a massive \nexpansion of this defensive medicine by doctors.\n  What does that do? That drives up the cost of medicine, and it does \nvery little to improve the quality of care.\n  Equally important, what we would see is a deterioration in the \navailability of doctors to practice specialties, which are unique and \nneeded in rural areas--especially OB/GYN--which we have already seen \ndriven out of many rural areas in this country because of the cost of \nthe error and omissions policies. An 8 to 20 percent increase in the \ncost of those policies would have a devastating impact on an area of \nmedicine which is already underrepresented in the rural parts of this \ncountry.\n  Six-hundred thousand fewer insured people, and what do we get for \nthis expansion in lawsuits? What does the consumer get for this huge \nexpansion in lawsuits? They get a lot more attorneys. There is no \nquestion about that. They get a lot more wealthy attorneys. There is no \nquestion about that. They will get a lot more attorneys who will be \nable to contribute to the Democratic National Committee. There is no \nquestion about that. The trial lawyers\n\n[[Page S8537]]\n\nlove this Kennedy bill. They are enthusiastic for this bill. If there \nis a basic beneficiary for the Kennedy bill, it is the trial lawyers in \nthis country. That is what I call this bill. It is the ``attorneys' \nannuity bill'' rather than the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  What do the consumers get when they get involved in these lawsuits? \nThey will get very little. Will they get greater care? No. They will \nhave to go to court to get care under this bill. A lawsuit has to be \nbrought. Do they get better results? Absolutely not. The attorneys get \n54 percent of the recovery. That leaves the litigants with a combined \n46 percent after this, one-half being an economic loss and one-half \nbeing compensation for pain and suffering.\n  It makes very little sense when you realize that the only winners \nunder the Kennedy bill are actually the attorneys in the expansion of \nlawsuits that will occur as a result of the bill.\n  So where does that bring us? We have come up with a better idea in \nour bill. We say that rather than creating a brand new opportunity to \ncreate all sorts of new lawsuits and add a lot of new attorneys to the \nAmerican culture, who really add very little in the way of \nproductivity--or better medicine, for that matter--let's let doctors \ntake a look at what doctors are deciding for patients.\n  Under our bill, a patient, rather than having to go to court to have \ntheir concerns addressed, gets to have their concerns addressed by, \nfirst, a doctor in the specialty dealing with the type of problem the \npatient has within the clinic or the group by which the person is being \nserved. That doctor is independent. That doctor makes a decision: Did \nthat patient have the right care or did that patient have the wrong \ncare? Or should that patient get more care? If the patient isn't \ncomfortable with that decision, then the patient can go outside the \nclinic, outside the insurance group, and have another doctor, who is \nappointed after having been prequalified by a certified either State or \nFederal agency, and have another doctor review that patient's care.\n  If that doctor decides that the patient needs some other type of \ncare--something that the clinic or the interests group did not decide \nthat the patient should have--then that is binding. It is binding on \nthe insurance group. There is an independent review at two different \npoints, one inside and one outside, done by doctors who have a binding \ndecision on the patient. If the patient again is uncomfortable with \nthat decision, then the patient can bring a suit. But it is limited as \nto amount of damages, and it is limited to the cost of the event.\n  The practical approach they have put forward is to try to get the \npatient care, and get the patient good care and efficient care quickly, \nand make sure they have gotten fair treatment and they have had a \nreview by the appropriate doctors.\n  As a result, we reduce the cost of health care. As a result, we keep \nmore people insured. As a result, we allow more people to participate \nin health insurance in this country. As a result, I admit that we do \nnot create as many opportunities for attorneys to bring lawsuits. That \nis absolutely right. We do not create a bill that basically underwrites \nthe legal profession in this country. That is absolutely right. We \nassist patients in getting care.\n  That is a big difference between these two bills. The Democratic \nbill, the ``Attorneys' Annuity Act,'' the ``Kennedy Patients' Bill of \nRights,'' is essentially a bill to promote attorneys. Our bill is a \nbill to promote health care.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the fact of the matter is, in the United \nStates of America, this great country we live in, there are basically \ntwo groups of people who cannot be sued: foreign diplomats and HMOs. \nThat is not the way it should be. We are saying HMOs should be treated \nlike every other entity in the United States.\n  Today, even an HMO involved directly in dictating, denying, or \ndelaying care for a patient can use a loophole in what we call ERISA to \navoid any responsibility for the consequences of its actions. The \nAmerican people simply do not support that. ERISA was designed to \nprotect employees when they lose pension benefits to fraud, \nmismanagement, and employer bankruptcies, which occurred so often \nduring the 1960s.\n  The law now has the effect of allowing an HMO to deny or delay care, \nwith no effective remedy for patients. What they are trying to do is \nstrike a provision from our bill which simply ensures HMOs can be held \naccountable for their actions, a responsibility of every other industry \nto consumers. They talk about this in vague abstract, as if this is \nsome big cabal to change the law. All we want to do is make the law \napply to HMOs.\n  Let's talk about a real person. Florence Corcoran is an example of \nthe need to hold HMOs accountable. She lost a baby because the HMO \nrefused the doctor's request for hospitalization in the last days of \nher pregnancy. The HMO would pay for only 10 hours of at-home care. \nDuring the final months of pregnancy, when no one was on duty, her baby \nwent into distress and died. Because Florence received health care \ncoverage through an employer, they had no recourse or remedy for the \ndeath of this baby. The HMO was not responsible under the law for any \ncost because the Corcorans never incurred any medical expenses for the \nloss of their baby.\n  The court of appeals--the court that is highest except for the \nSupreme Court in this country--said, and I quote from a Fifth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals:\n\n       The result ERISA compels us to reach means that the \n     Corcorans have no remedy, State or Federal, for what may have \n     been a serious mistake. This is troubling for several \n     reasons. First, it eliminates an important check on the \n     thousands of medical decisions routinely made in the \n     burgeoning utilization review system. With liability rules \n     generally inapplicable, there is . . . less deterrence of \n     substandard medical decisionmaking.\n\n  In another case, another Federal judge, Judge William Young, said:\n\n       ERISA has evolved into a shield of immunity that protects \n     health insurers . . . from potential liability for the \n     consequences of the wrongful denial of health benefits.\n\n  That is from the case of Andrews-Clarke v. Travelers Insurance \nCompany, decided last year.\n  All we want to do is be able to hold the HMOs accountable.\n  What about the cost of this? We have an independent study by Coopers \n& Lybrand that found the cost to be as little as 3 cents per person per \nmonth. We can handle that. That is fairness.\n  This is not going to touch off a flood of lawsuits. In fact, it will \nmake people feel better about their health care and, in fact, make \nhealth care providers be more diligent in rendering adequate, complete \ncare to their patients. It is not going to create massive lawsuits, as \nCoopers & Lybrand said.\n  The Republican provision leaves patients with no recourse if benefits \nare denied. That is wrong.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is Thursday and most of the week we \nhave seen amendments and offerings from the majority party that do \nlittle or nothing for the vast majority of Americans.\n  The Gregg amendment before us, however, is an amendment that would do \nsomething. It would prevent accountability. It would say that patients \nhave no right to expect accountability on the part of HMOs and the \ninsurance companies.\n  USA Today, in an editorial, says there are ``100 Million Reasons that \nthe GOP's Health Plan Fails.'' That is the number of people not covered \nby our opponent's health plan. The majority of the American people with \nprivate insurance are not helped by their proposal.\n  Now, some of my colleagues say that doesn't matter because the States \ncover these folks. Mr. President, 38 States don't guarantee access to \nspecialists; 48 States don't hold plans accountable; 29 States don't \nprovide for continuity of care; 39 States don't provide for omsbudsmen; \n27 States don't provide a ban on financial incentives to limit care. \nThe fact is, the argument that the States do this is a specious \nargument.\n  Let me go back to a couple of cases I have described in the past to \nillustrate my point. I know some here in the Senate say this debate is \nnot about individual cases, but I disagree. Ethan Bedrick was born in \ncircumstances that were devastating, the umbilical\n\n[[Page S8538]]\n\ncord wrapped around his neck causing partial asphyxiation. \nConsequently, he was born with cerebral palsy and was a spastic \nquadriplegic. He began to get therapy.\n  At age 14 months, the HMO said: We are going to cut back on Ethan's \ntherapy.\n  The doctor said: You shouldn't cut back on the therapy. Ethan has a \nchance to be able to walk by age 5.\n  The HMO says: A 50 percent chance of being able to walk by age 5 is \nminimal or insignificant. Therefore, we won't pay for it.\n  Now, is somebody going to protect Ethan? Does anything proposed by \nanyone on the other side of the aisle in the last 3 days solve this \nproblem? The answer is no. In nothing they proposed can they say they \nwill have solved this problem--not just for Ethan but for all the other \nlittle Ethans in our country. They will deny him the rights that he \nought to have.\n  What about Jimmy Adams? We had a big debate yesterday about emergency \ncare. One of my colleagues stood up and said little Jimmy would be \ncovered under their amendment. That is not the case. Jimmy Adams got \nsick with a 104 degree fever in the middle of the night. His mother and \nfather called the HMO. They were told to go to the Scottish Rite \nHospital way across the city of Atlanta.\n  Where is it? the mother asked.\n  Find a map, she was told.\n  So they got in the car at 2 in the morning and headed for Scottish \nRite Hospital. They passed the first hospital, they passed the second \nand third hospitals--because they were not authorized to go to these \nemergency rooms by their HMO. An hour into the trip, they pulled into \nScottish Rite Hospital, having passed three emergency rooms because the \nHMO wouldn't have paid for Jimmy's care there. At that point, Jimmy \nAdam's heart had stopped. They were able to get his heart restarted. \nThey intubated him. He was a very sick young man. He survived. However, \ngangrene from that episode caused Jimmy to lose both of his hands and \nhis feet.\n  This is young Jimmy without hands or feet. He passed three emergency \nrooms because the HMO said: You have to be in a car an hour to go to \nthe emergency room we will pay for.\n  Is there anything offered by anybody on the other side yesterday that \nwould have solved this problem? The answer is no because Jimmy's family \nis enrolled in an HMO that would not be covered under our opponent's \nproposal. No emergency room proposition offered by anyone over there, \neven though it was described in wonderful terms, would have done \nanything to help the Jimmy Adamses in a good many States in this \ncountry.\n  If you think that is wrong, I challenge anyone to tell me how you \nwill receive this protection if you are among the 100 million not \ncovered under the majority's bill and live in a State that doesn't have \nthis coverage. That is the problem with the proposal by the majority \nparty.\n  Let me give another example. This case deals with the issue of who \ndetermines what care is medically necessary, doctors or insurance \ncompany bureaucrats. This example was used by Dr. Greg Ganske, a \nRepublican Congressman from Iowa, who happens to be a reconstructive \nsurgeon. This is a picture of a child with a very serious medical \nproblem, a cleft lip. Dr. Ganske contacted his colleagues in \nreconstructive surgery, and Mr. President, he found that 50 percent of \nthem had cases such as this denied. In cases dealing with \nreconstructive surgery, 50 percent had cases denied because they were \nnot medically necessary.\n  Think of that. Think of being the mother or father of this young \nchild and being told reconstructive surgery is not medically necessary. \nAsk yourself whether you think that is reasonable. Yet it happens in \nthis country and will happen again under the Republican bill because \nthey do not allow a patient's doctor to determine what is medically \nnecessary.\n  Let me show you another picture of a child with the same cleft lip \nproblem. Now let me show Members what happens when reconstructive \nsurgery gives this young child a chance, an opportunity. Here is the \nsame child. Take a look at what someone decides is ``medically \nnecessary'' and what it will mean to this young child's life. This \npicture demonstrates what reconstructive surgery can do for this \nwonderful child.\n  As these real cases illustrate, this debate is not about theory. It \nis not about arguing the terminology in some half-baked plan that \ndoesn't do much. It is about providing assurance and guarantees to \npeople in this country. Help this young child. Provide protection for \nJacqueline Lee who fell off a cliff 40 feet, fractured her body in \nthree places, and unconscious, is helicoptered to an emergency \nroom. She is unconscious, out cold on a gurney. She survives and then \nis told by her HMO that she did not get prior approval for her \nemergency room visit and therefore they will not pay it.\n\n  Or Ray, the father who, with tears in his eyes, told about Matthew, \nhis 12-year-old son, who lost his battle with cancer because they were \nforced to fight both the cancer and the insurance company to provide \nfor the treatment necessary to try to save him. Ray says, ``We could \nnot fight cancer and the insurance company at the same time, and it is \nnot fair to ask us to do it.''\n  I say this to you, those who say you are providing wonderful \nprotection --you are not. This editorial says you are not and we know \nyou are not and you know you are not. Mr. President, 100 million people \nare left out of your plan and you say: Yes, they are left out of our \nplan but the States cover them. They do not and you know they do not. \nMedical necessity? Emergency room? OB/GYN? Go down the list and then \ntell the American people, tell these children, tell the women, tell the \nfamilies why you do not think they ought to be covered.\n  This last amendment says to patients, we do not think you ought to be \nprotected, but we certainly think we ought to provide protection to the \ninsurance companies. We certainly think insurance companies ought to be \ngiven protection and patients should be denied the right to hold them \naccountable.\n  My colleague talks about lawsuits. It is interesting. Texas passed a \nstatute allowing consumers to hold HMOs accountable a couple of years \nago. There has been one lawsuit, I understand--perhaps by now two or \nthree. Where is the blizzard of lawsuits our opponents predict when you \nmake health care providers accountable?\n  Every Medicare patient in this country has the basic protections we \nare proposing in our Patients' Bill of Rights. Every Medicaid patient \nin this country has the same protections, and every Federal employee \nand every Senator sitting on this floor has these protections.\n  But we have folks in this Chamber who decide it might be good enough \nfor Senators, they voted for it for Medicare, but it is not good enough \nfor the rest of the American people. And the result is too many cases, \ntoo many children, too many Jimmy Adamses whose parents decide they \nhave to comply with the rules because they do not have the money.\n  I remember the first time I saw an entertainer use the moon walk. It \nmade him look as if he was moving forward when instead he was moving \nbackwards. I see that on the floor of the Senate in this debate. People \noffer proposals when they want people to believe they are making \nprogress, but in reality, they are not doing anything or maybe even \nmoving backwards. That is not going to work in this debate. This debate \nis not about theory. It is about people's lives, about their medical \ntreatment. It is about providing protection for hardworking Americans \nwho have insurance and think they are protected with decent health \ncoverage--only to discover at 2 a.m. that they do not have access to an \nemergency room.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Senator from Nevada for the time and yield \nthe remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I will yield to the Senator from Alabama in \na second. I do want to point out the Senator from North Dakota, \nalthough well informed in most instances, on the issue of suing health \ncare plans of Senators he is not informed. The fact is, under our plan \nwe cannot sue the insurer. We are limited in our rights to sue, and our \nability to recover is also\n\n[[Page S8539]]\n\nsignificantly limited--in fact, about the same way it is limited in our \nbill. I would point that out as a point of clarification.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire. I will delay my \ngeneral remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the Senator from Alabama 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will delay my overall remarks on this \nmatter to deal precisely with some of the examples that have been \ncited.\n  There are a number of provisions in the law that allow the \ncontainment of lawsuits. Workman's comp--if a person is injured on the \njob, there are very limited matters for which they can sue. They do not \nhave to prove negligence. They get compensation. They have a lot of \nadvantages. They also are not able to sue their employer under those \ncircumstances. Federal employees, including Senators, are not able to \nsue.\n  But let me say this, first and foremost, this is not a step \nbackwards. Right now we have this limitation on lawsuits--not a banning \nof lawsuits, but a limitation on lawsuits under Federal law. This \nlegislation will increase significantly the power of individual \npatients to protect their rights against HMOs. It does change existing \nlaw. It does move the bar much lower for patients, in a way that makes \nsense, that keeps costs to a minimum, but improves their access. Now we \ntalk about offering a 2- or 4-year lawsuit in exchange for the plan we \nhave proposed that would allow immediate access to a panel of medical \nexperts to review your claim.\n  Let me mention some of the special cases that were discussed \npreviously. There was a case in which the HMO had denied therapy. Under \nour bill, you would have the existing rights we have today to go to \ncourt, but in addition to that, you would have an internal review \nprocess by the insurance provider. In addition to that, you would be \nable to have an independent external review of your claim that this \ntherapy is needed. It would require, and provide for, a person with \nexpertise in that medical specialty who is independent of the plan. \nThat is a major step forward for the rights of patients. We do not need \nto foster a jackpot justice mentality when we can get prompt, \nprofessional care.\n  With regard to the Jimmy Evans situation, what will our bill do for \nthat? Obviously, this matter has been discussed over and over again. It \nhurts me to see the emotional arguments made that ignore what this bill \nprovides. This bill says you could use a ``prudent layperson'' standard \non emergency care. That means, if you believe your child needs to stop \nat the first hospital, you can stop there. A prudent layperson means \nthe parent, using normal good judgment, is allowed to use that judgment \nabout where to go in an emergency.\n  With regard to problem of cleft palate and medical necessity--we \nhave, and have provided for, new requirements on HMOs. Ultimately, \nthere would be an independent, medical expert to review that claim. \nSurgery for cleft palate is not going to be denied. That is pure scare \ntactics, and it is offensive to me to suggest that. You can still go to \ncourt, at any rate, for the cost of the benefit denied and still get \ncoverage for the medical care you need. So I would say that really is \ndiscouraging.\n  With regard to the fundamentals of the appeals process, you do have \nto have a decisionmaking process in any complex contractual \nrelationship. How are we going to do it? There is a clear choice. As a \nmatter of fact, many have already discussed this. Friends on the other \nside of the aisle have said from the beginning that the biggest \ndifference between our parties bills is the question of how to handle \nthe liability issue. They want to add new lawsuits not provided for \nunder current law to allow increased lawsuits. We want to increase the \nability of patients to get prompt, cost-free, independent medical \nreviews for benefits denied when they need it.\n  I have heard doctors express to me they do not like dealing with \nbureaucrats when they need to talk about what kind of treatment their \npatient needs. They are frustrated about that. So this bill says: That \nis not good enough, HMO; if you cannot respond promptly to a \nphysician's request that the patient receive a certain type of \ntreatment, you are going to have to provide an independent, external \nexpert, with a specialty related to that patient's particular medical \nproblem, who can make a decision that is binding on the HMOs but not on \nthe patient. Let me emphasize, it is binding on the HMO. If that expert \nsays this treatment is needed, then it must be provided immediately.\n  I think these are the protections we want to provide.\n  This appeals process is a good plan. Basically, if a patient is \ndenied a benefit, he or she can call the HMO for an internal review. If \nthat is not satisfactory, he or she can demand an external review by an \nindependent medical expert. Even after that, they still maintain the \nright to sue--a right which exists today.\n  I think this is a very good policy. As a matter of fact, the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts who was here in 1973 pointed out the obvious when he \nsupported the establishment of HMOs. He said in his remarks on the \nSenate floor at that time these words:\n\n       Medical malpractice litigation has become an onerous and \n     protracted means to resolve medical malpractice disputes. The \n     costs are escalating with less of the medical insurance \n     premium dollar going to compensate the injured party. The \n     delays in resolving such disputes average up to 4\\1/2\\ years \n     from filing of a lawsuit. Litigation has failed to provide an \n     efficient means to achieve a fair result for all concerned.\n\n  And I say amen to Senator Kennedy. He was correct about that. This is \nnot working. It is not the way we can assure prompt care and responses \nto patients, doctors and injured parties when they need help.\n  Senator Kennedy went on to say:\n\n       Litigation of medical malpractice claims have not been an \n     effective method to monitor quality health care standards.\n\n  I agree with that also.\n  I believe the plan proposed by the Republicans provides for a prompt, \nprofessional, low-cost, independent determination of disputes. Make no \nmistake about it, lawsuits are expensive. It takes 25 months--4 years, \nas Senator Kennedy says--to bring one to a conclusion. Lawyers charge \n$200 plus an hour. The plaintiffs' lawyers charge a 40- to 50-percent \ncontingent fee. That means if the plaintiff receives $100,000, the \nlawyer gets $50,000. If the plaintiff gets $1 million, the lawyer gets \n$500,000. The lawyers have junior partner lawyers, paralegals, law \nclerks, and secretaries who work with them. They take deposition after \ndeposition after deposition. Medical experts are called. Testimonies, \nreports, and legal research have to be prepared. Court appearances, \npretrial hearings, discovery conferences have to be arranged and briefs \nhave to be filed.\n  There is a burden on the courts when you have lawsuits. We pay the \njudges salaries. The more these cases are given to them to handle, the \nmore judges we need to handle them. The judge has law clerks. Federal \njudges have at least two law clerks each, bailiffs, U.S. marshals, and \ncourt clerks to handle the cases--all of whom are paid for by the \ntaxpayers. This does not include jurors and witnesses. Let's not forget \nthe cost of the courtroom. Go to your courthouse and find out how much \na courtroom costs to build. Figure it out on a weekly basis.\n  These cases go on for 1 year, 2 years, or even 4 years before they \never reach a conclusion.\n  That is not the way to help patients who need help. Some will win \nmillions of dollars and some will win nothing. I will tell you what \nelse will happen. It will be routine for plaintiff lawyers, to sue a \ndoctor or hospital--which they can already do, make no mistake. \nCurrently, if a physician treats you improperly or the hospital commits \nan act of negligence or a willful act of wrongdoing, you can sue them. \nNow we are questioning whether you can sue the insurance company for \nthese kinds of problems.\n  We have made progress in allowing a good review, a tough new review \nprocess. The Kennedy plan is fatally flawed. We must not allow his plan \nto happen. President Clinton's own hand-picked 34-member Advisory \nCommission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care \nIndustry refused to put\n\n[[Page S8540]]\n\nliability reform or the Democratic liability plan in their bill when \nthey did their report for the President. They did that for a reason. \nThey considered the issue and decided it was not wise.\n\n  Meanwhile, for some reason the President and the Democratic Members \nhave changed their minds. I suspect they have talked with their trial \nlawyer friends in the meantime and have been convinced they ought to go \nalong with this new proposal.\n  It is not just the President's own review commission that has \nrejected liability expansion and more lawsuits, but major newspapers in \nthis country as well.\n  The Los Angeles Times:\n\n       Bad medicine for both employees and employers driving up \n     premiums.\n\n  The New York Times:\n\n       Jury awards in State courts for malpractice are----\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield 1 minute.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The New York Times:\n\n       Jury awards in State courts for malpractice are notoriously \n     capricious and do more to reward lawyers than patients.\n\n  The Washington Post:\n\n       The threat of litigation is the wrong way to enforce \n     rational decisionmaking.\n\n  This is a terrible idea. It is the wrong direction to go. It will add \nexpense throughout the system and will not benefit patients by getting \nthem care when they need it. This bill, as proposed, which I support, \nwill do that. It will give patients immediate relief and expert \nevaluation of their claims.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the privilege \nof the floor be granted to the following individuals: Kathryn Vosburgh \nand Jennifer Barker who are interns with Senator Byron Dorgan of North \nDakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. On behalf of the minority, I extend 10 minutes to the \nSenator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. President, this is the heart of the debate. This is what the \nPatients' Bill of Rights is all about. The insurance companies hate the \nidea of being sued in court as the devil hates holy water. They do not \nwant to be held accountable for their actions. They want to be \nprotected so they can make the wrong decision when it comes to medical \ncare for American families and never be held accountable.\n  The amendment being offered on the Republican side is an effort to \ntake away from 123 million Americans the right to hold health insurance \ncompanies accountable. That is the bottom line: 123 million Americans \nwill be denied an opportunity to go to court when a health insurance \ncompany makes a decision which costs them their health or their life.\n  Most people are stunned to know that you cannot take a health \ninsurance company to court. Since 1974, a Federal law has protected \nhealth insurance companies from being sued.\n  What does that mean? When your doctor wants a certain procedure, a \ncertain medicine, a certain specialist for your good or the good of \nyour family, and that doctor is overruled by a health insurance company \nbureaucrat, the doctor is the only one who will be taken to court, not \nthe health insurance company.\n  If we pass nothing else in this Patients' Bill of Rights but this \nsection which says health insurance companies will be held accountable \nin court, it would be a major victory for America. I trust the judgment \nof 12 citizens of this country in a jury box to decide the fairness and \nlegality of an issue. Obviously, the Republican side does not. They do \nnot want the health insurance companies to go to court. They do not \nwant them to face a jury. They do not want them to be held accountable.\n\n  This party, which parades and triumphs values and responsibility does \nnot want to hold the health insurance companies responsible in the most \nbasic form of adjudication in our country: a jury of your peers.\n  Oh, they make a lot of arguments about, oh, we are just gilding the \nlily and feathering the nests of all these trial lawyers. That is not \nwhat it is all about. You know it and all America knows it.\n  The health insurance companies, with the Republican majority, are \ndetermined to stop 123 million Americans from ever having a day in \ncourt. Ever.\n  For the last 2 days, Senator Kennedy, Senator Reid, and all of my \ncolleagues have brought stories to the floor--chilling, heartbreaking \nstories. Here is one. Florence Corcoran. Let me quote Florence \nCorcoran:\n\n       They let a clerk thousands of miles away make a life \n     threatening decision about my life and my baby's life without \n     even seeing me and overruled five of my doctors. They don't \n     get held accountable. And that's what appalls me. I relive \n     that all the time. Insurance companies don't answer to \n     nobody.\n\n  That is what Florence Corcoran says: ``Nobody knows about ERISA,'' \nthis Federal law that protects health insurance companies.\n  If you are listening to the debate, you would think: Well, surely \nthere must be a long roster of companies in America that receive the \nsame kind of immunity from liability that cannot be brought to court. \nNo. This is it, folks. This is the only sector of the American \neconomy--maybe the only sector in America--that is going to be allowed \nto be held above the law.\n  The Republican majority and the health insurance industry are \ndetermined to protect their immunity from a lawsuit so that Florence \nCorcoran, when her life and the life of her baby were threatened by the \ndecision of a health insurance company, can't even take that health \ninsurance company to court.\n  The Senator from Alabama gets up and talks about: Oh, this legal \nsystem, it is so expensive. It takes so long. Let me tell you, when it \nis your life or the life of your baby, and this is the only place to \nturn, this is where you will turn. Yes, you will go to a lawyer because \nyou are not wealthy, who will charge a contingency fee, meaning if he \nwins he gets paid; if he loses, he does not. That is part of the \nAmerican system.\n  How many times, day in and day out, do we hear about these cases--\nsimple, ordinary Americans, living their life, doing what they are \nsuppose to do, paying their taxes, going to work every day. They get \ncaught up in a situation where someone's negligence or wrongdoing hurts \nthem. It could be an accident; it could be medical malpractice; it \ncould be a decision by a company that was just plain doing wrong.\n  Where do you turn? You write a letter to your Senator. That isn't \nworth much, I will tell you. We will read it. We will write a reply. \nBut if you want justice in America, then you have a chance to go in the \ncourt system. But the Republican majority says, no, close the door to \nAmerica's families so that they cannot hold health insurance companies \naccountable in court.\n  For the last 2 days, we argued about all the outrages in these health \ninsurance policies, that you can't go to the nearest emergency room \nwhen someone in your family is hurt, that you can't go to the \nspecialist your doctor wants you to go to--the cases go on and on and \non--and we try, item by item, to make these health insurance plans more \nresponsive to the reality of life and more responsive to the medical \nneeds of Americans.\n  But let me tell you this. All of those amendments, all of those votes \nnotwithstanding, this is the bottom line. This will change the \nmentality of these health insurance companies that say no, because they \nare driven by the ambition for greed and profit, say no over and over, \nregardless of the outcome.\n  The Cortes family from Elk Grove Village, IL, their tiny little baby, \nRob, who is now 1 year old, has spinal muscular atrophy. For a year \nthey tried to keep their family together with this little boy on a \nventilator at home--on a ventilator at home. They have been fighting \nthis disease, and every week they fight the insurance companies. Will \nthey cover this care? Will they cover this drug? The battle goes on and \non.\n\n  Mark my words--and I say this to my Republican colleagues--if that \nhealth insurance company knew their decisions would be judged by 12 of \ntheir\n\n[[Page S8541]]\n\npeers, 12 American citizens, sitting in a jury box, I bet the Cortes \nfamily would get a lot better treatment. You know they would. They know \nthey would be held accountable.\n  But the health insurance industry and the Republican majority does \nnot want the 123 million Americans to ever have a day in court when it \ncomes to these health insurance decisions. Their arguments are as weak \nas they can be.\n  The State of Texas passed a patients' bill of rights. They said you \ncould take the health insurance company to court for certain insured \npeople in Texas. You would think, from the arguments on the Republican \nside, that the sky fell on Texas 2 years ago. It did not happen. You \nknow how many lawsuits have been filed since this law was enacted, a \nlaw which Governor Bush vetoed, but the legislature overrode his veto? \nThree lawsuits--three lawsuits in 2 years. Does that sound as if we are \nflooding the courts?\n  But I will tell you something. In that State, for those who are \nprotected by that law, I will bet you there has been a change in the \nway they do business.\n  Let me give you a quote from a health insurance executive. This is \nfrom the Washington Post.\n\n       . . . currently, ``We would charge the same premium to a \n     customer with the ability to sue as we do to those who do not \n     have the ability to sue.''. . .\n\n  This is from Aetna. Have you picked up the Washington Post lately? \nTwo-page ads every day begging us not to vote for the Patients' Bill of \nRights--Aetna sponsors them, full-page ads. But their spokesman said:\n\n       Why? Those judgments to date have been a very small \n     component of overall health care costs.\n\n  That is what Mr. Walter Cherniak, Jr. of Aetna said.\n  So the argument that this was going to flood the courts did not \nhappen. It did not happen in Texas. As to the argument that it is going \nto raise premiums, according to a man who does this for a living, it \nmakes no difference in the premium charged for those insured who have \nthe right to sue and those who do not.\n  Take a look at some of the numbers that have come out in terms of the \nestimated costs of increases in premiums if there is a right to sue. \nHow much is it going to go up? The Republicans argue it is going to \nskyrocket. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the impact on \npremiums to be 1.4 percent; Multinational Business Services, less than \n1 percent; Muse and Associates, a private firm, they say .2 percent.\n  Is it worth a quarter a month to you as an American with a health \ninsurance policy to have the right to go to court when it is your \nbaby's life?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to my colleagues, this is the key vote on the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. This is a vote about whether 123 million \nAmericans will be precluded from court by the Republican majority and \nthe health insurance industry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I simply note ERISA does not cover 123 million Americans, \nso the Senator from Illinois is incorrect.\n  I yield to the Senator from Iowa 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this is a Democratic leadership war on \nhealth insurance coverage. This is their proposal to subject employer-\nsponsored health plans, and thus employers, to lawsuits. As a member of \nthe Judiciary Committee, I have worked for tort reform throughout my \ntenure in Washington. I believe our tort system is badly broken, so it \nwill come as no surprise that I have grave reservations about sending \nmore disputes into it.\n  First, the big picture: The proliferation of lawsuits has damaged the \nefficiency, effectiveness and integrity of America's civil justice \nsystem. Almost as bad, it is injuring the nation's economy. Now, our \nDemocratic colleagues propose to declare a ``new gold rush'' for the \nlegal industry, this time in the area of health insurer liability. And \nthe harm that results from doing so will not be limited to our \njudiciary or our economy--it will harm our health. It's downright \nunhealthy for America. Is that an overstatement, Mr. President? Well, \npeople with health insurance are likely to have better health than \nthose without it. If the Democrats are now saying that insurance \ncoverage doesn't affect health status, then they'll have to explain why \nthey keep coming up with all kinds of ideas on how to insure people. \nFive years ago, they thought insurance coverage was important--so much \nso that they wanted the government to insure everyone. Of course, even \nwith a Democratic President and Democratic control of both Houses of \nCongress, they didn't manage to do it. It's funny how we don't hear \nabout that effort anymore, but it's certainly not because we solved the \nproblem.\n  The President acknowledged the problem of the uninsured again when he \nproposed to allow people under age 65 to buy their way into the \nMedicare program. By the way, with a hefty subsidy from other Americans \nunder age 65 who pay payroll taxes. Why does the President propose this \nunless he thinks insurance coverage will improve peoples' health \nstatus. Health insurance coverage is not an end unto itself, but a \nmeans to an end, and the end is better health. So when the Democrats \npropose things that will lessen health insurance coverage, and thus \nharm the health of the American people, we need to ask why.\n  Some argue that liability laws are a good way to guarantee quality of \ncare. We're certainly not hearing much from the other side in this \ndebate about quality, but objective people think that ensuring quality \nof care should be the point of patient protection. I care a great deal \nabout health care quality, let me tell you about research that has been \ndone in the context of medical malpractice. These studies, particularly \nthe well-known Harvard study, tell us that the medical liability system \nis simply not an effective way to ensure quality. There is a tremendous \nmismatch between incidents of malpractice, on one hand, and the \nlawsuits that are brought, on the other. For many reasons, instances of \nsubstandard medical care often do not give rise to lawsuits, while many \nlawsuits that are brought are groundless. In the malpractice context, \nit is not feasible to have immediate appeals of physicians' decisions \nwhen they make them, so we're stuck with the tort system.\n  But when we talk about insurance coverage decisions, we do have an \nalternative to lawsuits. We can have immediate, independent, external \nreviews of these decisions. We can do better than lawsuits after-the-\nfact. That's what our Republican Patients' Bill of Rights will do. It \nwill get patients' claims decided when the patient needs the care. \nIsn't that the best thing for the patient? Yes--but it's not the best \nthing for the lawyers, and that's why we're here today.\n  Mr. President, the other day, I heard a Senator note that only a \nhandful of medical malpractice cases have ever been tried to a jury in \nhis state. His point, apparently, was the lawyers don't really bring \nlawsuits: just a myth. Well, I am certain that the former trial lawyers \nin this body understand that defendants in cases sometimes pay out \nmoney in settlement of a claim, whether the claim was well-founded or \nnot. Where do my colleagues believe that the money comes from? It comes \nout of the pockets of the people who buy tht good or service, \nobviously.\n  In medical malpractice cases, the cost of medical settlements, just \nlike the cost of jury verdicts, is paid for by you and me. We pay in \ntwo ways: higher prices for medical services, and higher insurance \npremiums. When my friends on the other side say that creating a right \nto sue health plans somehow will not bring about more lawsuits, they \nshould pay more attention to what their trial lawyer allies are up to. \nWho knows, maybe if they took a look at what trial lawyers are doing to \nour economy, they'd have second thoughts about supporting them all the \ntime.\n  Let's see what an objective source says. The Congressional Budget \nOffice has noted that the lawsuit provision of the Democrat proposal \nis, by far, the most expensive single item in their bill. More than \nanything else they are proposing, this liability piece is what will \ndrive people out of their insurance\n\n[[Page S8542]]\n\ncoverage into the ranks of the uninsured. That's a high price to pay to \nkeep the lawyers happy.\n  Employers are not required by law to offer health insurance coverage \nto their employees. There are tax advantages for employers to do so, \nbut we're finding that those aren't enough. More and more employees are \ndropping coverage for their employees. That's not an opinion, that's a \nfact. My friends across the aisle have repeatedly noted that many \nliberal advocacy groups support their version of patient protections. \nThose groups have every right to get involved in this debate, and I'm \nglad that they are. But my point is that most Americans don't work for \nliberal advocacy groups. In fact, very few do. I'll also note that most \nAmericans don't work for plaintiffs' law firms.\n  Even if you're anti-business, you have to admit that businesses \nprovide health insurance coverage to most Americans, and businesses are \nin a position to discontinue that coverage. The businesses that most \nAmericans do work for, both large and small, are telling us that the \nDemocratic bill will force many of them to drop coverage for employees; \nhence adopt the Republican Patients' Bill of Rights instead.\n  Let's keep our eye on the ball. There are two goals that we should be \ntrying to achieve. One is to ensure that people get the appropriate \nhealth care to which they are entitled under their insurance coverage. \nBut the 2nd goal is to avoid taking that very insurance coverage away. \nThere are many times in politics when it's impossible to achieve two \ngoals at the same time, but we can this time. We have a Republican \napproach that achieves both goals. I call on my colleagues to support \nthis approach, and to resist the temptation to join the other side's \nwar on health insurance coverage.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, in the last few days, the Senate has \nrevealed a lot about itself and where it stands.\n  Members of the Senate have had a chance to respond to the needs of \nAmerican women in allowing OB/GYNs to be their primary health care \nprovider, and they failed. Members of the Senate have had a chance to \nprotect traveling Americans across the country, allowing access to \nemergency rooms, and they declined. Americans have asked that doctors \nmake final medical judgments. That issue was brought to the Senate. The \nSenate declined.\n  Senator Durbin now brings to the floor of the Senate one last chance \nfor the Senate to do something fair and decent for the American people \nin this plan to protect people in Health Maintenance Organizations--to \ngive them the right afforded every other American with every other \nindustry to bring their grievance to a court of law.\n  It is ultimately the choice between a Patients' Bill of Rights or an \ninsurance protection plan. If we fail, make no mistake about it, this \ndebate and this vote will be noted for the fact that the Senate \nbalanced the interests of 120 million Americans against several dozen \ninsurance companies and made the wrong choice.\n  In a nation in which we pride ourselves on access to the system of \njustice and equal rights for all people in this land, there are two \nprivileged classes. By international treaty, foreign diplomats cannot \nbe sued; and by ERISA, insurance companies in the health insurance \nindustry cannot be sued. Here is a chance to reduce that list and make \ninsurance companies and those responsible for our health accountable \nlike everybody else.\n  Every small business in America is responsible if they do damage to a \ncustomer, every dry cleaner, every trucking company, every mom and pop \nstore. This industry, and this industry alone, is treated differently.\n  Under the Republican proposal, that status quo is protected.\n  Under Mr. Durbin's amendment, they will be held accountable. As other \nMembers of the Senate, I have heard constituents come forward where an \nHMO has failed to diagnose cancer in a small child and months later, \nbecause they could not get access to an oncologist, a leg or an arm is \nlost. Tell that parent they cannot go to court.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. This is a great opportunity to provide fairness and \naccess. It is the last chance to do something decent in this debate for \nthe American people.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 8 minutes.\n  The longer this debate goes on, the stranger I find those who are \nsupporting the Republican proposal. Their basic proposal started out \ncosting $1 billion. They will have the agreement later this morning, \nwith the acceptance of the long-term care credit, that will end up \ncosting $13.1 billion--$1 billion for patient protections; 100-percent \ndeductibility, $2.9 billion; liberalized MSAs, $1.5 billion; flexible \nspending accounts, $2.3 billion. That adds to $7.7 billion. And the \ndeductibility of long-term care is $5.4 billion, according to the \nSenator from Oklahoma. That is $13.1 billion, and not a cent of it is \npaid for.\n  Their proposal has gone from $1 billion to $13 billion. Our proposal, \naccording to CBO, is approximately $7 billion, which represents the 4.8 \npercent figure from CBO. I certainly hope we won't hear any more about \nthe cost of our proposal from our good friends. That was a hot button \nitem. It didn't have anything to do with protecting patients, but it \nwas a hot button item.\n  Secondly, I hope we won't hear any more about one-size-fits-all. We \nlistened to that line for 3 days. We will probably hear it later in the \ncourse of debate on many different measures. ``We don't want a solution \nof one-size-fits-all.'' Our good friend, Senator Collins from Maine, \nused that 10 times in her presentation. We are having a one-size-fits-\nall with the Republican proposal because, effectively, they are \nexcluding the States from making their own determination as to what \nactions the state might take in holding people accountable. The \nRepublican proposal can be labelled ``one-size-fits-all'' if they are \nsuccessful on this measure.\n  They are saying to every State in the country: No, you cannot provide \nthe remedies you would like for malpractice by those making health care \ndecisions. We have one industry in this country that is going to be \nsacred, one industry that will not be held responsible. You can \ncontinue to sue doctors, but we will not permit any State in this \ncountry to determine whether you can sue your HMO.\n  That is an extraordinary position for our good friends, the \nRepublicans, who are always talking about one-size-fits-all, who are \nalways saying that Washington doesn't always know best. I hope we are \nnot going to continue to hear, ``Washington doesn't know best. The \npeople in the hinterlands know what is going on. They can make up their \nminds in the States. The States are the great laboratories for \ninnovation and creativity.''\n  I can give those speeches, but they are wiping that out with this \nparticular amendment. As the Senator from Illinois pointed out, this \namendment is so basic and fundamental in protecting American citizens.\n  Even my good friend from New Hampshire has addressed this issue--I am \nsure he expected to hear this, but he ought to hear it as one of the \nprincipals, and now as acting manager. Last year, when we had the issue \nof liability of tobacco companies, this is what he said, and we will \ninclude the statement in the Record:\n\n       When you eliminate that right of redress issue--\n\n  Which is effectively what the Republican proposal would do--\n\n     which this bill does, when you take away the ability of the \n     consumer, of the person who has been damaged, of John and \n     Mary Jones, of Epping, NH, to get a recovery for an injury \n     they have received, you have artificially preserved the \n     marketplace, but, more importantly, you have given a unique \n     historic and totally inappropriate protection to an industry.\n\n  The Senate accepted that position overwhelmingly. I think there were \n20-odd votes in opposition on that issue. But here we have the \ninsurance industry. Evidently, the message is that the insurance \nindustry is more powerful than the tobacco industry. Apparently, the \ninsurance industry has the votes to get their way on this issue.\n\n[[Page S8543]]\n\n  Why is this issue important? This issue is important for two very \nbasic and fundamental reasons. First, by making the right to sue \navailable, there is an additional incentive--a powerful incentive--to \nHMOs and others in the health delivery system. There is an incentive to \nmake sure they do what is medically appropriate because they know they \nmay be held liable if they do not.\n  You may say: That is good in theory, but is it so? Look at Medicaid. \nUnder the Medicaid system, a plan may be held liable, the health \ndelivery system may be held accountable. Do we have people abusing the \nliability provisions? The answer is no. The answer is no.\n  As the Senator from Illinois pointed out, the State that allowed for \nliability most recently was Texas. Has there been a resulting \nproliferation of lawsuits, as the Senator from Alabama has suggested? \nThe answer is no. There is one legal case that was brought and possibly \none or two more pending.\n  City and State officials have the right to sue. You can take the \nexample of CalPERS, one of the largest health delivery systems in the \ncountry, with 1.2 million members. They have had the right to sue for a \nnumber of years. You can look at CalPERS premiums over the last 5 \nyears. The cost increase of the premium for CalPERS--whose members have \nthe right to sue--has actually been below the national average for HMOs \nover the last 5 years. The Senator from Illinois has indicated, as \nwell, the findings of the various studies which support this.\n  Most important, the answer we get from the other side is we don't \nneed accountability because we have a good internal and external review \nsystem under the Republican proposal. That is a phony argument. Over \nthe past 3 days we have shown why this argument is phony. The \nRepublican appeals proposal is a fixed system. There is no de novo \nreview. There are many other problems in their appeals system which we \nhave previously addressed. Yet their best answer is that the external \nreview program is a substitute for the right to hold plans accountable \nin court.\n  What happens when the plan drags its feet through the review process \nuntil it is too late for the patient? What happens when the plan \ndoesn't tell the patient an external review is even available and the \npatient doesn't find out about its availability until the damage is \ndone? What happens when the plan makes a practice of turning down \neveryone--this is reality--who applies for an expensive procedure, \nknowing there will be an appeal in only a fraction of the cases? \nKnowing that the worst penalty they could have is to pay the cost of \nthe procedure that should have been provided in the first place?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Fourteen \nminutes remain.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The patient never learns the procedure should have been \nprovided until it is too late.\n  What happens when the plan refers the patient to an unqualified \ndoctor for a procedure because it doesn't want to pay for a more \nqualified specialist outside the network? What happens when the patient \ntrusted the plan to do the right thing?\n  According to the opponents of this proposal, those kinds of abusive \npractices should carry no penalty at all because you can't sue your way \nto quality. I would like to hear them say that to a widow who lost a \nhusband--the father of her children--to a plan's greed.\n  I would like to hear them say that to a young man disabled for life \nbecause his health plan insisted on the cheapest therapy instead of the \nbest therapy.\n  I would like to hear them say that to the parents whose child has \ndied because the health plan mislead them about the availability of \nappropriate treatment.\n  I challenge the opponents of this provision to tell the American \npeople why public employees in there own States should have the right \nto hold their health plan accountable, but the equally hard-working \nfamily just down the street employed in the local bank or grocery store \nshouldn't have the same right.\n  I challenge them to explain to the child or spouse of someone who has \ndied or become permanently disabled due to HMO abuses, why they should \nhave to live in poverty while a multibillion-dollar corporation gets \noff scot-free.\n  I challenge those on the other side--who talked so much during the \ndebate on welfare reform about the need for people to take \nresponsibility for their actions--to explain why this standard should \napply to poor, single mothers but not to HMOs.\n  I challenge them to explain why every other industry in America \nshould be held responsible for its actions, but HMOs and health \ninsurance companies should be immune from responsibility.\n  The time has come to say that this unique immunity should end.\n  The time has come to say that someone who dies or is injured because \nan insurance company accountant overrules the doctor is entitled to \ncompensation.\n  The time has come to say that profits should no longer take priority \nover patients' care.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nWashington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, nothing could more dramatically illustrate \nthe differences in general attitudes and attitudes towards health care \nbetween the Senator from Massachusetts and the Members on this side \nthan his statement that his bill would be preferable to ours because it \nwould only ``cost'' the American people $7 billion, while ours would \n``cost'' the American people $13 billion.\n  In fact, of course, overwhelmingly, the ``costs'' of his bill will be \nevidenced in higher taxes on the American people. His so-called \n``costs'' of our bill are, in fact, the reduction of taxes on the \nAmerican people so they can use their own money to take care of more of \ntheir own health care costs. But to the Senator from Massachusetts, it \nis the same thing--more taxes, not less taxes.\n  We do not think that is the same thing by any stretch of the \nimagination.\n  In addition, of course, he ignores entirely the costs imposed on the \nAmerican people by paying higher health insurance premiums. Those \npresumably are irrelevant.\n  But the subject before us primarily is lawsuits.\n  There is widespread agreement in this body and across the United \nStates that the medical malpractice system is simply broken, that it \ncomes too late, that it costs so much, that less than half of the \ndollars that it costs ever get to victims and the rest is consumed by \nlawyers and by the administration of the system itself.\n  The problem is, of course, we have never come up with a majority for \na way in which to fix that medical malpractice system. But the \nproposition that it is broken is very widely held.\n  It is into that broken system the Democrats' plan pours another \nelement of our health care system and says: Oh, the system may be \nbroken, but the only solution is to make it worse, is to make it more \nwidespread.\n  Pouring good wine into a broken bottle with what impact? Better \nhealth care? No. We know the medical malpractice system doesn't create \nmore and better health care.\n  More lawsuits? Clearly, yes. One aspect of that broken system, of \ncourse, is the costs go not into providing better health care for the \npeople of the country but into the system itself.\n  But the patients--ultimately, the people who buy insurance, the \npeople who consume health care--pay the entire bill, including all of \nthe bills for the lawyers. With what impact? Higher costs for everyone \nwho is insured and therefore fewer insured.\n  But I think that is perhaps the least of the vices of the Democratic \nproposal because it allows, under certain circumstances at least, the \nemployer--the person who is providing health care to his or her or its \nemployees--to be sued. As well, it will drive logical and thoughtful \nemployers out of the business of providing insurance at all. And it \nwill do that in a devastating degree.\n  I suspect that perhaps half of the employers, when they find they are \ngoing to be sued, will simply say: We are not interested in any more \nlawsuits. Sure. We will give each of our employees more money for the \ncost of that health insurance in cash, and the employee can do what he \nor she wishes with it.\n\n[[Page S8544]]\n\n  Some will ignore the cost of health care insurance and will become \nself-insured--some very much to their pain. Others will attempt to buy \nindividual policies, which will inevitably cost more and give them less \nthan any kind of group policy does. So we will have less insurance \nunder this set of circumstances in order to have more lawsuits.\n  Let's go back to this whole idea of medical malpractice as a broken \nsystem.\n  What we should be searching for is a better system, and the better \nsystem is exactly the plan that the Republican proposal has. It says \ninstead of lawsuits after the harm has been done with the reward, if \nany, coming 3, 4, or 6 years later, we tell the potential patient who \nthinks his health care system has not done right by him that he has a \nright to get an answer promptly before the damage is done.\n  This is the system we ought to expand to other health care systems. \nThis is the system we are asked by the Supreme Court of the United \nStates to apply to asbestos litigation--a unanimous Supreme Court of \nthe United States.\n  But instead, if the Senator from Massachusetts has his way, we will \nsimply take a broken system and apply it in more areas than it applies \nto right now.\n  That is a perverse answer to a very serious question. We will not \ntreat the patients. They will treat the court system.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we have heard the horror stories: An HMO \ndelays a breast cancer patient's treatment until the cancer has spread \nthroughout her body. Parents are forced to drive their critically ill \nchild to a hospital 50 miles away from their home because their insurer \nrefuses to let them take the boy to a hospital 5 miles from their home. \nA patient complaining of chest pains is not allowed to see a \ncardiologist, and as a result suffers a fatal heart attack. Americans \nwant their doctors--not managed care bureaucrats--to make their medical \ndecisions. And when managed care wrongfully delays or denies care, \nAmericans want the right to bring a lawsuit to hold managed care \nresponsible for its misconduct.\n  And let me tell you directly--the Gregg amendment won't do a thing to \nhelp Americans who suffer from the abuse of HMOs. It will maintain the \nprovision in ERISA that allows patients in employer self funded plans \nto only recover damages in court from an HMO related to the cost of the \ntreatment delayed or denied. It denies the right of Americans to \nreceive punitive damages that send the message to insurance companies \nthat when they do wrong, they'll be held accountable for the wrong they \ndo.\n  The Gregg amendment sets up a weak appeals process where patients \ncould first dispute the HMO's ruling with a doctor within the insurance \nplan (but not the one they saw for treatment) and if they are still not \nsatisfied then they can talk to a second doctor that is outside of the \ninsurance plan but regulated by either a state or federal agency. \nWhatever each of the doctors rule would then be binding. The Gregg \namendment only exacerbates a bureaucratic nightmare. It doesn't allow \nAmericans to hold insurance companies accountable in court. It doesn't \naddress the real impediment to accountability in health care: ERISA.\n  Today, even if an HMO has been directly involved in dictating, \ndenying or delaying care for a patient, it can use a loophole in the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) to avoid any \nresponsibility for the consequences of its actions. ERISA was designed \nover 25 years ago, long before managed care companies became the \npowerful entity in controlling the health care of Americans that it is \ntoday. ERISA was originally designed to protect employees from losing \npension benefits due to fraud, mismanagement and employer bankruptcies \nduring the 1960's, but the law has had the affect of allowing an HMO to \ndeny or delay care with no effective remedy for patients.\n  Judge William G. Young, a Reagan appointed US District Judge, in his \nlandmark opinion in one case, laid the problems out before us in clear \nlanguage. He said, and I quote, ``ERISA has evolved into a shield of \nimmunity that protects health insurers, utilization review providers, \nand other managed care entities from potential liability for the \nconsequences of their wrongful denial of health benefits. ERISA thwarts \nthe legitimate claims of the very people it was designed to protect.'' \nJudge Young was barred by law from awarding damages for wrongful death \nin an HMO case--his hands were tied by ERISA--but he laid out the point \nwe're trying to make today. We need to end the ERISA nightmare that is \nhurting ordinary Americans.\n  We have built a system that puts paperwork ahead of patients and \nignores the real life and death decisions being made in our health care \nsystem. We must do better. Americans deserve better care, and deserve \nthe right to hold insurers accountable if they do not receive that \ncare.\n\n  Our opponents erroneously argue that ensuring that plans are held \naccountable will drive up premium costs and result in lost coverage. \nThey fail to acknowledge however, that the timely appeals mechanisms in \nour amendment could prevent lawsuits before harm can occur. In fact, an \nindependent study by Coopers and Lyband found that the Democratic \nprovision to hold health plans accountable would cost a mere 3 to 13 \ncents a month. Ironically, the industry's cry that liability will raise \ncosts assumes that health plans are very negligent and that patients do \nindeed suffer real harm.\n  History bears out our case: access to the court system for ordinary \nAmericans--the right to seek redress--rescued America from Pintos that \ncaught on fire, it gave us seatbelts, bumpers, airbags in cars, and \nevery innovation in safety for consumers that we've witnessed over the \nlast thirty years.\n  So why would we oppose access to the court system for patients \ninjured by runaway insurance companies? Well, some have said it will \nclog the courts and increase costs and premiums on insurance. And all \nthe studies that prove otherwise aren't enough for these ideologies. \nWell, they might want to take a look at the State of Texas, where, over \nGovernor George Bush's objections, they gave Texans the right to sue \ntheir HMO. And what's been the result? In 2 years since an external \nreview process was established, only 480 complaints have been filed \nwith the Texas Independent Review Organization--about 30 times less \nthan the 4,400 complaints that were predicted in the first year alone \nby the Texas Department of Insurance. Even more important, only one \nmedical malpractice lawsuit has been filed under this law. Mr. \nPresident, the Republicans have been asking America to look towards \nTexas for some answers--Mr. President, this is one issue on which I \nthink we ought to follow Texas's example. It works.\n  Americans overwhelmingly favor holding managed care plans \naccountable. A Kaiser Family Foundation/Harvard School of Public Health \nsurvey released in January of this year found that 78 percent of voters \nbelieve that patients should be able to hold managed care legally \naccountable for malpractice. A poll released in September of 1998 by \nThe Wall Street Journal and NBC News revealed that 71 percent of voters \nfavor legislation that gives patients the right to hold managed care \naccountable for improper care, even if that might increase premiums--\nwhich studies show it would not.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that accountability is the key to \nenforcing patients' rights. A right to emergency room care on a \n``prudent layperson'' standard or a right to specialty care does little \nto protect patients if such care can routinely be delayed or denied. \nOnly legal remedies provide adequate protection against managed care's \nbiggest abuses. And it's time we embraced those legal remedies. That is \nsomething about which we should all agree.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have articles from the New York Times and \nthe Wall Street Journal printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 11, 1998]\n\n        Hands Tied, Judges Rue Law That Limits H.M.O. Liability\n\n                            (By Robert Pear)\n\n       Washington, July 10--Federal judges around the country, \n     frustrated by cases in which patients denied medical benefits \n     have\n\n[[Page S8545]]\n\n     no right to sue, are urging Congress to consider changes in a \n     1974 law that protects insurance companies and health \n     maintenance organizations against legal attacks.\n       In their decisions, the judges do not offer detailed \n     solutions of the type being pushed in Congress by Democrats \n     and some Republicans. But they say their hands are tied by \n     the 1974 law, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. \n     And they often lament the results, saying the law has not \n     kept pace with changes in health care and the workplace.\n       The law, known as Erisa, was adopted mainly because of \n     Congressional concern that corrupt, incompetent pension \n     managers were looting or squandering the money entrusted to \n     them. The law, which also governs health plans covering 125 \n     million Americans, sets stringent standards of conduct for \n     the people who run such plans, but severely limits the \n     remedies available to workers.\n       In a lawsuit challenging the denial of benefits, a person \n     in an employer-sponsored health plan may recover the benefits \n     in question and can get an injunction clarifying the right to \n     future benefits. But judges have repeatedly held that the law \n     does not allow compensation for lost wages, death or \n     disability, pain and suffering, emotional distress or other \n     harm that a patient suffers as a result of the improper \n     denial of care.\n       Congress wanted to encourage employers to provide benefits \n     to workers and therefore established uniform Federal \n     standards, so pension and health plans would not have to \n     comply with a multitude of conflicting state laws and \n     regulations.\n       The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, \n     in New Orleans, reached a typical conclusion in a lawsuit by \n     a Louisiana woman whose fetus died after an insurance company \n     refused to approve her hospitalization for a high-risk \n     pregnancy. The woman, Florence B. Corcoran, and her husband \n     sought damages under state law.\n       In dismissing the suit, the court said, ``The Corcorans \n     have no remedy, state or Federal, for what may have been a \n     serious mistake.''\n       The court said that the harsh result ``would seem to \n     warrant a reevaluation of Erisa so that it can continue to \n     serve its noble purpose of safeguarding the interests of \n     employees.''\n       In another case, Judge William G. Young of the Federal \n     District Court in Boston said, ``It is deeply troubling that, \n     in the health insurance context, Erisa has evolved into a \n     shield of immunity which thwarts the legitimate claims of \n     the very people it was designed to protect.''\n       Judge Young said he was distressed by ``the failure of \n     Congress to amend a statute that, due to the changing \n     realities of the modern health care system, has gone \n     conspicuously awry,'' leaving many consumers ``without any \n     remedy'' for the wrongful denial of health benefits.\n       Disputes over benefits have become common as more employers \n     provide coverage to workers through H.M.O.'s and other types \n     of managed care, which try to rein in costs by controlling \n     the use of services.\n       Here are some examples of the ways in which judges have \n     expressed concern:\n       Judge John C. Porfilio of the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver, said he was ``moved \n     by the tragic circumstances'' of a woman with leukemia who \n     died after her H.M.O. refused approval for a bone marrow \n     transplant. But, he said, the 1974 law ``gives us no \n     choice,'' and the woman's husband, who had sued for damages, \n     is ``left without a remedy.''\n       The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, \n     in St. Louis, said the law protected an H.M.O. against a suit \n     by the family of a Missouri man, Buddy Kuhl, who died after \n     being denied approval for heart surgery recommended by his \n     doctors. ``Modification of Erisa in light of questionable \n     modern insurance practices must be the job of Congress, not \n     the courts,'' said Judge C. Arlen Beam.\n       The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, \n     in Cincinnati, said that Federal law barred claims against a \n     ``utilization review'' company that refused to approve \n     psychiatric care for a man who later committed suicide. \n     Because of Erisa, the court said, people who sue an H.M.O. \n     or an insurer for wrongful death ``may be left without a \n     meaningful remedy.''\n       Federal District Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton, in Worcester, \n     Mass., said that the husband of a woman who died of breast \n     cancer was ``left without any meaningful remedy'' against an \n     H.M.O. that had refused to authorize treatment.\n       Federal District Judge Marvin J. Garbis, in Baltimore, \n     acknowledged that a Maryland man may be left ``without an \n     adequate remedy'' for damages caused by his H.M.O.'s refusal \n     to pay for eye surgery and other necessary treatments. But, \n     Judge Garbis said, whether Erisa should be ``re-examined and \n     reformed in light of modern health care is an issue which \n     must be addressed and resolved by the legislature rather than \n     the courts.''\n       The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, \n     in San Francisco, ruled last month that an insurance company \n     did not have to surrender the money it saved by denying care \n     to a Seattle woman, Rhonda Bast, who later died of breast \n     cancer.\n       ``This case presents a tragic set of facts,'' Judge David \n     R. Thompson said. But ``without action by Congress, there is \n     nothing we can do to help the Basts and others who may find \n     themselves in this same unfortunate situation.''\n       Democrats and some Republicans in Congress are pushing \n     legislation that would make it easier for patients to sue \n     H.M.O.'s and insurance wrong decision, he or she can be sued, \n     said Representative Charlie Norwood, Republican of Georgia, \n     but ``H.M.O.'s are shielded from liability for their \n     decisions by Erisa.''\n       Changes in Erisa will not come easily. The Supreme Court \n     has described it as ``an enormously complex and detailed \n     statute'' that carefully balances many powerful competing \n     interests. Few members of Congress understand the intricacies \n     of the law. Insurance companies, employers and Republican \n     leaders strenuously oppose changes, saying that any new \n     liability for H.M.O.'s would increase the cost of employee \n     health benefits.\n       Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, \n     said today that he had agreed to schedule floor debate on \n     legislation to regulate managed care within the next two \n     weeks. Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic \n     leader, who had been seeking such a debate said, Mr. Lott's \n     commitment could be ``a very consequential turning point'' if \n     Democrats have a true opportunity to offer their proposals.\n       But Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the assistant \n     Republican leader, said, ``Republicans believe that health \n     resources should be used for patient care, not to pay trial \n     lawyers.''\n       Proposals to regulate managed care have become an issue in \n     this year's elections, and the hottest question of all is \n     whether patients should be able to sue their H.M.O.'s. The \n     denial of health benefits means something very different \n     today from what it meant in 1974, when Erisa was passed. At \n     that time, an insured worker would visit the doctor and then \n     if a claim was disallowed, haggle with the insurance company \n     over who should pay. But now, in the era of managed care, \n     treatment itself may be delayed or denied, and this ``can \n     lead to damages far beyond the out-of-pocket cost of the \n     treatment at issue,'' Judge Young said.\n       H.M.O.'s have been successfully sued. A California lawyer, \n     Mark O. Hiepler, won a multimillion-dollar jury verdict \n     against an H.M.O. that denied a bone marrow transplant to his \n     sister, Nelene Fox, who later died of breast cancer. But that \n     case was unusual. Mrs. Fox was insured through a local school \n     district, and such ``governmental plans'' are not generally \n     covered by Erisa.\n       The primary goal of Erisa was to protect workers, and to \n     that end the law established procedures for settling claim \n     disputes.\n       Erisa supersedes any state laws that may ``relate to'' an \n     employee benefit plan. Erisa does not allow damages for the \n     improper denial or processing of claims, and judges have held \n     that the Federal law, in effect, nullifies state laws that \n     allow such damages.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, July 8, 1998]\n\n                Lawsuits Have Little Effect On Premiums\n\n                          (By Laurie McGinley)\n\n       WASHINGTON--Adding fuel to one of the most contentious \n     issues before Congress, a study found that allowing patients \n     to sue their health plans over treatment denials hardly \n     increased premiums.\n       Though laced with caveats, the study could have a \n     significant impact on the managed-care debate heating up on \n     Capitol Hill, where a key question is whether injured \n     patients should be permitted to sue their plans for damages. \n     The report, by Coopers & Lybrand for the Kaiser Family \n     Foundation, is the first attempt by an independent group to \n     look closely at the costs associated with litigation. It \n     undercuts assertions by the managed-care industry and \n     employer groups that imposing legal liability on health plans \n     for wrongly denying treatment would send insurance premiums \n     soaring.\n       After examining three big health plans for state and local \n     government employees, who already have the right to sue, the \n     study found that the cost of litigation was between three and \n     13 cents a month per enrollee, or 0.03% to 0.11% of premiums.\n       ``Coopers found that in these places where patients can \n     sue, very few have and the costs have been rather small,'' \n     said Kaiser Foundation President Drew Altman. He cautioned \n     against drawing strong conclusions from the data. ``These are \n     real-life examples, but you can't necessarily use them to \n     generalize to the whole country.''\n\n\n                       more cost estimates coming\n\n       The study won't be the last word on the subject. The \n     Congressional Budget Office is working on a cost estimate of \n     a Democratic ``patients' bill of rights'' proposal that \n     includes a managed-care liability provision. And the managed-\n     care industry has touted its own study, by the Barents Group, \n     which estimated that the right-to-sue provision could raise \n     premium costs by 2.7% to 8.6%.\n       The report came as Senate Democrats fired the opening shot \n     in what is likely to be a protracted struggle over managed-\n     care reform. Last night, Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South \n     Dakota tried to attach the Democratic bill to a funding bill \n     for the veterans and housing departments. In response, \n     Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi pulled the bill off \n     the floor. Meanwhile, GOP senators are working on their own, \n     slimmer, managed-care bill.\n       The Kaiser report gives the Democrats and their legislative \n     allies, including the American Medical Association, added \n     ammunition on the right-to-sue provision. ``The study strips \n     away the only serious argument against the right to hold \n     health plans accountable that has been made by the opponents \n     of change,'' Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) said in a \n     statement.\n\n[[Page S8546]]\n\n       Richard Smith, vice president for policy at the American \n     Association of Health Plans, which represents more than 1,000 \n     managed-care plans, said the study was deficient because it \n     doesn't include the cost of ``defensive medicine''--the \n     provision of services solely to avoid lawsuits. Such \n     practices, he said, would be the ``single largest cost \n     driver'' resulting from the right-to-sue provision.\n       Larry Atkins, president of Health Policy Analysts, a \n     Washington consulting group, said that ``it's impossible to \n     assess the real cost'' of liability, but its passage would \n     end managed care's success in curbing health costs.\n\n\n                         suits in federal court\n\n       Under the 1974 Employee Income Retirement Security Act, \n     injured patients enrolled in employer-sponsored health plans \n     can't sue their plans for damages under state law if they're \n     improperly denied treatment. They are permitted to bring \n     actions in federal court, but if they win they receive only \n     the value of the denied benefit.\n       But the law doesn't apply to employees of state and local \n     governments, so Coopers & Lybrand examined the litigation \n     experience of the California Public Employees Retirement \n     System, the Los Angeles Unified School District and the State \n     of Colorado Employee Benefit Plan. Altogether, the three \n     plans cover 1.1 million workers. ``All three programs \n     reported very low rates of litigation ranging from 0.3 to 1.4 \n     cases per 100,000 enrollees per year,'' the study said.\n       Coopers & Lybrand cautioned that public employees may be \n     less likely to sue than their counterparts in the private \n     sector.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, our bill that is now being attempted to be \nwiped out as far as liability has not established a right to sue but \nsimply says Federal law cannot break what the States say are \nappropriate remedies for patients and families who are harmed.\n  Our legislation protects employers against liability.\n  I repeat. Our legislation protects employers against liability.\n  It allows patients who are harmed by an insurance company's decision \nto deny or delay care to hold their insurance company accountable--not \ntheir employer.\n  There is a lot of talk about the ads that are being run that the \nemployers are going to be held responsible. That is absolutely not \ntrue.\n  Under the Republican amendment, if someone dies of cancer because an \ninsurer refuses needed tests, all the insurer is responsible for is the \ncost of that test. It may be $20 or $30. That will be the extent of \nliability. Doctors and other health providers can be sued for harm, \npain, and suffering. Yet health plans that make decisions to deny or \ndelay care will continue to be off the hook. Doctors and other health \nproviders can be sued, and yet these HMOs continue to be left off the \nhook.\n  It is ironic that those who defend States rights so much on the floor \nof the Senate obviously don't follow through because they are the \nloudest and the first to use Federal law to protect health insurers \nthat injure patients.\n  That is another way of saying the insurance industry is being \nprotected by the majority.\n  Democrats believe insurance companies should be held accountable when \ntheir decisions lead to injury or death. And our opponents claim that \nisn't the way it should be. They say they should be protected in this \nseparate category, as has been pointed out about the foreign diplomat.\n  In fact, I repeat what I said earlier this morning. An independent \nstudy by Coopers & Lybrand, the international accounting firm, found \nthat the provision in our bill to hold health plans accountable would \ncost as little as 3 cents per person per month.\n  Our legislation is directed toward patients, not profits. Our \nlegislation wants to maintain and reestablish the party-physician \nrelationship, which the Republican, the majority, have attempted to \ndestroy with their protecting of the HMOs.\n  The Republican, the majority, bill is an insurance protection bill; \nours is one that protects patients.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I note for the Record that the bill \nsponsored by the Democratic side does allow employers to be sued under \nsubsection A(302). It says specifically ``shall not preclude any cause \nof action described in paragraph one against employer.''\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. Under the Senator's time.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator is accurate in his statement, it would have \nsaid the only time an employer can be held responsible is when the \nemployer is involved directly in a specific case and makes a decision \nthat leads to injury or death.\n  Of course that is fair. If an employer makes a decision--not the \nemployer's HMO, not the employer's doctor, but the doctor himself is \ninvolved in making a decision that leads to injury or death--that seems \nfair to me.\n  Mr. GREGG. Actually, the language says ``discretionary authority,'' \nwhich is a very broad term.\n  I yield the Senator from Oregon 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, many of the HMOs that Senator \nReid identifies are self-funded insurance plans that are provided by \nbusinesses. They certainly are included.\n  As Senator Gregg has noted, the language reads ``discretionary \nauthority'' which is a very broad term. The potential for liability is \nvery great.\n  As I speak to my colleagues and the American people today, I simply \nsay we have a problem. We are mortals, and no one gets out of this life \nalive. When people die and when they get sick, there are lots of tears. \nWe would like to help. Often, as we reach out to help, we look also for \npeople to blame for tragedy. There are plenty of people in the legal \nprofession to help them find others to blame.\n  I stand before the Senate as a member of the bar. But I am not going \nto speak as a member of the bar. I am going to speak as the Senator \nfrom Oregon and as a member who holds a somewhat unique perspective in \nthis Chamber--as a businessman, also as someone who has actually paid \nthe health care bills.\n  Colleagues, as I have listened to Senator Frist I have been impressed \nby his skill as a physician, his nuances and his understanding of these \nissues and they have been helpful to me. As I watched Senator Edwards \nof North Carolina use his great skill and ability as a trial lawyer to \nmake the case for liability, I was also impressed.\n  However, there are not many people in this Chamber who have actually \nwritten the check to provide the health care coverage to their \nemployees. My experience before coming to this Senate was as a food \nprocessor. I provided health insurance to hundreds of employees and \ntheir families. For nearly 20 years in which I managed that business, I \nsaw health care costs rise three, four, even five times the rate of \ninflation. My business was not to provide health care, it was to \nproduce food. It was--beyond all others--a cost out of control.\n  These people who are writing the checks, trying to live up to the \npromise that we all want in this country for health care, are not the \nenemy. They are trying to do a good job, and to meet the needs of their \nemployees. I cannot think of a single thing that would imperil health \ncare more in this country than removing the protections provided to \nemployers on the issue of liability.\n  We are shown all of the terrible situations by the charts shown in \nthis Chamber. But I say to you, I have a heart, too. I would like to \nhelp. But I also know that when you deal with an inflationary cost such \nas medicine, sometimes you don't have the ability--particularly in \nagriculture--to pass those costs on in the price of your product. So \nwhen you add on top of that the potential cost of liability, I fear \nthat employers will not be able to bear it and will turn that benefit \ninto cash for their employees and simply say to employees--you will \nhave to buy it yourself.\n  But people don't have the ability to buy health care coverage as \nindividuals as well as when they are pooled in employer groups. I \nsupport employer-provided health care. I think we are imperiling it if \nwe remove the protections provided to employers by ERISA.\n  Now, employer-provided health care has an interesting origin in our \ncountry. It was very rare prior to World War II when we put on wage and \nprice controls but did not limit the ability of businesses and labor to \nbargain for benefits. When the men went off to war, businesses reached \nout to many of the\n\n[[Page S8547]]\n\nwomen. They could not offer them a higher wage, so they offered them \nthe benefit of health care. Then businesses began to do this more and \nmore, and it became the subject of collective bargaining under Taft-\nHartley and other labor provisions. By the 1970s, nearly three quarters \nof the American people were covered by employer-provided health care \nplans.\n\n  Congress wanted to go further. In fact, it was a Democratic Congress \nin 1974 that produced the protection called ERISA to further induce and \nincentivize businesses to expand in a multistate way to provide health \ninsurance.\n  Folks, it has worked. Right now the frustrating thing to me is, as we \ntry to legislate, we inevitably have to draw lines and make decisions.\n  We once were in the position in the State of Oregon of figuring out \nhow best to allocate Medicaid resources. We don't like to have \nuninsured people in our State; we want them to be insured. Our current \nGovernor's name is John Kitzhaber. He is a medical doctor; he is an \nemergency room physician. He is a Democrat. He came to the Federal \nGovernment, along with many on the Republican side, and said: Let's \ntake this Cadillac plan for a few and essentially turn it into a \nChevrolet plan for many.\n  So we got a waiver. Instead of rationing medicine through waiting \nlines and price, we did it upfront by saying: These are the health care \nprocedures that are available.\n  The Vice President, Al Gore, and others referred to our Governor \nsometimes in very disparaging terms. He was even called ``Doctor \nDeath'' by the media. But he had the courage, and many with him, to \nmake decisions that were tough.\n  So when we see the pictures and the charts, I say to you that I have \nbeen there, I have seen and lived them before. My heart strings are \npulled by those, too. But I also know that we don't help them by \nincreasing health care costs--we uninsure them.\n  What we are debating, really, is where to draw the line, how to make \nhealth care more affordable to more people. The last thing in the world \nwe should be doing is so disincentivizing the ability of small \nbusinesses to afford health care that they will simply turn it into \ncash.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter on \nbehalf of the National Grocers Association.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                  National Grocers Association\n\n                                         Reston, VA, July 9, 1999.\n     Hon. Gordon H. Smith,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: On behalf of independent retail and \n     wholesale grocers nationwide, I am writing to express our \n     strong opposition to legislation that allows employers to be \n     sued for health plan decisions or that modify or eliminate \n     ERISA preemption of state regulation. The National Grocers \n     Association (N.G.A.) is the national trade association \n     representing retail and wholesale grocers who comprise the \n     independent sector of the food distribution industry. This \n     industry segment accounts for nearly half of all grocery \n     sales in the United States.\n       Under current law, the Employee Retirement Income Security \n     Act (ERISA) supersedes all state laws concerning employee \n     benefits. This means that states cannot regulate or tax \n     employer health and welfare plans, and beneficiaries may not \n     sue plans or employers for violations of state law. The \n     purpose of ERISA preemption of state law is to encourage \n     businesses to offer health insurance to their employees by \n     guaranteeing a uniform national regulatory system and \n     limiting liability. It has served this purpose extremely \n     well.\n       Elimination of the ERISA preemption would subject companies \n     in the food distribution industry to a patchwork of new \n     regulations in the states in which they operate, and expose \n     them to a new class of possible lawsuits in each of those \n     states. Plans would be forced to cover treatments to avoid \n     litigation, thereby driving up the cost of offering health \n     insurance. There is tremendous concern that the new costs \n     associated with removing the ERISA preemption could cause \n     many businesses to stop offering health insurance to their \n     employees.\n       Again, I urge you to oppose legislation to modify or \n     eliminate the ERISA preemption thereby increasing the cost of \n     health care while expanding employer liability. Thank you in \n     advance for your consideration of our concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Thomas K. Zaucha,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. The letter talks about how many small grocers, \nas many in business, simply will not be in a position to bear this \nadditional burden.\n  I ask Members to understand, we are talking about a very significant \nthing. It is not just about price; it is about the ability to \nparticipate, and to continue providing health insurance to the working \nmen and women of this country. I ask my colleagues to vote against \nexpanding liability and in support of the Gregg amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield myself 5 minutes. Do we have 9 \nminutes left? Please let me know when 4 minutes are up.\n  Madam President, statements have been made here to the effect that we \nshould not let this process go forward. Statements have been made that \nthis is basically a Democratic initiative, a partisan issue. We have \nclaimed it is an issue of fundamental justice.\n  Let me quote Frank Keating, the Republican Governor of Oklahoma, a \nman who was so respected in his own party that he was elected chairman \nof the Republican Governors' Association. According to an Oklahoma \nnewspaper, in an interview with Keating, Keating sided with \ncongressional Democrats. He said health maintenance organizations \nshould be open to lawsuits if they are grossly negligent. Keating said \nhis oldest daughter had a heart defect since birth, but that the \ngatekeeper at her health maintenance organization in Texas told her she \ndid not need to see a cardiologist. Keating said he made a call to a \ntop aide to Texas Governor George W. Bush to get some action. He said \nhe realized other people might not be able to pull such strings.\n  That is what a Republican Governor has said is the reality in real \nAmerica.\n  We see it in the Federal courts. I will have printed in the Record a \nseries of statements from judges who are seeing these cases. Let me \nread one by Federal Judge William Young, a longtime Republican, who, \nincidentally, was appointed to the bench by President Ronald Reagan. He \nsaid that disturbing to this court is the failure of Congress to amend \na statute that, due to the changing realities of the modern health care \nsystem, has gone conspicuously awry from its original sense. This court \nhas no choice but to pluck the case out of State court and then, at the \nbehest of the insurance company, slam the courthouse door in the wife's \nface and leave her without any remedy.\n  Judge Young came down here and urged us to include this particular \nprovision in our legislation because of what he has seen occur in the \nFederal courts.\n  I could read instance after instance. Judge Spencer Letts has a long \nstatement about this as well. He said that it is not just the parents. \nThey are the most powerful voices, but it is the judges who are \nappalled at the inequity and outrageous injustice that is taking place \nin the Federal courts all over this country, and it is wrong.\n  Most Americans would be shocked to know that HMOs enjoy immunity from \nsuits. If a doctor fails to treat a patient with cancer correctly and \nif the patient dies, you can sue the doctor for malpractice. But if a \nmanaged care company decides to pinch pennies and overrule the doctor's \nrecommendations on treating the patient and the patient dies, the \ninsurance company is immune from responsibility. No other industry in \nAmerica enjoys this immunity from the consequences of its actions. The \nHMOs do not deserve it. On this life-and-death decision, immunity from \nresponsibility is literally a license to kill.\n  Madam President, we ought to at least leave this matter up to the \nStates, not preempt the States.\n  I want to say the strongest supporters of this provision are the \ndoctors. The reason the doctors are the strongest advocates of this \nposition is because they are sick and tired of having their medical \nrecommendations overruled by HMOs. That is the basic justification.\n  Ultimately, it is basic fairness to the individual who may be harmed. \nThe provision ultimately improves the quality of care by ensuring their \naccountability. Finally, we have the doctors themselves pleading, \npleading, pleading for Congress to act.\n  The American Medical Association has indicated its strong support in \na letter. I ask unanimous consent to have that printed in the Record as \nwell.\n\n[[Page S8548]]\n\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 American Medical Association,\n\n                                        Chicago, Il, July 8, 1999.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of the 300,000 physician \n     and student members of the American Medical Association \n     (AMA), we are pleased that the Senate has agreed to begin \n     debate on patient protection legislation. Bipartisan \n     enactment of comprehensive legislation in this area is \n     urgently needed.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       This bill should remedy the inequity that results from \n     health plans' ability to routinely make medical decisions \n     while remaining unaccountable for the injuries they cause. \n     Health plans duplicitously argue that they should make \n     medical necessity decisions and control utilization review \n     and appeals processes while stating that they want to be \n     protected by ERISA preemption. By not removing that immunity, \n     this bill would fail to hold those health plans accountable. \n     Presently, 125 million enrollees participate in ERISA-covered \n     health plans, and despite state legislative initiatives to \n     provide adequate legal remedies, those enrollees are all \n     without effective legal recourse against their health plans. \n     This is an issue of fundamental fairness. The AMA firmly \n     believes that Americans covered by ERISA plans must have the \n     same right of redress as those who are covered by non-ERISA \n     plans. We therefore request that S. 326 be amended to remove \n     ERISA preemption for health plans.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       In conclusion, the AMA appreciates the Senate's efforts to \n     adopt legislation that would promote fairness in managed \n     care. We urge you to join us in advancing patients' rights by \n     strengthening the ``Patients' Bill of Rights Act,'' S. 326, \n     to guarantee all patients these essential protections.\n           Respectfully,\n                                   E. Ratcliffe Anderson, Jr., MD.\n\n  Madam President, I hope this amendment will be defeated and that we \nlet the States make the final judgment. They ought to be the ones who \nmake the decision about protecting their own citizens. On this issue, \nit should not be the Federal Government or the Senate preempting and \ndenying States the opportunity to protect their citizens.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes and 29 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 2 minutes on the bill to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n2 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I thank Senator Kennedy for his \nincredible leadership on this issue.\n  Last night, I said the score was 8 to 0; it was 8 for the HMOs, \npatients nothing. I think this amendment is worth 2 points, so it will \neither be 10 to nothing or 8 to 2.\n  Let me tell you why I think this amendment is so important. If this \namendment is agreed to and the HMOs cannot be held accountable in a \ncourt of law, it means that if they kill you, if they maim you, if they \nhurt you or your family or your children due to callous and uncaring \nbureaucrats, they cannot be held accountable. We set no new Federal \ncause of action. We simply say if the States believe it is right--such \nas Texas decided it was--then they can allow these lawsuits to proceed.\n  Let me tell you about an emergency room physician I met. He came \nbefore the Congress. He told a harrowing tale of a man who was brought \ninto the emergency room with uncontrollable blood pressure. The doctor \ntried everything. Finally, by administering drugs through an IV, he was \nable to control the pressure. He felt the man needed to stay in the \nhospital at least overnight. He called the HMO. The HMO said, \n``Absolutely not. Give the man his medication and send him home.''\n  The doctor begged. The doctor cajoled. The HMO was unrelenting. The \ndoctor went to the patient. He said, ``Your HMO will not allow you to \nstay here, sir, but I strongly advise you to stay here.''\n  The patient said, ``What will it cost?\"\n  The doctor said, ``About $5,000.''\n  This gentleman started laughing. He said: I don't have $5,000. I have \na family. I have to go home. I have a job. I am sure my HMO would never \ndo this to me, would never put me in danger. If they say I can have the \ndrugs, give me the drugs, and I will go home.\n  The doctor could not prevail with the gentleman. The gentleman went \nhome and had a stroke. He is now paralyzed on one side of his body.\n  I ask for an additional 30 seconds on the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 30 more seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So now what happens? This man is paralyzed for life. Oh, \nhe could sue the doctor, that good doctor who begged the HMO. Yes, he \ncould sue the hospital. The hospital had nothing to do with it.\n  I am saying to my friends on the other side of the aisle, you are \nalways talking about States rights. We come in here and get lectured \nevery day. All this amendment, under the underlying bill, says is, if a \nState decides to allow their people the right to sue a callous, \nuncaring, and negligent HMO, as Texas decided to do and other States \ndid, let them do it.\n  I hope this amendment will be defeated. Remember, it is worth 2 \npoints.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask that the Senator from New \nHampshire yield me 1 minute.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the Senator from Oklahoma 1 minute.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a letter from the Republican Governors Association, \nsigned by Governor Keating from Oklahoma, Ed Schafer, Governor of North \nDakota, and Don Sundquist, Governor of Tennessee, all urging us to \ndefeat the Kennedy bill.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                             Republican Governors Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 1999.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     Assistant Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, U.S. Capitol, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: As Congress begins debate on managed \n     care reform legislation, we would like to emphasize our \n     confidence in states' achievements in managed care and ask \n     that any legislation you consider preserve state authority \n     and innovation. We applaud the Republican Leadership's \n     efforts to complement the states' reforms by expanding \n     managed care protections to self-insured plans without \n     preempting state authority.\n       Historically, regulating private insurance has been the \n     responsibility of the states. Many, if not all of the ideas \n     under consideration now in Congress, have been considered by \n     states. Because the saturation of managed care is different \n     throughout the nation, each state has its own unique issues \n     relative to its market place. We have concerns about the \n     unintended consequences of imposing one-size-fits-all \n     standards on states which could result in increasing the \n     number of uninsured and increasing health care costs.\n       As Governors, we have taken the reports of abuses in \n     managed care seriously and have addressed specific areas of \n     importance to our citizens. As you know, some analysts \n     estimate that private health insurance premiums could grow \n     from the current 6 percent to double-digit increases later \n     this year. This does not include the costs of any new federal \n     mandates. Health resources are limited.\n       We hope the Congress' well-intended efforts take into \n     account the states' successful and historical role in \n     regulating health insurance.\n           Sincerely,\n     Frank Keating,\n       Governor of Oklahoma, Chairman.\n     Ed Schafer,\n       Governor of North Dakota, Vice Chairman.\n     Don Sundquist,\n       Governor of Tennessee, Chairman, RGA Health Care Issue \n     Team.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. I want to be clear. The Governors do not want us \nmicromanaging their health care. The Governors, frankly, do not want us \ndriving up health care costs. The Governors do not want to have a bill \nthat is not really for patients rights, but rather for trial lawyers' \nrights. It would be great for lawsuits, but it would be terrible for \nhealth care. It basically would have people dropping health care all \nacross the country because, not only do you sue HMOs, but you sue \nemployers as well. Maybe many people have missed that part of the \ndebate.\n  The Kennedy bill says, let's sue employers. If your health care is \nnot good enough, sue your employers. The employers say: We do not have \nto provide health care; we are going to drop it. Employees, I hope you \ntake care of it on your own. If you want to increase the number of \nuninsured, pass the Kennedy bill. This amendment would strike the \nprovision. I think it would be very positive for health care in \nAmerica.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield, off the bill, to the Senator from Pennsylvania, 3 \nminutes.\n\n[[Page S8549]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 3 minutes \noff the bill.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I thank the Senator from New \nHampshire. Many have said that you cannot sue your HMO. There are three \nFederal Circuit Court cases and 12 Federal District Court cases that \nhave said ERISA does not preempt State law when you want to sue your \nHMO for malpractice.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this list printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n          ERISA Is Not a Barrier to HMO Malpractice Liability\n\n       The key argument made time and again by sponsors of the \n     Kennedy unfunded mandates bill is that we need expanded \n     liability because managed care companies are shielded from \n     being held accountable for malpractice by the federal ERISA \n     (Employee Retirement Income Security Act).\n       The fact is that in at least 15 cases since 1995, federal \n     circuit and district courts have ruled that ERISA does not \n     shield an HMO from being sued for medical malpractice.\n     Federal circuit court\n       In Dukes (1995), the third circuit court held that ERISA \n     did not preempt Pennsylvania state law on medical negligence \n     action involving an HMO.\n       In Pacificare (1995), the tenth circuit court held that \n     ERISA did not preempt Oklahoma state law, stating, ``just as \n     ERISA does not preempt the malpractice claims against the \n     doctor, it should not preempt the vicarious liability claim \n     against the HMO . . .''\n       In Rice (1995), the seventh circuit court held that ERISA \n     did not preempt Illinois state law medical malpractice \n     action.\n     Federal district court\n       In Henderson (1997), the court rejected claims of ERISA \n     preemption in a malpractice case against an HMO, its \n     hospitals, and treating professionals and settlement for $5 \n     million was reached shortly thereafter.\n       In Prihoda (1996), the court held that ERISA did not \n     preempt vicarious liability of an HMO.\n       In Kampmeier (1996), the court held that ERISA did not \n     preempt Pennsylvania state law claim for medical negligence.\n       In Quellette (1996), the court held that ERISA did not \n     preempt Ohio state law claim for medical negligence.\n       In Roessert (1996), the court held that ERISA did not \n     preempt California state law for negligence.\n       In Fritts (1996), the court held that ERISA did not preempt \n     Michigan state law for medical negligence.\n       In Lancaster (1997), the court held that ERISA did not \n     preempt Virginia state law medical negligence claim.\n       In Blum (1997), the court held that ERISA did not preempt \n     Texas malpractice claim against an HMO.\n       In Edelen (1996), the court held that ERISA did not preempt \n     District of Columbia law in malpractice action against an \n     HMO.\n       In Prudential (1996), the court held that ERISA did not \n     preempt Oklahoma malpractice law in an HMO case.\n       In Ravenell (1995), the court held that ERISA did not \n     preempt Texas malpractice law in an HMO case.\n     State court decisions\n       In Pappas (1996), Pennsylvania Superior Court held that \n     medical malpractice action against an HMO was not preempted \n     by ERISA.\n       In Naseimento, Massachusetts Superior Court held that ERISA \n     did not preempt liability of an HMO, and a jury awarded $1.4 \n     million.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. So the issue is not whether you can sue your HMO. That \nis not why we are so adamantly against the provision in the Kennedy \nbill. It is not to be able to sue your HMO. I do not have any problem \nwith your being able to sue your HMO. What I do have a problem with is \nwhat this bill does; it allows you to sue your employer. It allows you \nto sue the employer for a decision made by an HMO, by an insurance \ncompany. What will that mean?\n  You heard the Senator from Oregon, who is a small business owner, \nsay--and, by the way, I have talked to dozens of employers who have \nsaid this:\n  If you are going to open up the books of my corporation--I make \nwidgets or I make steel or I make desks or I make pencils--you are \ngoing to open up my books for my employees to sue me for a decision my \ninsurance company, that I hired, made. I cannot afford it. I am not in \nthe business of health care. I am not managing these health care \ndecisions. I hired someone to do that, but I am going to get sued for \ntheir decisions? Sorry, as much as I would love to provide group health \ninsurance to you, I cannot allow the corporation--our corporation, our \neffort--to be jeopardized by a decision made by someone outside of what \nI do.\n  I cannot let it happen. They will drop their insurance. I ask for 30 \nadditional seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the Senator 30 seconds.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Who will be the first person, once these employers drop \ntheir insurance as a result of this bill, to run to the Senate floor \nand say: These nasty employers, look at them; they are dropping their \ninsurance; we need the Government to take over the health care system?\n  Yes, the Senator from Massachusetts would be the first person on the \nSenate floor calling for a Government health care system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that 23 cases \nemphasizing ERISA's limitations, Federal cases from most every circuit \nplus various State courts around the country, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Court Cases Emphasizing ERISA's Limitations\n\n\n                     a. federal appellate decisions\n\n     1. Bedrick v. Travelers Insurance Company (4th Cir. 1996) 93 \n         F.3d 149\n       Ethan Bedrick was born with severe cerebral palsy and \n     required speech therapy and physical therapy to prevent \n     contraction of his muscle tissues. In April of 1993, \n     Travelers Insurance Company terminated the speech therapy and \n     severely restricted physical therapy when Ethan was 14 months \n     old. When Ethan's father threatened to sue, the insurance \n     company reviewed the decision. The insurance company \n     concluded, without updating Ethan's file or consulting with \n     his physicians, that intensive physical therapy would not \n     result in what the insurance company described as \n     ``significant progress'' for Ethan.\n       In its ruling in 1996, the Fourth Circuit held that \n     Travelers' decision was arbitrary and capricious because the \n     opinions of their medical experts were unfounded and tainted \n     by conflict. The court observed that neither the insurance \n     plan nor the company's internal guidelines required \n     ``significant progress'' as a precondition to providing \n     medically necessary benefits. ``It is as important not to get \n     worse as to get better'', the court noted. The court noted \n     that ``the implication taht walking by age five. . . would \n     not be `significant progress' for this unfortunate child is \n     simply revolting.'' (page 153)\n       ERISA left the Bedricks with no remedy to compensate Ethan \n     for the developmental progress he lost during the three years \n     and more that his parents had to litigate the benefit denial \n     by Travelers. The Bedricks' state law causes of action were \n     eliminated due to ERISA.\n     2. Corcoran v. United Healthcare, Inc. (5th Cir. 1992) 965 \n         F.2d 1321\n       Mrs. Corcoran was in an employer-sponsored health plan \n     using Blue Cross as administrator and United Health Care \n     handling utilization review. Mrs. Corcoran was pregnant and \n     had a history of pregnancy-related problems. Although her own \n     doctor recommended hospitalization, United Health Care denied \n     that hospitalization was medically necessary and did not pre-\n     certify a hospital stay. Instead, 10 hours of daily in-home \n     nursing care were authorized. When the nurse was not on duty, \n     the fetus developed problems and died. The Corcorans had no \n     remedy for damages against United under ERISA. The Corcorans' \n     claim for state damages were eliminated due to ERISA.\n       The court noted: ``The result ERISA compels us to reach \n     means that the Corcorans have no remedy, state or federal, \n     for what may have been a serious mistake. This is troubling \n     for several reasons. First, it eliminates an important check \n     on the thousands of medical decisions routinely made in the \n     burgeoning utilization review system . . . Moreover, if the \n     cost of compliance with a standard of care (reflected either \n     in the cost of prevention or the cost of paying judgements) \n     need not be factored into utilization review companies' cost \n     of doing business, bad medical judgements will end up being \n     cost-free to the plans that rely on these companies to \n     contain medical costs. ERISA plans, in turn will have one \n     less incentive to seek out the companies than can deliver \n     both high quality services and reasonable prices'' (page \n     1338).\n     3. Cannon v. Group Health Services of Oklahoma, Inc. (10th \n         Cir. 1996) 77 F.3d 1270\n       Ms. Cannon was diagnosed with elobastic leukemia. She \n     received chemotherapy treatments, and her leukemia went into \n     remission. Subsequently, her insurer amended her policy to \n     state that preauthorization would be denied for an autologous \n     bone marrow treatment if sought after the first remission.\n       Ms. Cannon's doctor recommended an autologous bone marrow \n     treatment and requested preauthorization from the insurer. \n     When the insurer denied the treatment as experimental, the \n     doctors made a second request which was also denied. Through \n     persistence by the doctor and Ms. Cannon, the insurer \n     reversed its decision and authorized the treatment \n     approximately seven weeks after the first request was made. \n     It was not until 18 days after the decision to authorize the \n     treatment was made that Ms. Cannon\n\n[[Page S8550]]\n\n     learned of the reversal. Two days after notification, she was \n     admitted to the hospital and died the following month.\n       Ms. Cannon's surviving spouse brought several state law \n     claims. The court held that the state law causes of action \n     were preempted due to ERISA and that there was no remedy \n     under ERISA for the delay in receiving the authorization. The \n     court apologized for the result and wrote ``although we are \n     moved by the tragic circumstances of this case and the \n     seemingly needless loss of life that resulted, we conclude \n     the law gives us no choice but to affirm'' (page 1271).\n     4. Jass v. Prudential Health Care Plan, Inc. (7th Cir. 1996) \n         88 F.3d 1482\n       Ms. Jass was in an employer-sponsored health plan using \n     Prudential Health Care Plan to administer the plan. She had \n     complete knee replacement surgery. A utilization review \n     administrator for Prudential determined that it was not \n     necessary for Ms. Jass to receive a course of physical \n     therapy following the surgery to rehabilitate the knee.\n       Ms. Jass claimed that her discharge from the hospital was \n     premature since she had not received required rehabilitation \n     and she had permanent injury to her knee.\n       Ms. Jass had no damages remedy against either the \n     utilization review administrator or Prudential under ERISA. \n     The court found that ERISA preempted any state claim against \n     Prudential for vicarious liability for the doctor's alleged \n     negligence in connection with the denial of rehabilitation.\n     5. Comer v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan (9th Cir. 1994) \n         1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 27358, 1994 WL 718871\n       Although Ryan Comer had been diagnosed with an unusual form \n     of pediatric cancer, Kaiser denied coverage for high-dose \n     chemotherapy and denied authorization for an autologous bone \n     marrow transplant. Ryan subsequently died.\n       Ryan's parents' state wrongful death action was preempted \n     by ERISA. Ryan's parents had no damage remedy available to \n     them under ERISA.\n     6. Kuhl v. Lincoln National Health Plan of Kansas City, Inc. \n         (8th Cir. 1993) 999 F.2d 298\n       Mr. Kuhl had a heart attack. His doctor decided on June 20, \n     1999 that he required specialized heart surgery. Because the \n     hospitals in his town did not have the necessary equipment \n     for such surgery, the doctor arranged for the surgery to be \n     performed in St. Louis at Barnes Hospital.\n       When Barnes Hospital requested precertification for the \n     surgery, the utilization review coordinator at Mr. Kuhl's HMO \n     refused to precertify the surgery because the St. Louis \n     hospital was outside the HMO service area. Accordingly, the \n     surgery scheduled for July 6 was canceled. The HMO instead \n     sent Mr. Kuhl to another Kansas City doctor on July 6 to \n     determine whether the surgery could be performed in Kansas \n     City. That doctor agreed with the first doctor that the \n     surgery should be performed at Barnes Hospital. Two weeks \n     later, the HMO agreed to pay for surgery at Barnes Hospital. \n     By then, the surgery could not be scheduled until September.\n       When the doctor at Barnes Hospital examined Mr. Kuhl on \n     September 2, Mr. Kuhl's heart had deteriorated so much that \n     surgery was no longer a possibility. Instead, he needed a \n     heart transplant. Although the HMO refused to pay for an \n     evaluation for a heart transplant, Mr. Kuhl managed to be \n     placed on the transplant waiting list at Barnes. Mr. Kuhl \n     died waiting for a transplant.\n       The survivors of Mr. Kuhl have no damages remedy against \n     the HMO under ERISA. Mr. Kuhl's survivors' state law causes \n     of action were eliminated due to ERISA.\n     7. Spain v. Aetna Life Insurance Co. (9th Cir. 1993) 11 F.3d \n         129, cert. denied (1994)\n       Mr. Spain was diagnosed with testicular cancer. The \n     recommended course of treatment was three-part procedure \n     which had to occur in a short time period. Although Aetna \n     initially approved the treatment, Aetna withdrew its approval \n     prior to the third part of the procedure.\n       While Aetna ultimately changed its position and authorized \n     the third part of the procedure, it was not authorized until \n     it was too late to be effective. Mr. Spain died. There are no \n     damage remedies against Aetna under ERISA. Mr. Spain's \n     survivors' state law causes of action were eliminated due to \n     ERISA.\n     8. Settles v. Golden Rule Insurance Co. (10th Cir. 1991) 927 \n         F.2d 505\n       Mr. Settles was in an employee-sponsored health plan. The \n     employer paid a monthly premium to Golden Rule and the \n     employer was required to give written notice to the insurer \n     in advance of terminating Mr. Settles' coverage. On October \n     24, the insurer notified Mr. Settles by a letter that it had \n     terminated his insurance unilaterally. That same day Mr. \n     Settles suffered a heart attack and he died five days later.\n       The widow sued Golden Rule in state court alleging that the \n     death of her husband was caused proximately by the insurer's \n     unilateral decision to terminate his insurance. The court \n     ruled that ERISA preempted her state claims. ERISA does not \n     provide a damage remedy for her losses.\n\n\n                  B. Federal District Court Decisions\n\n     9. Wurzbacher v. Prudential Insurance Co. of America (E. \n         Dist. Ky. January 27, 1998)\n       Mr. Wurzbacher received monthly injections of leupron as \n     treatment for his prostate cancer. Under his retiree health \n     plan, the treatment was fully covered (paid 100% of the $500 \n     charge) and paid for. When Prudential took over as the plan \n     administrator, it changed the coverage stating the plan would \n     now only over 80% of $400 ($320) of the $500 charge for each \n     injection. Since Mr. Wurzbacher could not afford to pay the \n     additional $180, he asked his physician for alternatives. In \n     light of the aggressiveness of the cancer, the doctor said \n     the only alternative was castration. The request was approved \n     by Prudential and he was castrated.\n       When he returned home, he found a letter from Prudential \n     notifying him that it had made a mistake and that the plan \n     would pay the full $500 for the monthly leupron injection.\n       The court held that the Wurzbachers' claims for state \n     damages were eliminated due to ERISA. Neither Mr. Wurzbacher \n     nor his spouse have a damage remedy under ERISA for alleged \n     negligence by Prudential in denying the claim.\n     10. Andrews-Clarke v. Travelers Insurance Co. (D. Mass. Oct. \n         30, 1997) 21 EBC 2137, 1997 WL 677932\n       Richard Clarke's health plan covered at least one 30-day \n     inpatient rehabilitation program per year when necessary. \n     Travelers refused to approve Richard's enrollment in a 30-day \n     inpatient alcohol rehabilitation program. Instead it approved \n     two separate brief (five and eight days, respectively) \n     hospital stays. Within 24 hours after the second hospital \n     stay, Richard attempted suicide in the garage with the car \n     engine running while he consumed a combination of alcohol, \n     cocaine, and prescription drugs. His wife discovered him by \n     breaking through the garage door. Mr. Clarke was taken to the \n     hospital where he was treated for carbon monoxide poisoning.\n       At his mental commitment proceeding, the court ordered Mr. \n     Clarke to participate in a 30 day detoxification and \n     rehabilitation program following his release from the \n     hospital. Travelers ``incredibly refused'' to authorize \n     admission under his plan. Instead, for his detoxification and \n     rehabilitation, Mr. Clarke was sent to a correctional center, \n     where he was forcibly raped and sodomized by another inmate. \n     He received little therapy or treatment at the correction \n     center. Following his release, he went on a prolonged, three-\n     week drinking binge. He was hospitalized overnight with \n     respiratory failure. After his release from the hospital, he \n     began drinking again. He was found the following morning dead \n     in his car, with a garden hose running from the tailpipe into \n     the passenger compartment.\n       Mr. Clarke's widow and four minor children sued Travelers \n     and its utilization review provider under state law. ERISA \n     was held to preempt all of these and to provide no remedy. \n     The Court noted that ``the tragic events set forth in Diane \n     Andrews-Clarke's Complaint cry out for relief'' (p. 2140) and \n     ``Under traditional notions of justice, the harms alleged--if \n     true--should entitle Diane Andrews-Clarke to some legal \n     remedy on behalf of herself and her children against \n     Travelers and Greenspring. Consider just one of her claims--\n     breach of contract. This cause of action--that contractual \n     promises can be enforced in the courts--pre-dates the Magna \n     Carta'' (p. 2141).\n       But the Court also noted: ``Nevertheless, this Court has no \n     choice but of pluck David Andrews-Clarke's case out of the \n     state court in which she sought redress (and where relief to \n     other litigants is available) and then, at the behest of \n     Travelers and Greenspring, to slam the courthouse doors in \n     her face and leave her without any remedy'' (p. 2141).\n       In discussing the need for ERISA reform the Court was quite \n     clear:\n       ``This case, thus, becomes yet another illustration of the \n     glaring need for Congress to amend ERISA to account for the \n     changing realities of the modern health care system'' (pp. \n     2141-2142).\n       ``It is therefore deeply troubling that, in the health \n     insurance context, ERISA has evolved into a shield of \n     immunity which thwarts the legitimate claims of the very \n     people it was designed to protect. What went wrong?'' (p. \n     2144).\n       ``The shield of near absolute immunity now provided by \n     ERISA simply cannot be justified'' (p. 2151).\n       The Court, recognizing ``the perverse outcome generated by \n     ERISA in this particular case,'' called upon Congress for \n     reform.\n     11. Thomas-Wilson v. Keystone Health Plan East HMO (E.D. PA \n         1997) 1997 U.S. District court LEXIS 454, 1997 WL 27097\n       In May of 1995, Ms. Thomas-Wilson was diagnosed with Lyme \n     disease. She began receiving intravenous antibiotic treatment \n     on June 6, 1995, which the HMO covered. In August of that \n     year, the HMO denied continuation of that treatment. Since \n     she could not afford to pay herself for the treatments, she \n     stopped receiving them and her condition worsened. She could \n     not work or perform household duties. Her neck and back pain \n     became so severe and persistent that she needed a full-time \n     caregiver.\n       From September through December of 1995, the HMO required \n     her to undergo extensive testing to determine if she had Lyme \n     disease. In December of 1995, the HMO reinstated coverage for \n     the intravenous antibiotic treatment.\n       Ms. Thomas-Wilson filed suit alleging that she became \n     severely disabled and endured great pain, suffering, \n     depression, and changes in personality as a result of the \n     interruption of her treatment.\n       The court found that Ms. Thomas-Wilson's and her spouse's \n     state tort claims against\n\n[[Page S8551]]\n\n     the HMO were preempted by ERISA. There was no damage remedy \n     available under ERISA.\n     12. Turner v. Fallon Community Health Plan Inc. (D. Mass. \n         1997) 953 F. Supp. 419\n       Mrs. Turner's HMO refused to authorize cancer treatment. \n     She died. Mr. Turner sued his spouse's HMO for allegedly \n     causing her death by refusing to authorize treatment.\n       The court held that, even assuming there had been a \n     wrongful refusal to provide the treatment to Mrs. Turner, her \n     surviving spouse's state claims were preempted by ERISA. Mr. \n     Turner has no damage remedy available under ERISA.\n     13. Foster v. Blue cross and Blue Shield of Michigan (E.D. \n         Mich. 1997) 969 F. Supp. 1020\n       Mrs. Foster was diagnosed with breast cancer and Blue cross \n     refused to approve the treatment prescribed of high dose \n     chemotherapy with peripheral cell rescue and autologous bone \n     marrow transplantation. Because of this denial, Shelly Foster \n     did not receive the treatment and died. The court, noting \n     that this was a ``harsh result,'' held that the claims of her \n     spouse for breach of contract, bad faith and infliction of \n     emotional distress, negligent misrepresentation and fraud, \n     and wrongful death, as well as any claim under the Michigan \n     civil rights statute, were all preempted by ERISA. Mr. Foster \n     had no damage remedy under ERISA.\n     14. Smith v. Prudential Health care Plan, Inc. (E.D. Pa. \n         1997) 1997 WL 587340\n       Mr. Smith's contract with Prudential through the PAA Trust \n     required pre-authorization for medical treatment before \n     insurance coverage would be provided. After Mr. Smith injured \n     his leg in an automobile accident on January 18, 1995, he \n     needed surgery to reduce his heelbone. When no doctor \n     participating in the Prudential HMO was available, Mr. Smith \n     found a qualified out-of-network doctor to perform the \n     surgery. Prudential would not authorize the surgery since \n     ``surgical correction is no longer possible.'' Mr. Smith \n     filed a state action for breach of contract, negligence, and \n     negligent performance of contract. The court ruled that \n     plaintiff's claims were preempted by ERISA. Mr. Smith has no \n     remedy under ERISA.\n     15. Udoni v. The Department Store Division of Dayton Hudson \n         Corporation (N.D. Ill. 1996) 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8282, \n         1996 WL 332717\n       Mrs. Udoni's bone deterioration in her facial bones, caused \n     by osteoporosis, prevented her from eating food. Her bone \n     deterioration caused numerous other problems. Her doctors had \n     to replace her facial bones with bones from her hip.\n       Under Mrs. Udoni's medical plan, medical conditions were \n     fully covered but treatments to correct conditions of the \n     teeth, mouth, jaw joints were excluded. The plan's \n     administrator classified Mrs. Udoni's operation as ``dental'' \n     and denied coverage for surgery.\n       The court ruled the interpretation of the plan was \n     arbitrary and capricious. The physicians had provided \n     evidence repeatedly explaining the medical necessity and \n     classification of her specific surgery. Recognizing that to \n     remand the case to the administrator would be futile in light \n     of its ``continued refusals to consider (or even acknowledge) \n     substantial evidence of the merits'' of Mrs. Udoni's claim, a \n     bench trial was scheduled.\n       ERISA provides no remedy for complications resulting from \n     the deterioration in Mrs. Udoni's physical condition during \n     the coverage disputes. Mrs. Udoni's claim for damages arising \n     from improper denial of benefits were eliminated under ERISA.\n     16. Bailey-Gates v. Aetna Life Insurance Co. (D. Conn. 1994) \n         890 F.Supp. 73\n       Mr. Bailey-Gates was hospitalized in May of 1991 for \n     physical and mental disorders. A managed care nurse for Aetna \n     ordered him released on June 18, 1991. He was released on \n     June 25 and less than two weeks later, on July 4, 1991, he \n     committed suicide.\n       His survivors sued Aetna for negligently releasing him \n     while he was still in need of hospitalization for his \n     disorders. The court ruled that ERISA preempted his \n     survivors' state claims. Mr. Bailey-Gates' survivors have no \n     damage remedy under ERISA.\n     17. Gardner v. Capital Blue Cross (M.D. Penn. 1994) 859 \n         F.Supp. 145\n       Although Ms. Wileman's tumor from her peripheral \n     neuroectodermal cancer was reduced by 70% from chemotherapy, \n     only a bone marrow transplant could possibly eliminate the \n     cancer. Blue Cross initially denied the request and refused \n     to pre-certify the procedure. Blue Cross reconsidered and \n     agreed to pay for the bone marrow transplant after it heard \n     from Ms. Wileman's lawyer and the Pennsylvania Insurance \n     Department.\n       Ms. Wileman's condition worsened sufficiently during the \n     delay following the denial. Her doctors decided she was too \n     weak to undergo the bone marrow transplant when they were \n     preparing for the transplant in June of 1993. In September of \n     1993, Ms. Wileman died.\n       The court held that ERISA preempted her survivors' state \n     negligence claims against the HMO. Her survivors have no \n     damage remedy under ERISA.\n     18. Nealy v. U.S. Healthcare HMO (S.D. N.Y. 1994) 844 F. \n         Supp. 966\n       Mr. Nealy had been treated by his doctor for an anginal \n     condition. The HMO had assured Mr. Nealy that he could \n     continue the care he was receiving for his pre-existing \n     condition and be treated by the doctors he had been seeing.\n       After Mr. Nealy enrolled in the HMO, he was not issued an \n     identification card. One week after first seeking an \n     appointment, Mr. Nealy was examined on April 9, 1992, by a \n     primary care physician who refused to refer Mr. Nealy to his \n     former cardiologist. The HMO explained its refusal in an \n     April 29, 1992 letter saying it had its own participating \n     cardiologists. On May 15, 1992, the primary care physician \n     authorized Mr. Nealy to see a cardiologist on May 19, 1992. \n     Mr. Nealy suffered a massive heart attack on May 18, 1992 and \n     died.\n       The court ruled that Mr. Nealy's surviving spouse's state \n     claims were preempted due to ERISA. Mrs. Nealy has no claim \n     for damages under ERISA.\n     19. Dearmas v. Av-Med, Inc. (S.D. Fla. 1993) 814 F. Supp. \n         1103\n       Ms. Dearmas was injured in an automobile accident, and she \n     was transferred to four different hospitals in three days by \n     her HMO based on the availability of providers participating \n     in her plan at those facilities. As a result of those \n     transfers, as well as other delays in her treatment, she \n     alleged irreversible neurological damage.\n       The court held that ERISA preempted her state negligence \n     claims against the HMO. Ms. Dearmas has no claim for damages \n     under ERISA.\n     20. Pomeroy v. Johns Hopkins Medical Services, Inc. (D. Md. \n         1994) 868 F. Supp. 110\n       Mr. Pomeroy required surgery for dilopia (double vision). \n     The HMO denied his claim. Five months later, in September of \n     1990, suffering from back pain and severe depression, the HMO \n     again denied treatment. After these denials, he became \n     addicted to a pain killer. When he sought treatment for the \n     addiction, the HMO once again denied his claim.\n       Mr. Pomeroy pursued his benefits under the state Health \n     Claims Arbitration Board and the HMO removed the case to \n     federal court.\n       The court dismissed with prejudice Mr. Pomeroy's state \n     claims for mental, physical and economic losses due to ERISA \n     preemption. The court also dismissed without prejudice his \n     benefit claim. Mr. Pomeroy has no claim for damages under \n     ERISA.\n     21. Kohn v. Delaware Valley HMO Inc. (E.D. Penn. 1991) 14 EBC \n         2336\n       Mr. Kohn entered outpatient drug and alcohol rehabilitation \n     in 1989. His HMO primary care physician admitted him in \n     February of 1990 into an in-patient program. When the 15 days \n     concluded, the therapist determined additional inpatient care \n     was necessary. The HMO not only refused coverage for the \n     additional inpatient care but refused to allow Mr. Kohn's \n     family to pay for that additional care. While attempting to \n     cross the railroad tracks in a drunken stupor, he was struck, \n     and killed by a train two weeks after leaving the \n     rehabilitation center.\n       The court found that ERISA preempted his survivors' claims \n     based on denial of additional treatment. The court also held \n     that a vicarious liability claim against the HMO based on \n     ostensible agency would not be preempted if the HMO doctors \n     committed malpractice. The survivors had no claim for damages \n     under ERISA.\n\n  Mr. REID. I yield the final minutes we have on this amendment to the \nSenator from Illinois, the floor leader for the Democrats.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes 24 seconds remain.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator suspend?\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. GREGG. I understand this is your last speaker. We have Senator \nDomenici, and then I will close. If Senator Domenici can go in between \nthat.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator wants Senator Domenici to go now, if Senator \nDurbin will withhold.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield 5 minutes off the bill to Senator Domenici.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Madam President, I want Senator Kennedy to know that I will not get \nred in the face today. My wife is watching, and she tells me I do \nbetter when I do not yell.\n  Looking at America today, I ask this question: Is the best way to \nresolve the problem of somebody who is a patient and sick, and the kind \nof coverage and care to which they are entitled, to give it to the \ntrial lawyers to resolve before juries in court cases?\n  I cannot believe the best we can do to arbitrate and settle these \ndisputes is to say: Let the trial court do it; let the juries do it. We \nalready know, if you are looking for an egregiously inefficient way to \nresolve disputes, use the trial lawyers and use the courts of America. \nIt just does not target the problem. It resolves issues in a very \narbitrary way.\n  I say to everybody here, I am convinced that letting the trial \nlawyers solve a medical problem is borderline useless. It will cost \nimmeasurable amounts of money because every lawsuit will be worth \nsomething and because everybody will be frightened to death to try \nsomething before a jury,\n\n[[Page S8552]]\n\nnot because they are guilty but because jurors and the trial system are \napt to award a gigantic verdict. Then every case is worth something.\n  Can we not figure out a better way than that? Whatever the arguments \nin this Chamber, the issue is: When people are covered by managed care \nor private health care, to what are they entitled?\n  It is not an issue of whether a doctor performs malpractice. That \nlitigation is wide open. It is, if they are not getting what they are \nentitled to, how do you fix that? Frankly, I believe to fix it by \nthrowing every one of those decisions into the lap of a trial lawyer \nwho can file a lawsuit is, for this enlightened America, borderline \nlunacy. For an intelligent, bright America, it is ludicrous to suggest \nthat as a way to settle disputes about coverage and quality of care.\n  Think of this: You open this up to the trial lawyers, and whatever an \nHMO or a managed care or an employer's policy provides for people is \ngoing to be in question unless the patient turns out healthy, safe, and \nsound.\n  If it turns out that they get sick or sicker, what do you think the \ncase is going to be? They should have provided a different kind of \ncare; I am in court; I am going to get an expert to say it should have \nbeen different; I am going to get a contract lawyer, an expert, to read \ninto this contract what they think I should have.\n  Then they are liable for wrongful death, they are liable for any kind \nof illness, because the patient did not get well.\n  Frankly, I believe that is a giant mistake, and everybody should \nunderstand we are adding billions of dollars to the cost of health care \nthrough this and maybe will not get the kind of relief the people need.\n  Whatever the Republicans' final package is, I hope and pray that as \npart of the external review process we put in something that is very \ntough on HMOs and managed care and other policies, that they will \nprovide what an independent medical expert says they are supposed to \ndo, and it will force them to do it, not in a jury trial but in the \nprocess run by the States and their policymakers and insurance \ncarriers.\n  Do we want the final decision as to the kind of coverage, the \npropriety of what was given to patients, to be decided by jurors in a \ncourtroom with monstrous liability attached to it, or do we want it to \nbe done by an expert as part of a review process with short timeframes \nand mandatory performance when they make a decision as to what they are \nentitled to?\n\n  I believe an enlightened America should opt for the latter. I do not \nbelieve an enlightened America should even consider having contract \ndisputes of this type determined by trial lawyers in courtrooms by \njurors.\n  Which do we want? Do we want health care or do we want a jury \nverdict? Do we want health care as it should be or do we want a trial \nin the courts of this country? I choose the former, and you can do it \nwithout putting these issues into the courts of America, Federal or \nState.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the remaining time to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me say at the outset that the Senator from Pennsylvania misstated \nthis amendment. This amendment says an employer can be held liable only \nwhen that employer uses his discretionary authority to make a decision \non a claim. If a decision is made by an insurance company hired by the \nemployer, the employer cannot be held liable. That is what this \nlanguage says clearly.\n  Is there a time when an employer could be held liable? We found two \ncases. You decide whether they should be brought into court.\n  The employer collected the premiums from the employee and did not \nturn them in to the insurance company. When the employee had a claim, \nthe insurance company said: You are not on the books.\n  In the second situation, the employee was a full-time employee and \nhad worked 9 months at this firm. He filed a claim with the health \ninsurance company. The insurance company said: No; we see you as a \npart-time employee. It is a dispute over part-time/full-time.\n  Those are two instances under law where employers are brought into \ncourt. Employers do not make these medical decisions. They would not be \nsubject to this lawsuit.\n  Please bear with me for a minute. This is the most important \namendment we will consider on this bill.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire corrected me. He is right. It does not \nkeep 123 million Americans out of court. It keeps 120 million Americans \nout of court. I stand corrected, I say to the Senator. He is right. It \nis only 120 million Americans and their families who will be denied a \nday in court by the Republican amendment, an amendment which is a \nFederal prohibition against State lawsuits against health insurance \ncompanies.\n  Across the street at the Supreme Court building, you will find the \nphrase, ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' This amendment says to that \nphrase: Denied; denied. Equal justice under law is denied for those \nfamilies who want to take health insurance companies into court and \nhold them accountable for their wrong decisions.\n  The Senator from New Mexico said: What are we doing taking contract \nquestions into courts? I do not know where that Senator went to law \nschool, and I do not know whether he follows law and order in other \nprograms, but that is what courts do. Courts decide questions like \ncontract coverage. That is part of the law of the land for every \nbusiness in America, except health insurance companies.\n  The Republicans have come forward with this amendment, an amendment \nwhich the insurance industry wants dearly so that they cannot be held \naccountable in court. What this means is that families across America, \nwhen decisions are made, life-or-death decisions, will not have their \nday in court. The Republicans want to continue to prohibit American \nfamilies from holding these health insurance companies accountable for \ntheir bad decisions.\n  From USA Today: The central question is, Should HMOs, which often \nmake life or death decisions about a treatment, be legally accountable \nwhen their decisions are tragically wrong? Right now the answer is no.\n  If we pass the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights, finally the \ncourthouse doors will open to families across America. If the \nRepublicans and the insurance industry prevail on this amendment, those \ndoors are slammed shut. What will that mean? It will mean not just \nfewer verdicts, not just fewer settlements, but the continued attitude \nof this health insurance industry that they are held unaccountable, \nthey cannot be held accountable to anyone. They will make decisions--\nlife and death decisions--for you and your family and never face the \nprospect of going to court.\n  This is an internal memorandum from an HMO. This memorandum says it \nas clearly as can be. What they conclude is: Stick with the current law \nthat keeps us out of court. This gentleman, who is in charge of \nmanagement, said: We identified 12 cases where our HMO had to pay out \n$7.8 million. If we had it under the ERISA provisions that the \nRepublicans want to protect, we would have paid between zero and \n$500,000 to those 12 families.\n  This is what it is all about. Someone who is maimed, someone who \nloses their life, their family goes to court and asks for justice. \nEqual justice under the law, that is all we are asking for.\n  The Republican majority and the insurance industry do not want to \ngive American families that opportunity.\n  Vote to make sure we have equal justice under the law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield myself 5 minutes off the bill. I will be the last \nspeaker, so Members can understand there will be a vote in about 5 \nminutes--two votes. I stand corrected.\n  There have been a lot of representations in this argument in the last \nhour and a half or so. Let me make a couple points.\n  First off, once again, the Senator from Illinois cites the wrong \nnumber of people covered by this proposal. That does not really go to \nthe core of the issue, but it should be clarified. The Senator from New \nJersey said there are only two classes of people who are covered by \nthis type of situation, diplomats and insurance companies. Actually \nSenators and members of the Government are covered in the same way.\n\n[[Page S8553]]\n\n In fact, it was an OPM directive from the Clinton administration on \nApril 5, 1996. I will simply quote from it. It says:\n\n       Legal actions to review actions by OPM involving such \n     denials of health benefits must be brought against OPM and \n     not against the carrier or the carrier subcontractor.\n\n  It further states those actions can only be for certain limited \namounts of recovery. So essentially we are tracking that proposal which \nis what Senators are presently covered by.\n  Also, the Senator from Massachusetts said--and this point was made by \nthe Senator from Washington--that, yes, our proposals cost $13 billion \nand, yes, your proposals cost billions of dollars.\n  But there is a little bit of difference. We cut taxes. We give people \nassets. We put money in their pockets. We say to your folks: You can go \nout and use that money to benefit your family. Your proposals increase \nthe cost of premiums and drive people out of the health care system and \ncreate more uninsured people. There is a fairly significant difference \nbetween the two cost functions of these two bills.\n  But this amendment goes to the fact that the proposal from the other \nside of the aisle essentially dramatically expands the number of \nlawsuits which will be brought in the United States, lawsuits which \nwill be brought in all these different areas by aggressive and creative \nattorneys, lawsuits which today and under our bill would be settled \nunder a procedure which is reasonable, which has independent doctors \nlooking at the issue. Those decisions, by doctors who are independently \nchosen by independent authorities, are binding, binding on the health \ncare provider group.\n  So we take out all these lawyers, all these attorneys. I think of \nthis one procedure I cited before where you have literally 137 doctors \ntalking about 82 different ways to treat one different type of health \ncomplication. That can be multiplied by thousands, if not millions, \ngiving literally millions upon millions of opportunities for attorneys \nto bring lawsuits because one doctor shows treatment A and another \ndoctor chose treatment A-82 or B-82.\n  The fact is the decision should not be made by an attorney. That \ndecision should be made by an outside doctor who has independence, who \nis chosen by an independent group, and who has binding authority.\n  The end product of this bill will be to create a lot of new attorneys \nin this country having a lot of new opportunities to bring a lot of new \nlawsuits. In fact, there has been an lot of hyperbole on this floor. I \nwant to put it in perspective. It might be hyperbole, but it is still \nfairly accurate.\n  There is a show on Saturday morning that I enjoy listening to on \nNational Public Radio. Some may be surprised that I enjoy listening to \nNational Public Radio, but I do. The show is called ``Car Talk.'' In \n``Car Talk,'' there is a law firm in Cambridge, MA. I know it is \neuphemistic, but they call them, so far: Dewey, Cheatum & Howe? They \nrepresent the folks on ``Car Talk.'' Their offices are somewhere in \nCambridge in Car Talk Plaza, and they represent the Tappet Brothers. \nToday I think they have three attorneys: Dewey, Cheatum & Howe.\n\n  If this bill is passed, Dewey, Cheatum & Howe are going to have to \nbuild a new building in Cambridge, and they are going to have all these \nattorneys working for them because that is how many people will be \nneeded to bring all the lawsuits that are going to be proposed under \nthis bill as a result of its expansion.\n  What is the serious, ultimate outcome of this? It drives up costs. \nThat is the serious ultimate outcome. It was almost treated as if that \nwas an irrelevancy by one of the other speakers. Well, 1.4 percent of \nthe premiums are going to go up. That does not mean anything? I say 1.4 \npercent translates into 600,000 people.\n  There have been a lot of pictures brought to the floor about people \nwho have not gotten adequate health care, and I am sure their stories \nare compelling. But this floor would be filled if we put up the 600,000 \npictures of people who will lose their health care insurance--filled \nright up to the ceiling by people who no longer have health care \ninsurance as a result of all these lawsuits driving up all these costs \nfor health care.\n  As the Senator from Pennsylvania pointed out, what will be the \noutcome of that? What will be the outcome of all these people being put \nout of their health care insurance because the cost has gone up so \nmuch? These are CBO's estimates, not mine. It will be that somebody \nwill come to the floor from the other side of the aisle saying: We have \nto nationalize the whole system in order to take care of all the \nuninsured we just created by creating all these lawsuits for all these \nattorneys to pursue. What a disingenuous approach to health care, in my \nopinion.\n  The Republican plan has a constructive way to approach this. It \nleaves the decision of care to the patient, to be reviewed by a doctor, \nwho is independently chosen, who is in the specialty where the patient \nneeds the care. That decision is binding, binding on the health care \nprovider.\n  I hope Senators will join me in supporting my amendment which voids \nthe language which expands the lawyers' part of this bill.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, for the information of all Senators, I \nthink we are ready to vote on the Gregg amendment, which strikes the \nliability provision. I also notify Senators that immediately following \nthat vote, there will be a vote on the first-degree amendment, the \namendment offered by Senator Collins dealing with long-term care \ndeductibility and also dealing with ER and OB/GYN and access. So that \nvote will be immediately after the Gregg amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1250. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

May we have order, Mr. President? Mr. President, the \nSenate is not in order. We have done very well during the course of the \nmorning. We have had good attention, a good exchange, and good debate. \nThis is an important amendment. If we could make sure the Senator could \nbe heard and the Senators give their full attention, we would be very \nappreciative.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Any Senators with \nconferences, please take them off the floor. Staff will take their \nconferences off the floor.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1251 to Amendment No. 1232\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the imposition of gag rules, improper financial \nincentives, or inappropriate retaliation for health care providers; to \n prohibit discrimination against health care professionals; to provide \n for point of service coverage; and, to provide for the establishment \n              and operation of health insurance ombudsmen)\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon (Mr. Wyden), for himself, Mr. Reed, \n     Mr. Harkin, Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. Bingaman, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1251 to amendment No. 1232.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator is yielded 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, very much.\n  Mr. President and colleagues, I offer this amendment with a number of \nour colleagues to protect the relationship between health professionals \nand their patients.\n  What this amendment is all about is essentially ensuring that \npatients can get all the facts and all of the information about \nessential health care services for them and their families.\n  If ever there was an amendment that does not constitute HMO bashing, \nthis would be it.\n  I don't see how in the world you can make an argument for saying that \nin the United States at the end of the century, when doctors sit down \nwith their patients and their families, the doctors have to keep the \npatients in the dark with respect to essential services and treatment \noptions for them.\n  Unfortunately, that is what has taken place. They are known as ``gag \nclauses.''\n  They are chilling the relationship between doctor and patient, and \nthey are at the heart of what I seek to do in this amendment with my \ncolleagues.\n  I think Members of this body can disagree on a variety of issues with \nrespect to managed care. I have the highest concentration of older \npeople in managed care in my hometown in the United States. Sixty \npercent of the older people in my hometown are in managed care \nprograms. We need this legislation, but at the same time we have a fair \namount of good managed care.\n  But today we are saying even though Members of the Senate will have \ndifferences of opinion, for example, on the role of government and \nhealth care, we will have differences of opinion with respect to the \nrole of tax policy in American health care.\n  If you vote for this amendment, you say we are going to make clear \nthat all across this country, in every community, when doctors sit down \nwith their patients and their families, they will be told about all of \ntheir options--all of their options, and not just the ones that are \ninexpensive, not just the ones that perhaps a particular health plan \ndesires to offer, but all of the options.\n  It doesn't mean the health plan is going to have to pay for \neverything. It means the patients won't be in the dark.\n  By the way, when I talked to the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts shortly after coming to the Senate, a majority of Members \nof this body said these gag clauses should not be a part of American \nhealth care.\n  Let's differ on a variety of issues--the role of government, the role \nof taxes--but let's not say, as we move into the next century in the \nera of the Internet and the opportunity to get information, that the \none place in America where you keep patients in the dark would be when \nthey sit down with their provider and cannot be told all the options.\n  There are other important parts of this amendment. One that \ncomplements the bar on gag clauses, in my view, is the provision that \nmakes sure providers would be free from retaliation when they provide \ninformation to their patients, when they advocate for their patients.\n\n  This amendment is about protecting the relationship between patients \nand their health care providers. If ever there was something that \nclearly did not constitute HMO bashing, it is this particular \namendment.\n  Unfortunately, across this country we have seen concrete examples of \nwhy this legislation is needed; why, in fact, we do have these \nrestrictions on what forces health care professionals to stay in line \nrather than tell their patients what the options are with respect to \ntheir health care. We have seen retaliation against health care workers \nwho are trying to do their job.\n  It strikes me as almost incomprehensible that a Senator would oppose \neither of these key provisions. What Member of the Senate can justify \nkeeping their constituents in the dark with respect to information \nabout health care services? I don't see how any Member of the Senate \ncan defend gag clauses. That is what Senators who oppose this amendment \nare doing. This amendment says to patients across America that they \nwill be able to get the facts about health care services.\n  We talked yesterday about costs to health care plans. What are the \ncosts associated with giving patients and families information? That is \nwhat this legislation does. In addition, it says when providers supply \nthat information, plans cannot retaliate against providers for making \nsure that consumers and families are not in the dark.\n  We have seen instances of that kind of retaliation. It strikes me \nthat it goes right to the heart of the doctor-patient relationship if \nwe bar these plans from making sure patients can get the truth. It goes \nright to the heart of the doctor-patient relationship if providers are \nretaliated against, as we have seen in a variety of communities.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The argument on the other side will be, Republicans will \nsay: We ban the actual gagging of a doctor.\n  The real distinction between the amendment of the Senator from Oregon \nand the Republican amendment is that this amendment ensures the doctor \nwill not risk his job if he advocates. He might be able to tell the \npatient they need a particular process, the doctor will be permitted to \nrelay that information, but then he can be fired under the Republican \nproposal.\n  Also, they will have the option of giving financial incentives for \ndoctors not to provide the best medicine.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Oregon is the only amendment that \ndoes the job.\n  Mr. WYDEN. The Senator is absolutely right. What the Senator has \npointed out is that you gut the effort to protect patients from these \ngag clauses unless you ensure that the providers are in a position to \ndo their job and not get retaliated against and not face this prospect \nof getting financial incentives when they do their job.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely right. We are making \nsure that providers can be straight with their patients. We are \nactually giving them the chance to carry out that antigag clause effort \nby making sure they will not be retaliated against and by making sure \nthey will not face the prospect of their compensation in some way being \ntied to doing their job.\n\n  I am very hopeful all of our colleagues can support this amendment. \nIt tracks what the majority of the Senate is already on record in \nvoting for, the effort that the Senator from Massachusetts and I led in \nthe last Congress shortly after I came here.\n  I was director of the Gray Panthers at home in Oregon for about 7 \nyears before I came to Congress. I can see a lot of areas where \nDemocrats and Republicans have differences of opinion on\n\n[[Page S8555]]\n\nAmerican health care. There are a lot of areas where reasonable people \ncan differ. I don't see how a reasonable interpretation of what is in \nthe interest of patients and providers can allow for gag clauses and \nthen give these plans the opportunity to vitiate any effort to bar gag \nclauses by saying: If you try to be straight with your patients, we \nwill retaliate against you; we will tie your compensation to your \nkeeping these parties in the dark.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. It shouldn't be \npartisan. It doesn't constitute HMO bashing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  I strongly support the effort my friend from Oregon is making to \nensure that there is a provision in this bill that is finally passed \nprohibiting these gag provisions. I think that is very important.\n  I want to speak about a different aspect of this larger amendment. \nThis is a provision that Senator Harkin has taken the lead on, that I \nam cosponsoring with him. It deals with the problem of discrimination \nagainst nonphysician providers of health care services.\n  What am I talking about when I talk about ``discrimination against \nnonphysician providers of health care services''? I am talking about \nthe people whom everyone, on occasion, wind up going to for high-\nquality professional health care. I am talking about nurse \nanesthetists, about speech and language pathologists, nurse \npractitioners, physical therapists, nurse mid-wives, occupational \ntherapists, psychologists, optometrists, and opticians. These are \nhealth professionals who are licensed to provide particular medical \nservices.\n  All we are providing in Senator Harkin's amendment, which I \ncosponsor, is that a health maintenance organization cannot arbitrarily \nprevent a whole category of health care providers from providing that \nhealth care they are licensed and qualified to provide.\n  This is an extremely important issue for a State such as New Mexico \nwhere we have a great many rural and underserved areas. That is where \nthe impact is the greatest because we have too few physicians in my \nState. The reality is that if a person is limited in obtaining their \nhealth care from a physician, in many cases in many parts of our State \nthey either have a choice of driving a great distance or going outside \ntheir health plan and paying out of their pocket for something that \nought to be covered by the premium they are already paying.\n  It is a serious issue that needs to be addressed. In my State, the \nestimate is that we are losing 30 physicians. I believe it was 30 \nphysicians in 1 month, according to the estimate. So we have a shortage \nof physicians. We are losing many of the ones that we have. We need to \nbe sure people have access to the nonphysician health care providers \nwho are very qualified to provide some of these services.\n  Let me show a chart on one of the specialties I am talking about. \nThis is on anesthesia providers.\n  As I indicated before, nurse anesthetists are covered as one of the \ngroups of health care providers. In our State, if you want anesthesia \nservices, if you have to have anesthesia provided to you, your ability \nto get that strictly from a physician occurs in only one small area of \nour State. That is the area in blue. In all of the rest of our State, \nyou are forced to rely upon someone other than a physician to provide \nthat service.\n  All we are saying is, in the case of anesthesia services, a health \nmaintenance organization should have to allow those services to be \nprovided by another qualified person other than a physician, where that \nperson is available. This is a simple matter of fairness to patients in \nrural areas. It is something that does not involve significant costs. \nIn fact, the estimate of the Congressional Budget Office is less than \nhalf a percent change in cost over a 10-year period.\n  The reality is that many of these nonphysician health care providers \nprovide these services at a much lower cost than the physician does. \nSo, in fact, it is not a question of increasing the cost. In many \ncases, it is a question of decreasing the cost.\n  We offered this amendment in committee when this bill was considered \nin the Health and Education Committee. I offered this exact language. \nSenator Harkin did. Several of our Republican colleagues at that time \nexpressed their support--not with their votes but with their \nstatements--for providing this type of guarantee. So it is nothing \nradical. This is a simple fairness issue, and it is one that makes all \nthe sense in the world as far as the economics of health care is \nconcerned.\n  If we are really concerned about getting adequate health care to the \nrural underserved areas of our country, such as I represent in New \nMexico, such as Senator Harkin represents in his State, it is essential \nwe have this amendment as part of what we pass out of Senate.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. President Clinton, as I understand, has insisted this be \npart of the Medicare Program. So it is in the Medicare Program. Could \nthe Senator indicate to me how this is working in his own State? Is it \nworking well? It would appear to me to be a precedent for this, unlike \nother public policy issues, and it appears we have a pretty good pilot \nprogram--more than a pilot program. Perhaps the Senator would share \nwith us his experience.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator for that question. It is an \nextremely good point. This is the nondiscrimination requirement that \nwas put into the Balanced Budget Act in addition to Medicare.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield another minute.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator. In relation to Medicare managed \ncare plans, and in relation to Medicaid, it has worked extremely well \nin those cases. As far as I know, there has been no objection raised to \nit.\n  So I believe what has worked there makes good sense in this area as \nwell. I believe it is very important we have this provision included in \nthe bill we finally pass.\n  One other example. In my State, certified registered nurse \nanesthetists are the sole anesthesia providers for 65 percent of our \nrural hospitals. If our rural hospitals are going to continue to \nfunction, as they must, then we need to be sure the nonphysician \nproviders who are able to provide services in these smaller communities \nare able to do so and be compensated through these health maintenance \norganizations.\n  I think this is an important provision. I hope very much Senators \nsupport it and we can get this adopted as part of a bill we finally \npass.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the minority yields 6 minutes to the junior \nSenator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I join my friend and colleague from New \nMexico. Together, we are cosponsoring this very important, vital \namendment.\n  Again, I will repeat some of what the Senator said. The most \nimportant thing I heard him say was, in the State of New Mexico, only \n65 percent of the State has nurses that provide anesthesiology.\n  I have a map of my State of Iowa. There are a lot of different colors \non it, and I will not go into all the explanation, but the reality is, \nthe vast majority of the State of Iowa only has certified nurse \nanesthetists to provide services to all of the State of Iowa. We have a \nfew counties, about nine or 10, that have doctors, MDs. The rest are \nregistered nurses. That is all. So someone up here in northwest Iowa or \nsouthwest Iowa, someplace up in this area, would have to drive hundreds \nof miles just to access an MD who is an anesthetist.\n  Here is a letter from Preferred Community Choice PPO. I will not read \nthe whole thing. It says:\n\n       At this time, participation is limited to MD and DO degrees \n     only.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the entire letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                Preferred CommunityChoice PPO,\n\n                               Mountainview, AR, November 1, 1995.\n       Greetings: Thank you for recent inquiry regarding \n     participation in our network of\n\n[[Page S8556]]\n\n     providers. At this time, participation is limited to MD and \n     DO degrees only. We have created a file for interested \n     providers who fall outside of these two categories. Should we \n     expand the network in the future, we will use the information \n     that you have provided for future contact. We appreciate your \n     interest in Preferred CommunityChoice.\n\n                                               Michael H. Kaufman,\n                                               Provider Relations.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is what we are trying to get over with our \namendment. As the Senator from New Mexico pointed out, this would cover \nsuch things as physician assistants, nurse practitioners, \npsychologists, optometrists, chiropractors, et cetera. This is not an \n``any willing provider'' amendment. We are not saying that. We are not \nsaying that we require a plan to open up to any provider who wants to \njoin. We are simply saying a health plan cannot arbitrarily exclude a \nhealth care professional based on his or her license. That is all we \nare saying: They cannot do it based upon licensure.\n  Second, this provision does not require health plans to provide any \nnew benefits or services. It just says, if a particular benefit is \ncovered and there is more than one type of provider that can provide a \nservice under their State license or certification, the health plan \ncannot arbitrarily exclude this class of providers. For example, if a \nplan offers coverage for the treatment of back pain, it cannot exclude \nState-licensed chiropractors.\n  Third, and I want to make this point very clearly, this provision \nwould not expand or modify State scope-of-practice laws. Decisions \nabout which providers can provide which services are left where they \nbelong: to the States.\n  Again, I just want to remind everyone, this Congress supported this \nconcept when we passed provider nondiscrimination language as part of \nthe Balanced Budget Act for Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Senator \nfrom Massachusetts made an inquiry. He said: How is this working? I can \ntell you, it is working great in my State for elderly people under \nMedicare because now a lot of elderly people, who live in sparsely \npopulated areas of my State, can access, for example, for back pain, \nchiropractors. They can access nurse practitioners, physician's \nassistants, a whole host of different providers under Medicare who are \nlicensed by the State of Iowa. That is what our amendment does.\n  Again, I have to ask, if people in these programs, people in Medicare \nand Medicaid, have the right to choose their provider, should not all \nAmericans?\n  That is why this is a very simple and straightforward amendment. \nThirty-eight States have recognized the need for this provision by \npassing similar legislation. Thirty-eight States have passed \nlegislation providing that people can have their choice of providers as \nlong as they are licensed or certified by the State.\n  You might say, why would we do it here if 38 States already cover it? \nThe problem is, the State laws do not apply to the 48 million Americans \nwho are in self-funded ERISA plans. That is the problem. That is the \nloophole we are plugging.\n  This provision is critically important for those who live in rural \nareas; those who do not have access to an MD or a DO; those who rely \nupon others who have State licensure or State certification to provide \nthe kind of medical services they need.\n  In our amendment, the amendment by the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. \nBingaman, and me, we are basically saying we want to give people a \nlittle more power, to empower them a little more, and to provide \nfreedom of choice for the American consumers. It is very simple. This \nprovision says a managed care plan cannot arbitrarily exclude a health \ncare professional on the basis of the license or the certification.\n  It is a simple and straightforward amendment. It has broad-based \nsupport. I have a list of all the different associations supporting it. \nI would point out the broad-based support that it indeed does have, by \neverything from the American Academy of Physician's Assistants, nurse \nanesthetists, chiropractors, nurse midwives, the American Dental \nAssociation, American Nurses Association, Occupational Therapy \nAssociation of America, the American Optometric Association, the \nPhysical Therapy Association, Speech, Language, and Hearing \nAssociation, and the Opticians Association of America. A broad range of \nproviders support this provision.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator's 6 minutes have \nexpired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I hope at least we can support this and \nprovide our people freedom of choice.\n  Mr. REID. I yield the Senator from Rhode Island 6 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this amendment. \nThere are many very important provisions, but I want to focus on one \nprovision, and that is the creation at the State level of ombudsman \nprograms or consumer assistance centers. I have been working on this \nprovision, along with Senators Wyden and Wellstone. We introduced \nseparate legislation, and today, as part of this amendment, we are \nconsidering this very valuable and very important opportunity to \nempower consumers of health care services in this country.\n  One of the persistent themes we have heard throughout this debate is \nhow do we give consumers more leverage in the system against these huge \nHMOs, against what appears to be illogical, indifferent decisions about \nthe health of themselves and their families.\n  We rejected some proposals which I believe we should have embraced. \nFor example, we just defeated an opportunity to give people a chance, \nin extremist, to go to court if necessary. This is something that has \nbeen adopted in Texas and is working very well. If we cannot do any of \nthose things, then I think we must do at least this; and that is, to \ngive the States the incentive to develop consumer assistance centers so \nindividual health care consumers--patients--when they have frustrating \ndenials, have someplace to turn.\n  We all know, because we all listen to our constituents, that every \nday there are complaints about the inability to get straight answers \nfrom their HMO, of the inability to get coverage, the inability to get \nwhat you paid for. Where do they turn? Too many Americans cannot turn \nanywhere today. If we pass this amendment, we will give them a chance \nto turn to a consumer assistance center.\n  I will briefly outline the provisions of the legislation. We provide \nincentives to four States to set up consumer assistance centers. These \ncenters will operate as a source of information. They can give direct \nassistance in terms of advice or assistance to someone who is in a \nhealth care plan who has a question about their coverage. They will \noperate a 1-800 hotline. They will be able to make referrals to \nappropriate public and private agencies. They will not be involved in \nany type of litigation. This is not an attempt to provide an \nopportunity to recruit litigants. This is a consumer assistance center \nconcept. I hope also that these centers will educate consumers about \ntheir rights.\n  This is something that has been promoted by many different \norganizations. The President's health care advisory commission in 1997 \npointed out this is efficiency and every State, every region should \nhave these types of centers.\n  We have similar centers with respect to aging and long-term care \nombudsman programs working very well. Several States--Vermont, \nKentucky, Georgia, and Virginia--have adopted these programs because \nthey want to give a voice and give some type of power to their \nconsumers in health care. Florida and Massachusetts have programs they \nare trying to get up and running, and just a few weeks ago on this \nfloor in response to profound concerns we have about the military \nmanaged care program, the TriCare program, we adopted legislation that \nwould set in motion the creation of an ombudsman program for military \npersonnel. It is not a controversial idea. We passed this idea with \noverwhelming support.\n  This is something we can do. This is something we should do, and, \nfrankly, if we rejected all the remedies we are proposing to give to \nconsumers, we have to adopt at least this one. We have to give an \nincentive to States for working through not-for-profit agencies to set \nup these consumer assistance programs. Frankly, this is something that \nis long overdue, noncontroversial, and it should be done.\n\n  I see the Senator from Oregon, who has been a stalwart on this issue, \nis standing. He might have a comment.\n\n[[Page S8557]]\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate my colleague yielding. I so appreciate his \nleadership because this is a chance, with the Reed proposal, to make \nsure the consumers in this country can get what they need without \nlitigation. I hope Members of the Senate will see this ought to be the \nwave of the future. It is a revolution in the concept of consumer \nprotection because what this part of our proposal does, under the \nleadership of the Senator from Rhode Island, is essentially say: Let's \ntry to help the patients and the families early on in the process. \nLet's not let problems fester and continue and eventually result in \nhuge problems which can lead to litigation.\n  It seems to me--I want the Senator from Rhode Island to address \nthis--what he is doing is essentially changing consumer protection so \nit ought to be at the front end when problems have not become so \nserious.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I ask the Senator from Rhode Island be given 2 additional \nminutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 1 minute.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I do not think there is a good health plan in America that \ncannot support the idea of a good ombudsman program so we can solve \nproblems without litigation. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. REED. I thank my colleague from Oregon. Let me reaffirm what my \ncolleague said. This whole concept of ombudsman and consumer assistance \ncenters is designed to allow the consumer in the first few hours, or \neven minutes, when they encounter problems in the health care system, \nto get advice and assistance. This is not a theoretical concept. It \nworks already in several States.\n  California has a model program around the Sacramento area. People \nhave benefited from this. This is what we want to see in every State in \nthe country.\n  Again, if we cannot be sensitive enough to recognize the need for \nconsumer assistance early in the process, then I believe we are failing \nthe American public miserably. I hope we can embrace, support, and \nadopt this amendment, particularly this provision with respect to the \nombudsman consumer assistance program.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 4 minutes.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this \namendment. I particularly want to address the issue of financial \nincentives, which this amendment addresses, which essentially is HMOs \nand health insurance companies providing financial incentives for \nphysicians to provide less than appropriate care to limit the treatment \noptions for patients or, in the case I am about to talk about, not \ncalling in other physicians or doctors when they may be needed under \nthe circumstances.\n  This is the story of something that actually happened in North \nCarolina.\n  A young mother was in labor. During the course of her labor, she was \nbeing overseen by an obstetrician/gynecologist who was responsible for \nher care. Unfortunately, this single OB/GYN was responsible for the \ncare of a number of mothers in labor on this night.\n  During the course of the evening and the morning, the mother \ndeveloped severe complications with her labor. There were clear signs \nthe baby was in serious trouble and was having trouble getting oxygen \nand needed to be delivered. Something needed to be done immediately. \nThe nurses taking care of this mother did exactly what good nurses \nwould do under the circumstances: They paged the doctor. They called \nthe doctor who was on call. They could not get him there. They had no \nunderstanding of why he was not responding to the call. They notified, \nby way of the call, that it was an emergency situation. Still no \nresponse.\n  More and more time was passing when the child within the mother's \nwomb was not receiving the oxygen it needed and continued to suffer \ninjury and damage.\n  Finally, the doctor appeared and delivered the baby by cesarean \nsection. Unfortunately for this child and the family, it was too late. \nThe child suffered severe and serious permanent brain injury. The child \nhas severe cerebral palsy and, essentially, will require extensive \nmedical care for the course of its life.\n  Later we learned that what happened was the physician who was in \ncharge of this patient's care had a financial incentive, because of his \ncontract with the HMO, not to call in additional physicians. In other \nwords, he was rewarded where, on a consistent basis, he did not call in \nbackup help--even though in this situation he was taking care of too \nmany patients, too many mothers.\n  There was an emergency, and the bottom line is this: Because of a \nfinancial incentive, an insurance HMO credit with its doctor, we have a \nyoung child who will have cerebral palsy for the rest of his life. This \nis the kind of thing that should not happen in America. This is what \nthis amendment addresses. It specifically deals with the issue of \nfinancial incentives in a thoughtful, intelligent way, limiting the \nfinancial incentives that can be allowed and requiring their \ndisclosure--both of which are absolutely needed and absolutely \nnecessary.\n  I might add one final thought. This child, who for the rest of his \nlife will be severely brain damaged, will require extensive medical \ncare, very expensive medical care, running in the many millions of \ndollars. His family, who are responsible for this child's care, who \nlive with this problem 24 hours a day, day in and day out, year after \nyear--this child's medical care is being paid for by Medicaid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. If I may have 30 more seconds?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the Senator 30 more seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 30 seconds.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Since this child suffers from a severe injury as a \ndirect result of an incentive that the HMO, the health insurance \ncompany, provided to the doctor, since this child suffers this severe \ninjury and will have millions of dollars of medical problems over the \ncourse of his life, the question is, Who pays for this cost? The HMO is \nnot going to pay for it. Who is going to pay for it is the taxpayers of \nAmerica, through Medicaid.\n  So the financial burden of what happened as a result of this \nfinancial incentives clause, a clause which is absolutely fundamentally \nwrong and should not be allowed, is that every American taxpayer is \nresponsible for carrying the burden of these millions of dollars in \nmedical costs.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 9 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 9 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts, the Senator from North \nCarolina, and the Senator from Oregon for their work on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. President, I say to Senator Wyden from Oregon that I did not get \na chance to hear his remarks on the floor of the Senate, but I think \nthis whole question of whether or not doctors and providers can \nadvocate for their patients and speak up when they think their patient \nis being denied care unfairly is extremely important. It is a little \nshocking, but it is really true that we all hear from doctors who tell \nus that they do not believe they can do that. They have no protection. \nThey are worried about losing their jobs.\n  So I just say that if we are about being on the side of consumers, \nwhich I think is what we are about, Senator Wyden's amendment is \nextremely important.\n  I will speak to another provision in this amendment which we actually \nhave not discussed on the floor of the Senate. Of course, my fear is \nthat Republicans will come out with a second-degree amendment and try \nto essentially wipe this amendment out. I wish--in fact, I would give \nup half of my 9 minutes if somebody from the other party would come \ndown here; I would give up 4 and a half minutes just to get their other \npoint of view, because the argument I am about to make goes as follows.\n  This is about ``points of service,'' which actually is about consumer \nchoice. What we are saying in this provision is that if you are paying \nextra or\n\n[[Page S8558]]\n\nare willing to pay a little extra, you should have the choice to be \nable to stay with your doctor, to be able to go to the clinic to which \nyou have been going.\n  For example--and this just drives people in Minnesota crazy--an \nemployer may shift a plan, and then what will happen is, even though \nyou have been taking your child or your children, or you yourself have \nbeen seeing the same doctor whom you trust, who knows you well, who \nknows your family well, all of a sudden you no longer can see them.\n  What we are saying is, don't the consumers and don't the families in \nMinnesota and Oregon and Massachusetts and Kentucky--all around the \ncountry--have some choice? My gosh, if people are willing to even pay a \nlittle extra in premium, how can anybody come out on the floor of the \nSenate and say they are not entitled to some continuity of care and \nsome choice when it comes to being able to continue to see their \ndoctor?\n  I can give a lot of examples. Let me simply go through the Republican \nproposal for a moment and then come back to some examples.\n  In the Republican proposal, only if the employer has 50 employees or \nmore is there any discussion at all about any alternatives; and even \nthere, it is two panels of providers. But two panels of providers does \nnot make for choice. And if it is under 50 employees, there is no \nchoice at all.\n  We have gone over this over and over again. For the 115 million \npeople who are excluded, they do not have any protection whatsoever.\n  So again, the clock is ticking away. But if, in fact, any Republican \nwants to come and debate me, I would be pleased to give up my 4 minutes \nor 3 minutes or whatever.\n  Again, this is about choice. We are saying is that if you and your \nfamily have been seeing a doctor and going to a clinic for 5 or 6 or 7 \nyears, if you have paid extra, and all of a sudden your employer shifts \nplans or your managed care plan narrows the number of doctors you can \nsee, you ought to be able to continue to see your doctor, you ought to \nbe able to continue to go to that clinic.\n  We have all had this experience of--well, maybe we have not; I have. \nYou go into the hospital; you put on one of those gowns. I think I \ncould become rich by coming up with an alternative gown that does not \ntie in the back, because it just makes you nervous right away; you are \nvery nervous, and you do not know what is going to happen to you.\n\n  You know what? It sure makes a difference if it is your family doctor \nwho is there with you. It sure makes a difference if you have the sense \nthat there is a doctor or a nurse or people from the clinic who have \nrecommended you need to have the surgery who are there with you, who \ncare about you, who know you, who love you.\n  I will say it again, consumer choice is what this amendment is about. \nHow can the Republicans come to the floor of the Senate with a piece of \nlegislation that they claim is patient protection and not give families \nthis choice? If a family in Minnesota wants to pay or can pay a little \nmore in premium to make sure that if their employer shifts plans they \nwill be able to stay with their family doctor, or if you are an elderly \ncitizen and you have Parkinson's you will be able to stay with your \nneurologist, or you have a child who is very ill with cancer you will \nbe able to stay with your pediatric oncologist, I would think, for gosh \nsakes, we would want to allow a family to have that choice.\n  I do not want to hear my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \ntalk about freedom of choice if they are going to come out here with a \nsecond-degree amendment that is going to wipe out this very important \nchoice that this amendment says people and families should have in our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If I only have 3 minutes left, since we are in the \nlast day of the debate, I want to try to pull this into focus, at least \nas a Senator from Minnesota.\n  I would like to say one more time, if you take, for example, this \namendment--and I do not have the time to read it, this amendment has \nthe support of the Patient Access Coalition with 134 members. Every \nkind of consumer organization, provider organization, children's \norganization, women's organization, and advocacy organization for \npeople with disabilities, all are saying: Please make sure that \nfamilies in this country have a choice and do not get cut off from \nseeing their doctor, do not get cut off from seeing a specialist who \ncan really help them. I see the same pattern in all of this. We have \nsaid we ought to cover all 165 million Americans. We shouldn't be \ncovering 43 million Americans. We ought to have some standard of \nprotection for all families in the country that States can build on. \nRepublicans say no.\n\n  We say you ought to have a guarantee of access to specialists, if you \nneed those specialists. There should be a panel in the plan. If there \nisn't a specialist in the plan to help you or a member of your family, \nyou ought to be able to go outside the plan and receive that care. \nRepublicans vote no.\n  Then we say, if you are denied care, there ought to be an appeals \nprocess. You ought to have a right to seek redress of grievance. When \nyou do that, there ought to be an independent appeals process, and \nthere ought to be some people you can go to. There ought to be some \nadvocacy for consumers. On that strong consumer protection amendment, \nRepublicans vote no and basically want to stop it.\n  I think the logic of this debate is clear. I have seen a little bit \nof confusion in a couple of articles. I do not believe this is about \nSenators who cannot sit down in the same room and agree with one \nanother, and therefore, why can't they do that. What is wrong with \nthem?\n  I think this is a very honest debate where you have two different \ndefinitions of what is good. I think we are talking about two different \nframeworks of self-interest and power. I think there is a reason that \nevery single children's consumer and provider organization has \nsupported our amendment and wants to see real patient protection. There \nis a very good reason why the insurance industry is the only interest \nthat is supporting the Republican proposal.\n  It is because the Republican Party, the other side of the aisle in \nthis debate, is marching lock, stock, and barrel with the insurance \nindustry, and we are on the side of consumers and families. As \nDemocrats, that is exactly where we should be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time as expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New \nYork.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment. It looks as if \neven this amendment will be defeated, if the past is any pattern. It is \nso minimal: the right to ombudsman, points of service, a gag rule so \nyour physician can tell you the truth, financial incentives. It is hard \nto believe this amendment is going down, but it is, and so is every \nother reasonable provision.\n  So as we come to the close of this week's debate, it is worth looking \nat what has happened in the Senate. What has happened this week can be \nsummed up in one sentence: The insurance industry won; American \nfamilies lost.\n  The insurance industry won and American families lost because the \nright to emergency room treatment at the nearest hospital is not \ngranted. The insurance industry has won and American families have lost \nbecause access to specialists is not guaranteed. The insurance industry \nhas won and American families have lost because the right to appeal an \nunfair decision by the HMO is not guaranteed. The insurance industry \nwon and American families lost because the right to sue, even the most \negregious, outrageous behavior by an HMO, is not granted.\n  The insurance industry won and American families lost because the \nright of so many women, the desire of so many women to have an OB/GYN \nas their primary care physician is not there. And most of all, the \ninsurance industry won and the American people lost, because instead of \ncovering 161 million people, we are only covering 48 million people. \nEven the minor changes that were made by those on the other side of the \naisle are underscored by these two numbers: 161/48, 161 million\n\n[[Page S8559]]\n\npeople covered by our proposal; 48 million by theirs.\n\n  What about the other 113 million? They get no rights at all.\n  I am going to make a prediction. This will not be the last time we \ntake up the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 3 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield a half minute.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator. I was just finishing my thought.\n  The mothers and fathers of America, who have been wrestling with the \nHMO bureaucracy, struggling with it, are not going to have their \nproblems solved. They will come back to us, and we will be back to pass \na better bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think we have 2\\1/2\\ minutes. How much \nremains on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifty minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will withhold the remainder of my time to respond to \nsome of the points made on the opposite side.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if I may, I ask unanimous consent that \nSofia Lidskog be granted the privilege of the floor during the duration \nof the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might take for \nsome additional views.\n  During the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee \nconsideration of S. 326, I asserted strong positions on several key \ncomponents of the managed care reform debate. These additional views \nare intended to reiterate my support for S. 326, provide the committee \nwith a cohesive explanation of my position on specific policy, and \nexpress my appreciation to the committee for reporting to the full \nSenate a good bill for health consumers.\n  S. 326 offers a series of patient protections to consumers in \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) regulated health plans. \nDirect access to OB/GYN and pediatric providers, a ban on gag clauses, \na prudent layperson standard for emergency services, a point-of-service \noption, continuity of care and access to specialists will provide \nconsumers in self-funded plans the same protections being offered to \nstate-regulated plans participants. Additionally, all ERISA regulated \nplans will be required to disclose extensive comparative information \nabout coverage, networks and cost-sharing. This requirement is \ncomplemented by the establishment of a new binding, independent \nexternal appeals process, the lynchpin of any successful consumer \nprotection effort.\n  I believe the two most contentious elements of the managed care \nreform debate are addressed favorably for consumers in S. 326. The \nfirst is holding health plans accountable for medical versus coverage \ndecisions; the second is ensuring that health plans cannot manipulate \nthe definition of ``medical necessity'' to deny patient care.\n  S. 236 does not expand the liability of ERISA plans by exposure to \nstate tort laws, which has been proposed as a way to hold health plans \naccountable for medical decisions. Rather, S. 326 gets patients the \nmedical treatment they need right away through a timely appeals \nprocess. Get the care; then worry about the problems. It doesn't \nrequire them to earn it through a lawsuit. I do understand the \nfrustration expressed by physicians who are held liable for their \nmedical decisions. It is for that very reason that the bill I support \nsecurely places the responsibility for medical decisions in the hands \nof independent medical experts. These decisions are binding on health \nplans, who run the risk of losing their accreditation, daily fines and, \nultimately, their stake in the market.\n  Likewise, the external appeals process in S. 326 prohibits plans from \nhiding behind an arbitrary definition of medical necessity to deny \ncare. S. 326 expressly establishes a standard of review, including: the \nmedial necessity and appropriateness, experimental or investigational \nnature of the coverage denial; and, any evidence-based decision making \nor clinical practice guidelines, including, but not limited to, those \nused by the health plan. This is in subtitle C. Sec. 503(e)(4). In \nother words, the independent external reviewer--required by the bill to \nhave appropriate medical expertise--will have access to the patient's \nmedical record, evidence offered by the treating physician and all \nother documents introduced during the internal review process. \nAdditionally, the reviewer will consider expert consensus and peer-\nreviewed literature, thus incorporating standards of ``medical \nnecessity'' clearly outside those prescribed by the plan. The bill also \nrequires that, during the internal appeals process, the medical \nnecessity determination is made by an independent physician with \nappropriate expertise--not by the plan.\n  Since its inception in 1974, this is the first major reform effort of \nERISA as it pertains to the regulation of group health plans. The focus \nof the mission--regardless of politics--should be to protect patients. \nProtecting patients means not only improving the quality of care but \nexpanding access to care and allowing consumers and purchasers the \nflexibility to acquire the care that best fits their needs. The \ncontention has been how to do this in the context of our health \ndelivery system. I believe S. 326 is a responsible approach to \nprotecting consumers in the managed care market.\n  While bipartisanship was in short order during committee \nconsideration of S. 326, it is my hope that through the balance of this \nprocess we will continue discussions among Members to advance needed \npatient protections without jeopardizing access to health care. While \nwe have been unable to bridge some of the partisan barriers during \nfloor consideration, I believe a better plan for health care consumers \nis being passed today.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the \ntime be charged to our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today pleased with the discussion \nand the debate which has taken place over the last 4 days, recognizing \nthat we have a number of other amendments as we go forward and \nhopefully look for a vote later today for final passage.\n  I want to mention a couple of things I haven't had the opportunity to \nspeak on earlier yet I continue to be asked about by my colleagues and \nby various people in the media and constituents continue to call about. \nOne of them has to do with an issue we debated yesterday, which will be \nvoted on at 3:30; that is, access to specialty care.\n  A number of issues have arisen. I think it is important that our \ncolleagues all understand that the Republican bill ensures access to \nspecialty care. Again, the easiest way for me to take care of that, \nwithout getting involved in a lot of the rhetoric that goes back and \nforth, is with the wording in the underlying bills that is a little bit \ndifferent. ``Specialty'' versus ``specialty care'' has all kinds of \nconnotations that allow people to confuse the issue.\n  But in section 725 of our bill, it states that plans--and I begin my \nquotation by saying--``shall'' ensure access to specialty care as \ncovered under the plan.\n  What is important is that people understand that the ultimate \ndecision of what is ``medically necessary and appropriate''--those \nexact words that are used in the various bills and amendments that have \ncome forward to ultimately decide what is ``medically necessary and \nappropriate''--ends up being with a physician who is independent of the \nplan, who is a medical expert, who is a specialist, who is appointed \nnot by the plan.\n  We have heard again and again that in some way this independent \nreviewer is tied to the plan. The words are written in the bill. I \ndon't know how much\n\n[[Page S8560]]\n\nmore we can do in terms of distancing this reviewer, this physician, \nthis independent reviewer, who is appointed by an entity, which is \nregulated by the Government, and is another sort of separation from the \nplan. This entity can be approved either by the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services or by the State or by the Federal Government. This \nentity appoints this third party reviewer who ultimately decides what \nis ``medically necessary and appropriate.''\n  When we use those words ``medically necessary and appropriate,'' \nagain and again it has come back that at least we should consider \nputting it in Federal statute and defining in Washington, DC, what \n``medically necessary and appropriate'' means.\n  I reject that, and I think we should reject that because it is \ndifficult--I think it is impossible, but I will say it is difficult--to \ndefine what is ``medically necessary and appropriate.'' To pretend that \nwe can do it on the Senate floor is misleading. In fact, many think \ntanks and many Senators, Congressmen and women have tried to do it, and \nwe haven't been able to define it in Medicare or in CHAMPUS. The \nPresident's Quality Assurance Commission was unable to define what is \n``medically necessary and appropriate.''\n  Thus, we don't attempt to define it. We say it is important, but we \nsay ultimately it has to be defined by an independent medical \nspecialist, independent of the managed care company. Then we have a \nwhole list of things that he or she has to take into consideration.\n  We continue to limit what that third party independent reviewer--he \nor she--actually considers the best practice of medicine, which is very \ndifferent, I should say, from ``generally accepted medical practices.'' \n``Generally accepted medical practices'' haven't been defined very \nwell. There is not a book of ``generally accepted medical practices.''\n  I say that because if your sick heart is not beating very well, there \nare procedures that may not be ``generally accepted'' but they can be \nlifesaving. They may not be done very much in a community. Whether you \ndo a transplant, or you put a wrap around the heart, or you take out a \nsection of it, that may not be the overall best practice, but it could \nbe ``generally accepted practice'' or ``generally accepted'' but not \nthe ``best medical practice.'' I don't want to get into writing these \ndefinitions into Federal statute.\n  The distinction that has been made in several bills when we talk \nabout ``medical necessity'' is also a very important issue because for \nthe layperson, or the patient sitting out there, you would think that \n``medical necessity'' would be easy to define. But saying what is going \non out there in the health care arena, what is the range of treatment--\nwe have seen charts on the floor that basically show that the range of \ntreatment is huge in America, charts on how to treat urinary tract \ninfections 80 different ways by 170 different physicians.\n  What that basically says is the range of treatment is huge--the \nvariety. It doesn't say whether all of those are good or whether all of \nthose are bad. But the fact that it doesn't say that and the practice \nis so wide, we don't want to make that the gold standard. If we were \ngoing to write something into Federal statute, we shouldn't say \n``generally accepted medical practices'' because in truth it takes not \nthe lowest common denominator but it takes the common denominator and \nmakes that the standard.\n  I think it is very dangerous to say ``best practices'' will be the \nstandard. That is why I don't think ``best practices'' should be \nwritten into Federal statute as the definition.\n  Why is that? It is because ``best practices'' are evolving over time. \nYes, you can have studies in the New England Journal of Medicine and in \nthe Journal of the American Medical Association of the greatest \nbreakthrough, but you can't expect that greatest breakthrough which \nmight be in truth the best practice 3 or 4 or 5 years later to \nimmediately be disseminated to hundreds of thousands of physicians the \nnext day across the United States of America.\n  I am trying to spend a little bit of time with this because I think \nit is dangerous to try to define ``medical necessity'' in Federal \nstatute. We can still use the terms. You need ``medical necessity'' in \nthere--what is ``medically necessary and appropriate''--but I don't \nthink we should. I think we are doing a disservice if we try to define \nit. I struggled. We tried in our committee and in our staff to come up \nwith a good definition. It doesn't mean that health care plans aren't \ngoing to try to define what is ``medically necessary and appropriate.''\n  The reason this bill is necessary is that some managed-care plans \nhave terrible definitions. They say what is ``medically necessary and \nappropriate.'' They might say that it is effective and that it has had \nproven efficacy in the past. But some will go so far as to say what is \nthe most efficient or what is--they don't say it this way--but what is \nthe least expensive, and once they have put it in the contract, the \npeople will come back and point to that.\n  Those are bad definitions. But that same sort of risk of writing in \nthe definition in Federal statute, again, can be very dangerous if we \nare looking for quality of care in an evolving health care marketplace.\n  The beauty of our bill is that we fix the system. We go to where the \nproblem is. We don't bring in a trial lawyer or a lottery where people \nwait 5 years on average to have a medical malpractice lawsuit.\n  I didn't participate in the earlier discussion today. But when you \nlook at medical malpractice, my experience in medicine is that when you \nlook at health care and lawyers, it is in medical malpractice. \nBasically, we know that is a very costly system. Most people just want \nto get something covered and don't know how to go out and hire a \nlawyer. Most lawyers, because they are operating on contingency fees, \naren't going to fool with the $5,000 case, or the $20,000 case, or the \n$50,000 case. They will fool with the $1 million case. Then it becomes \nvery arbitrary. You have a costly system that is an arbitrary system.\n  The third point is that it takes forever. It is a time consuming \nsystem. Earlier studies, I am sure, were quoted on the floor. The \naverage malpractice case takes 5 years before recovery is made. That is \nan average of 5 years. That means some are 6, 7, 8, or 9 years.\n  The American people want to fix the system. They want the reassurance \nthat their managed care plan is not denying coverage.\n  I yield myself 3 more minutes, and then I will yield to the Senator \nfrom Texas, if I may. I will finish this one thought.\n  What the American people want is for us to get away from this fear \nthat managed care is overriding what they or their physician, in \nconsultation with each other, think and believe is appropriate and, in \ntruth, provides good quality of care. The reason I believe we were \nstuck on this vote earlier is the American people are saying let's fix \nthe system, but let's make sure that we remove the barrier to the \ncoverage that I deserve, that I expect, and that is appropriate for me, \nand that it is delivered in a timely way.\n  That is not helped by a very expensive lawsuit which is not going to \nbe settled for about 5 years, at least in medical malpractice. It will \nnot allow a person to get coverage for that cleft lip repair of a child \nor the appendectomy or the laryngitis.\n  We want to do what is best for Americans, best for children, and \nallow that timely access of care, removing unnecessary barriers. There \nwill be certain barriers. remove the unnecessary, unjustified barriers, \nso that Americans can rest assured they can, in a timely way, receive \ngood, quality care. That is the purpose of this bill.\n  I have been pleased with our discussions. As we accept some \namendments and reject others, I know we can come up with a good bill \nlater today.\n  I yield such time as necessary to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Is it possible to have 20 minutes?\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield 20 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank Senator Frist for his leadership in this \narea. Certainly all Members look to the one doctor in our body to give \nus advice, not only on what we need to do to make patient care better \nbut to know the system well enough to know what will cause more harm \nthan good. I appreciate the steady level-headedness of\n\n[[Page S8561]]\n\nthe Senator from Tennessee. We are fortunate to have a physician in our \nmidst.\n  Our Nation has the highest quality health care anywhere in the world. \nThere is no question about that. In my home State of Texas, in our \nlargest city of Houston, the biggest employer in the whole city is the \nhealth care industry, the Texas Medical Center. It contains world-class \nhospitals, including the renowned University of Texas M.D. Anderson \nCancer Center, which is the finest cancer treatment center in the \nworld. Baylor College of Medicine, too, is a world leader in the \ntreatment of cardiovascular disease. Houston is the home of the fathers \nof modern heart surgery: Dr. Michael DeBakey and Dr. Denton Cooley.\n  In the city of Dallas, TX, the University of Texas Southwestern \nMedical School has four Nobel laureates. They are doing research that \nis changing the quality of health care for our future. They are doing \nit because we have a system that allows for the investment in research. \nIt allows for the treatment that is the best for diseases.\n  We don't want to break something that isn't broken. We don't want to \ntry to fix something that isn't broken. We want to make sure we are \ngiving better quality health care, that we are going to continue to \nhave research and be in the forefront of research and technology as we \ngo into the next millennium, trying to make sure we are doing the right \nthing.\n  There are problems. We have too many uninsured. Too rapid growth of \nHMOs and other service providers has caused some to be left behind. We \nmust address these problems. Are there problems with HMOs? Absolutely. \nDo we need to increase the number of insured Americans? Of course.\n  If the American people remember the health debate we had in 1993, \nthis Nation soundly rejected an outright Federal takeover of health \ncare. That bill went down once America realized that their doctor, \ntheir hospital, everyone involved in the health care industry in this \ncountry would have to answer to a massive bureaucracy in Washington, \nDC.\n  Under global cost limits, total health care spending in this Nation \nwould be capped by Washington. Any way you slice it, what the \nadministration offered was Government rationing of health care.\n  Today, we are considering legislation that would impose 350 new \nFederal mandates and regulations on our Nation's health care system. \nThere has been discussion about the cost of these mandates, whether \nthey will cost as much as a Big Mac or a McDonald's franchise. Either \nway, there will be increased costs, and more Americans could lose their \ninsurance.\n  Once a mandate becomes law, a Federal agency here in Washington will \nissue regulations or interpretations of that mandate. We have only to \nlook as far as the Health Care Financing Agency to see what a total \ndisregard of congressional intent can do in the health care industry. \nWhile Congress did mandate more efficiencies, they did not mandate the \ncuts that HCFA made in our hospital industry and to our health care \nproviders, such as physicians and home health care service agencies. We \ncan see what Federal control of a health care industry does by looking \nat what HCFA is doing to the health care providers in this country \ntoday.\n\n  I think we need to move very carefully into the arena of more Federal \nregulations of our health care industry. We do need to do something \nmore than we are doing right now. However, I think we need to be very \naware that we could go too far and throw out the baby with the \nbathwater.\n  I believe Democrats and Republicans want to make sure patients have \nbasic rights when they and their family members need health care. It is \nwrong for an HMO to deny coverage for medically necessary treatment. It \nis wrong to allow a patient to get lost in red tape and unnecessary \ndelays.\n  Both of our bills seek to empower patients when they are dealing with \ntheir health care industry and their insurance companies. However, \nthere are three major differences in the way in which Democrats and \nRepublicans are approaching the issue of managed care.\n  First, we believe that cost matters and that higher costs will \ntranslate into more Americans losing their coverage.\n  Second, Republicans recognize that the Federal Government and a \nFederal bureaucracy should not impose a one-size-fits-all approach to \nensuring quality care.\n  Third, we believe good health care is better than a good lawsuit.\n  With regard to costs, the Congressional Budget Office has said that \nthe Democrats' plan will cause health insurance to increase in price by \n6 percent above the current rate of inflation. By some estimates, that \ncould lead to an estimated 1.8 million Americans losing their health \ncoverage.\n  Mr. President, 1.8 million people is a city the size of Houston \nrelying on free clinics or charity coverage. That is what the Democrat \nbill will do.\n  The new mandates in the Democratic bill will also cost an estimated \n190,000 American jobs and additional out-of-pocket costs by the average \nfamily of $207 a year. This is not acceptable. The average cost per \nfamily for employer-provided health premiums has already more than \ndoubled over the last decade from $2,530 in 1988 to $5,349.\n  The provisions of the Republican bill will also cost money, but the \ntotal cost of our bill as calculated by the Congressional Budget Office \nis less than 1 percent in increased health premiums. These increases \nare more than offset by the provisions in our Patients' Bill of Rights \nPlus that will make health care more accessible and affordable for all \nAmericans.\n  For the self-employed, our approach will make 100 percent \ndeductibility of health insurance available next year--not in 5 years, \nas currently envisioned. Next year, every small business owner, every \nstay-at-home parent with their own business, will get exactly the same \ntax treatment for health insurance that corporations presently enjoy. \nThis is long overdue.\n  The bill will allow employees the so-called flex plans or cafeteria \nplans to roll over to the next year up to $500 in unused funds to \nhealth insurance premiums or other out-of-pocket health costs. Under \nthe present use-it-or-lose-it flex plans, they are not able to keep the \nmoney they have not spent. We want to encourage them not to spend money \nthey do not need to spend by allowing them to roll it over.\n\n  The second major difference between our two bills and our two \napproaches is that the Democratic plan assumes Washington knows better \nthan individuals, States, and health care providers what is in their \nbest interest. We heard so much this week about how some of the \nprovisions of the Republican bill do not apply to all private health \ncare insurance. That is true. For those health plans that are now \nregulated exclusively by the Federal Government, we ensure that \npatients have their rights, such as direct access to OB/GYNs, direct \naccess to pediatricians, access to specialists, and access to emergency \nroom care. But, for the vast majority of Americans with health care, it \nis the States that have jurisdiction over their plans. This has been \nthe case for several decades, ever since there has been health \ninsurance in our country. Since the advent of HMOs, more and more \nStates have acted to regulate managed care plans to ensure that the \nresidents of their States enjoy the same protections we are proposing \nfor the federally regulated plans. Every State in America has some \nregulation of their managed care companies today.\n  There are wide differences in approach by various States, but there \nare wide differences among the States. Why should there not be wide \ndifferences if the States are acting on behalf of their own \nconstituents, which they know better than we do? Who is to say the \npatient protections and regulations in New York are the same that the \ncitizens of Texas would want? I do not want to take responsibility for \ndeciding that New York should be doing something because Texas likes \nit.\n  The Democratic bill is too federally centered and heavyhanded in \nother areas as well. We have heard much discussion of medical \nnecessity. The Democrats say they only want to allow physicians to do \nwhat is medically necessary. That sounds fine, but what do they mean by \nmedical necessity? It goes to an agency that will have 250 pages of \nregulations about what is a medical necessity. And there we have it \nagain, one-size-fits-all.\n  By trying to do this in Federal law, the Democratic plan empowers a \nFederal Government employee to make those decisions, not your doctor \ntalking to you about your needs. Under our\n\n[[Page S8562]]\n\nsystem, we let an external review board of professionals, who are not \nassociated with the HMO, decide who is right in making the call for the \ncare. If the HMO says they are not going to cover a certain procedure, \nand the patient and the doctor decide that is not the right decision, \nthe patient can internally appeal within the HMO, within a short period \nof time, and then appeal again to an outside panel of experts not \nassociated with the HMO. That is the system we have in Texas, and it is \nworking.\n  In 1997, Texas enacted an innovative and broad set of managed care \nreforms, including a host of patients' rights that are included in our \nbill today. The Texas plan includes the right to both internal and \nexternal appeal if the HMO denies a claim. In fact, in Texas, before \nyou can even think of suing your HMO in court, you must exhaust your \nadministrative remedies, and because the State tried to apply its \nexternal review provisions to federally regulated as well as State \nregulated HMOs, a Federal court has struck down part of the State law. \nBut it was working very well.\n\n  The State recently acted to revive the external review section of the \nlaw. Now the system is voluntary. But, surprisingly, HMOs and other \nhealth plans are still willing to participate and be bound by the \nexternal review process in Texas. And it is working.\n  The Republicans' Patients' Bill of Rights Plus establishes a \nnational, internal, and binding external appeals process using the \nTexas statute as a guide. It is a good system. I think it will work for \nthe federally covered plans as it has worked in Texas. In fact, in \nTexas it has worked so well that, of more than 300 appeals heard under \nthe external review system, only one lawsuit has emerged, and the \nappeals have gone about 50-50 in favor of both patients and health \nplans.\n  This brings me to the third major difference between the Democrat and \nRepublican approach, and that is they believe lawsuits are the answer \nto better care, and we disagree. Good health care is prospective. A \nlawsuit is retrospective. An adequate external review process helps \nensure that HMOs will not arbitrarily deny coverage for benefits. It \nwill make them want to improve the quality of the care and services \nthey provide in the future. A lawsuit, on the other hand, only seeks to \nshift money around long after the fact, to try to determine who was at \nfault and how much they owe. At that point, patient care is obsolete. \nWe are talking about fault. I would rather focus on what we can do to \ngive that patient the care when the patient needs it.\n  All one needs to do, if the suggestion is that more lawsuits are the \nanswer, is to look at our current medical malpractice tort system. Many \nphysicians in this country may be upset with the growth of managed \ncare, but most of them are far more concerned with the tidal wave of \nlawsuits against doctors and other health care providers that we have \nseen in recent decades. These lawsuits, costing hundreds of billions of \ndollars, have done little to improve the practice of medicine in \nAmerica. In fact, I wonder if they do not cause more defensive medicine \nrather than better care. In fact, in some ways, I think they have \nalienated the doctor-patient relationship.\n  So look at the range of views here. The Washington Post said last \nyear that expanding lawsuits in this area was probably wrong. The Post \nwrote:\n\n       There appears as well to be an impulse among congressional \n     Democrats to make insurers and companies that self-insure \n     liable for damages. The impulse is understandable but the \n     threat of litigation is the wrong way to enforce the rational \n     decisionmaking that everyone claims to have as a goal. The \n     proposed appeals system should be given a tryout. ``First do \n     no harm'' is the rule of medicine. It should be the rule on \n     legislating as well.\n\n  Mr. President, I know my colleagues across the aisle are trying to \naddress complaints they have heard from their constituents. But rather \nthan again mandating new rules that will drive up the cost of health \ncare, the American people would be much better served with a carefully \ntailored approach that respects the ability of patients, professionals, \nand State regulators to make their own decisions about what is best \npractice in their States and within their communities.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus does just that. It makes sure that \nHMOs are accountable, without scaring employers away from even offering \ninsurance to their employees. It gives patients rights without \nencouraging inflationary rises, and empowers health care providers to \nprovide the care their patients need but without Washington having to \nlook over everyone's shoulder. It is the right answer, and it is the \nright time.\n  Mr. President, I thank the leadership, Senator Frist, and Senator \nCollins, and those who have worked closely on the task force to make \nsure we do provide the rights to patients in an affordable way that \nwill not drive up costs and drive people out of the system. That should \nbe our goal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have 2 \\1/2\\ minutes left. I will use \nthose minutes.\n  I want to point out for the benefit of the membership, we have almost \nconcluded our 50 minutes of debate. The debate has included a number of \ndifferent amendments. All are very important because they all relate to \nthe doctor-patient relationship. That is the heart of our entire bill. \nThe heart of our bill is to make sure that medical professionals are \nable to practice the best medicine and make the best recommendations \nand that the insurance companies will comply with those \nrecommendations. The heart of our bill is maintaining the relationship \nbetween the doctor and his or her patient. That is the heart of our \nbill. We still have not had any real criticism, observations, or \ncomments on those issues.\n  We had some debate in the HELP Committee when these matters were \nraised. I note the proponents of those particular amendments--those who \nwere on the committee and those who were not--were on the floor ready \nto respond to questions. Nonetheless, we have heard debate on the \noverall legislation. We still have not heard a response to what I think \nhas been a powerful presentation in favor of these measures. Again, I \nwill mention very quickly what this amendment is about.\n  This amendment is critical to preserving the relationship between \nmedical professionals and patients, as well as providing fair \ninformation to consumers. Today, medical professionals are too often \ngagged, harassed, and financially penalized if they advocate for their \npatients.\n  I am reminded in my own State of Massachusetts of Barry Adams who was \nfired for simply reporting quality of care problems to his superiors. \nThis happened just 3 months after he received a glowing evaluation that \nsaid he was an excellent role model, conducted himself in a \nprofessional manner, was an advocate for patients, and channeled his \nconcerns appropriately.\n  Yet after he spoke up about his concerns, the facility mounted a \ncampaign to oust him. The month he was fired, a woman died from a \nmorphine overdose given by an unsupervised junior nurse. This was the \nvery type of incident Barry reported previously, the very type of \nincident that Barry reported in the complaint that led to his firing. \nThe facility also retaliated against two of his colleagues who reported \nunsafe patient conditions.\n  Barry fought back, and more than a year after he was fired, a judge \nruled that Barry's termination was unlawful. The judge ordered the \nhospital to reinstate Barry, pay all back wages and expunge his record. \nHe won. But the point is, he never should have been fired in the first \nplace. This amendment prevents that from happening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if patients cannot count on their doctor, \nquality medical care is impossible. If doctors cannot do their best for \ntheir patients without fear of retaliation, quality medical practice is \nimpossible, too.\n  This amendment protects the relationship between the doctors and \ntheir patients. The Republican bill protects only the insurance \ncompanies. Part of the doctor/patient relationship is being able to go \nto the medical professional of your choice, not the HMO's choice.\n  This amendment establishes a point-of-service option that guarantees \nthat choice. The Republican bill offers no meaningful guarantee.\n  Without the type of information the ombudsman program provides, too\n\n[[Page S8563]]\n\nmany consumers will simply be unable to exercise the rights this bill \nproposes to grant. As our friend and colleague, Senator Reed, pointed \nout, giving consumers information so they will have their rights \nprotected under their HMO is so important. This amendment provides \nbasic, commonsense protections for health professionals and patients, \nand I know of no valid reason that it should be opposed.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  I have sat here and listened to the arguments from the other side. \nThere is part of this amendment the Democrats didn't even talk about. \nThe problem is that this part of the amendment will make things worse, \nand not just for doctors and nurses. It will put patients at risk by \nallowing providers to release the intimate details of a patient's \ntreatment without having to worry about being accurate or even \ntruthful.\n  Here is how. Under the Democrat amendment, any provider could \ndisclose any information about a patient at any time for any reason. \nThis fact is so important that I want to say it again: under the \nDemocrat amendment, any provider could disclose any information about a \npatient at any time for any reason. And as bad and unbelievable as that \nis, that's not even the worst of it. This amendment allows a provider \nto do the worst of all things--not only to give out information about a \npatient, but even lie about it--and not be held accountable. How can \nthat be possible, you ask? Isn't that against the law? Not if this \namendment passes, it's not. If this amendment passes, that possibility \nis a reality, and your private health records will be held hostage by a \nprovider who can make an unchecked decision to disclose them without \nasking your permission and who can't be penalized for doing so.\n  But that is not all. There is no requirement in the Democrat \namendment that when a provider exposes your confidential records, that \nthe provider make disclosures only within his area of expertise. So if \nan anesthesiologist wants to reveal something about the way your ear \nexam was performed, the Democrat amendment says that is okay. There is \nnothing saying that the person disclosing your information has to know \nanything about either the procedure or your case before revealing \neverything about it--in fact, he doesn't even have to witness the \ntreatment or ever have met you--and there's nothing saying he will be \nheld accountable if he's mistaken or just flat out wrong. Adding insult \nto injury, the Democrat amendment doesn't even say that the disclosure \nhas to relate to safety and health. All the amendment says is that the \ndisclosure must be based on squishy terms that aren't even defined. For \nexample, the amendment says that the disclosure must be based on \ninformation, and I'm quoting here, that the provider ``reasonably \nbelieves * * * to be true.'' It is unbelievable to think that this \nflies under the Democrat amendment. It is unbelievable that the \namendment would allow a patient's health information, records, and \nprivate treatment details to be jeopardized and publicized without his \nconsent, based on something that a total stranger ``reasonably believes \nto be true'' and is not even related to the patient's own safety. \nExposing patients to such a high degree of risk without tying \ndisclosures to patient safety, expertise or even accuracy is not only \nunacceptable, it's just plain wrong.\n  What the Democrat amendment completely ignores is that procedures \nspecifically related to the health care industry are in place for \nreporting problems with patient safety and health right now. The \namendment also completely ignores and steam rolls all the state law in \nthis area. I find it fascinating that the other side has said over and \nover and over again in this debate that their bill will not shift \ndecisionmaking from the state capitals to Washington bureaucrats, and \nthen they propose an amendment like this.\n  I want to talk about what this does to state law, and then talk about \nthe procedures that are in place now.\n  On the first day of this debate, I heard no less than four Senators \non the other side of the aisle characterize our ``states rights'' \nargument as being ``tired'' and ``old.'' Well, while I might take issue \nwith it being ``tired,'' I certainly agree that it is ``old.'' In fact, \nit's as old as the Constitution. And if you are tired of hearing about \nit, think about this: How many times have you been to Wyoming? What do \nyou know about the folks there? I can tell you that it's true they need \naccess to good health care, and I can also tell you that folks there \ndon't want the Federal government to step in and trump what the Wyoming \nLegislature has done to protect them. They don't want one standard that \napplies to everyone regardless of who they are, where they're from, and \nhow they live. And if those on the other side of the aisle think that \nthe people I represent in Wyoming are exactly like New Yorkers or \nCalifornians, then I suggest you head back to Cheyenne with me this \nweekend and see if you change your mind.\n  One size fits all doesn't fit when we are talking about giving \nproviders ways to report patient safety problems and protecting them \nwhen they make disclosures. Over 25 states have their own language \nprohibiting employers from retaliating against providers who disclose \ninformation relating to patient safety within a recognized framework. \nThat's over 25 states with different laws and different reporting \nprocedures; 25 states that offer different rights and responsibilities. \nI cannot underscore the importance of this enough. To a Democrat caucus \nthat has repeatedly said that their bill will not shift the \ndecisionmaking from the state capitals to Washington bureaucrats, I \nchallenge you to tell me how such a statement jives with an amendment \nsuch as this one that fully wipes out state law. Not only that, I \nchallenge you to tell me how this flawed amendment is better than the \nlaw that exists on the state books. More on this in a minute.\n  Bottom line, this amendment allows providers to file complaints \ndisclosing confidential patient information without permission. These \ncomplaints don't need to relate to safety and health. The provider does \nnot need to know anything about who or what they are disclosing--\nwhether it be the specific patient treatment or the patient himself. \nAnd finally--and most ridiculously--the provider doesn't need to be \naccurate because he can't be penalized for inaccurate statements, \nmisleading information or even downright lies about the patient or \nother health care providers. How in heaven's name could any state law \nanywhere be worse, or more destructive, than this? Indeed, having no \nlaw whatsoever would be vastly better.\n  But you do not have to take my word for it. Just take a look at some \nof the State laws. In California, for example, providers cannot \ndisclose information that violates the confidentiality of the \nphysician-patient privilege. An important provision. Is it anywhere to \nbe found in the democrat amendment? No. The amendment ignores it \nentirely. What about a Rhode Island law that eliminates any protection \nfor providers who participate or cause the problem being reported, or \nwho provide false information? That one is pretty important, too. Also \nnowhere to be found in the Democrat amendment.\n  The body of state law that it would destroy is incredibly vital \nwhether we're talking about ERISA plans or not, because the courts have \ndefinitively held that where quality of care is concerned, state law \ntrumps ERISA. As the Supreme Court has held, ``the historic powers of \nthe State include the regulation of matters of health and safety.'' \nAnother seminal third circuit case has held in citing the Supreme Court \nthat, while the quality control of health care benefits might \nindirectly affect the sorts of benefits an ERISA plan can afford, they \nhave traditionally been left to the states, and there is no indication \nin ERISA that Congress chose to displace general health care regulation \nby the states. It's clear: the courts have deferred to the states when \nit comes to quality of care. I think that the democrats should take a \nlesson from this.\n\n  I have heard it said, however, that we need not worry about the \noverhaul of state law that occurs under the Democrat approach to health \ncare because their bill will merely set a ``floor'' upon which States \ncan build. Such a\n\n[[Page S8564]]\n\nstatement is questionable given an amendment such as this that is so \nflawed that it actually protects those who publicize confidential \npatient information and lie about it without giving the patient or \nother accused providers an opportunity to object. As a former state \nlegislator, I say respectfully, ``thanks, but no thanks.'' The only \nfloor this sets for the States is the one they will stomp on when they \ntake one look at this bill.\n  So who should investigate claims of wrongdoing and retaliation? I \nhave mentioned that lots of other procedures are in place that allow \nfor reporting and are specific to the health care industry. One of the \nbiggest and most far-reaching of these is the reporting mechanism in \nplace at the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare \nOrganizations. The Joint Commission covers over 80 percent of the \napproximately 6,200 hospitals in this country that receive Medicare \npayments. These charts I have next to me are blow-ups of information \ntaken directly off of the Joint Commission's website and show not only \nhow reports and concerns about patient care can be disclosed, but also \nwhat followup occurs in response.\n  Here is how the process works. If a provider wants to report an \nalleged problem, that provider has several choices under the Joint \nCommission. He can e-mail a complaint, fax a complaint, mail a \ncomplaint, or call the Joint Commission directly using their toll free \nnumber. And there are a couple of points I want to make about why this \nprocess is so much better, more related to the health care industry, \nand has much stronger teeth than this amendment. First, using the Joint \nCommissions' toll free number, reporting concerns can be immediate and \nconfidential. Not only that, communications with the Joint Commission \ncan be made in English or in Spanish. Second--and this one's really \nimportant, too--all complaints must relate to quality of care issues \nand patient safety unlike the democrat amendment which can relate to \nanything. Third--and perhaps most important of all--where serious \nconcerns have been raised about patient safety, the Joint Commission \nwill, and I emphasize ``will'' conduct an unannounced, on site \ninvestigation. Period. And with the Joint Commission, there will never \nbe any concern over who's investigating problems. The Joint \nCommission's standards are recognized as representing a contemporary \nnational consensus on quality patient care, and these standards are \ncontinuously reviewed to reflect changing health care practices. This \nis a real solution that combines a proactive reporting method to make \nsure that patient quality is not compromised, with an appropriate and \nstrong follow up with mandatory, unannounced, on site inspections by an \norganization that knows the health care industry as well as anyone.\n\n  In addition to all the State laws setting up reporting procedures and \nprotections for providers, and in addition to the practices in place \nsuch as the Joint Commission, there are other controls. Hospitals that \nreceive Medicare payments and that are not accredited by the Joint \nCommission are certified by the states. All these hospitals are \nrequired to provide patients with a document that explains their rights \nincluding a phone number where they can call a state agency to make a \ncomplaint about quality of care issues. These rights must also be \nposted. Yet another control is that patients--and even providers--can \nanonymously complain to the Medicare Program's Peer Review Organization \non quality of care matters. Providers may also complain to HCFA's \nregional offices, state survey agencies and professional licensing \nboards.\n  I have heard the stories about providers who have disclosed \ninformation and then were retaliated against. What I don't know is why \nthe state laws, the Joint Commission's reporting process, state \nreporting processes, Medicare reporting processes, HCFA's reporting \nprocesses, and the professional licensing board--among other \nprotections--are not working. I have in my hand a copy of the HELP \nCommittee's report on the Patients' Bill of Rights and all of the \namendments introduced to the bill. You may remember that an amendment \nsimilar to the democrat amendment introduced here today was introduced \nduring the markup of this bill. I happened to remember that amendment, \ntoo, and so I picked up a copy of the committee report and began to \nleaf through the minority comments to find their explanation of the \namendment. I was looking for some reason--other than pure politics--\nabout why an amendment like this is needed, about what isn't working in \nthe system that must be fixed, and about why current laws, practices \nand procedures aren't enough. This is what the committee report is for, \nright? So I looked, and I looked. Out of the report's main body of 108 \npages, 99 pages were written by the majority to explain and to support \nour bill. Only nine pages were written by the minority--nine. So out of \nnine pages, you would not think it would take too long to find some \ninformation--any information--about one of the minority's major \namendments. I did not think so either, but I was wrong. I did finally \nfind the minority's reference to the amendment, though. It was three \nsentences long. Three sentences out of nine pages on a major amendment. \nLet me read them to you: ``Doctors and other providers must be able to \ngive every patient their best possible advice, without fear of \nretaliation or financial penalties.'' So far, so good. ``Out plan bans \nabusive insurance industry practices that undermine the integrity of \nthe doctor-patient relationship. The committee legislation does not.'' \nSo I kept reading. I scanned the page. What abusive industry insurance \npractices? I wanted to know. Why do providers fear retaliation? Why are \ncurrent law, current practices, and current procedures not working? \nNothing. Wouldn't you think that if the majority was able to spend its \ntime writing 99 pages supporting its position, the minority might have \nbeen able to spend just a little more time adding even one paragraph to \nits nine pages on this? Not even one paragraph on an amendment that the \ndemocrats say is so vital. It just doesn't make any sense.\n  I have heard time and again that Republicans are weeping ``crocodile \ntears'' about our bill. In fact, out of those mere nine pages in the \nminority's committee report, an entire sentence was wasted making this \nstatement. But it seems to me that when you lay down amendments and \ndon't share information about why we should trump state law in support \nof an amendment that protects providers who disclose misleading and \nconfidential patient information unrelated to the patient's safety, \nthen I think it is the democrats who are the ones crying crocodile \ntears when people like me are baffled by their empty allegations and \noutlandish solutions.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield back any time I have on the amendment.\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield back the remainder of our time on this amendment.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1252 To Amendment No. 1251\n\n  (Purpose: Enhancing and augmenting the internal review and external \n   appeal process, covering individuals in approved cancer clinical \n  trials, improving point-of-service coverage, protecting individuals \n  when a plan's coverage is terminated, and prohibiting certain group \n  health plans from discriminating against providers on the basis of \n                       license or certification)\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Frist], for Mr. Ashcroft, \n     for himself, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Mack, Mr. Frist, Mr. Sessions, Ms. \n     Collins, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Enzi, Mr. \n     DeWine, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. Helms, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1252 to amendment No. 1251.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, very quickly, because we have a lot of \nground to cover over the next 100 minutes, the amendment that has been \nsent to the desk involves basically five components. I will be relying \non a number of my colleagues coming to the floor, all of whom have \nworked for weeks and months and, in some cases, well over a year on \nthese amendments.\n  The first of these components is on external appeals. As we continue \nto address the issues before us, it is very important to have the \nAmerican people\n\n[[Page S8565]]\n\nrecognize we are going to continue to improve this bill as we go \nthrough.\n  A second component is the clinical trial issue, an issue Senator Mack \nand I have worked very aggressively on over the last year with a number \nof our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, an issue that had been \naddressed initially earlier in the week that, as we said before, we are \ngoing to come back to and lay out what we think is the most reasonable \nway to achieve a very important goal, and that is to increase access to \nimportant clinical trials.\n  A third component a number of Senators, again Senator Collins and \nSenator Grassley, will be speaking to is on provider nondiscrimination, \nand we will be looking at some protections that are similar to those in \nMedicare and Medicaid.\n  A fourth component of this amendment--again a very important one \nbecause it involves choice, and again we are working to improve this \nbill as we go through with the amendments--is on point of service where \nwe expand choice, which again is a basic underlying principle of the \nRepublican efforts in this bill.\n  The fifth component that will be addressed is continuity of care, \nagain a very important issue, the whole issue of extending the \ntransition period for patients.\n\n  We have a lot to cover over the next 100 minutes. To me it is very \npleasing, having participated so much on each of these issues, that \nupon passage of this amendment with its five components, we will do a \ngreat deal to improve the quality of care of individual patients. That \nis where our focus must be.\n  We are going to begin with the issue of clinical trials, again \npicking up on the discussion earlier in the week. I yield 12 minutes to \nthe Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Dr. Larry Kerr, \na health fellow for the Judiciary Committee, be granted the privilege \nof the floor for the remainder of the debate on the Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator Frist, Senator \nJeffords, and Senator Collins, and others, as we offer this amendment \nto provide cancer patients with coverage of health insurance benefits \nwhen they participate in approved clinical trials.\n  Many health plans will not pay for the cost of routine patient care \nif patients want to participate in a clinical trial. As a result, \nbeneficiaries with cancer are denied access to these trials of \npromising new therapies because these therapies are deemed \n``experimental'' by most health plans and, therefore, not qualified for \ncoverage. This means many cancer patients have two choices when they \nhave exhausted all traditional therapies: either pay the cost of \nparticipating in a clinical trial themselves or go without additional \ntreatment.\n  For all but the most wealthy patients, it is cost prohibitive to take \npart in a clinical trial. This amendment will help ensure that a \npatient's decision about whether or not to participate in a clinical \ntrial is based upon science and not cost.\n  Clinical trials are one of the most effective ways of determining \nwhich treatments are beneficial. Yet cancer researchers have told me \nthey have had difficulty enrolling the required number of patients to \nparticipate in the clinical trials they are conducting. Scientists have \nidentified noncoverage by private insurers, as well as Medicare, as one \nof the primary reasons why patients do not participate in clinical \ntrials.\n  For example, approximately 2 percent of cancer patients are \nparticipating in clinical trials. This amendment will help scientists \nrecruit cancer patients who wish to participate in clinical trials by \nbreaking down the financial barriers which may preclude most patients \nfrom participating.\n  Clinical trials are one of the most effective techniques for \nassessing the effectiveness of a scientific and medical intervention. \nMany of my Senate colleagues have joined with me in a bipartisan effort \nto double biomedical research funding through the National Institutes \nof Health. Last year, Congress appropriated $15.6 billion for NIH. This \nrepresented a $2 billion increase, the largest increase in NIH history. \nAt a time when American researchers are making such tremendous progress \nin scientific areas such as cancer genetics and biology, it is \nessential that this knowledge be translated into new therapies through \nwell-designed clinical trials. This amendment is a natural extension of \nthe historic effort to double funding for medical research in our \ncountry.\n  When my brother, Michael, was diagnosed with cancer, there were only \nthree basic forms of treatment--surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. \nToday, scientists are revolutionizing the treatment of cancer by \ndeveloping many new weapons to kill cancer, including gene therapy and \nimmunotherapy.\n  On a personal note again, every time I get into these discussions, \nand every time I see the new efforts that are being pursued, and the \nsuccesses that have been developed, I cannot help but think if \nMichael's melanoma had been discovered or if he had found the disease \nmuch later in his life, when these new procedures--gene therapy and \nimmunotherapy were available--and if he had been able to participate in \na clinical trial, which he attempted to do throughout his treatment \nmany years ago, his life may have been saved.\n  This amendment will help scientists continue the unprecedented \nprogress being made to find new methods of treatment.\n  Coverage of cancer clinical trials is a bipartisan issue. Earlier \nthis year, for example, Senator Rockefeller and I introduced \nlegislation to provide for Medicare coverage of cancer clinical trials. \nI am pleased to say that 36 additional Senators, from both sides of the \naisle, have cosponsored this legislation. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to pass this important legislation during the 106th \nCongress.\n  The reason Senator Rockefeller and I targeted our legislation to \ncancer is the same reason we have targeted this amendment to cancer \ntoday--there is a legitimate debate about what the true cost may be. \nSenator Rockefeller and I believe the cost will be insignificant. And \nwe have the studies to prove that.\n  However, there are legitimate concerns with respect to cost which \nhave been raised. Both the amendment we offer today and the \nRockefeller-Mack legislation, call for a study and report to Congress \nin 2005 on the cost implications of covering cancer clinical trials.\n  I support comprehensive coverage of clinical trials. But, at this \ntime, we need more information before we go further. This amendment \nwill help provide the information we need to make a better informed \ndecision.\n  During markup of S. 326, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions considered an amendment offered by my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Dodd, to provide clinical trial coverage.\n  Since then, my colleagues and I have more thoroughly studied this \namendment. We have examined what barriers exist that impede enrollment \nin clinical trials. We looked into the cost implications. We considered \nthe best way to define the term ``routine patient costs.''\n  Let me first highlight the many similarities in our amendment and the \namendment which Senator Dodd offered during committee consideration.\n  Our amendment requires plans to provide coverage of routine patient \ncosts. I will get back to that term in a few minutes.\n  Our amendments ensures that health plans are not required to pay for \ncosts of items and services that are reasonably expected to be paid for \nby the sponsors of a clinical trial. This includes tests or \nmeasurements conducted primarily for the purpose of a clinical trial.\n  Our amendment permits plans to require clinical trial participants to \nuse in-network providers, if they are available. If coverage is \nprovided by a nonparticipating provider, payment would be at the same \nrate the plan would pay for comparable services to a participating \nprovider.\n  Our amendment is limited to those health plans over which Congress \nhas sole and exclusive jurisdiction.\n  Our amendment is limited to only the highest-quality clinical trials. \nThese include trials approved and funded by the National Institutes of \nHealth, the Department of Veterans Affairs,\n\n[[Page S8566]]\n\nand the Department of Defense. Only those trials which have undergone \nthe rigors of peer-review will be considered.\n  Our legislation differs with Senator Dodd's proposal in three ways.\n  The first difference is how to best define the term ``routine patient \ncost.'' In researching this issue, we have found that there is not a \ngenerally accepted definition of the term, ``routine patient cost'' \nassociated with participation in a clinical trial. The Balanced Budget \nAct required the Institute of Medicine to conduct a study on the issue \nof cancer clinical trial coverage, including the definition of routine \npatient costs. This study is due in September, and it will likely help \nus to better define this highly technical term. There are other experts \nwho have opinions on how to define the term ``routine patient cost.'' \nWe believe it is best to leave this task to patients, employers, health \nplans and those with true expertise in the field of clinical trials.\n  It is essential to remember that protocols for clinical trials vary \nwidely, and routine patient costs for clinical trials also vary. \nScientific researchers have indicated that developing one standard for \ndetermining routine patient costs will be a daunting task. I don't \nbelieve Congress is best qualified to make this important scientific \ndetermination.\n  Therefore, our amendment provides for a negotiated rulemaking process \nto establish a time-limited committee charged with developing standards \nrelating to the coverage of routine patient costs for patients \nparticipating in clinical trials. This way, organizations representing \ncancer patients, health care practitioners, hospitals, employers, \nmanufacturers of drugs and medical devices, medical economists and \nothers will be involved in the process of defining routine patient \ncosts with respect to clinical trials.\n  By May, this committee is required to develop standards for routine \npatient costs for individuals who are participating in those trials. If \nthe committee is unable to reach a consensus, then the Secretary must \ndevelop these standards and publish a rule by June 30, in the year \n2000. In either case, coverage for these benefits would begin for plans \nbeginning on, or after, January 1, 2001.\n  We believe that a negotiated rulemaking process is the best way for \norganizations representing all who are affected to collectively \ndetermine what costs should be considered in ``routine patient costs.'' \nThese decisions will have a major effect of the cost of covering \nclinical trials.\n  I will just underscore that again. These decisions will have a major \neffect on the cost of covering clinical trials.\n  Under the Democratic bill, these organizations can only submit a \ncomment to the Secretary, who has broad authority to determine what \nconstitutes routine patient costs. However, those comments could be \nrejected out-of-hand by the Secretary.\n  By contrast, the negotiated rulemaking process ensures that all who \nhave an interest in the outcome have a seat at the negotiating table to \nmake the decision. We believe it is essential that cancer patients have \nan opportunity to be involved in establishing standards for routine \npatient costs, and a negotiated rulemaking procedure affords them that \nopportunity.\n  Second, as I mentioned earlier, our amendment differs from the Dodd \namendment in that it is limited to cancer clinical trials. There are \nmore clinical trials involving cancer than perhaps any other disease. \nThis targeted approach will not only provide a needed benefit to a \nlarge patient population, but it will also provide significant \ninformation for the study and report called for in this amendment.\n  Finally, our amendment includes a study and report to Congress on the \ncosts to health plans and any impact on health insurance premiums. \nSenator Dodd's amendment did not include this study and report, which I \nbelieve is extremely important. Congress can then use this important \ninformation to determine if they wish to expand coverage for patients \nwith other diseases.\n  Like most of my colleagues, I am very concerned about the ever-\nincreasing costs of health insurance. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, our amendment will result in an increase in health \ninsurance premiums of less than one-tenth of one percent. The Dodd \nproposal would cost five times that amount.\n  I have met with thousands of cancer patients throughout Florida and \nthe rest of the United States, patients desperately wanting to \nparticipate in clinical trials when traditional therapies are no longer \nbeneficial.\n  Let me conclude my comments here today by relating an experience \nwhich puts a human face on why this issue is so important.\n  As my colleagues may know, I frequently visit the National Institutes \nof Health to meet with scientific reserchers so I may gain a better \nunderstanding of the many advances which are taking place to detect and \ntreat cancer and other diseases.\n  Over the years, I have been fortunate to get to know Dr. Steven \nRosenberg, a world-renowned scientist and oncologist who is an expert \nin the field of melanoma research and treatment. I first met Dr. \nRosenberg after reading his book, ``The Transformed Cell.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MACK. I ask for 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield an additional 2 minutes.\n  Mr. MACK. Last year, I was meeting with Dr. Rosenberg to learn about \na clinical trial he is conducting on a state-of-the art melanoma \nvaccine. During our conversation, Dr. Rosenberg mentioned that one of \nmy constituents was at NCI participating in that clinical trial. I \nasked if I might meet him. Before we went to his hospital room at NCI, \nDr. Rosenberg showed me photographs which had previously been taken. \nThis patient had purple, bulbous melanoma lesions several inches in \ndiameter down the side of his body.\n  Dr. Rosenberg introduced me to my constituent, and we engaged in \ncasual conversation.\n  At one point I asked him how he was doing. To show me how he was \ndoing, this brave man took off his hospital gown and showed me that \nthese lesions of huge size on both his arm and his side were totally \ngone. That is why I think it is so important that we have this \namendment included in the legislation, so that other cancer patients \nwill have the same opportunity.\n  To conclude, what is this amendment really about? Most importantly, \nit is about giving patients fighting cancer the hope that an \nexperimental therapy being tested in a well-designed clinical trial \nmight save their lives. In addition to providing hope, it paves the way \nfor new therapies that will, one day, not only provide hope, but a \ncure. It is about allowing cancer patients to make what may be the \nfinal major health care decision of their lives--whether to participate \nin a clinical trial.\n  Mr. President, I've met with many patients who were participating in \nclinical trials. To me, these patients are, in many ways, like \nAmerica's astronauts. Later this month, we will celebrate the 30th \nanniversary of man's landing on the Moon. Like the astronauts of \nApollo, clinical trial participants are pioneers. They are heroes, who \nare helping to push science and medicine into new frontiers. We must \nprovide hope to these brave Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the facts are that the Republican majority \nhave offered a number of feel-good amendments. Everyone should \nunderstand that these amendments, even if they pass, will only cover \n40-plus million Americans. Our amendment covers over 160 million \nAmericans. Even though the provisions they have stuck in this amendment \nare weakened compared to the Democratic provisions dealing with \nexternal appeals, provider nondiscrimination, points of service, \ncontinuity of care, it is just the same as the amendment we offered for \n50 minutes. Advocates of that amendment came from the minority side and \npresented their arguments to the Senate, to each other. The majority \nwas not here. They did not offer a single word in opposition to the \namendment that was offered by the minority.\n  This can best be summed up not by a Senator, not by some paid \nadvertisement on television. I think the best\n\n[[Page S8567]]\n\nway to sum this up is by a New York Times statement by Bob Herbert \ntoday entitled, ``Money versus Reform.''\n\n       Donna Marie McIlwaine was 22 when she died on Feb. 8, 1997. \n     She is buried in the Chili Rural Cemetery in upstate \n     Scottsdale, N.Y.\n       The managed-care reform legislation that has been the focus \n     of a furious debate in the Senate was essentially an effort \n     to make it easier to save the lives of patients like Ms. \n     McIlwaine.\n       The Republican Party, flooded with money from the managed-\n     care industry, gives lip service to the idea of protecting \n     patients, but then does the bidding of the companies that are \n     the source of all that cash.\n       It's a tremendous scandal. No one can seriously argue that \n     lives are not being lost.\n       Ms. McIlwaine went to the doctor several times in the week \n     before she died, complaining of pains in her chest and \n     shortness of breath. According to her family, she was \n     diagnosed with an upper respiratory infection and ``panic \n     attacks.''\n       In fact, she was suffering from pneumonia and a blood clot \n     in her left lung. Her mother, Mary Munnings, told me \n     yesterday that her daughter had been screaming from \n     excruciating pain before finally lapsing into unconsciousness \n     and dying at home on a Saturday night.\n       There was no need for her to die. Ms. Munnings said that \n     when she contacted the office of her daughter's primary-care \n     physician the following Monday, she learned that Ms. \n     McIlwaine had not been sent for the laboratory tests that \n     would have properly diagnosed her condition. She said that \n     when she asked why not, she was told that ``they couldn't \n     justify'' the tests to her health maintenance organization.\n       So we have Donna Marie McIlwaine dead at age 22.\n       Most of the country understands that an unconscionable \n     obsession with the bottom line has resulted in widespread \n     abuses in the managed care industry. Simply stated, there is \n     big money to be made by denying care. It is now widely known \n     that there are faceless bureaucrats making critical \n     diagnostic and treatment decisions, that some doctors are \n     being retaliated against for dispensing honest advice, that \n     women have had an especially hard time getting the care they \n     need, and that patients have died because they were unable to \n     gain admittance to emergency rooms.\n\n  Mr. President, that is what this debate has been about. I quote \nfurther:\n\n       The so-called patients' bill of rights, sponsored \n     by Democratic Senators Tom Daschle and Edward Kennedy, was \n     an attempt to curb these and other abuses. The managed-\n     care industry wanted no part of the legislation, which \n     meant the Republicans wanted no part of it. The Democrats \n     had to virtually shut down the Senate before the \n     Republican majority would even agree to bring this matter \n     to the floor for a debate.\n       The Republican whip, Don Nickles of Oklahoma, could hardly \n     have been clearer about his party's desire to avoid the \n     issue. ``I don't want our members to go through a lot of \n     votes that can be misconstrued for political purposes,'' he \n     said.\n       The Democrats succeeded in forcing debate on the bill, but \n     they haven't gotten the patient protections they sought. What \n     occurred on the floor of the Senate this week was a G.O.P.-\n     sponsored charade in which one Republican senator after \n     another talked about protecting the health of patients while \n     voting to protect the profits of this industry.\n       It was a breathtaking exercise in hypocrisy. It was as if \n     George Wallace had spoken earnestly about the need to admit \n     black students to a public school in Alabama while standing \n     in the doorway to block their entrance.\n       Some face-saving measures were passed by the G.O.P. \n     majority, but the essence of managed-care reform was \n     defeated. In the end, it didn't matter that Mary Munnings had \n     needlessly lost her daughter, or that a parade of managed-\n     care victims had traveled to Washington to detail their \n     horror stories, or that organizations representing doctors, \n     patients and their families had lined up en masse in support \n     of reform.\n       All that mattered was the obsession with the profits of the \n     insurance companies and the H.M.O.'s.\n       Eventually substantial improvements will be made in the \n     delivery of effective and affordable health care to \n     Americans. It will take years but it will happen. And then \n     the country will look back and wonder (as we have with Social \n     Security, Medicare and the like) why anyone was ever opposed.\n\n  Mr. President, that is what this debate is all about. It is a debate \nabout protecting the insurance industry or protecting American \npatients. I am sad to report, money is going to win. Money is going to \nprevail over American patients who need help. It is as simple as that.\n  It is whether or not a doctor can make a decision for a patient or a \nbureaucrat is going to make a decision for a patient. It is a question \nof whether we are going to be driven by profits or patients. Let us \nhope some day patients will prevail.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Democratic whip for yielding me this time.\n  Mr. President, I am troubled about the pending amendment because one \nof its components my colleagues might not be aware of is that it strips \nthe Democratic provision to provide continuity of care.\n  This is pretty serious because what continuity of care means. What \ndoes continuity of care mean? Under our proposal, continuity of care \nmeans just because your company changes HMOs, you should not have to \nchange your doctor, or if your doctor is put out of the network, you \nshouldn't have to leave your doctor.\n  I hope we can make sure that we keep continuity of care in. If we \nlose it, we are going to have our own amendment. Senator Bob Kerrey and \nI are going to offer our own amendment on continuity of care. I will \ntell you why we feel so strongly about it.\n  We think the most important thing in getting well is the doctor-\npatient relationship. You need to have a doctor who knows you, and you \nneed to keep your doctor who has prescribed a course of treatment and \nwho knows you as a person, not as a lab test, not as a chart. We do not \nbelieve doctors are interchangeable. We believe you should be able to \nkeep your own doctor. Let me tell you what the Democratic provision \ndoes. Under the Democratic proposal, if your company changes HMOs, you \nget to keep your physician through at least a 90-day transition period.\n  So if you are a diabetic or if you are engaged in a particular course \nof treatment, you get to keep your doctor.\n  Then we have three provisions that make sure you keep your doctor \nwhen you are facing significant medical circumstances. What would be a \nsignificant medical circumstance? It means, for instance, when you are \npregnant. We think that when you are having your baby and you have an \nOB/GYN and a course of treatment, you should be able to keep that same \ndoctor all the way through your pregnancy and through your postpartum \nrecovery.\n  Why is that important? Suppose you are a diabetic, or suppose you \nhave kidney problems, or suppose you have a whole variety of other \nmedically indicated symptoms that require very special monitoring; you \ncan't just change your doctor. We certainly don't want to change \ndoctors in late-term pregnancies. We have talked a lot on this floor \nabout late-term pregnancies. Well, let's make sure you get to keep the \nsame doctor during late-term pregnancies.\n  Let's take another issue. If you are terminally ill, under the \nRepublican school of thought you would lose your physician--if you are \nterminally ill and your company changes providers. We think if you are \ndying of cancer, if you are in the last stages of any illness, or if \nyour child is in the last stages of illness, you shouldn't have to \nchange your doctor. We truly believe that when a little boy or girl is \ndying of leukemia and the family is facing the heartbreak of that, they \nshould at least be able to keep the same doctor through the course of \ntreatment.\n  The other exception we provide is if you are in an institution or a \nfacility. So if you are in a mental facility and you are getting well, \nyou are working hard to get well, let's keep the doctor while you are \nkeeping up the fight to get well. If you are also recovering from a \nstroke and you are in a rehab center, we say you should be able to keep \nyour doctor and the same set of providers throughout that course of \ntreatment.\n  We are being bashed on this floor about how we are for lawyers. Well, \nI am not for or against lawyers, but I am for doctors. I am really for \nthe doctors and the other appropriate health care providers. I think \nthat if you are pregnant, or terminally ill, or if you are in an \ninstitution trying to get better, you ought to be able to keep your \ndoctors, and maybe we would not have to turn to the lawyers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are currently debating an amendment that \nwe have introduced on several topics. One is external appeals, \nstrengthening that external appeals process.\n  No. 2, and one that I have been intimately involved with, is \nexpansion of cancer clinical trials, to make those\n\n[[Page S8568]]\n\ntrials more available to the American people. We have a very important \nissue on provider discrimination and continuity of care. Senators \nCollins and Enzi will be responding later to the comments that were \njust made, which I thought were very positive in terms of what is \nnecessary and what the American people expect in terms of continuity of \ncare.\n  We want to address the fifth issue at this juncture, and that is the \npoint of service. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee, Dr. \nBill Frist, for his leadership and effort in this bill to craft a \nresponsible and effective piece of legislation that will increase \nprotections substantially for consumers' medical care and do so in a \nway that enhances the quality of that care. Dr. Frist is an \nextraordinary physician. He has given his life to medicine. He was the \nfirst person to do a lung transplant in the State of Tennessee--not an \ninconsiderable event. The thought of that is beyond my comprehension. \nAnd he has certainly provided great leadership here.\n\n  One of the concerns I have heard a lot about from my doctors and \ndentists in the State of Alabama is that closed plans prevent patients \nfrom having any opportunity to go outside that plan to seek another \nphysician, if that is whom they choose. As a Republican, and as an \nAmerican, I believe in achieving freedom as much as we possibly can and \ngiving people choices. So we have sought to listen to those physicians \nand dentists, to try to understand what they are saying and try to \nprovide that kind of option for Americans.\n  I am glad Dr. Frist and the leadership on this side have concurred \nthat we can take a major step forward, that we can say that every \nAmerican in one of these self-insured plans--not regulated by the \nState--can have the option to choose a plan that allows them to go \noutside that plan if they want to pay the extra expense to go to a \ndoctor who may charge more. They would pay the difference for that \nextra privilege. I think that is good policy. It promotes freedom, and \nin this day of computers and high technology, it is not impossible to \nmaintain the different accounting procedures that may be necessary to \nhandle a different offering in that regard.\n  So I am excited about this step. We already have a provision in our \nbill that is similar to this amendment, but it doesn't provide a \nguarantee it in the way this one would. After talking to physicians, \ndentists, and small business groups, we have decided to maintain an \nexemption from this provision for businesses with 50-employee or less. \nSmall businesses may be unduly burdened administratively as it may be \nmore difficult and time-consuming for them to process claims. \nFurthermore, we have discovered that fewer than 4 percent of people \ncovered under our bill are employed by these small businesses.\n  So, Mr. President, I am delighted to see this occur. I believe it \nwill have broad-based support. The cost is negligible --almost none--\nbecause if the person chooses the point of service option, they would \npay the additional cost for it.\n  I want to mention something and clarify an issue. The National \nAssociation of Insurance Commissioners testified on our bill and has \nwritten the Senate, a letter in March of this year, in which they state \nunequivocally that:\n\n       It is our belief that States should and will continue \n     efforts to develop creative, flexible market-sensitive \n     protections for health consumers in fully-insured plans, and \n     Congress should focus attention on those consumers who have \n     no protections in self-funded ERISA plans. The States have \n     already adopted statutory and regulatory protections for \n     consumers and fully-insured plans and have tailored these \n     protections to meet their State's consumer health care \n     marketplace. Many States are supplementing their existing \n     protections during the current legislative session [right \n     now], based upon particular circumstances within their \n     States. We do not want States to be preempted by \n     congressional or administrative actions.\n\n  What we are primarily concerned with regarding this piece of \nlegislation is Federal ERISA plans, which States cannot regulate. That \nis why we are here. We are going to leave the other plans to the States \nwho are already regulating them.\n  I see my time has expired. I will again express my delight that we \nare able now to say that the individuals who come in will be able to \nreceive point-of-service option.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I inquire on my time and will yield the \nSenator 2 minutes. This change will, of course, only be for the self-\nfunded program, and of course there are no changes in excluding any \nemployer that has less than 50 employees. That hasn't been changed, has \nit?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct. But we know, for example, in Alabama, \nonly 4 percent of the self-insured plans would fall under that group \nbecause most of the self-insured plans are for the larger businesses. \nWe have also found that, in Alabama, for example, 75 to 80 percent of \nthe state-regulated plans already offer point-of-service choice now. So \nit is not as critical as it might appear.\n  We don't want to see the trend go the other way. It could turn the \nother way. Physicians are afraid that HMOs will build up walls and \nblock out physicians and choice in the future. So they want this \nprotection. I think it is legitimate, and I think the Senator favors \nthat.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could continue, I yield myself another minute. Is \nthe Senator saying that of all the self-funded programs, only 4 percent \nhave fewer than 50 employees?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes. Actually, 4 percent less than 100.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Four percent less than a hundred. So, effectively, this \nwon't apply, I imagine, to any of the mom-and-pop small businesses; \nthey won't have those kinds of protections, will they, in Alabama?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Only four percent under our bill will not be guaranteed \nthat protection, but many are already providing it. Furthermore, 75 to \n80 percent of plans regulated by the state of Alabama plans do offer \nit.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What percentage of Alabama, just for my own information, \nworks in plants with less than 100 employees?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Most of those plants don't have self-insured, and they \nare already subject to State regulations.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So they wouldn't be affected by the Republican program \nin any event.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. In the State of Alabama, and in most States, I think, \nthe smaller companies use traditional plans that are subject to State \nregulations, I think our primary focus in this body has been to deal \nwith those plans that are not regulated.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the Senator from New York 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator for \nyielding.\n  We are coming to the close of this debate. The amendment the Senator \nfrom North Carolina and I offered on appeal has been replaced by a much \nweaker version. We allow an independent review process. We allow that, \nif your HMO should say to you, you can't have this medicine, you can't \nhave this procedure, you can't see this specialist, you would get an \nindependent review as to whether that was right or wrong.\n  Under the proposal that was passed by the other side, very simply, \nthat review will not exist except by somebody appointed by the HMO \nitself--not independent and not real. But, in general, in this debate, \nand what has happened again is what has happened this week, which is \nsimple, the insurance companies won and American families lost. As a \nresult of what we have done today, the vast majority of American \nfamilies will not get access to emergency rooms, access to specialists, \nthe right to appeal an unfair decision, the right to sue, and the right \nto have an OB/GYN physician be their primary care physician.\n  If we could sum up this debate, it is in two charts. It is in three \nlittle numbers. First, under the Democratic plan, 161 million people \nare affected. Under the Republican plan, 48 million people are \naffected--161 million or 48 million.\n  What do the American people want? My guess is they want as many \npeople covered as possible.\n  As for cost, it is $2 a month more. As the Senator from Massachusetts \nhas said repeatedly, that is not more than the cost of a Big Mac a \nmonth. We could cover all of these people, and we\n\n[[Page S8569]]\n\ncould have emergency room access, we could have access to a specialist, \nand a right to appeal an unfair decision.\n  I ask the American people to remember this day as a day when the \nSenate turned its back on them and their wishes; as a day when the \nspecial interests, particularly the insurance companies, prevailed over \ncommon sense and wisdom; as a day when this Senate chose to have only \n48 million people covered, not 161 million; and a day when this Senate \nsaid you can't get emergency room coverage, you can't get access to a \nspecialist, and you can't get the right to appeal an unfair decision by \nthe HMO because it cost $2 more a month per worker.\n  It is a sad day for the American people. It is a day when this body \nchooses to follow the whims of the insurance industry rather than the \ndesires of the American people.\n  Oh, yes. There are some placeboes. In fact, the bill we are passing \ntoday is a placebo. But by definition a placebo is only affected when \nthere is nothing wrong with the patient. If you are well and you are \nnever going to get sick, you love the Republican plan. But if you have \nhad to go through the agony and ordeal of having an HMO reject \nmedicines, doctors, and procedures that are desperately needed by you \nor a loved one, you will rue this day.\n  I say to my colleagues: Wake up. Our health care system is ill. A \nplacebo won't work. This bill is a placebo. Managed care needs real \nmedicine to become well again, and this placebo will not do the job.\n  It seems very clear to me that this will not be the last time we take \nup the Patients' Bill of Rights. The reason this won't be the last time \nwe will take up this bill is because the families of America will find \nout in the next year that the HMO beast has not been tamed, that the \ngood that HMOs have brought in terms of reducing costs is being \noutweighed by the bad in terms of cookie-cutter decisions made by \naccountants and not by doctors.\n  We will be back. We will argue this issue again and we will prevail \nbecause the American people want real medicine--not a placebo \nprescribed by the insurance industry.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I yield up to 5 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I guess, despite the rules of the Senate, \nwe all have our own rules that we apply to ourselves about what we say.\n  One of the problems is that if one side of the debate insists on \ngetting up and saying things that are verifiably false, we end up with \na shouting match going back and forth.\n  Our bill guarantees access to emergency care. Our bill guarantees \nthat any woman at any point at any time can get access to an OB/GYN \nphysician. Our bill deals with people under the Federal jurisdiction \nbecause the States have already done a very good job in dealing with \nthe people under their jurisdiction which they cannot reach without \nFederal action.\n  We have talked at great length. Our colleagues keep saying this bill \ncost $2 a month. The problem is that the Congressional Budget Office, \nthe nonpartisan budgeting arm of the Congress, says this bill will cost \n$72.5 billion, this bill will take insurance away from 1.9 million \nAmericans, and this bill will end up driving up costs for Americans who \nare able to keep their insurance.\n  Obviously, anyone who follows the debate around here realizes that \nDemocrats aren't very much worried about cost. But why are we so \nworried?\n  No. 1, we are worried about 1.9 million people losing their \ninsurance. We believe we can fix what is wrong with HMOs, and do it \nwithout driving up medical costs so much that people lose their health \ninsurance.\n  But I would like to make two final points which I think are critical \nto this entire debate. If you came from outer space this morning and \nyou listened to our Democratic colleagues, you would think they are \nopponents of HMOs. But let me read for you from congressional debate on \nFebruary 10, 1978. I quote:\n\n       I authored the first program of support for HMOs ever \n     passed in the Senate. The Carter administration has made the \n     promulgation of HMOs one of its major goals. Clearly HMOs \n     have done their job in proving themselves a highly desirable \n     mechanism for medical care delivery.\n\n  That is Senator Ted Kennedy. That is not Phil Gramm.\n  Our Democrat colleagues are the fathers and the mothers of HMOs. Yet \ntoday they have decided to vilify an institution they created. Rather \nthan fixing the problems that exist, they have decided, for political \nreasons, it would be basically a good idea to destroy HMOs.\n  Why are we concerned about destroying the private health care system? \nWhy are we so concerned about cost? The reason we are so concerned \nabout cost, the last time we had double-digit health care inflation, \nthe Democrats and President Clinton sent a health care bill to \nCongress, the Clinton health care bill, that would have had the \nGovernment take over and run the health care system, a bill that would \nhave required every American to buy their health care through a Federal \nhealth care collective.\n  Today, our Democrat colleagues are very concerned about ``medical \nnecessity.'' We have heard them talk about it all day long. When we \nopen the Clinton health care bill, which they supported, on page 86, it \nmentioned ``medical necessity'' under exclusions. Let me read their \nsolution to the problem of medical necessity when they wanted the \nGovernment to take over and run the health care system.\n  Their bill says, on page 86, line 10, under ``Exclusions'':\n\n       Medical necessity. The comprehensive benefit package does \n     not include any item or service that the National Health \n     Board may determine is not medically necessary.\n\n  Today, our dear Democrat colleagues are all concerned about ``medical \nnecessity,'' but when they wanted the Government to take over and run \nthe health care system they defined medical necessity as whatever the \nNational Health Board determined it to be, and the National Health \nBoard was the Federal Government.\n  Today, our colleagues have gone on and on about medical access and \npoint of service. When the inflation rate on health care was above \ndouble digit and they proposed having the Government take over the \nhealth care system, do you know what their point of service option was? \nIf you didn't join the Government plan, you got fined $5,000. The \nchoice they provided in their point-of-service option is if the doctor \nwho had to work for the Federal Government provided care he felt you \nneeded but their Government health board felt you didn't need, he got \nfined $50,000 for doing that. If he provided a service they didn't \nallow and you paid privately for it, the physician could go to prison \nfor 15 years.\n  Now, the same people who proposed all these things and came within a \nheartbeat of forcing Americans into this totalitarian system because \nthey wanted to deal with inflation and access, today they are proposing \nlegislation that would drive the inflation rate up by 6.1 percent and \nwould, by Congressional Budget Office numbers, force 1.9 million people \nto lose their health insurance.\n  Why are we so concerned about starting runaway medical inflation \nagain? Part of it is because we care about the people who lose \ninsurance. Part of it is because we care about the $72.5 billion in \ncosts for people who get to keep their insurance. But a lot of it is \nbecause we remember what Bill Clinton and the Democrats wanted to do \nthe last time we had runaway medical inflation.\n  I am sorry, but I have a very hard time listening to my Democrat \ncolleagues talk about medical necessity when only a few years ago they \nproposed to let Government define what medical necessity was, and if \ntheir board didn't say it was necessary, you didn't get it. I have a \nvery hard time listening to them talk about a point-of-service option \nwhen virtually every one of them supported and cosponsored a bill that \nwould have put a physician in prison for 15 years for providing a \nservice that their Government board said was not needed.\n  In listening to our colleagues, it's easy to forget their support of \nlegislation for the last 25 years that created HMOs. One forgets they \nlove HMOs so much that they tried in 1994 to force every American into \nan HMO run by the Government. And one forgets that\n\n[[Page S8570]]\n\nthey were so concerned about patients rights they let the National \nHealth Board determine what was medically necessary with no review \nwhatever, and they put a doctor in prison for 15 years if he didn't \ncomply with their rules.\n  There is a certain disconnect between what they are saying today and \nwhat they have proposed in the past.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I yield myself 8 minutes, and I ask to be notified at \nthe conclusion of 8 minutes, and at the conclusion of my time, I yield \n6 minutes to the Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I respectfully suggest we have been going \nback and forth and we have had Members waiting for well over an hour. \nIt is not appropriate to yield to successive people. It should be our \ntime.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. How much time does the Senator desire?\n  Mr. REID. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Oregon, who has been \nhere for about 3 hours.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am very sorry. I didn't intend to deprive him of that \nopportunity. When I came in, I failed to observe him in the Chamber. I \nam happy to have him go ahead.\n  Mr. REID. I know the Senator from Oregon has been here a long time, \nbut the Senator from Connecticut left a hearing and came to speak on \nthe clinical trials.\n  Would the Senator allow the Senator from Connecticut to speak next?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is yielded for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from Oregon. I \napologize for not being here during the presentation of the amendment \ndealing with clinical trials by my friend and colleague from Florida, \nSenator Mack. He made numerous references to the amendment I offered \nyesterday, and I want to address those concerns.\n  While I have deep appreciation for the motivations behind the \namendment offered by our colleague from Tennessee, Senator Frist--and I \nwill speak specifically on the issue of the clinical trials--the \namendment offered by Senator Mack, if you look at it in the totality, \nsays no to 9 out of 10 people in this country. How does that work, 9 \nout of 10?\n  The clinical trials are limited to cancer therapies only; only for \ncancer. We all agree we ought to have clinical trials for cancer. No \none disagrees with that. In a way, it is very cruel to say we can have \nexperimental testing for cancer patients, but we cannot for people with \nAIDS, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and heart and lung disease. A long \nlist of patients are excluded.\n  Today, if you are watching this debate and you have cancer and this \namendment is adopted, you are OK, but God help you if you fall outside \nthe cancer area and you need the clinical trials, or you want to get \ninvolved in that because it could save your life, save your wife's \nlife, or your child's life. You would like to get in the clinical \ntrials. If you adopt this amendment, you cannot.\n  The argument is, we need to study the issue more. If we need to study \nclinical trials, why make an exception for cancer? If we don't need to \nstudy the clinical trials for cancer, it seems to me we don't need to \nstudy them when it comes to other life-threatening, devastating \ndiseases where the only option can be the clinical trial.\n  As I said to my colleagues yesterday, this is the only option we \noffer in our amendment. It has to be clinical trials approved by NIH or \nthe Department of Defense or by the Veterans Administration. There must \nbe no other alternative available, and it only picks up routine costs. \nThe cost of drugs and medical devices is not included.\n  I don't understand how we say to someone with mental illness, \nosteoporosis, cystic fibrosis, multiple sclerosis, stroke, blindness, \narthritis, Lou Gehrig's disease, and more areas where clinical trials \ncan make a difference for people. By adopting this amendment, we are \nexcluding the option of people to utilize what may be the only avenue \navailable to them to save their lives or the lives of their family.\n  Obviously, we acquire necessary information that allows a product or \na device to become available to the public at large, saving future \ngenerations.\n  So I urge my colleagues, with all due respect, while it is hard to \nargue with this limited amendment, we will have a broader amendment \nthat covers all of these areas which are so critically important to \npeople.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator pointed out for those who might be watching \nthat if they had cancer, this amendment, if agreed to, would at least \nassure them of coverage. Of course, two-thirds of those individuals \nwill not be in the plans that would be covered by this proposal. So \ntwo-thirds of those who have cancer, on the face of it, would not be \nprotected. Contrast this with the amendment the Senator from \nConnecticut offered, which would have applied to all private health \nplans and would have included all diseases.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. DODD. I deeply appreciate the Senator from Massachusetts raising \nthat point. He is absolutely correct. It does cover the cancer patient, \nprovided you are part of that small minority that gets coverage. But if \nyou are part of the 113 million and have cancer, you are out. It is an \nimportant point to make. If you are part of the 48 million, you are out \nthere completely. You are just gone. I think this is a tragedy.\n  Every single cancer group in this country does not support this \namendment. No cancer group at all endorses this amendment because they \nunderstand it is a great deprivation and liability to their efforts. \nThey understand how important it is to cover these other illnesses as \nwell. These groups, by the way, also have supported unanimously the \namendment we offered, which would have covered clinical trials for all \npatients.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The additional minute of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent for half a minute.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. On this issue, on the clinical trials, to deny people \nacross the board the ability to access clinical trials is one of the \ngreat shortcomings of the Republican proposal here. This will do a lot \nof damage to an awful lot of people, unnecessarily. The application of \nclinical trials is the only course available to people to save their \nlives and to save future lives. By excluding AIDS and the other \ndiseases I have mentioned from the clinical trial approach, not to \nmention 113 million people who are excluded, we do a great disservice, \nat the end of this century, to people who expect more of this body.\n  I urge the rejection of this amendment.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, well over 2 hours ago I offered the first-\ndegree amendment that deals with an issue that ought to be totally \nnonpartisan, and that is protecting the relationship between health \ncare professionals and their patients. The distinguished Senator from \nTexas is on the floor. I think he illustrated what the debate has now \nbecome. He wanted to talk about the Clinton health care plan of 1994. \nWhat my colleagues and I are here to talk about is giving patients and \ntheir families a voice in 1999.\n  In over 2 hours of discussion on the floor of the Senate, there has \nnot been one argument--not one argument--advanced against our provision \ninvolving gag clauses; not one argument advanced against our provision \nprotecting the providers from retaliation; not one argument advanced as \nit relates to this matter of making sure there are not financial \nincentives to keep the patients in the dark.\n  In 2 hours on the floor of the Senate, not one single argument was \nmade against those positions. I think it is because the Senate \nunderstands that the free flow of information between patients and \nhealth care providers is at the heart of what we want for our health \ncare system. It is also what this country is all about. It is what the \nfirst amendment is all about.\n  I know this has been a very hard debate to follow. We have had \ndiscussions about HCFA. We have had discussions\n\n[[Page S8571]]\n\nabout the Clinton health care plan of 1994. We have heard discussions \nabout costs, about making sure that patients get all the information \nfrom their health care providers, and that providers are free from \nretaliation when they do give out that information, that is not going \nto cost a good health care plan a penny. Maybe if you are offering poor \nquality care it may end up costing you a little bit of money but giving \npeople information, protecting their first amendment rights, is not \ngoing to cost a penny.\n  I am very hopeful our colleagues, when we get back to it, will \nsupport the first-degree amendment that was before the Senate a little \nover 2 hours ago, and recognize that, in the space of that time, not \none single argument--not one--has been advanced against the idea that \nthere ought to be a free flow of information. We ought to protect the \nrelationship between health professionals and their patients.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I yield myself 6 minutes. I ask to be \ninformed at the conclusion of the 6 minutes.\n  By agreement, I believe Senator Collins was to have 6 minutes at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Republican Members for their \neffort on assembling a very good plan. It is a plan designed to protect \nthe interests of individuals who receive their health care through \nHMOs. It is designed so that, if the HMO denies a particular kind of \ntreatment as not being necessary, there is an appeals process, and the \nappeals process is first to the HMO, asking them to correct a faulty \ndecision. But if the HMO does not respond constructively, there is an \nappeal to an independent appellate authority, an independent appeals \nofficer.\n  I wanted to make sure the Republican bill's effort to have this \nappeals process, which gives people the chance to make sure they are \ntreated fairly, has the right enforcement to it. The right enforcement, \nin my judgment, is to send people to treatment, not to send people to \ntrial. It would be possible to have a big legal arrangement where the \nperson does not get treatment, they die, and the relatives then go to \ncourt. Instead of getting treatment, you get a trial and you may get a \nlot of money, but you have a dead relative. I think it is important to \nunderstand this is a health care effort we are waging.\n  So I wanted to do some things to strengthen the enforcement \nprovisions in the Republican proposal which relate to the external \nreview. That is the final appeal to a person outside the HMO, a \nqualified individual. This is what I think we must do.\n\n  First of all, we must make sure that the HMO acts promptly. While the \nRepublican bill provides there should be certain designations within 5 \ndays, there is a place where the HMO has to provide the reviewer, or \nthe appeal authority, with the documents of the case. We put in a time \nlimit on that. We put in a stiff penalty for failure to meet that time \nlimit. It simply is saying we will not allow an HMO to drag its feet in \norder to avoid the review by an independent authority. So I wanted to \nmake sure we had that.\n  Second, I want to make sure the person whose case is being reviewed \nhas the right to present evidence to the appeal authority. I think this \nis implicit in the Republican bill, but I want it to be explicitly \nstated that when a person files a review petition, they have the right \nto say this is the reason you should set aside your judgment; this is \nthe reason you should make a determination that the treatment is \nappropriate in my case--not only the person but the doctor who made the \noriginal decision. And that is important as well, making sure they are \ninvolved.\n  Then I want to make sure the person conducting the review of a \nphysician's work would be a qualified physician or would be a person \nwho was qualified to be the same kind of specialist the treating \nphysician was so we would not have some bureaucrat or some individual \nwho was interested in or more well trained, perhaps, in business making \njudgments about things that were medical. That is provided for in this \nparticular matter. So it makes it clear we want to have the physician \ndoing the kind of assessment in the appellate process.\n  However, I wanted also to make sure we had HMOs willing to carry \nthrough on the decision of the appeals process. I thought to myself, \nwhat if the patient lost the appeal in the HMO, made the appeal to the \nexternal authority--and this can be done very rapidly because the \ntimeframes are tight in this instance, and should be, and we always \ninclude even expedited timeframes for medical exigencies-- what if the \nappeal goes to the external appeal authority and then the HMO refuses \nto provide the treatment in spite of the determination by the external \nauthority?\n\n  One option in that situation, I suppose, would be to say you go to \ncourt. But if you are sick and you call an ambulance, you expect the \nambulance driver to take you to the hospital, not to the courtroom. \nWhat we need for people is not to be provided with a trial; we need \npeople to be provided with treatment.\n  What we have done in this amendment is simply this: If you had this \nopportunity for an expeditious appeal that has gone through the HMO and \nthe external authority, the external appeal officer is to write in any \nappellate decision a date by which treatment is to be commenced. If \ntreatment is not commenced as of that date, the system converts to a \nfee-for-service system so the patient has the right to get whatever \nservice is needed at the expense of the provider which failed to \nprovide it in accordance with the directive of the appellate officer.\n  Furthermore, it provides a penalty, an immediate $10,000 payment to \nthe patient--not to the Government, not to the Department of Labor, not \nto an administrating bureaucracy--to the patient for having been \ndislocated and for having arranged for other things.\n  The business of the HMO is to arrange for medical services, and this \nis a plan which simply says we are going to deliver to people medical \nservices. We are not going to deliver them somewhere else. We do not \nwant you to end up with a good lawsuit; we want you to end up with good \nhealth care. And if the HMO does not provide the health care in \naccordance with the appeal, then it is time we turn loose the patient \nwho paid the premium, and that patient has the right to access the care \nof his or her choice to get it done, and the responsibility of payment \nfor that falls upon the noncomplying health care provider in the HMO. \nThat makes sense. Instead of getting a good lawsuit because you did not \nget health treatment and you got sick, you get good treatment. It seems \nto me that should be the objective to have. That is basically what we \nhave done.\n  We have made sure there are time lines.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 6 minutes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, that is kind of you, and I yield myself \nan extra 30 seconds. We made sure there are enforceable time lines. We \nhave made sure physicians will be the appeals officers on the work of \nphysicians. We have made sure the responsibility to deliver the process \nto the appellate appeals officers, both internal and external, is \nexpedited. And we have made sure, in the event of noncompliance, the \npatient gets treatment. We convert the system to fee for service, and \nyou can access treatment on your own.\n  It is with that in mind that I am pleased to conclude my remarks and \nyield to the Senator from Florida 5 minutes for his remarks.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am not sure I need 5 minutes. I could not \nhelp but listen very closely to my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle with respect to the issue of clinical trials and the idea of \ntargeting clinical trials to cancer.\n  One could draw the conclusion from what they had to say either they \nnever heard of the idea of targeting clinical trials to cancer or there \nwas some confusion. I remind my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle who have supported a clinical trial expansion of the Medicare \nprogram that is limited to only cancer --let me say that again. The \nclinical trial legislation that Senator Rockefeller and I introduced \nearlier this year is limited to cancer only; just as this amendment is \nlimited to cancer: Senator Feinstein, Senator Sarbanes, Senator \nJohnson, Senator\n\n[[Page S8572]]\n\nBingaman, Senator Kerry, Senator Leahy, Senator Kerrey, Senator \nSchumer, Senator Akaka, Senator Murray, Senator Breaux, Senator \nMikulski, Senator Conrad, Senator Wellstone, Senator Moynihan, Senator \nInouye, Senator Graham, Senator Harkin, Senator Kennedy, Senator Boxer, \nSenator Durbin, Senator Robb, Senator Biden, Senator Dodd, and Senator \nHollings.\n  I submit that one of the reasons we have this not only in this \namendment but also in the Medicare approach is because there is truly a \nconcern about what the true cost of clinical trials is. As I said in my \nearlier comment, Senator Rockefeller and I happen to believe the cost \nis quite small. In fact, there are arguments out there that Medicare is \nalready picking up the cost of those clinical trials. We have limited \nit to cancer because we, in fact, believe we can develop information \nthat will allow us to expand it.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. MACK. If the Senator would wait. What I have found, as I have \nlistened to this debate now for 4 days, is the term \n``compartmentalization'' comes back into my mind: The ability on the \nother side of the aisle to think of one procedure, one amendment, one \nconcept at a time, as if it has no influence or no effect on the cost \nof health care and what it might do to those individuals who could lose \ntheir health care coverage because of increased costs. It is very \nreasonable to ask the question: What does it cost; how do you define \ncertain aspects of the clinical trial that is going to take place?\n  I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for yielding. I suppose the best \nevidence I can offer is, in fact, a significant number of HMOs today \nare offering full clinical trials. What we are talking about are the \nfew who are not. My amendment is not designed to deal with every HMO. \nMost of them today provide clinical trials on a wide array of issues. \nWe are, by our amendment, saying: Shouldn't those few HMOs that are not \ndoing this do what the others are doing?\n  Sloan-Kettering and M.D. Anderson cancer research centers did \nindependent studies on costs. I think they are world-class \ninstitutions. Their conclusion was the clinical trial was less, lower \ncost----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 5 minutes allotted to the Senator from \nFlorida has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask the Senator have an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. MACK. Can I inquire who is going to use that minute?\n  Mr. DODD. Two minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 2 minutes, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague. Mr. President, let me know when I \nhave a minute and give the Senator from Florida a minute to respond to \nwhat I am saying.\n\n  The CBO estimates 12 cents per patient per month. That is their \nestimate. Sloan-Kettering and M.D. Anderson say it is lower than \nstandard cost, less than the cost that would be otherwise. We limit, by \nthe way, how the clinical trials are approached so that you have to \nhave no other available option. It has to be life-threatening. It is \nonly NIH, Department of Defense, and Veterans Affairs.\n  We have narrowed it and also said, as important as cancer is--and I \nam a cosponsor of the bill of the Senator from Florida, but I hope my \ncosponsoring of clinical trials for cancer is not interpreted to mean \nthat I do not think there ought to be clinical trials for diabetes or \nAIDS or mental illness or heart and lung disease or multiple sclerosis \nosteoporosis--all these other areas in which it can make a difference. \nI applaud my colleague for his bill. That was to deal with cancer, but \nwe do not exclude these other options which most are doing today. Most \nare, but this is for the few that do not.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes. I know we have a \nnumber of other speakers on the floor. After our discussion two nights \nago, I looked at the two studies the Senator from Connecticut used. \nThis is one of the problems. There is not good data on what are routine \ncosts. I went through this the other night. I cannot be any clearer.\n  I have personally read the studies, as many as I could find. The two \npresentations you made in the data on how much money it saves is not \npeer review. It has not been published, to the best of my knowledge. \nBoth are presentations made on May 7, 1999, at the National Coalition \nfor Cancer Research. The data probably is good, but I cannot go back \nand see what the methodology is. Let me say that is the problem, that \nthere are only three prospective, randomized clinical trials I could \nfind and we were able to find in the committee. There may be more \ntrials out there. But three clinical trials, not the ones you are \ntalking about, that, again, show the cost, with some variation, might \nbe zero--I am not sure what the lowest is--but up to 10 percent.\n  Mr. DODD. Both Sloan-Kettering and M.D. Anderson, did they say it is \nlower cost? Am I accurate?\n  Mr. FRIST. You are exactly right. I do not question the data. But it \nis unpublished data with no explanation given for methodology on either \none. The cost of clinical research in the M.D. Anderson study or the \nSloan-Kettering study--no details were given about methodology. So, \nyes, you say it is cheaper, but I have no idea how they determined \nthat, whether they are accurate or not.\n  To the best of my knowledge, that has not been peer-reviewed. All \nthat does not matter very much, except when you go back to an earlier \nquestion of why we focus on just cancer. I was not on the floor, but I \nhad heard the argument, why not other diseases, such as Alzheimer's and \ncardiovascular disease, and others? I think that is legitimate.\n  Let me tell you my rationale for starting with something that is \nfocused. The NIH has about 6,000--maybe it is 5,000; maybe 7,000--\nclinical trials out there, about 6,000 and 2,000--1 out of 3--are in \ncancer. The others are scattered among different disease processes.\n  So we said, since we do not know what the routine costs are --the \nother day I talked about the difficulty of defining ``incremental \ncosts,'' using the example of medical devices. There are no studies--\nprospective, randomized clinical trials--to know what the incremental \ncosts are for devices.\n\n  So what we are arguing is, instead of opening that door broadly, to \nstart with a foundation of information about which we know. The \nclinical studies on routine costs all apply to cancer, which happens to \nbe about one out of three trials that are out there today.\n  That is the base we are going to start with as we get into this \nsubsidy--a good subsidy--that is in our private health care system \nwhich is passed on by increased premiums, or some way you are taxing \npeople out in the private sector who are listening to this right now. \nWe are going to tax you to pay for these trials.\n  We simply say, let's do it in a systematic way, starting with the \nbody of knowledge we know about, which happens to be in cancer, and \nthen letting it expand, potentially, over time based on our findings.\n  One last thing, in our amendment, as was pointed out, we also have a \nstudy, a very important study, that will expand so we will not have \nthree studies. You will not be presenting data that has not been \npublished yet, which I think is part of our amendment.\n  I will yield to the Senator from Florida, and then we will come back.\n  Mr. DODD. Just to make a couple quick points.\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. I believe the Senator from Florida has been graciously \ngiven 1 minute by Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield at this time?\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield and reserve my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Florida has 1 \nminute. Then I would be glad to yield another minute and a half to the \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. First of all, the impression created that HMOs or most HMOs \ncover all clinical trials is inaccurate.\n  There is a second component to this thing. ERISA plans versus the \nplans that we have control over may be confusing the issue as well.\n  In addition, though, I think it is important to focus. Again, this \ndiscussion has come down to a discussion about cost. I happen to agree \nwith the Senator from Connecticut about the data that we have from \nthose two health organizations. But I think he knows as\n\n[[Page S8573]]\n\nwell that there are those out there who make claims that the cost of \nthe clinical trials would be substantially higher than that--from OMB, \nCBO, the administration.\n  So the point is that there is a legitimate debate about the cost of \nclinical trials. I am saying I think, before we go to the full extent \nof comprehensive coverage, we ought to fully understand what we are \ngetting ourselves involved in.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me just say, the Congressional Budget Office estimates \nthat 90 percent of HMOs provide broad-based clinical trials. They did \nthe study on the 12-cent per month cost; and 90 percent do. Our \namendment deals with a handful who are not.\n  Ironically, the adoption of this amendment may encourage some of \nthese HMOs that are today providing clinical trials across the board to \nreduce actually the number they provide. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, I say to my friend and colleague from Tennessee, these HMOs, \nthe 90 percent that are providing broad-based clinical trials, have \nobviously done an economic study or they would not do it. They are not \nmandated under current law to do it. So the vast majority providing \nclinical trials beyond just cancer have, obviously, made the financial \ncalculation that this is something they can afford to do. So in \naddition to Sloan-Kettering, M.D. Anderson, and the Congressional \nBudget Office--the costs are relatively low. They are providing the \nbenefit.\n  What we were saying in the amendment that was defeated yesterday is \nyou ought to be for those 10 percent or 12 percent that are not \nproviding the clinical trials in these other areas. You ought to do so. \nThat is the distinction, and there is ample data.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask Senator Kennedy, does he have somebody from his \nside?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield Senators Harkin and Bingaman 1 \nminute each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, earlier today Senator Bingaman and I \noffered an amendment to provide nondiscrimination, so the plans could \nnot discriminate against providers on the basis of their license or \ncertification.\n  Now I see the Republicans have offered that amendment. I read through \nit. It is almost word for word the same as ours. Gee, here is an \namendment I could vote for on the Republican side, until I read the \nfine print. What is the fine print? The fine print is this: Senator \nBingaman, in our amendment, covers 161 million people; the Republicans' \namendment covers only 48 million people.\n  It is sort of like this. A doctor prescribes an antibiotic for you to \ntake every day for 7 days. The Republicans come in and say you can only \ntake it for 2 days. It is probably better than nothing, but it is not \ngoing to cure the illness.\n  The Republican amendment on provider nondiscrimination is not going \nto cure the discrimination against chiropractors, against optometrists, \nagainst nurses and nurse practitioners, and physicians assistants. That \nis why I cannot support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 1 minute has expired.\n  The Senator from New Mexico has 1 minute.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the manager of the bill.\n  Let me add one other thing. We need to ask, who are the 48 million \npeople who are covered under the Republican plan and under this \namendment they have offered on nondiscrimination against providers? \nThey are people who work for large employers primarily who are self-\ninsured. The employers have their own insurance programs.\n\n  Unfortunately, in my State, there are very few of those large \nemployers. You have to have over 100 employees, essentially, before it \nmakes any sense to be self-insured.\n  In New Mexico, people work for small employers, by and large. Even \nthose who work for larger employers generally are not working for self-\ninsured employers. Essentially, the folks I am representing in the \nSenate are not going to be covered by the amendment as it is offered. I \nthink this is a serious defect.\n  There is one other thing I want to say in relation to Senator Dodd's \npoint. The American Cancer Society does not support an amendment or \nprovision that does not apply to all insured individuals, that requires \na commission to determine routine patient costs, and delays access to \nclinical trials until the year 2001. The American Cancer Society \nmaintains that all patients with a serious and life-threatening illness \nshould have assured access and reimbursement for clinical trials.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield the Senator from Maine 5 minutes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  This amendment includes two provisions that are intended to \nstrengthen the Patients' Bill of Rights that was reported by the Senate \nHELP Committee. We do not have much time, but I would like to take a \nmoment to describe two of the provisions that are of particular concern \nand interest to me.\n  First, our amendment includes provider nondiscrimination language. \nDuring the HELP Committee markup, as the Senator from New Mexico will \nrecall, I pledged I would attempt to come up with language on the floor \nbecause we shared many of the same concerns, reflecting, I think, the \npopulations of our State. So we have done just that.\n  The exclusion of a class of providers solely on the basis of their \nlicense or certification unfairly restricts patients' access to \nqualified professionals who are licensed and certified by the various \n50 States. This is a very important issue in rural areas because there \nmay not be a sufficient supply of physicians to provide the care that \nthe health plan has promised. In these areas, if, for example, a plan \ndiscriminates against optometrists, the result may be that patients \nhave to travel long distances in order to get eye care or, conversely, \nthey have to pay out of their own pockets for services that are \nsupposed to be covered benefits.\n  Maine, for example, has optometrists in virtually every community in \nthe State, but we have very few ophthalmologists, and they are located \nprimarily in southern Maine, primarily in our larger cities.\n  In 1982, 17 years ago, to respond to this problem, Maine specifically \npassed legislation requiring State-regulated health plans to have \nnondiscrimination language with regard to optometrists. The Republican \namendment tracks similar protections that are provided for Medicare and \nMedicaid beneficiaries in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n  Our amendment would prohibit federally regulated group health plans \nfrom arbitrarily excluding providers, based solely on their licensure \nor certification, from providing services for benefits that are covered \nby the plan.\n  Let me be clear about what this amendment does not do. It does not \nrequire the plans to cover new services just because the State may \nlicense a health care professional in that area. For example, there are \nsome States which license aromatherapists. Just because aromatherapists \nmay be licensed by a State doesn't mean the health plan has to cover \nthose kinds of services. Moreover, nothing in our amendment would \nrequire the health plan to reimburse physicians and nonphysicians at \nthe same rate.\n  The amendment also makes clear--and this is really critical--that \nthis provision is a nondiscrimination provision. But it is not a \nwilling provider requirement. It does not require health plans to take \nall comers. It simply says that a managed care plan cannot exclude a \nhealth care professional's entry into that plan solely on the basis of \nlicensure or certification. Senator Grassley, Senator Hatch, Senator \nJeffords, and Senator Enzi have all worked with me on drafting this \nprovision.\n  The second provision, which is of particular concern to me, improves \nupon the continuity of care provisions in the HELP Committee bill. Our \namendment would affect the legislation in two different ways.\n  First, it recognizes that it would be unconscionable to require a \npatient\n\n[[Page S8574]]\n\nwho is terminally ill to change health care providers in the final \nmonths of life just because the health plan either stopped contracting \nwith that particular provider or the employer providing the health plan \nswitched plans, thus causing a change in the providers under contract. \nOur proposal would extend the transition period for patients who are \nterminally ill from 90 days until the end of life. This proposal is one \nthat I know is of concern to Senator Mikulski, and it is something on \nwhich I completely agree with her.\n  Second, it would require a comprehensive study--I don't believe this \nis part of the Democratic proposal--into the appropriate thresholds, \ncosts, and quality implications of moving away from the current narrow \ndefinition in Medicare of who is considered terminally ill and toward a \ndefinition that better identifies those with serious and complex \nillnesses. This study was suggested by the group, Americans for Better \nCare of the Dying. Senator Jay Rockefeller and I have worked with this \ngroup in proposing our end-of-life care legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute from the \nunderlying bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 1 additional minute from the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. This study, as I said, was suggested by the group, \nAmericans for Better Care of the Dying. It is intended to help us shift \nthe paradigm in this country of how we view serious illness. Medicare \ncurrently defines terminally ill people as those having no more than 6 \nmonths to live. It is often very difficult to predict with any \ncertainty how long exactly a seriously ill person is likely to live. \nThis study will help us to provide better care for that broader \ncategory of patients who are terminally ill and have the need for more \ncoordinated care but who may well live longer than a 6-month period.\n  I thank Senator Enzi and Senator Grassley for their work and joining \nwith me in improving the continuity of care provisions of the bill.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to address provisions included in \nthis amendment on behalf of Senators Ashcroft, Kyl, and myself. These \nprovisions concern external review of denial of coverage. In my view, \nthey will improve the underlying Republican proposal in several \nimportant respects.\n  Mr. President, I believe the Republican proposal takes the steps \nnecessary to ensure that every American has access to high quality \nmedical care. In my view, the overriding goal of this legislation is to \nempower patients and their physicians. By putting medical \nconsiderations first, we will protect patients against arbitrary \nactions by health care bureaucrats. Republicans have put in place an \nexternal review procedure which will guarantee a patient's right to \nappeal adverse decisions by providers and to receive the care he or she \ndeserves.\n  The purpose of an external review is to ensure that an unbiased, \nmedical opinion can be offered when coverage has been denied on the \nbasis of medical necessity and appropriateness or because a treatment \nis considered experimental. The changes contained in this amendment \nwill guarantee an unbiased, timely and appropriate decision and I \nbelieve they will help ensure that the external review process works \neffectively. In particular, I would like to focus on three changes \nwhich resolve issues that were brought to my attention by the Michigan \nState Medical Society:\n  First, we clarify that appeals which are considered emergencies be \nmade with the expediency necessary for the emergency, but in no case \nshould the emergency decision take longer than 72 hours.\n  This clarifying language ensures that decisions are made in an \nexpedient fashion, especially in case of emergencies.\n  Second, the amendment language clarifies that the independent, \nexternal reviewer shall be a physician in the same specialty area \ndictated by the case in question. This only makes sense, Mr. President, \nand I appreciate the sponsors willingness to clarify the language in \nthis regard.\n  Third, in the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus, the independent external \nreviewer must take into consideration several factors in making his or \nher final decision. Some of those factors include: Any evidence-based \ndecision making or clinical practice guidelines used by the group \nhealth plan or health insurance issuer; timely evidence or information \nsubmitted by the plan, issuer, patient or patient's physician; the \npatient's medical record; and expert consensus and medical literature.\n  This amendment clarifies that expert consensus includes both \ngenerally accepted medical practice and recognized best practice.\n  Senators Kyl and Ashcroft have also included other provisions to \ntighten the external appeal process which I support. I note my full \nsupport for these provisions and ask my colleagues to support them as \nwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the majority has about 2 minutes remaining \non the amendment. The minority has about 15 minutes--about 12 minutes, \nI am sorry. So with the permission of the manager of the bill, I yield \n3 minutes----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. \nWellstone; 3 minutes to the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Bob Kerrey; and \n3 minutes to the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Edwards.\n  Mr. KERREY. Would the Senator mind if the Senator from Nebraska went \nfirst?\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will withhold.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Does the Senator intend to go one after the other?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, since the majority has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I want to accommodate the Senator from Wyoming--we only \nhave a couple of minutes left--if he could speak now.\n  Go ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Maine heading for \nthe door. With great respect for her, I want her to hear this \nobservation. She talked about continuity of care and said that she and \nSenator Grassley and Senator Enzi had worked on language in this \namendment that provided continuity of care for people with terminal \nillness. I call her attention to pages 49 and 50 of this bill. It does \nnot do that. It says specifically, under terminal illness, it is \nsubject to paragraph 1, which says the general rule is just for up to \n90 days. The only exception under continuity of care with this bill is \nfor pregnancy, which was in the original bill.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Will the Senator yield for a clarification on that?\n  Mr. KERREY. I only have 3 minutes. I am sorry.\n  I call the Senator's attention to continuity of care. Look at the \nlanguage of the bill because on page 49 it describes this transitional \nperiod.\n  This is something that is very important to me. I received health \ncare in 1969 after I was injured in Vietnam. I have a very passionate \nconcern for people now who are in managed care.\n  I must say, the problem we are experiencing with managed care is not \nself-funded ERISA plans. That is what the Republican proposal is going \nto do. It is going to solve almost a nonexistent problem that may, in \nfact, as a consequence of setting the bar low, encourage people who are \nin HMOs and who are in the marketplace providing those plans to say: I \nsee the bar is low; we are going down to that lower standard. That is a \nmajor concern I have with this proposal. It does not cover the plans \nthat are the biggest problem.\n  I call your attention to pages 49 and 50. Under the continuity of \ncare provisions, the only continuity of care that would be provided \nwould be women who are pregnant. They could go beyond 90 days under \nthis provision, but those who were terminal would not. Terminal illness \nis subject to paragraph 1, according to the language of the bill \nitself, which does not provide for an extension.\n\n  Our proposal would go beyond those three general categories, not just \nterminal illness, not just institutionalized\n\n[[Page S8575]]\n\npeople, not just women who are pregnant--all three reasonable--and \ncertainly not just self-funded ERISA plans, which are hardly receiving \nany complaints at all.\n  That is the odd thing about this debate. We are going to take care of \na problem that doesn't exist under the guise of--I have heard people \ncome down saying: We are going to address a problem with HMOs. Well, \nyou would address the problem of HMOs if you changed your bill.\n  This bill doesn't take care of HMOs. It takes care of self-funded \nERISA plans. Go to your mailbox and see if you have any complaints \nabout self-funded ERISA plans. You won't find any complaints about \nthat. The complaints are about HMOs.\n  We have watched the market move more and more into business decisions \nwhen it comes to health care. And I am for the market. I like what the \nmarket can do. When we regulate the market, we say----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 3 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. KERREY. I will come back to this later, Mr. President. This bill \ndoes not provide continuity of care except for pregnancy. Those with \nother health problems would not be covered under this proposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I came to the floor earlier today and \nsaid I have a proposition for my colleagues. It is this: Let's give \npeople freedom of choice. If people have paid extra premiums and their \nemployer should shift insurance company plan or managed care plan, and \nthey want to be able to take their children to the same family doctor \nthey have been going to for 10 years, they ought to be able to do so.\n  I waited for the response.\n  Now I notice my colleagues on the other side of the aisle come out \nhere with an amendment and they say this deals with the problem. First \nof all, they give freedom of choice to 48 million Americans, one-third \nof those who would be eligible. Only 48 million people in self-insured \nplans are covered. Another 115 million people aren't covered.\n  Two-thirds of the families in our country that need some protection \nand need freedom of choice aren't covered. Then I look at this bill and \nI notice that even among the 48 million people, if you were in a plan \nwhere you are working for an employer with fewer than 50 employees, you \nwould not be covered. Subtract that number of Americans. Now we are \nwell below 48 million people, well below one-third of the citizens in \nthis country.\n  Finally--and I don't even know what this means, but we need to look \nat the fine print--they have an exception in terms of points of service \nor freedom of choice:\n\n       It shall not apply with respect to a group health plan \n     other than a fully insured group health plan if care relating \n     to point of service coverage would not be available and \n     accessible to the participant with reasonable promptness.\n\n  I have absolutely no idea what that means. Obviously, consumers and \nfamilies would be going to a doctor who would be prompt in giving them \nor their children the care they need, unless this is some kind of an \nopen-ended escape clause.\n  I am telling you, the more the people look at the fine print and the \ndetail of what the Republicans are offering on the floor of the Senate, \nthe more they will see a consistent pattern: Offer as little as \npossible, covering as few people as possible, with as little protection \nas possible, so you don't offend the insurance industry.\n  That is what it is all about. We should be representing the people in \nour States. We should be advocates for people in our States. We should \nbe advocates for families, advocates for children. We don't need to be \nadvocates for the insurance companies. They already have plenty of \nclout.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will yield our final 3 minutes to the \nSenator from North Carolina.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the underlying amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, let me address the external appeals part \nof this amendment. Yesterday afternoon, we had a debate, at which time \nI brought to the attention of my colleagues on the other side the fact \nthat, essentially, we had no enforcement mechanism for any of the \nprovisions passed because there was no meaningful external review, the \nreason being insurance companies got to write the language on what is \nmedically necessary, and the only thing that was appealable was what is \nmedically necessary.\n  That being the case--that the insurance company totally controlled \nwhether there could be an appeal at all--not having a meaningful appeal \nis similar to having a law without a police force or a court system. \nThere is no way to enforce it. The law is meaningless. All of these \nprovisions we pass are meaningless unless they are enforceable.\n  This amendment attempts--and I applaud my colleagues for making this \neffort. I think it is the result of a discussion we had yesterday. It \nattempts to address that problem, but it still has an enormous problem \nin it. There are two parts of an appeal process. The first is, do you \nget to appeal? The second is, if there is an appeal, what can be \nconsidered?\n  What they have offered by way of different language today, for the \nfirst time in the course of this week, is some change in what can be \nconsidered if there is an appeal. They don't change, in any way, what \nis appealable. Once again, the only thing appealable is medical \nnecessity. You can't appeal whether you have access to a specialist. \nYou can't appeal whether you were reasonably prudent in going to the \nemergency room. All that long list of things which are contained in the \nvarious provisions that have been considered are not appealable. The \nonly thing appealable is medical necessity. The insurance company \nwrites what medical necessity means. They can write it any way they \nwant.\n  So the problem is, while they have attempted to address the second \npart of the appeals process--and I applaud them for that --they have \nnot addressed in any way the first part, which means the insurance \ncompany lawyers can write the contracts in a way that essentially makes \nappeals impossible by simply drafting very narrow language of what \nmedical necessity means. If they do that, then nobody gets their foot \nin the door.\n  What we have done basically is we have taken a door that was \ncompletely closed and put a very tiny crack in it. That is all that has \nhappened. Instead of what we ought to be doing, which is to have a \nsimple, plain provision--and I don't know why my colleagues won't agree \nwith this; maybe they will if we talk about it--a plain provision which \nsays any right provided in any part of these amendments and bills that \nhave been passed is appealable.\n  Why not make them all appealable? That way, we have an enforcement \nmechanism. We have a police force, a court system, and we have a way to \nmake the rights that we are attempting to create meaningful because if \nwe don't do that, essentially what happens is we pass laws that are \ntotally unenforceable. The result is the insurance company totally \ncontrols what occurs. What we have today is a situation where HMOs and \ninsurance companies are totally in control. That is what we are about \nthis week. We are about changing that.\n  I do applaud my colleagues for making some effort to address that \nissue. But what has happened is they only address the second part, \nwhich is what can be considered. They still, I might add, allow the \nparty considering the appeal, which is chosen by the insurance company \nthrough another entity, to consider what the HMOs' own plans and \nprocedures are. So the bottom line is this, Mr. President--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 3 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. The bottom line is this: What we have is a provision \nthat does not cure the problem. There is a simple cure, and if we are \ndoing this in good faith, I ask my colleagues to join me in that cure, \nwhich is a simple provision which says that any right created in these \namendments, in these patient protections we are attempting to debate \nand pass on the floor, is appealable. It is that simple, that \nstraightforward. If we want to enforce these\n\n[[Page S8576]]\n\nlaws against the insurance companies, that is what we ought to be \ndoing. It is simple and straightforward and it will work.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes off the bill to the \nSenator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment. I want \nto particularly congratulate the Senator from Maine for her care and \nconcern over the 2 years she has been involved in drafting this bill. I \nwant to particularly express my pleasure at the improvement to the \ncontinuity of care provision she put into this bill. From our base \nbill, we further extend our continuity of care for terminally ill \npatients through the end of life.\n  While the language in our committee bill followed the recommendations \nof the President's Quality Commission and the National Committee on \nQuality Assurance, both of which recommended ninety days for transition \nfor all chronically ill patients, we feel very strongly that terminally \nill patients and their families deserve to remain with their providers.\n  Extremely important is the other piece of the continuity of care \nprovision. It would require the Agency for Health Care Policy Research, \nthe Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and the Institute of Medicine \nto conduct a multi-pronged study into the appropriate thresholds, cost \nand quality implications of moving away from the current narrow \ndefinition of ``terminally ill'' towards identifying those with \n``serious and complex'' illness.\n  This study was suggested by the groups who advocate for patients \nsuffering with terminal illness. Unfortunately, many patients are not \ncaptured by current efforts to address the coordination and care needs \nof those who have several years, rather than several months, to live. \nThis is because ``terminally ill'' is a narrowly construed concept. \nThese patients may be better captured as ``serious and complex.'' This \nstudy is designed to help shape those parameters and seeks to improve \nthe care for all patients with terminal illnesses.\n  Again, I commend the Senator from Maine's leadership on this \nimportant matter.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are at the conclusion of another part \nof this debate. There is an amendment that includes a variety of \ndifferent provisions trying to upgrade the Republican proposal and make \nit more acceptable and responsive to the points that have been raised \nduring the course of the debate. Most importantly, the points have been \nraised by doctors, nurses and patients all over this country. Still, \nthey fall short.\n  These amendments are another testament to the priority the \nRepublicans place on protecting profits instead of patients. Every time \nwe point out the severe defects and loopholes in their plan, they say: \nOh, no, we will improve it. Then the so-called improvements come, and \nthey are virtually meaningless. It is botched cosmetic surgery; all the \nwrinkles still show. You can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a \npig. And you can call something a patients' bill of rights, but it is \nstill a patients' bill of wrongs.\n  Every single one of these amendments leaves a profit-protection \nproposal, a sham proposal, a triumph of disinformation. We have voted \non 10 of the amendments that have been offered by the other side, and \nwe will have this amendment--10 amendments. There isn't a single \namendment that has the support of a patients' organization or a medical \norganization--not one. I think that is a fair indication as to what \nthose amendments are really about.\n  On the contrary, each and every one of the positions we have taken \nhad the strong support of the medical profession. Each and every \namendments we have offered--each and every one of them--had the strong \nsupport of the medical profession. I think that speaks volumes about \nwho is really interested in protecting the patients and not the profits \nof the HMO.\n  Let's look at these proposals individually. The so-called independent \nappeals provision leaves every fundamental flaw in the original bill \nuncorrected. The HMO still chooses and pays the review organization. \nThe HMOs own definition of ``medical necessity,'' no matter how unfair, \nstill controls the whole process. That has been pointed out by our \ncolleague, the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein. That particular \nloophole remains in the bill.\n  The clinical trials proposal applies only to cancer patients and only \nto those in self-funded plans. Two-thirds of Americans are left out. \nTwo-thirds of cancer patients are left out.\n  All of the cancer organizations have rejected this proposal. We have \nprinted their positions in the Record. They all reject this particular \nproposal.\n  If you or your loved one has heart disease or Alzheimer's, cystic \nfibrosis or multiple sclerosis, a spinal cord injury or diabetes or \nAIDS, you are out of luck under the Republican plan. And if you are a \nfarmer or small business employee who belongs to an HMO and you develop \ncancer, you are out of luck.\n  The continuity of care provision has not changed a bit. If you have a \nterminal illness and are fortunate enough to live more than 3 months, \nthey can cut you off; you have to change doctors. If you have a long, \nongoing illness--even cancer or life-threatening heart disease--you \nhave no transition at all. And if you are one of the 113 million people \nnot in a self-funded plan, you are not protected at all.\n  Let's go back to the basics. Again, after 4 days and 10 amendments, \nthey have not presented a single proposal supported by any group of \ndoctors, nurses, or patients--not one, zero.\n  Their bill is supported by the insurance companies that profit from \nabuse. Our bill is supported by 200 groups; doctors, nurses, and \npatients who want to end these abuses.\n  The Senate should stand with the health professionals and the \npatients, not with the powerful special interests.\n  We will have another opportunity in a few moments to stand again with \nthe patients. Let's hope the Senate will.\n  I reserve the balance of the time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Maine 2 minutes \noff the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I recently discussed the continuity \nprovisions which are included in the amendment before us. This is one \nof the rare areas of agreement on both sides of the aisle. We both \nagree that if someone is terminally ill, and if there is a change in \nhealth care providers, the terminally ill patient should be able to \nstay with that provider until the end of his or her life.\n  Our amendment clearly says that the care shall extend for the \nremainder of the individual's life for such care. There is, however, a \ntechnical mistake which could create some ambiguity in that provision.\n  I ask unanimous consent, since the yeas and nays have been ordered, \nthat I send a modification to the desk to correct that technical \namendment. I hope my colleagues will agree to that.\n  Mr. REID. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, since there has been an objection, which \nI think is very unfortunate, the technical correction will be included \nin the final Republican package that will be offered.\n  As I said, I think the intent is very clear. The majority of the \nlanguage is very clear. But there is an ambiguity in one section which \nwill be cleared up in the final language.\n  Also, at this time I request the yeas and nays on the underlying \nCollins amendment which was set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield to the Senator from California 1 minute off the \nbill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, by popular demand, I have my scorecard \nback. It was 8 to nothing. And then I gave two points to the liability, \none, because that is crucial. Unfortunately, we lost that--the patients \ndid. The HMOs won. They still will be able to get away with hurting \npeople and not paying any price whatsoever.\n  So we are 10 to nothing.\n  We are about to have two votes. The Collins amendment is opposed by \nthe obstetricians and gynecologists who\n\n[[Page S8577]]\n\nhave sent out a letter saying it is nothing; it is a cruel nothing. I \nhave their exact words at everybody's desk.\n  I hope we will vote that down. It doesn't do anything about the \nspecialists. It doesn't do anything about OB/GYNs. It doesn't do \nanything about emergency rooms. Senator Gramm pointed that out. They \nare still going to be charged.\n  Again, we have a sham proposal. I hope it will be 10 to 2 after the \nnext two votes. But I am afraid it is going to be 12 to zero.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We yield back any time remaining on our amendment.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, shortly we will be voting on two \namendments. The first vote will be an amendment which was carried over \nfrom this morning on long-term care, deductibility, access to emergency \nroom services, access to specialists, and access to OB/GYN services, \nafter which we will be voting on the amendment that we have been \ntalking about over the last 100 minutes, which is an amendment we have \nintroduced on external appeals with a Republican amendment that \nprovides a specific timeframe for expedited external review, No. 1.\n\n  No. 2, on coverage of clinical trials, our amendment provides \ncoverage of routine patient costs associated with participation in an \napproved trial in the field of cancer.\n  No. 3, provider nondiscrimination, where our amendment offered \nprotections similar to those provided in Medicare and Medicaid, and the \nbalanced budget amendment of 1997.\n  No. 4, a point-of-service aspect, where we extended the point-of-\nservice option to beneficiaries beyond what was in the underlying bill.\n  No. 5, continuity of care, which has been discussed by Senator \nCollins.\n  I very much believe these amendments will strengthen the underlying \nbill.\n  I urge their approval because I think they go right to the heart of \nwhat the American people want, and that is to keep the focus on the \npatient, on the individual, to ensure quality and to ensure access.\n  I yield the remainder of our time.\n\n\n       Point-of-Service Option and Anti-Discrimination Amendment\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to support this amendment \nwith my colleagues, Senator Collins, Senator Sessions, and others. This \namendment will offer freedom of choice to millions of Americans and \nwill ensure they have access to a wide range of providers.\n  Our amendment would provide individuals with the option of choosing a \npoint-of-service plan when no such option exits. I support this because \nI want to give people choice and the ability to go out of network if \nthey need to. They may have to pay more for this freedom, but they \nshould at least have this protection if they want it.\n  I have been a long-standing supporter of the point-of-service option. \nThis provision was part of my Medicare patients' bill of rights in \n1997. I also supported a similar amendment offered by Senator Helms on \nthe Senate floor several years ago.\n  I believe people should have this option when they are willing to pay \nfor it. Point-of-service provides people with the security of insurance \ncoverage to see providers outside the plan if they need to. Many people \nare will to pay for this extra security. But for people who don't want \nto pay for this, they won't have to. They can choose another plan that \nbetter suits their needs.\n  In addition, this amendment ensures that managed care plans do not \ndiscriminate against any class of providers, such as chiropractors or \noptometrists. This is important to patients because it ensures they \nhave access to certain providers or services they prefer who may be \nleft out of the network. Classes of providers, who are not medical \ndoctors, are sometimes excluded from participating in managed care \nplans to restrict patients' access to their services. Our amendment \nwould ensure this does not happen by prohibiting plans from \ndiscriminating against any class of providers who are licensed to \npractice in their state.\n  This amendment is about choice, freedom, and security. It is about \nallowing patients to choose a plan or provider that best meets their \nhealth care needs. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will \nvote in favor of these very important patient protections.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 1243, as amended.

Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, we \nare coming to closure on this bill. I think the procedure is that now \nthe Democrats, if we continue our alternation, have a second-degree \namendment which will be offered to the underlying amendment, and we \nwill consider that. We will vote on it. Then it is our expectation that \nwe will have the passage of the substitute amendment, to be offered by \nSenator Lott on behalf of us, that will be wrapping up some of the \nchanges we made to S. 326 in the consideration of this bill.\n  We will offer that immediately following disposition of the Democrat \namendment, and that will be the final\n\n[[Page S8578]]\n\nvote of the evening. At least that is our expectation. For Members' \ninformation, we will be voting on the next amendment no later than \n6:50, hopefully before 6:50. Then it is our intention to vote on final \npassage no later than an hour or 2 hours after that. That would be \ncloser to 9.\n  It is our hope that we can shave off some time and have final passage \nmuch closer to 8 than 9. Members can plan accordingly. Please plan on \ntwo more votes, one on the Democrat amendment, which will be offered \nmomentarily, and then basically the final passage or the Republican \nwraparound amendment--we might call it that--or a substitute. It would \nincorporate all the changes we have made on the floor to S. 326.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, may we have order. This is a very \nimportant amendment, and the Senators are entitled to be heard. We are \nenormously grateful for the attention that has been given to the debate \ngenerally, but this is in many respects one of the most important \namendments. The Senators should have a chance to have the attention of \nthe membership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senate will be in \norder.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1253 To Amendment No. 1251\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for a transitional period for certain patients)\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself, Senator Mikulski, and Senators Schumer, Graham, Kennedy, \nMurray, Daschle, Durbin, Rockefeller, and Torricelli, and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Nebraska is yielded 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask that we suspend temporarily for a \nmotion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield temporarily, as I understand, \nthe Senator is going to make a motion to reconsider and lay on the \ntable.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote on the \namendment just passed.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey], for himself, Ms. \n     Mikulski, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Graham, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Murray, \n     Mr. Daschle, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr. Torricelli, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1253 to amendment No. 1251.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Did we yield 7 minutes to the Senator?\n  Mr. KERREY. That is correct.\n  Mr. President, this proposed change in the law would provide \nprotection for every single American who has health insurance in this \ncountry--not just those that are in self-funded ERISA plans, as the \nRepublican alternative would do. That is the most important \ndistinction. I have been asked, well, if our amendment fails, will I \nvote for the Republican alternative? My answer is no. I believe that \nwould be a step backward because it will say to the marketplace that \nyou can fall to the lowest possible standard, which is what the \nRepublican proposal does.\n  Every step of the way, we have seen a sort of grudging retreat from \nour challenge to change the law and intervene in the marketplace. There \nis cost to this, Mr. President; I acknowledge that cost. But as with \nall regulation, we have to measure the cost versus the benefit. That is \nwhat we intend to do with this amendment--talk about the benefit to \npeople who will be able to get continuity of care, and not just if they \nare pregnant, which the Republicans included in their earlier \nalternative, but to take care of people with terminal illness, for \nexample. I understand it that there will be a modification to the \nRepublican bill on this point. But you have to be declared terminal.\n  What if you have cancer and you believe you are going to survive \ntreatment? What if you have diabetes or some other complicated medical \ncondition, and you established, over the years, a relationship with \nyour physician who watched for changes in your physical condition, \nlooked at your symptoms and determined the kind of treatment and \nresponse to those symptoms, and suddenly you are told your doctor was \neither removed from the managed care group, which happens, or your \ndoctor changes venue and moves to some other locality and you are told \nby your managed care organization that you have to pick a different \ndoctor. Your relationship with this physician is over.\n  This amendment puts the law on the side of those individuals and says \nyou can continue care with that doctor for 90 days for most conditions, \nand for three conditions this time can be extended. It is reasonable.\n  Is there cost? Yes. Measure the cost against the benefit of having \nthe law on your side when it comes time that you are told that your \ndoctor now is different and you have had a relationship with that \ndoctor. The doctor has diagnosed your cancer and told you here is the \ntreatment, or has been your doctor treating your diabetes or your \ncardiovascular disease, or your doctor has told you what the treatment \nis going to be, and suddenly you have a new doctor. You have to pick \nsomebody new. That is what this amendment does. It puts the law on the \nside of every single American, not just those in self-funded ERISA \nplans, as the Republican version would do. This takes care of everyone.\n  I have real passion on this subject because on the 14th of March, \n1969, I was a healthy human being with the U.S. Navy SEAL team, and I \nthought I could accomplish everything on my own. I didn't think I \nneeded any law to support me or take care of my needs. Then I was \ninjured. In an instant, I went from being able to take care of myself \non my own to not being able to do anything at all, including going to \nthe bathroom, without asking somebody else for help. So they sent me to \nthe Philadelphia Naval Hospital, and I recovered there.\n  Well, in 1989, when I came to the Senate, I was fortunate enough to \nbe able to be a member of the Appropriations Committee, and we were \nmarking up a bill--a law that this body considered. It occurred to me \nwe were appropriating money for military hospitals--including the one \nthat I had gone to in 1969. Well, in 1969, I didn't understand the \nrelationship between that law and me. That hospital was not there \nbecause of Sears & Roebuck.\n  I love the marketplace. I come from the business sector and I love \nwhat the market can do. But the market has limitations. My life was \nsaved by a hospital that was authorized by this Congress. The \nappropriations were authorized by this Congress not because I made a \nfinancial contribution, not because I was able to come and influence \nanybody in this Congress--there wasn't a politician in America in 1969 \nI liked, let alone been willing to make a contribution to. Yet Congress \npassed, and the President signed, a law which saved my life--not the \nmarketplace but a law.\n\n  Was there cost? You're darn right there was cost. What was the \nbenefit to the rest of America? I hope the benefit was being able to \nsay we live in a country where we want our Congress to pass laws to \ntake care of our own. We want to take care of each other. It isn't just \nabout me. I am healthy today, and the independence I have and the \nhealth I have came as a consequence of that law. That law gave me \nindependence.\n  Roughly 10 days ago, we all celebrated the Fourth of July. That is \nIndependence Day. This Nation has an over 200-year tradition of making \nindependence meaningful by fighting against illiteracy, fighting \nagainst intolerance, and fighting against illness. If you are sick or \ndisabled and you don't have health insurance and reliable health care, \nyou are not likely to feel independent. It is likely to be meaningless \nto you.\n  So what this amendment does is to say if you have a relationship with \na doctor, and the doctor is treating you, and the market determines \nthat the doctor no longer can treat you, you will have a right, under \nthe law, to\n\n[[Page S8579]]\n\ncontinue to have the care of that physician for 90 days. If it is one \nof the three exceptional conditions, this right can be extended.\n  As I say, there is cost. I don't disregard the cost at all. I have \nheard many Senators come down and talk about how this is going to \nincrease the cost of our insurance. I am willing to pay it. Why? \nBecause Americans were willing to pay the bills for me. That is why we \nare a great country. We don't just take care of ourselves; we take care \nof each other. We recognize, as great as the marketplace is, as \nwonderful as free enterprise is in creating jobs and generating wealth, \nthere are limits. If all we care about is the bottom line and \ngenerating profit for our businesses, we will forget the need to put \nthe law on the side of human beings when, through no fault of their \nown, the bottom drops out of their lives.\n  So I hope and pray that the Republicans will give this amendment \nconsideration. It is the last amendment we will consider before we shut \nthis thing down permanently. At least for the rest of this week, we are \nnot going to have a chance to change the law and put it on the side of \nAmericans out there who desperately need it.\n  I understand there are costs to it. If I talk to people in Nebraska \nand they ask why we do this, I will not only use myself as an example, \nI will use hundreds of others who had the law on their side. Medicare \nbeneficiaries have had the law on their side, and they are better off \nas a consequence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we are in the closing hours of this \ndebate now. I want to thank the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts for his steadfast advocacy not only this week, but his \nwhole life has been devoted to making sure that people have access to \nhealth care, and to believing that in the United States of America \nthere is an opportunity structure where we give help to those people \nwho try to practice self-help--we have done that in education and in \nour legal framework--and also to be sure that if you have something \nhappen to you in terms of your physical, emotional, or mental well-\nbeing, you should have access to health care in the greatest country in \nthe world.\n  I thank Senator Kerrey for offering this amendment. I think it is an \noutstanding amendment and I am pleased to be a cosponsor. I lend my \nvoice to this amendment that the Senator has offered, and I hope that \nat least once this week we can pass an amendment 100-0, and that we put \nthe profits of an insurance company aside, put the politics of party \naside, and that we take a moment to think what is in the best interest \nof the American people.\n  I hope that on this amendment we can come together. Senator Kerrey's \namendment is one that I offered in the committee. It was defeated along \nparty lines. But I understand committees. That is the way it goes. But \nI don't understand how we are doing this on the floor of the Senate \nbecause, first of all, we are advocating continuity of care. What does \nthat mean?\n  It means just because your boss changes insurance companies, you \ndon't have to change your doctor. It also means if your physician is \npushed out of a network, you are not pushed aside from seeing that \nphysician.\n  Why is this important? It is important because doctors are not \ninterchangeable. The hallmark of getting well and staying well is the \nrelationship between a doctor and a patient. We have known this \nthroughout history. This is nothing new. This goes back to Hippocrates \nand the earliest basis of medicine. Your doctor knows you as a person--\nnot as a chart or a lab test. Your doctor knows you, your history, your \nfamily's history. Your doctor knows what is best for you and how to act \nin the most prudent way in regard to what is medically necessary or \nmedically appropriate or medically indicated.\n  Why is this important?\n  There are those who will say this will cost too much. I say, if we \ndon't have it, it will be penny-wise and pound-foolish.\n  If you are dumped from seeing the doctor you currently have and you \nhave to start all over again, that doctor is going to have to take a \ncomplete physical. The doctor is going to have to take complete tests \nand in many instances start all over with you. Diabetes is treatable \nand diabetes is manageable, but if you are a diabetic and go to a new \ndoctor, that doctor has to know you and your history and your family \nhistory, and start again with complicated tests and complicated \nevaluations. That is penny-wise and pound-foolish. You should stick \nwith your own doctor, or at least come up with a transition plan.\n  What about the terminally ill?\n  This amendment Senator Kerrey has offered says if you are terminally \nill, or your family member, or your child, is terminally ill, you get \nto keep your doctor. What happens if your child has a terminal illness? \nYou are struggling with this illness. Imagine being a father wanting to \nbe at the bedside of a child who is terminally ill. Instead he is in \nthe other room calling an insurance company finding out if his son's \ndoctor is in his new plan's network because the company he works for \nhas changed HMOs. So he is up there not talking to the doctor about his \nson, or not even talking to his son, but trying to figure this out.\n  I think that is cruel. I think it is cruel and unusual punishment.\n  What happens if you are recovering from a stroke and you are in a \nrehabilitation hospital?\n  Under the Kerrey-Mikulski amendment, you will get to keep your doctor \nduring that rehabilitation, so you can return and not be having to try \nto find out who your physician is going to be.\n  What happens if you have been admitted to a mental hospital for an \nacute psychiatric episode and you have chronic schizophrenia, but you \nalso have a physician who has been treating you, who knows you, and in \nthose 90 days you have to change doctors just when you are trying to \nget your mental health back again?\n  This is what we are talking about--continuity of care, so for those \nundergoing an active course of treatment and for all Americans who have \ninsurance you would get at least 90 days to come up with a transition \nplan.\n  But in three categories--if you are terminally ill; also if you are \nwithin an institution or facility; or if you are pregnant--you get to \nkeep your doctor for a longer period.\n  We think this is what should happen. This isn't just Barbara Mikulski \nmaking this up.\n  I will submit a letter from the Consortium of Citizens with \nDisabilities. These are people who strongly support the Kerrey-Mikulski \namendment.\n  This is what they say:\n\n       Protecting continuity of care is not some wonky \n     technicality. It will have a real impact on the quality of \n     care for many people with disabilities and anyone who is \n     undergoing active treatment. Consider for a moment what could \n     happen to a child with cerebral palsy if their parent's \n     employer changed health plans and there was no opportunity to \n     adequately plan a transition to new plan and new providers. \n     It can be assumed this child would be receiving ongoing \n     physical therapy.\n\n  This could be potentially expensive and exhausting for the family. \nThere may be a variety of other reasons for this.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Consortium for Citizens\n\n\n                                            With Disabilities,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 12, 1999.\n     Re CCD strongly supports the Kerrey/Mikulski amendment on \n         continuity of care.\n\n     Hon. J. Robert Kerrey,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerrey: We are writing as Co-Chairs of the \n     Health Task Force of the Consortium for Citizens with \n     Disabilities (CCD) to express our strong support for the \n     amendment you intend to offer with Senator Mikulski during \n     the upcoming debate on the Patient's Bill of Rights. Your \n     amendment will ensure that continuity of care is protected \n     when health plan contracts are terminated. This is a critical \n     issue to people with disabilities. CCD is a Washington-based \n     coalition of nearly 100 national organizations representing \n     the more than 54 million children and adults living with \n     disabilities and their families in the United States.\n       For people with disabilities, planning a transition from \n     one health plan to another requires great care and much \n     coordination. If an employer switches health plans or if \n     enrollees experience a change in health plans for any reason, \n     persons with disabilities need to be guaranteed that they \n     will have adequate time to manage the transition to new\n\n[[Page S8580]]\n\n     providers. For persons undergoing active treatment for \n     serious conditions, patients should be permitted to continue \n     being treated by their existing provider until the serious \n     condition has been positively resolved or for at least ninety \n     days.\n       Protecting continuity of care is not some wonky \n     technicality. It will have a real impact on the quality of \n     care for many people with disabilities and anyone who is \n     undergoing active treatment. Consider for a moment what could \n     happen to a child with cerebral palsy if their parent's \n     employer changed health plans and there was no opportunity to \n     adequately plan a transition to a new plan and new providers. \n     It can be assumed this child would be receiving on-going \n     physical therapy, they would potentially be taking extensive \n     prescription medications, they would have an on-going need \n     for various types of durable medical equipment such as a \n     wheel chair or other devices that help them to function. They \n     may also be receiving personal assistance services. If a \n     transition to another plan is necessary, should the care of \n     the child be abruptly terminated without any planning to \n     manage the transition to a new plan and new providers?\n       What is most perverse about such a situation is that if \n     care is interrupted, this child could develop an acute health \n     problem that requires a hospitalization. Is this in the best \n     interest of that child or the health plan? This type of \n     scenario is not limited to this example.\n       Anyone who is receiving on-going care needs an opportunity \n     to plan and manage a transition to a new health plan, and if \n     necessary a new provider. We are frustrated that such a \n     straightforward issue is not adequately addressed in the \n     Republican Leadership proposal.\n       There are many complex issues that will be raised as the \n     Senate debates the enactment of a Patient's Bill of Rights. \n     Continuity of care is not one of them. Your amendment \n     provides a straightforward solution to a simple problem. \n     Under current law and the Republican Leadership proposal, \n     health plan enrollees could be stranded and life-prolonging \n     health care could be abruptly interrupted through no fault of \n     their own.\n       The CCD Health Task Force is grateful for your leadership \n     on this critical issue and we look forward to working with \n     you and your staff to ensure that this amendment is adopted.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jeffrey Crowley,\n       National Association of People with AIDS.\n     Bob Griss,\n       Center on Disability and Health.\n     Kathy McGinley,\n       The Arc of the United States.\n     Shelley McLane,\n       National Association of Protection and Advocacy Systems.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we have letters from parents. We have \nletters from advocacy groups that say in the United States of America \nwhen you get health care it shouldn't have term limits on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from New York is allocated 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for \nyielding.\n  It has been a long week. I know there will be many who will say that \nthis week was not as productive as it might be. I agree with that \ncompletely.\n  But this is one good point that has emerged. We have debated, as we \nasked, the Patients' Bill of Rights. It is now an issue that is before \nthe American people. They know there will be a time when they don't \nhave to put up with HMOs that are dictating policy.\n  The American people know that in the doctor-patient relationship \nthere does not have to be a third person in the room all the time--an \nactuary, an accountant with no medical experience. They know it is \npossible for this Senate and this Congress to pass a law that might say \nthat if your doctor says you need a medication, and says you need a \nprocedure, and says you need an operation, and your HMO denies it, you \nhave the right --you could, if this Senate had the courage--to an \nindependent appeal.\n  Unfortunately, amendment after amendment that would have protected \nthe average American was rolled back. Unfortunately, we are in a \nsituation where the insurance industry has all too often dictated what \nhas happened on this floor. Instead of stepping up to the plate and \nvoting for the protections for which our constituents are literally \nclamoring, this Senate buckled to the insurance industry and passed a \nbunch of amendments that are aimed at looking good and doing nothing. \nThe look-good, do-nothing amendments will not prevail because next \nweek, and the week after, as Americans visit their doctors and their \nHMOs deny them service, deny them things they need, they will know.\n  This entire debate can be summed up in three numbers. Who is covered \nunder the Democratic plan? One hundred and sixty-one million people. We \nlost on that amendment. The Republican plan, which covers 48 million \npeople, prevailed.\n  What are we saying to the 113 million who will not get coverage? The \nmain argument against the legislation is that it would cost too much. \nThe cost is $2 a month. How many Americans wouldn't pay $2 a month to \nhave their doctor determine what medicine, what operation, what \nspecialist they need?\n  I think the only Americans who would not vote to have that $2 a month \nin exchange for what they need medically are in this Senate, and in a \nfew of the HMOs.\n  My colleagues, my friends, this is not the Senate at its greatest \nhour. This is a time when we, once again, succumb to the special \ninterests and deny what the American people want.\n  But we will be back. The American people will demand we come back. \nThey will demand the pendulum swing back to the middle so actuaries \ndon't make policy, but doctors do.\n  We shall return. We shall, not tonight but in the future, prevail.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  As we near the end of this debate, I want to share a few thoughts \ngenerally on the proposals we are discussing. Quite frankly, we just \nhad an opportunity to see the amendment which has been offered. Our \ncrack Senators are reading it over to study the measure. They will \nshortly have comments to offer on that.\n  I want to talk about some areas that I think have become very obvious \nas we have moved forward in this debate. The first thing we ought to \nemphasize is that both sides are going to deal with the managed care \nproblems and concerns. We have heard from patients in our States. I \nhave heard a lot of rhetoric and a lot of name-calling about what the \nvarious bills do. The simple fact of the matter is, the people of \nMissouri, the folks who talk to me, the people who are concerned about \nhealth care--the small businesses are particularly sensitive--have some \nthings they don't want to do.\n  The first rule of medicine is to do no harm. They want to make sure \nwe don't make it worse. I believe the amendments we have adopted and \nthe direction in which we are going will make the situation better. We \nare going to assure patients in a managed care plan, if they are turned \ndown for coverage, they can go to a physician for an external appeal, \nand thanks to the very wisely crafted provision of the amendment \noffered by my colleagues--Senator Ashcroft, Senator Kyl, and Senator \nAbraham--if the managed care organization doesn't provide them with \nthat coverage of services that the external appeal said they are \nentitled to, they will be able to go out and get it someplace else and \nbill the HMO.\n  What we are saying is, we don't want to give people a lawsuit, a \ncause of action or, even worse, give their widow or their orphans a \ncause of action. We want to give them health care. We want to give them \na treatment. We want to give them a treatment, not a trial. We want \nthem to make sure they can get health care. That is the important \npoint. That is what the provisions we have adopted do.\n  One of the things we don't want and one of the things our colleagues \non the other side of the aisle seem to want is another bureaucratic \nnightmare. Do we really want to turn the regulation of our health care \nsystem over to the Federal Government, to the bureaucrats at the Health \nCare Financing Administration? I say not. We have had a lot of \nexperience with HCFA, and it has not been good.\n  The Republican bill is based on the premise that States can do a good \njob monitoring what is going on in the world of managed care, they can \ndo a good job of deciding what is the appropriate legislative response. \nSome may do better, some may not do as well. But the nice thing about \nthe laboratory of States is that we can see which States are doing the \nbest job and we can change the law.\n  During my time and service in State government, we worked on assuring \nbetter regulation. The States will move\n\n[[Page S8581]]\n\nforward. My State has passed a Patients' Bill of Rights. Most States \nhave. They are looking to see how it works. The States that make it \nwork the best are going to be followed by others.\n  The Democratic bill, the Democratic approach, is based on the premise \nthat States can't handle managed care regulation and that Federal \nbureaucrats are better equipped to do it. The Democratic bill will \noverturn a host of State laws and replace them with the interpretations \nof the Federal Government employee. These are the same bureaucrats who \nproduced one nightmare after another in trying to impose their \nregulatory monstrosities from Washington. Now they want the entire \nhealth care system turned over to them.\n\n  We have already had examples of HCFA's failures related to the issue \nof consumer protection, the very topic that the Democrats want to turn \nover to HCFA lock, stock, and barrel. Back in 1996, we entrusted HCFA \nwith more responsibility when Congress passed the Kassebaum-Kennedy \nhealth care bill designed to make sure health care was portable. How \nwell did HCFA handle this responsibility? According to the General \nAccounting Office, HCFA admits they pursued a Band-Aid, minimalist \napproach for protecting consumers.\n  The GAO has another finding that HCFA ``lacks the appropriate \nexperience or expertise to regulate private health insurance.'' These \nare the people to whom we want to turn over regulatory responsibility \nfor the entire health care system? When they are entrusted with the \nentire responsibility, when they are incompetent or mess up, the whole \ncountry suffers.\n  One of the things I have done as chairman of the Small Business \nCommittee is to try to ensure that Federal agencies live up to the \nrequirements of the law passed in this body and the other body \nunanimously to reduce redtape, to make sure that Federal agencies take \ninto account how their activities and their regulatory actions would \nimpact small business. We found there were several agencies that \nweren't doing a very good job. The regulatory process was clogged up.\n  I initiated the ``Plumber's Friend Award'' to unclog the regulatory \npipes in these agencies. Needless to say, HCFA and the Department of \nHealth and Human Services were one of the first. We give these awards \nto Federal Departments which blocked the flow of public participation \nbecause they failed to reduce unreasonable and burdensome regulations \naffecting small business. HCFA and HHS qualified for the award by \nrepeatedly disregarding Federal laws designed to make it easier for \nsmall businesses to deal with the massive amounts of regulation and \npaperwork required by Federal bureaucrats.\n  That is an example of the nightmare HCFA is creating. We saw the \nnightmares. They were going to impose surety bond requirements on home \nhealth care agencies, many of them small businesses in my State. HCFA \ndecided they were going to require the small business home health care \nagencies to purchase surety bonds that would cover up the Federal \nGovernment's mistakes. In other words, they had to provide insurance so \nif the Federal Government made a mistake, the surety bond would be \nresponsible. A home health care operator told me with tears in her eyes \nshe couldn't raise the money to buy a surety bond.\n  Then they imposed cuts on the home health care agencies that have \nbeen putting them out of business left and right. Under the Balanced \nBudget Act, they were supposed to save $16 billion a year over 5 years. \nThey cut back on the amount of reimbursement so much that they would \nwind up saving $48 billion a year. They were imposing a system of \nreimbursement that penalized the good providers, that penalized the \nproviders who were providing the most intensive care in the home. They \nwere penalizing the providers in the most difficult areas--precisely \nthe kind of service we want to keep.\n  HCFA has had a bad track record. Ask anybody who has had to deal with \nHCFA, and they will say, whatever the problem is, HCFA is not the \nanswer.\n  There are some who think that maybe our colleagues really want to get \nback to the era of another health care proposal that came from the \nWhite House. Known as Clinton Care, the 1993 health care plan was going \nto be a Federal takeover of health insurance. The wisdom of the Federal \nGovernment was going to run health care.\n  Senator Gramm has done a good job this week talking about some of the \npossible horror stories that could and would have happened if we passed \nthe Clinton health care bill. Fortunately, we didn't. Some of my \ncolleagues are running around saying they personally helped kill the \nClinton health care bill. That sucker wasn't killed by any Republican. \nIt died of its own weight. The Democratic majority leader didn't even \nbring it up because once they looked at it, they said, this thing isn't \ngoing to work. It was dead on arrival.\n  Let me state some of the likely results had we adopted the \nPresident's proposal to socialize medicine. Expensive mandates on the \nNation's employers would have cost jobs, insurance premiums that would \nlikely skyrocket. It would create 50 new Federal bureaucracies, a new \ntrillion-dollar Federal entitlement. These were the items we would have \nreceived.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask for another 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. The bottom line is we would have had 1,200 pages of \nmandates, rules, requirements, and penalties. It died. But let me \nremind my colleagues what the President said just a couple of years \nago, in September 1997. Talking about his failed effort to impose this \nfailed health care bureaucracy on the American people, he said:\n\n       If what I tried before won't work, maybe we can do it \n     another way. That is what we tried to do, a step at a time \n     until we have finished.\n\n  That is what I am afraid of. That is what we were trying to do, to \nget to the point where we had socialized health coverage in the United \nStates.\n  Costs are clearly a problem. Costs are going to be a lot more than $2 \nmillion, or one Big Mac, $2 a month or one Big Mac a month, as some of \nmy colleagues on the other side have said. If you have a $2,600-a-year \nfamily health insurance program and you have a 5-percent raise, it is a \nwhole lot more than $2 a month. It is about $180 a year, something \nsimilar to that. It is a lot more. And when costs go up, people lose \ntheir health insurance.\n  We need to fix some of the problems. We need to do it without driving \npeople out of the system. We already have 40 million uninsured people \nin America. I can tell you one thing that is clear: small businesses \nare very much concerned about ensuring they do not get priced out of \nthe ability to compete by their health insurance costs.\n  There is an excellent article in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, \nApril 15. I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, April 15, 1999]\n\n Taking Care: Small Employers Offer Health Benefits to Lure Workers in \n                              Kansas City\n\n                          (By Lucette Lagnado)\n\n       Kansas City, Mo.--When Stephanie Pierce took over as \n     director of the Broadway Child Enrichment Center in December, \n     she faced a hiring crunch.\n       The small, church-based day-care center was enrolling more \n     children than ever, and Ms. Pierce needed to keep the staff \n     she had and bring on more. It was no small challenge in \n     Kansas City's strong economy, where newspapers are flush with \n     help-wanted ads and workers can brush off day-care work, with \n     its low pay and high pressure.\n       So, Ms. Pierce made a move her hourly workers could never \n     have imagined: She scrutinized her budget, swallowed hard and \n     decided to offer medical benefits to employees.\n       That put the day-care center out of sync with small \n     employers in many U.S. cities. But not in Kansas City.\n       Nationwide, the problem of people living without any health \n     insurance is growing. It is estimated that they total more \n     than 40 million, and their numbers are increasing as welfare \n     recipients who had Medicaid leave the rolls for jobs that \n     don't offer health benefits. In addition, fewer small \n     businesses are offering medical benefits to workers, says a \n     study by the Henry J. Kaiser Foundation. It puts the share at \n     54 percent last year, compared with 59 percent in 1996.\n       But Kansas City is moving the opposite way, thanks not only \n     to its tight labor market--a 2.8 percent unemployment rate, \n     vs. 4.2 percent nationally--but also to a Chamber of\n\n[[Page S8582]]\n\n     Commerce initiative and to competition for workers from an \n     industry that does offer medical benefits: riverboat casinos.\n       As small employees such as the daycare center offer this \n     coverage for the first time, some interesting things are \n     happening. The employees are facing the pain of rising health \n     costs, just like their big brethren. But they are also \n     learning something else that large companies know: In some \n     ways, offering health benefits saves money. As for workers, \n     they are finding that coverage can be a psychic as well as \n     physical benefit.\n       The first change Ms. Pierce noticed at her day-care center \n     went pretty directly to the bottom line. Sick days declined. \n     In February, overtime costs for her 14-member staff totaled \n     $120, down from a monthly average $420 last year.\n       It seems that before, sick workers who were uninsured would \n     commonly stay home to try to nurse themselves back to health, \n     or would get stuck for hours in a hospital emergency room or \n     free clinic. Now, they can get timely medical attention from \n     private physicians in their health plan and often return to \n     work sooner.\n       That means Ms. Pierce no longer has to pay as many other \n     workers to pull overtime, at higher pay. ``It's better to pay \n     an employee to be there at work than to be sick. It helps \n     your cash flow,'' Ms. Pierce says. Having a staff that has \n     health benefits is ``a whole new world,'' she says.\n       For the staff, the changes are greater still. Before she \n     got insurance, employee Towanna Smith says, being ill meant \n     ``terrible'' waits at a hospital emergency room, not to \n     mention other indignities she perceived. She and a friend \n     were in a car accident last year. ``My friend had insurance \n     and I didn't, and I noticed that the doctor treated her \n     differently.  He went over her thoroughly,'' says Ms. Smith, \n     who is 26 years old.\n       Last month, Ms. Smith, now in a health plan, went to a \n     doctor for a swollen arm that has nagged her since the \n     accident. ``I brought out my insurance card, and I got \n     special treatment,'' she says, smiling, ``I said, `Thank you, \n     Jesus.'' '\n       She might also thank the riverboat casinos. About four \n     years ago, out-of-town gambling companies arrived in an \n     already-tight labor market here and began hiring thousands of \n     people locally, leaving in place companywide policies that \n     called for full-time workers to get medical coverage. ``The \n     boats put people in a tizzy,'' says Scott Samuels, an adviser \n     to hotels and restaurants. ``People were flowing to the \n     casinos to work, and I know that employers in the hospitality \n     field, out of sheer need, had to offer greater benefits and \n     incentives to employees.''\n       Quick to react was Peter Levi, president of the local \n     Chamber of Commerce. To help local employers compete, he \n     teamed up with an insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas \n     City, to devise a healthcoverage plan that a mom-and-pop \n     business could afford. Blue Cross capped premium increases at \n     about 9% a year.\n       In three years, more than 3,000 businesses here have begun \n     offering the plan. Blue Cross officials expect the number to \n     increase 15% this year.\n       Some other insurers, noting this success, also began \n     offering small-employer health-benefits plans. HealthNet, a \n     health plan partly owned by the eight-hospital St. Luke's-\n     Shawnee Mission Health System, last summer unveiled a program \n     for tiny businesses and has signed up 200 of them, covering \n     4,000 employees and dependents, including the Broadway Child \n     Enrichment Center.\n       Frances Cox, who has operated a 77-room Best Western Hotel \n     for more than a decade, began offering medical benefits for \n     the first time in 1997. She chose Kaiser Permanente, the big \n     health-maintenance organization, and agreed to pay 100% of \n     the premiums, prompted by the need to compete with the \n     casinos for reliable workers. ``It is the cost of doing \n     business,'' she sighs. ``You have to stay competitive.''\n       Only seven or eight of her 20 employees took the coverage. \n     That surprised her, but she learned that some were covered \n     through their spouses, while others had Medicaid, the \n     federal-state program for low-income people, which they \n     preferred to an HMO requiring copayments.\n       As a recruitment tool, the benefits do the trick for Ms. \n     Cox. She has attracted people like her new 29-year-old head \n     of housekeeping, Lewis Nicholson.\n       Mr. Nicholson had worked at a fast-food outlet for 14 years \n     without getting benefits, and he held a second job cleaning \n     office buildings by night, just to get medical coverage. A \n     year ago, he decided to take advantage of Kansas City's \n     booming job market. ``In looking for a job, I looked to see \n     what type of benefits'' were offered, he says. Result: no \n     more fast food, just one full-time job at the Best Western, \n     where Ms. Cox says he is already one of her most valued \n     employees.\n       Ms. Cox makes sure she gets her money's worth from Kaiser \n     Permanente. If a sick worker has trouble getting a quick \n     doctor's appointment, ``I will call and say, `This is Fran \n     Cox and I am director of operations. Can't you see this \n     person?'' she says. ``When they develop a better relationship \n     with their doctor, that gets them back to work faster.''\n       She adds that as after employees ``become exposed to \n     insurance, they begin to appreciate what the benefits are. \n     They know that they can go to a single doctor and receive \n     excellent care. They are being educated.''\n       So is she--in costs. The first year, 1997, the HMO coverage \n     cost her $110 a month per employee. That rose to $120 in \n     1998, and then, for 1999, Kaiser Permanente jolted her with a \n     boost to $157 a month per covered worker. Though Kaiser \n     eventually agreed to shave this by $5 in return, she says, \n     for boosting workers' copayments, ``a jump like this pretty \n     much scares the jeepers out of me,'' Ms. Cox says, and \n     makes her wonder ``how long can we continue'' to offer \n     free medical coverage. One option she is considering is \n     requiring employees to pay part of the premium.\n       Some employers find they can't offer health benefits even \n     if they want to. Patti Glass ran the nonprofit Jewish Family \n     and Children Services, assisting the frail elderly. She was \n     paying $6.50 an hour--and hemorrhaging workers. Ms. Glass \n     looked into health plans but found them prohibitively \n     expensive for her mostly middle-aged workers. Even a basic \n     plan would add $1.35 to her hourly wage costs, she figured, \n     and she would still have to offer a pay increase to be \n     competitive.\n       ``Adding the cost of health benefits was going to make the \n     service unavailable. It was going to make the cost \n     astronomical,'' she says. The upshot: Ms. Glass chose simply \n     to raise wages 30%, to $8.50 an hour, and forgo a health \n     plan.\n       As an alternative, some employers merely give workers an \n     opportunity to get in on group insurance, but contribute \n     nothing toward paying the premiums. There are also bare-bones \n     plans that do little more than give employers the right to \n     say that they offer a medical plan.\n       Still, even a number of fast-food outlets here now offer \n     some sort of medical coverage to certain hourly workers. \n     David Lindstrom, a former Kansas City Chiefs lineman, owns \n     three Burger King franchises, including one in suburban \n     Johnson County, an area of million-dollar mansions, feverish \n     construction and an unemployment rate of about 2%. For his \n     ``key approved'' employees--full-time workers who can open \n     and close restaurants--he offers Blue Cross medical coverage \n     and pays much of the monthly premiums.\n       To him, offering benefits ``was a competitive decision we \n     needed to make, and we think that long-term it will reap \n     rewards for us. Already, it has allowed us to retain \n     employees.''\n       People like Kathy Wilson. A nine-year employee, Ms. Wilson \n     arrives at 4 a.m. to get ready for the day, and soon becomes \n     a whirling-dervish of activity, rushing from station to \n     station. ``I cook the eggs, I cook the sausages, I heat up \n     the Cini-Minis,'' she says. Then the customers arrive, and \n     she really gets busy.\n       FInding medical coverage became a top priority for Ms. \n     Wilson, who is 29, a few years ago after she had a baby. \n     Paying for everything out of pocket was a huge strain. It \n     wasn't long afterward that Mr. Lindstrom began offering \n     insurance, and she jumped at it. Out of her pay of $8.75 an \n     hour, Ms. Wilson contributes $25 every month for medical \n     coverage, plus a discretionary $85 to cover her son.\n       Though her employer pays half, some fast-food operators \n     have chosen no-frills health plans that require workers to \n     pay 100% of the premiums, for very basic coverage. Several \n     McDonald's and Godfather's Pizza outlets here have signed up \n     with Star Human Resources Inc., a Phoenix company that sells \n     plain-vanilla health plans known as Starbridge. One of them \n     costs only $5.95 a week, usually paid by the workers \n     themselves, and provides a narrow array of benefits with \n     strict limits.\n       Marilyn and Thomas Dobski, owners of a dozen McDonald's \n     outlets, offer Starbridge, and about 40% of full-time hourly \n     employees take it. Shift managers, who typically earn about \n     $7 an hour, can enjoy a fancier, $50-a-month Starbridge plan \n     subsidized by the Dobskis.\n       Mike Rogers, a Star salesman in Phoenix, explains that his \n     company provides a limited plan for working population that \n     ``most insurers don't want to mess with.'' He is quick to \n     concede it isn't comprehensive: ``If they have a catastrophe, \n     our little plan won't be adequate.'' But Mrs. Dobski, \n     defending it, says the plan offers workers ``much more than \n     nothing.''\n       The uninsured in Kansas City still total between 9% and 12% \n     of the population. But that is far below the nationwide \n     average, 18%, or New York's 28%. The number of uninsured \n     patients showing up in St.-Luke's Shawnee Mission \n     emergency rooms for free care has at last leveled off, \n     says Richard Hastings, chairman.\n       Kansas City's experience intrigues E. Richard Brown, a \n     professor at the University of California at Los Angeles who \n     studies health policy. He warns that the medical benefits \n     popping up could disappear fast if the local ecomony weakened \n     and competition for workers eased up. But another student of \n     these issues is more hopeful. William Grinker, president of \n     Seedco, a nonprofit New York organization, says, \n     ``Historically, once you have benefits, it is much harder to \n     take them away.''\n       These days, benefits are a new goal--beyond just a job--at \n     Kansas City's Women's Employment Network, which helps low-\n     income, often poorly educated Kansas City women find work. \n     ``We actually coach the women so they don't simply settle,'' \n     says Leigh Klein, the network's executive director. In \n     January, the network placed 25 women. The average wage was \n     $7.87 an hour and 18 of the jobs came with benefits of some \n     sort, more than half of them medical.\n\n[[Page S8583]]\n\n       The importance of benefits is something the center drums \n     into its clients. It is a crucial lesson, because if they are \n     giving up welfare to take a job, they will also lose Medicaid \n     after about three years.\n       Charlotte Jones, a spirited 20-year-old attending one \n     recent session, has learned will. ``I worked at lots of fast-\n     food places--Texas Tom and White Castle,'' that didn't offer \n     medical benefits, she says. As her classmates nod, she adds: \n     ``If I had a job that paid even $7 an hour, but it had \n     benefits, I would snatch it up.''\n       It is nap time at the Broadway Child Enrichment Center. Ms. \n     Pierce, the director, lowers herself onto a red plastic \n     toddler's chair to explain how she picked a benefits plan. \n     Keeping costs down was the overarching priority. She reviewed \n     $120-a-month HMOs, plus a HealthNet Preferred Provider plan \n     for $137 a month.\n       ``I gave the staff a spreadsheet and let them help me with \n     the decision,'' she recalls. Wary of HMOs, they chose \n     HealthNet, whose coverage includes doctor's visits (with a \n     $15 co-payment) and maternity care and hospitalization.\n       The director, for one, couldn't be happier. Before the \n     employeers got coverage, Ms. Pierce says, ``these girls would \n     spend two to four days at home being sick. Now, they don't \n     have to--they call, get an appointment, get a medication and \n     return to work.''\n\n  Mr. BOND. It talks about small businesses in Kansas City, MO, getting \nhealth insurance coverage. But the costs are still the problem, and \nthere are examples of people who are trying to provide health care \ncoverage, but when the costs continue to go up, then they have to drop \nit. They are fighting over $5 a month. Some of the people who wanted to \nprovide health care for their employees figured they could not afford \n$1.35 an hour in addition which, on a 2000-hour-a-year job, would come \nout to around $2,700. They aren't able to afford the increased cost of \ninsurance.\n  If we drive the costs of health insurance up, we are going to find \npeople who cannot afford it. We are going to find employers who drop \nit. Particularly, if we give the employee the right to sue their health \ncare plan or their employer, as my friends on the other side wish to \ndo, they are not going to provide it.\n  We need to make health care better, more affordable, more accessible. \nWe do not need to drive people out of the health care system.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 9 minutes.\n  We are drawing to a close on this debate. While I am pleased that our \ncolleagues have addressed an issue related to genetic discrimination in \ntheir bill, I am very concerned about the way in which this has been \napproached and I regret that we have not had sufficient time to focus \non this issue. I was a co-sponsor of Senator Snowe's original bill in \nthe 105th Congress, which contained strong penalties and disclosure \nprohibitions. Unfortunately, the Republican bill will not stop genetic \ndiscrimination, because it lacks three key provisions.\n  First, the Republican bill does not prohibit discrimination by \nemployers. If we only address health insurance, we could actually \nincrease employment discrimination. Second, the Republican bill does \nnot prohibit health insurers from sharing the information with each \nother and with employers. Finally, the Republican bill lacks teeth. The \nonly penalty in the Republican bill for genetic discrimination is a \nfine of $100 a day. Do we really think that $100 a day will deter the \nhealth insurance industry from practicing genetic discrimination?\n  That is why Senator Daschle, Senator Harkin, Senator Dodd and I \nintroduced legislation earlier this month to truly prevent genetic \ndiscrimination. Our bill prohibits disclosure of genetic information to \nemployers, prohibits employment discrimination, and contains strong \npenalties.\n  The bottom line is that people are afraid, and that prohibiting \nhealth insurance discrimination is not enough. We have letters from \npatient groups, women's groups, medical groups, and labor groups, \nasking us to stop employment discrimination, place some limits on \ndisclosure of predictive genetic information, and back up these \nprohibitions with strong penalties. I look forward to passing a \nmeaningful genetic discrimination bill after this debate.\n  As to our debate this week on the Patients' Bill of Rights, I think \nit is fair to look at the reaction in communities across the country. I \nwould like to share this with our colleagues.\n  Here is the St. Louis Post-Dispatch editorial, July 14 of this year:\n\n       The Republicans keep asking the wrong question about health \n     care. Instead of asking how to keep the quality of health \n     care high, their primary concern seems to be how to keep the \n     cost of health care down. They are paying too little heed to \n     the symptoms of an ailing health care system, which are hard \n     to miss. There is a drumbeat of HMO horror stories.\n       Sure, people want inexpensive health care. But it is \n     increasingly apparent that neither doctors nor nurses nor \n     patients are willing to have appropriate medical care \n     dictated by HMO bureaucrats with their eyes on the bottom \n     lines.\n\n  Dayton, OH:\n\n       The Republican's bill is largely a statement of goals. The \n     Democrats' bill provides better support for patients and \n     medical-care providers. . . .\n\n  The Atlanta Journal and Constitution, July 15:\n\n       It's called the Patients' Bill of Rights but by the \n     time the U.S. Senate gets done with it a better title will \n     be ``The HMO Protection Act.''\n       On amendment after amendment this week, Senate Republicans \n     have had their way, creating a bill that seeks to limit the \n     rights of HMO patients, not protect them. . . .\n       Relying on the mercies of the marketplace and the HMOs to \n     meet America's health care needs has not worked and will not \n     work. Patients need protections. That's what Congress ought \n     to provide.\n\n  New York Times, July 15:\n\n       What occurred on the floor of the Senate this week was a \n     GOP-sponsored charade in which one Republican Senator after \n     another talked about protecting the health of patients while \n     voting to protect the profits of industry.\n       It was a breathtaking exercise in hypocrisy. . . .\n       All that mattered was the obsession with the profits of the \n     insurance companies and the HMOs.\n\n  Newsday, July 15:\n\n       Medical insurance? Try malpractice by GOP.\n\n  The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, July 13, a column by Molly Ivins:\n\n       We are watching a classic political shell game: There's the \n     Patients' Bill of Rights that actually gives the patients \n     some rights and there's the Patients' Bill of Rights that \n     doesn't. . . .\n       The reason we know this is pure hooey is because the very \n     bill they are opposing has already been in effect in Texas \n     for over two years and none of the heinous consequences they \n     predict has occurred here.\n       If the Republicans and the insurance industry have their \n     way, the old shell game will run right through the Senate and \n     we'll get something called a bill of rights that has no \n     remedies in it.\n\n  The Seattle Post Intelligencer, July 8:\n\n       The health insurance industry is back again with a \n     misleading campaign opposing a patients' bill of rights.\n       Just as the industry did successfully in 1994 with its \n     Harry and Louise ads that misled the public about President \n     Clinton's health care reform--falsely claiming that people \n     would lose their right to choose their own doctor--the new \n     campaign is designed to convince us that a patients' bill of \n     rights will cause many people to lose their health insurance.\n       Like the Harry and Louise ads, the campaign relies on fear \n     rather than fact. . . .\n       Consumers need avenues of redress when dealing with health \n     care providers. . . . [T]he ability to sue their health care \n     provider and portability of their health care should they \n     change jobs or move to another area[,] those are all \n     fundamental rights to which consumers are entitled. No one \n     should be fooled by this later effort to distort the issue of \n     health care.\n\n  The Charleston West Virginia Gazette, July 14:\n\n       Democrats have a proposal called the Patients' Bill of \n     Rights. Republicans have called theirs the Patients' Bill of \n     Rights-Plus Act. If truth-in-advertising laws applied to \n     Congress, the GOP would have to call its bill the Patients' \n     Bill of Rights-Minus Act. . . .\n       Some cost-saving measures may be necessary to keep health \n     care spending under control, but when HMOs sacrifice patient \n     health for profits, they must be held accountable. Democrats \n     want that. Republicans apparently don't.\n\n  The News and Observer, Raleigh, NC:\n\n       The GOP is up against it, because this bill of rights, \n     [referring to the Democrats'] is hardly a revolution: It \n     would ensure that people could choose their doctors and their \n     specialists, would allow them to go to the closest emergency \n     room instead of one specified by an HMO, would enable them to \n     keep a doctor who has begun treating them even if that doctor \n     were dropped by the HMO. Republicans rail against regulation \n     of this type, but they fail to see the American people are \n     ready for it.\n\n  These are just a few examples of editorials being written all across \nthe\n\n[[Page S8584]]\n\ncountry this week. Why do they all get it and no one gets it in here \nexcept Democrats and the two or three of our Republican friends who \nhave supported the Patients' Bill of Rights? Why is the debate so \ndifferent all across the country than it is, apparently, here in the \nSenate? Why is it that we have all the nurses supporting us? Why is it \nthat we have all the doctors supporting us? Why is it that we have all \nthe health professionals and all the patients groups supporting us? And \nwhy is it that newspapers and editorials all over the Nation, north, \nsouth, east, and west get it?\n  We wonder whether this is really an issue. We are asked: is this \nreally an issue out there? I can tell you, just from the cases I have \nhad in my own office, that this is an issue. I received a call this \nmorning from Kathy Mills, a registered Republican who called my office \nfrom Tulsa, OK. She said her husband was literally ``killed by an HMO'' \nlast July, and she has been trying to find someone to listen to her \nstory. She has given up her efforts to contact her own State Senators \nbecause they have not responded to her numerous calls.\n  On July 16 last year--1 year ago tomorrow--Mrs. Mills' husband, who \nhad a history of severe congestive heart failure, was seen by an \ninternist at their new HMO for severe chest pain. Without taking a \nthorough patient history and despite a positive EKG, the doctor sent \nMr. Mills home. As Mrs. Mills was later told by doctors at the HMO, \ntheir policy is to refer patients to a cardiologist only after waiting \n10 days, unless the patient is ``having a heart attack on the table.'' \nMr. Mills was released to go back to his job, working outside in 100-\ndegree weather.\n  Mr. Mills died later that day of a massive heart attack.\n  The HMO doctors have been forthcoming, and after extensive inquiry \nMrs. Mills feels certain it is HMO policy that is at fault for her \nhusband's death. Unfortunately, her attorney has informed her she does \nnot have the right to sue the HMO.\n  Mrs. Mills just this morning offered to fly to Washington with what \nlittle money she has left to tell her story to the Members of the \nSenate. Her conviction is that in the future injustices like the \nunnecessary death of her husband will be prevented, or at the least \nthat when they occur the Americans victimized will have some means to \nredress the wrong.\n  People ask whether this is still going on. This is yesterday. Here is \na story about Jacob. Jacob is 4 years old and lives in a midwestern \nState. Jacob's mom has asked that we not use his last name or the name \nof the HMO because she is afraid of what the HMO will do.\n  Jacob was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. The course of \ntreatment recommended by Jacob's doctor was called monoclonal antibody \ntreatment, and it is only available at Memorial Sloan-Kettering \nHospital in New York. Jacob could participate in a clinical trial at \nMemorial Sloan-Kettering that would involve complex surgery, \ntransplant, radiation, and chemotherapy treatment.\n  When Jacob's parents inquired into the clinical trial, their \nphysician told them it was not experimental. Their physician told them \nthat monoclonal antibody treatment is the standard of care for Jacob's \ntype of cancer, and has been standard treatment in use since 1987. Even \nthough this recommended course of action is the standard treatment, \nbecause Jacob's treatment could only be obtained through a clinical \ntrial, his HMO denied him this needed therapy. After many months of \nfighting the HMO from both inside and outside the system, the company \napproved the first stage of Jacob's treatment.\n  However, the story does not end there. Jacob's only hope for a cure \nis to complete the entire course of treatment which comes in four \nstages. Jacob's family continues to live in fear of their HMO because \nhe has not completed the treatment yet and, in the words of his HMO, \n``This determination to provide coverage . . . may be terminated at any \ntime, even if the condition or treatment remains unchanged.''\n  Jacob and his family are currently receiving treatment, but they live \nin fear.\n  I can give you the story that I received last Friday, a very powerful \ncase involving a small boy and how he was denied needed surgery by one \nof the major HMOs in this country.\n  This is happening every day, every hour. People all across the \ncountry understand it. Certainly the parents of these children \nunderstand it. Mrs. Mills understands what is happening. I doubt there \nis a Senator's office that hasn't received similar calls in the last \nfew days.\n  We have had a series of votes in the last 4 days, and each of these \nvotes has been decided in the interest of the insurance industry. They \nhave prevailed over patients' interests, but only by a narrow margin. \nThat is only temporary.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes on the bill. We may have lost \nthe battle for the minds of Republican Senators, but we are winning the \nbattle in the minds of the public.\n  Once the debate is over and the votes are counted, the action will \nmove to the House of Representatives. I believe we will do better in \nthe House because of the groundwork we have laid in the Senate. We \nintend to keep the pressure on. There is still a good chance that a \nstrong Patients' Bill of Rights can be enacted into law by this \nCongress this year. A switch of only two or three votes would have \ngiven us victory after victory on each of these specific issues.\n  If there is an attempt to bury this issue in the Senate-House \nconference, the consent agreement makes clear that we can raise it \nagain and again in the Senate this year. Every day, every week, every \nmonth we delay, more patients suffer.\n\n  This is a Pyrrhic victory for the Republicans. If they keep taking \nmarching orders from HMOs, they will keep losing public support. The \nAmerican people will not be fooled by hollow Republican promises and \ncosmetic Republican alternatives. Patients deserve real protections, \nand not just some patients, but all patients.\n  You should not have to gamble on your health. You should not have to \nplay a game of Republican roulette to get the health care you need and \ndeserve. This issue is not going away. Too many people have had too \nmany bad experiences with abuses by HMOs and managed care health plans. \nThey know the horror stories firsthand. Everyone knows these abuses are \nwrong, and, frankly, we have only just begun to fight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield to the Senator from New Mexico such time as he \nmay consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the chairman. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that I be permitted to speak for 30 seconds as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1379 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish I had brought a prop with me. It \nwould have been the front page of the New Mexico papers in 1997, \nbecause in 1997 across New Mexico there were front-page stories and \nheadlines. Guess what they said: ``New Mexico Passes Patients' Bill of \nRights.''\n  Six months later, in July of 1998, there could have been a comparable \nheadline across New Mexico, my State, the State in which the Democrats \nwant to cover every single person who has health insurance. There could \nhave been another headline saying: ``Patients' Bill of Rights Now \nEffective in New Mexico.''\n  Maybe if I had brought that newspaper with me, some people from that \nside of the aisle would understand. They do not trust the States and \neven if the States already have protection through a bill of rights, \nthey still want to take over nationally.\n  Forty-two States have protections for some or all of the very same \nthings that are in the Democratic bill that the editors across America, \nat least to the extent identified by the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts, seem to be supporting. They do not even say in our State \nwe already have the protection, except they imply it in Texas by \nsaying: How can it get to be so expensive when we already have it?\n  I ask the question: If they already have it, why do we need to pass \none? Our premise is that 42 States already\n\n[[Page S8585]]\n\nhave many of the protections being suggested here. Some of them are \nmoving in the direction of covering more than is being proposed here. \nWhy do we insist that they would be better enforced in Washington, DC? \nI submit to anybody who understands the bureaucracy in Washington, do \nyou really want every State's protection under a bill of rights to be \ndependent on HCFA? HCFA cannot handle in any diligent manner, with any \nreasonable conclusion, the work we have given them on Medicaid and \nMedicare and benefits and figuring out who can pay what. And now they \nwant to give HCFA, from every State in the Union, huge numbers of the \nvery people the other side of the aisle is crying for but who are \nalready protected.\n  I do not know if we will ever get anybody, outside of those who hear \nwhat I am saying, to write that and check it out. It does no good to \nsay the Democrat plan covers 161 million Americans. The question is, \nWhy do we cover 161 million Americans?\n  I will introduce as part of my remarks the entire list of patient \nprotections and mandates that are already in New Mexico's law. It reads \nlike a litany of the issues we have been debating: Emergency room, OB/\nGYN, and how you get protection under it.\n  Everybody in New Mexico, on all the issues we have been discussing, \nis already covered, except whom? Except those the Republican bill \ncovers as we introduced it and have debated it, for it goes out into \nthe land and says there are some people the Texas Bill of Rights does \nnot cover because they cannot; it is not legal for them to cover them. \nSome people in New Mexico are not covered. I wish I could tell you how \nmany, but nobody knows how many. Some have insurance, and we cannot \ncover them with New Mexico's rights. So we are covering them here. So \nit is a bill of rights for those who are uncovered in America.\n\n  I do not know how we will ever make the point, but let me just say, \nif you do not need coverage under a bill of rights because you already \nhave it, then how does anyone get by with coming to the floor and \nsaying: We're covering it anyway, and the other side of the aisle isn't \ncovering it and they don't care? How do you get away with that?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Say it 200 times.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think you just keep saying it, like they have been \nsaying it. It can be nothing else. In fact, there are many States with \nbroader bill of rights' protections today than the Democrat bill, if it \nwere passed. So why do they need it?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to finish. It is the first time I have had to \nspeak. I looked over and you spoke at least 10 times, and you did \nbeautifully.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Not quite.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to finish and then answer any questions \nwhen I finish.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Good.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So I decided the best thing I could do is come here to \nthe floor and see if I could express, in as simple language as I could, \nwhy the Congress needs to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. I think I \nhave tried my very best today to say we probably need one for those who \nare not covered or cannot be covered in our States because, by \noperation of law, the States do not cover them and cannot cover them.\n  Actually, I wish we could say that 200 times. Maybe we ought to. \nEvery time somebody stands up, we ought to say: We're covering those \nwho are uncovered in America. Now let's go on to the rest of the \ndebate, and then put up a sign and say: We're covering 48 million--put \nit up there--because they are the only ones who either do not have this \nprotection or cannot have it. These people are not covered because the \nlaw says you cannot cover them, the States simply do not have the \nauthority to provide these rights to these people, vis-a-vis, the \nhealth insurance they have.\n  Having said that, I believe that answers most the questions that have \narisen in this debate. But, then I understand there remains--I see this \nas only four issues--another very interesting issue. Because at this \nstage of the evolution in the United States of America of settling \ndisputes one goes to court and asks a jury to do it even though plenty \nof criticism exists from laymen and professionals on how inefficient, \nhow lacking in rationale the decisions are that are rendered by juries \nand trial lawyers bringing cases. The Democrats insist that we put that \nin here as the mechanism, the means, the way to settle disputes over \nscope of coverage, whether you have given somebody what they are \nentitled to under an insurance policy or not, or given them the \nspecialists they are entitled to.\n  Can you imagine, we are making a major issue here out of whether the \nlawyers and juries and courtrooms ought to decide that? Can you imagine \nthat we could stand up before a group of people and say, just as the \nmillennium arrives, we have concluded that with all the knowledge we \nhave, everything we know about arbitration, mediation, ways to avoid \ngoing to juries and courtrooms, that this was the way to resolve this \nissue, and if we do not do it, as our opposition says, we are denying \npeople insurance coverage?\n  What we need to look at before the day is over--and what I hope those \nwho wrote editorials will look at--is did the Republicans have in their \nbill a method and means of resolving these disputes which are \nlegitimate disputes? Do we have a method of resolving them that is apt \nto do it expeditiously, professionally, and is it apt to be right?\n  I believe, with what has been added here on the floor and will be in \nthe bill tonight, when we finally vote on it, that we can stand up and \nsay, there is a way.\n\n  We think enough of this issue that we have made it nationwide, as I \nunderstand it. There will be no insurance policies that do not have \nthis approach to settling the solutions across the land. That is pretty \nfair. Because it is sort of generically necessary for whatever set of \nrights you are giving to people.\n  So there are two issues. Frankly, for me, they are both very simple. \nI have explained the one on scope of coverage, and I have just \nexplained the one on why in the world would you get lawyers and juries \ninvolved in the disputes between patients and health care systems on \ncoverage. If doctors perform their service improperly, we still have \nmedical malpractice. That is not being changed here. It is when you sit \ndown and have an argument about a specialist, can you get a decision \nquickly.\n  I have heard from our side, from some very good experts--and as a \nmatter of fact, we on the Republican side are very fortunate. We have a \ngreat doctor helping us. Frankly, when he tells us about this, I am not \neven sure we need a second opinion. He seems to know the answers very \nwell, and we seem to rely on him. We are very glad to have him. He \nsuggested, along with Senator Ashcroft and others, that we ought to \nhave a more straightforward, forthright, expeditious, and enforceable \nprovision to handle the disputes between patients and their insurance \ncoverage as to what they are entitled.\n  Those are two of the issues. To tell you the truth, if those two \nissues could be resolved, we would be well on our way to having it \ndone.\n  There are some other issues that are around on the scope of what \nexactly we ought to mandate? They are not as important as these two. \nWho should we be covering? Should you let lawyers instead of doctors, \nlawyers instead of independent professionals, determine the scope of \ncoverage and the entitlement of people to coverage under insurance, and \nthe delivery of health care under new insurance approaches in the \nUnited States?\n  My last point, those couple of editorials my friend from \nMassachusetts read were written by editorialists who said we should not \nbe concerned about cost; we should only be concerned about care. Let me \ntell you, one of the reasons we do not have enough coverage in the \nUnited States is because health care is expensive. While there are some \nwho think the money just flows down from heaven and we pay for \ncoverage, most people know somebody is paying for it--a business. In my \nState thousands of small businesses are paying for it.\n  If you think it is not important to them as to whether they maintain \ncoverage, how much coverage they are going to pay for it, and whether \ntheir insurance costs go up 6.1 percent or not, then I guarantee you, \nyou have not been reading the letters I am getting in my office from \nsmall businesspeople saying: You cannot give us too many mandates and \nyou cannot have lawyers suing us because of the kind of coverage we \nhave.\n\n[[Page S8586]]\n\n  You may be surprised, but businesses do not have to provide health \ncare. That is the law in America. It is voluntary on the part of most \nbusinesses. I am very pleased that most businesses are moving as \nrapidly as they can to buy insurance.\n  But I guarantee you, the other issue is, how much do we have to add \nto health care costs to get a reasonably good system for patient \nprotection that is not now available in America? That is what we have \nbeen talking about, doing that where it is not available because of the \noperation of law.\n  We could go into three or four more issues, but I choose to give my \nown summary and my own understanding of the real nature and \nphilosophical difference between that side of the aisle, the Democrats, \nand this side of the aisle.\n  Frankly, everyone around here knows I am not a Senator who votes one \nway all the time. I have been known to have a big argument with my \nfriend from Texas, and he votes one way and I vote another. I will not \nchalk up the results, like that scoreboard: Domenici--6; Gramm--0. But \nin any event, we have had those disagreements.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. It was the other way around.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. He will think it was the other way around.\n  But in any event, the point of it is, it does not normally fall on \nthis Senator to come to the floor and brag about our side of the aisle \nbeing right. But I can tell you, on this one I am very pleased with \nwhat has happened. I never have felt more comfortable than I have with \nthis task force of Republicans who have handled this issue.\n  They have been good. They have been sharp. They know the issues, and \nthere has never been a shortage of Senators arguing on this bill. I \nhave been very pleased that they are willing to answer questions far \nmore than I am. They know much more than I do.\n  I believe the issue is as I have painted and described it today. If \nit turns out that by beginning to cover a bunch of people who aren't \ncovered, we only add eight-tenths of a percent to the cost, we don't \ninject into the system lawyers and courtrooms and jury trials to \ndetermine disputes between a provider and patient, and we provide for \nresolution of disputes in an expedited manner, as is going to be done \nin the bill we will introduce when we wrap this thing up tonight, I \nthink we are on the right track.\n  I don't believe the American people, contrary to what my good friend, \nSenator Kennedy, said, are going to be fooled by this. I don't think \nwhen it is over they are going to say: Boy, we would have had much \nbetter health care if the Democrats would have won their way. I think \nmany are going to say it would have been a lot more expensive. I think \nmany of them will say: We would be back in Washington every week trying \nto get the rules out of HCFA, which can't handle what it has now, much \nless handling all the States in terms of the Patients' Bill of Rights \nand the remedies available under it.\n  I thank everybody who worked on our side as diligently as they have. \nI particularly say we are lucky in the Senate to have Dr. Bill Frist as \na Senator. He is on my Budget Committee. I had trouble. I used to say \nhis name ``First'' instead of Frist. It took me a while. He tried to \ncorrect me six or eight times, and I finally got it. I think we are \nvery fortunate to have him here because when he tells us how this \nworks, and he shares the opinion of how the medical people are looking \nat it and what the reality is, I end up thinking Tennessee did us a \nvery special favor by sending him to us.\n  I close by saying, I hope after all this work, the proposal that the \nDemocrats offer will get defeated and that the final Republican bill, \nwhich will be explained again in depth by others, passes. Let's go to \nconference and see how it all turns out.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Do you have any time?\n  Mr. REID. I yield 2 minutes on the bill to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I say to my friend, who is my chairman, \nhow much I respect him and also how much I disagree with him.\n  I ask my friend a question. The Senator said--and I think he said it \nvery clearly and straight from the heart--the Democrats are wrong, it \nis a philosophical difference, that we are wrong to say we need a \nnational bill because the States are taking care of this problem.\n  Senator Dorgan has a chart. I want to ask the Senator if he will take \na look at it. Thirty-eight States have no protection for their people \nwhen it comes to access to specialists. It goes down the list. Many \nStates have virtually no protection on most of the issues we are \ndebating in this Patients' Bill of Rights. The question is, How does \nthe Senator respond to that?\n  He has said States are taking care of it when, just taking \nspecialists, there are no protections for people getting specialists in \n38 States, and there is a whole other list that I won't go into. I \nthink that is an important question. I would like to hear the Senator's \nresponse to it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The fact of the matter is, he says unequivocally, States \nare taking care of it when people in those States are writing to us and \ntelling us: We need a Patients' Bill of Rights at the national level. \nWe have no protection.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I tried as best I could to say 48 States \nhave patients' bills of rights. I did not say 42 States have every \nsingle item that the Democrats want in the Patients' Bill of Rights, \nbut they do have the authority to put in as much as they want. So if \nthe sovereign States, their Governors and legislatures, think your \nlitany of things ought to be there and they are that important, they \nhave the authority to pass it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if I may take back my time, I ran for the \nSenate on a lot of issues. My friend has been elected many more times \nthan I have to the Senate. We stand up and we say what we believe.\n  For example, I know the Senator is very strong on mental health \nprotection. I have been with him on that. For me to think that I am \ngoing to sit here and say some legislature in some other State knows \nmore than what my people tell me, I think we are here to do the \npeople's business. When we look at this list, when we see how many \nthings people don't have, I think it is ducking responsibility to say \nwe should walk away from it.\n  By the way, the Republican bill claims to give people specialists, so \nthe Senator himself has argued in favor of it for 48 million people.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I already have answered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator give me 10 minutes?\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. We have 31 minutes; they have 12 minutes. The minority \nyields 5 minutes to the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. President, for those who have followed the debate this week, \nthere have been some very clear-cut issues decided on the floor of the \nSenate. Sadly, I must report that the Republican majority and the \ninsurance industry have prevailed on every single effort by Democrats \nto provide protections to families across America when it comes to \ntheir health insurance.\n  Take a look at the scoreboard. On the Democratic side, we offered \nprotection to 113 million Americans who were left high and dry by the \nRepublican side and the insurance industry. We lost.\n  We offered an amendment saying that every woman in America could \nchoose her OB/GYN as her primary care physician and could not be \noverruled by an insurance company. We lost.\n  We offered an amendment saying that emergency room care could be at \nthe hospital closest to your home instead of that dictated by the \nhealth insurance policy. We lost.\n  We offered an amendment saying that doctors should make medical \ndecisions and not the health insurance companies. We lost.\n  We offered an appeal process that gave families a fighting chance \nwhen the health insurance company turned them down for coverage. We \nlost.\n\n[[Page S8587]]\n\n  We offered an amendment for access to specialists, when your doctor \nsays that is in your best interest, in order to come out of a process \nhealthy and well. We lost.\n  We offered the latest treatments, clinical trials, prescriptions that \ndoctors recommend to save the life of someone in the most perilous of \ncircumstances. We lost.\n  I have to give credit to the insurance lobby because, through their \nefforts on the floor this week, they have rejected every effort we have \nmade to provide protection for America's families when it comes to \nhealth insurance. I used to think the gun and tobacco lobbies were the \nbig ones on the floor of the Senate. My hat is off to the insurance \nlobby. They have really done a job. With the Republican majority, they \nhave defeated us time and time again on 11 different amendments, 11 \ndifferent efforts to protect American families.\n  There may be dancing tonight, when this is all over, in the \nboardrooms of the health insurance companies in America, but there \nwon't be any dancing in the family rooms for those American families \nwho realize that tomorrow they are just as vulnerable to a decision \nmade by a health insurance company clerk as they were yesterday. There \nwon't be any dancing in the emergency rooms across America, as the \nnurses and doctors there respond to emergencies, never knowing whether \nor not the insurance company will reimburse them for their heroic \nefforts to save lives. And there won't be any dancing in the doctors' \noffices, as they leave the room with the patient to go to a backroom \nand call an insurance company and beg them for the right to make the \nbest medical decision for an individual.\n  I know the Republican side has criticized us for bringing pictures of \nreal people to the floor of the Senate. I know it scalds their \nconscience to see these pictures, pictures of kids such as Rob Cortes, \na little 1-year-old, a little boy I met last Sunday. Every time I voted \non an issue this week, I thought about this little boy and his family \nin the Chicago area. This little 1-year-old breathes with a ventilator, \nas my colleagues can see. He has spinal muscular atrophy. His mom and \ndad fight every day so he can live, and they fight the insurance \ncompany every day to make sure they have an opportunity and access to \nthe miracle drugs they need to give this little boy a chance.\n  The Republicans tell us this is unfair. Don't bring us pictures of \nreal people. We want to talk about statistics. We want to talk about \nthe 1993 Clinton health care bill. Give me a break.\n  I say this: If doubletalk were electricity, the Senate floor would be \na powerplant after the debate that we have had this week on health \ninsurance. I think the American people know what is at stake. They \nrealize they had a chance, with the Democratic Patients' Bill of \nRights, to have some rights and some protections when it comes to their \nhealth insurance, but they have lost.\n  There has been a decision made by the Republican side of the aisle \nand the insurance companies that they are going to create and protect a \nprivileged class in America, the health insurance companies. They won't \nbe answerable to the law, and they will not have to provide the kind of \nmedical protection that every family counts on in America. Time and \nagain, as we have offered these amendments, the Republican majority has \ndefeated them. It is true that two or three of them have crossed the \naisle from time to time to join the Democrats, but never enough to make \na difference.\n  Sadly, that is how this debate is going to end. But it isn't going to \nend today. This debate will continue because we are calling on American \nfamilies across this Nation to join us, to let the Senators on the \nother side of the aisle know that there are more important things in \nthis town than the health insurance industry. Let them realize that \nthis is the only building in America where health insurance reform is a \npartisan issue, because in every house I have visited in Illinois, \nfamilies have told me time and again, whether you are a Democrat, \nRepublican, or independent, you are vulnerable to an accident or \nillness that can leave you at the mercy of a health insurance clerk who \nwill overrule your doctor and make a decision that can make your life \nmiserable. That is what this is all about.\n  Vice President Gore came up here today with a last-minute plea to the \nMembers of the Senate to pass a bipartisan bill to protect families. He \ntold the story of a doctor who was working in the emergency room and a \nman came in and had a cardiac arrest before him. This doctor used a \ndefibrillator and brought the man back to life. When the hospital \nturned in the charges, the HMO rejected him, saying it wasn't an \nemergency, it was only a cardiac arrest.\n  Let me tell you, this issue is not cardiac arrest; it is alive and \nwell, and we will continue to fight it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Texas 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, one of the frustrating things about this \ndebate is that when facts are established, our dear colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle continue to use information that has no \nfoundation in fact and which, in fact, is at variance with the facts. \nSo what I would like to do is to go through and present the facts, not \nas I would like to make them up, or as our colleagues may have made \nthem up, but the facts in terms of the findings of the Congressional \nBudget Office, the nonpartisan arm of Government which does estimates \non the basis of which we run Government.\n  First of all, the CBO estimate which I have here says that the \nultimate effect of the Kennedy bill would be to increase premiums for \nemployer-sponsored health insurance by an average of 6.1 percent. That \nis not my number, that is the number of the Congressional Budget \nOffice. That converts into $72.7 billion of costs that will be borne by \ncompanies that pay insurance and employees that often match that \nexpenditure.\n  Senator Kennedy has made headlines by saying we are talking about a \nhamburger a month. The reality is that the estimate of the Kennedy bill \nby Congressional Budget Office is enough money to buy every franchise \nof McDonald's in America. It is estimated that this cost will mean that \n1.8 million Americans will lose their health insurance. That is 1.8 \nmillion people who won't have access to health care at least paid for \nby insurance of any kind.\n  Our colleagues on the Democrat side of the aisle don't seem very \nconcerned about 1.8 million people losing their health insurance. But \nwe are very concerned. We looked at public opinion strategies \nnationwide poll of small businesses which asked what they would do if \nthe Democrat bill were adopted and you could sue not only the HMO, or \nthe health care provider, but sue the company that bought the insurance \npolicy. The responses indicated that 57 percent of small businesses in \nAmerica say that they either would be very likely to drop health \ninsurance coverage, that is 39 percent, or somewhat likely, 18 percent. \nThat is 57 percent of the insurance for some 70 percent of the working \npeople in America that would be jeopardized by this bill. Yet, over and \nover and over again, we hear this talk as if there are no costs \ninvolved.\n\n  Now our colleagues go on and on as if repeating something would make \nit true, by saying that their bill covers 161 million people and our \nbill covers 48 million people. The way Federal law and State law is \nstructured, the federal government has jurisdiction over 48 million \npeople in terms of health insurance under a Federal law called ERISA. \nMy State has passed a comprehensive health care Bill of Rights. Maybe \nSenator Boxer would not support their Bill of Rights, but Senator Boxer \nwould not be elected in Texas. I might not support the Bill of Rights \nin California, but I probably would not be elected in California.\n  The point is, who elected Senator Boxer to write health care policy \nfor State insurance in Texas? Nobody in Texas elected her. Nor did they \nelect me for that purpose. If I wanted to write State insurance policy \nin Texas, I would have run for the Texas senate and not the U.S. \nSenate.\n  So we have this absurdity that is stated over and over again that \nthey are covering more people than we are. We are covering the people \nin America who are under Federal jurisdiction. They are preempting \nState law in every State in the Union, and Senators\n\n[[Page S8588]]\n\nwho have never been to some States in the Union are dictating to them \nabout the jurisdiction of their legislature. Yet, somehow it is \nsuggested that I don't care about people in Oklahoma. I care about \npeople in Oklahoma so much that if the State has the power to write \ntheir own health care Bill of Rights--which they do in Oklahoma--I want \nthem to write it. That is how much I care about them. But in that area \nwhere it is Federal jurisdiction, I want us to write it.\n  In terms of continuity of care, if there has ever been any debate in \nhistory that could be referred to as somewhat contradictory of a \nprevious position, it is this. I want to remind my colleagues who today \naren't concerned about a 6.1-percent increase in the cost of health \ninsurance, who aren't concerned about 1.8 million people losing their \nhealth insurance, who in 1994 they were so concerned about double-digit \nhealth inflation--an inflation rate we would match if their bill \npassed, they were so concerned that they wrote the Clinton health care \nbill. And they were so concerned about medical necessity that when they \nwrote it, here is what their medical necessity was:\n\n       The comprehensive benefit package does not include an item \n     or service that the national health board may determine is \n     not medically necessary.\n\n  Today they are jumping up and down about medical necessity. They want \na doctor to choose. They want us to write in our bill that we are going \nto let the Federal Government define it. But when they wrote their \nhealth care bill in 1994, they said that a national board would decide.\n  They talk about point-of-service option. But when they wrote their \nhealth care bill, if you didn't join their health care collective, you \nwould be fined $5,000. If your doctor prescribed a health treatment \nthat was not approved by the Clinton administration, your doctor would \nbe fined $50,000. And if they provided a health service that wasn't \nprescribed and you paid for it, your doctor could go to jail for 15 \nyears.\n  Now, that is how much they cared about all these things when they \nwere trying to put America under socialized medicine. They were trying \nto do it because people were losing health insurance, because costs \nwere going up.\n  Yet today they are trying to pass a bill that would drive costs up \nand that would deny people their health insurance.\n  Having spent all of this time answering all of this misinformation, \nlet me spend the rest of my time saying a few things that I feel \nstrongly about.\n  No. 1, I have never been prouder of the Republican majority than I am \ntoday. I have never seen greater collective political courage than I \nhave seen today.\n  It would be very easy with all of this demagoguery about insurance \ncompanies, HMOs, health, consumers, and charts showing scores of HMO's \n12, consumers 0.\n  I remind you that our Democrat colleagues invented HMOs. Ted Kennedy \nin 1978 said:\n\n       I authored the first program of support for HMOs that \n     passed the Senate. Clearly HMOs have done their job.\n\n  What is Ted Kennedy saying today? He loved them so much that he \nwanted to put the whole Nation under one run by the government. But, \ntoday, he is trying to kill HMOs.\n  We are not trying to kill HMOs. I am not ashamed of that.\n  I want to give people a choice so that if they don't want to be in \nHMOs they can get out. We broaden their options. We give people the \nright to fire an HMO.\n  Senator Kennedy gives people the right to sue one. We guarantee \npeople the right to see a doctor. He guarantees the people the right to \nsee a lawyer.\n  I am proud, when it has been so easy to demagogue this issue, that we \nhave stood up for the interests of this country.\n  We have written a very good bill. It cleans up the things in HMOs \nthat needed to be cleaned up. But it doesn't kill off the only \nmechanism we have to control costs.\n  We provide tax deductibility for the self-employed. That will mean \nmillions of people will get health insurance that do not have it today.\n  We let people have medical savings accounts--a new, innovative way to \nlet people choose their own doctor and control costs at the same time.\n  I am proud of what we have done. It is easy to demagogue, but it is \nhard to lead. We have led, and America is going to benefit from our \nleading.\n  Finally, let me say we have come forward with a bill that works--a \nbill that works for people, a bill that holds down costs, a bill that \npromotes equality.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota, Senator \nByron Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I guess my favorite Will Rogers quote is \nthe old one that we all know. He said, ``It ain't what he knows that \nbothers me. It is what he says he knows for sure that just ain't so.''\n  I heard a lot of discussion today about facts and about whose side is \nright. In fact, we just heard the two stages of denial on the central \nargument of the Republicans against our real Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  The first stage is that States provide all of this protection, so we \nshouldn't have to do it. And when informed the States don't do it, they \nsay, well, that might be true, but the States could do all of it if \nthey wanted to. That is the second stage of denial, of course.\n  Let me talk again about some of the people involved in this debate, \nif I might. This is, after all, fundamentally about patient care. It is \nnot a debate about theory.\n  I want to talk about Ethan Bedrick once again. This young boy \npictured here was born under very difficult circumstances. During his \ndelivery, the umbilical cord wrapped around his neck and consequently, \nhe was born with cerebral palsy and a condition called spastic \nquadriplegia. He can't get the rehabilitation services he needs to help \nhim because his HMO says there is only a 50-percent chance of his being \nable to walk by age 5 and that chance is insignificant. The HMO called \na 50-percent chance of being able to walk by age 5 a minimal benefit. \nHis parents appealed and appealed. Guess who they appealed to--the same \npeople who turned them down.\n\n  We know that in 31 States there is no right to an independent, \nexternal appeal. The Republican plan says that Ethan Bedrick and \ncitizens in 31 States are denied coverage. Denied. That is the fact. \nDispute it if you can, but those are the facts and they are stubborn.\n  Or what about Jimmy Adams. Jimmy Adams doesn't have hands or feet \ntoday because his folks had to pass three hospital emergency rooms \nbefore they got to the fourth hospital where the HMO would pay for his \nemergency care. On the hour-long trip to the further hospital, his \nheart stopped beating. They were able to revive him, but too much \ndamage had already been done by the lack of circulation to his limbs. \nThis young child lost his hands and feet due to gangrene.\n  Our opponents say, young Jimmy Adams can stop at any emergency room \nunder the Republican bill. Sorry; not true. The Republican bill doesn't \ncover over 100 million people, and there are 12 States that have no \nprotections with respect to emergency room care.\n  With respect to Jimmy Adams, or a Jimmy Adams of the future, the \nRepublican plan says this: Denied.\n  What about this young fellow born with a severe deformity? Dr. Greg \nGanske, our Republican colleague over in the House, does reconstructive \nsurgery. He surveyed his colleagues, and 50 percent of them had HMOs \ndeny reconstructive surgery for young patients with birth defects such \nas this.\n  Here is the picture Dr. Ganske used when he described the kind of \ncircumstances these children live with.\n  What about an appeal for this young fellow? What about the access to \nthe specialist services needed? The Republican plan says ``denied'' to \nthis young child--denied. Under the Republican plan--and in 38 States--\nthere is no provision for access to specialists for reconstructive \nsurgery.\n  Those are the stubborn facts.\n  Let me show you the bright morning of hope for a young child who was \nborn with a cleft lip who has had access to the appropriate \nreconstructive surgery. This is the same child I just showed you.\n  Here is the way this child looks with reconstructive surgery. What a \nworld\n\n[[Page S8589]]\n\nof difference this makes in a young child's life.\n  This is called patients' rights.\n  Some say it doesn't matter; we don't need it. We say these rights are \ncritical to the health of the people in our country. This is about \nchildren, men, women, families.\n  Would anyone in here, if this were your son or daughter or your \nparent, really stand up and say let the States protect his or her. \nWould you really vote against these basic protections, such as access \nto specialists, if it were your child's health on the line? You know \nthe answer to that. Of course, you wouldn't.\n  We just heard a fill-in-the-blank speech from about three people. You \ncould fill in the blank. Over and over, in debate after debate, year \nafter year, the subject changes, but the mantra remains the same: Let \nthe States do it.\n  During the debate to create Medicare we heard the same thing: We \ndon't need Medicare; let the States do it.\n  On minimum wage--Let the States do it.\n  On protections for residents of nursing homes--Let the States do it.\n  On efforts to create a safer workplace or prevent child labor--Let \nthe States do it.\n  That speech has been given in this Chamber for 150 years, and it is \nso tired, rheumatoid, and calcified that I don't want to hear it \nanymore.\n  We have had to fight for every step, for progress on such issues as \ncreation of the Medicare program, a safe workplace, and minimum wage. \nTonight we are fighting for something called a Patients' Bill of \nRights. All along the way, we see people digging in their heels saying \nfor lots of reasons that they don't want to do it.\n  We need to do it for these children. No longer shall we deny them the \nrights they deserve in our health care system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from North \nCarolina, John Edwards.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, actually for almost 20 years before I came to the \nSenate, I had an opportunity to see firsthand what insurance companies \ndo to people because of the type of work I did.\n  What I saw was they take people's money. They deny them coverage when \nthey need it, and when they need them the worst, they are never there.\n  What I have seen on the floor of the Senate for the last week is what \ninsurance companies do in Washington.\n  What they do is this: They make certain that the power in the health \ncare industry in this country remains with them.\n  They have done that in a remarkably effective way. It has been \nextraordinary to watch what has happened over the course of the last \nweek.\n  It boils down to--at least, to me as a first-time observer of this--a \nvery simple fact. On the floor of the Senate this week, insurance \ncompanies have won and the American family has lost. The children, \nparents, and members of American families have lost and the insurance \ncompanies have won. This is what has happened.\n  No. 1, insurance companies cannot be held accountable. They \nabsolutely cannot be held accountable. They have done everything they \ncan do to make sure that occurs. The reason for that is very simple. I \nhave listened to my colleagues on the other side argue with great \nemotion that we want to turn health care over to lawyers.\n  Exactly the opposite is true. This is why. What happens, in every \namendment, in every single bill--including the underlying bill offered \nby the other side--this language appears: ``when medically necessary \nand appropriate under the terms and conditions of the plan.'' That \nlanguage is the killer language. It is the language the insurance \ncompanies need, that they desperately want, and that they have gotten. \nIt is the language that is going to remove any power from any patient \nor any family or any doctor in America as a result of what is passed on \nthe floor.\n  The reason they are wrong about lawyers is because the plans control. \nUnder what has passed during the course of this week, the plans always \ncontrol. They control what benefit patients receive to begin with; they \ncontrol what patients can appeal; they control what happens on appeal.\n  I ask the American people: Who do you believe writes these plans for \nthe big HMO companies of America? Who do you think writes these plans? \nLawyers. Their teams of lawyers write these plans.\n  When we leave the floor tonight, starting tomorrow, everything that \nis passed will be handed to the HMOs; the very first thing they will do \nis get in their cars and drive down to their big law firms and hand \nthese over to the lawyers and the lawyers will go to work. What the \nlawyers are going to do is write health care plans that make absolutely \ncertain the insurance companies have total control over what happens, \nthey have control over the initial benefit, they have control over the \nappeals process, and that they cannot, under any circumstances, be held \naccountable.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. It appears what the Senator has said as an experienced \ntrial lawyer from the State of North Carolina, the lawyers will be \nunder the control of the insurance companies?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. That is absolutely true. These are lawyers hired by the \ninsurance companies.\n  Mr. REID. The talk of the lawyers controlling what is going to happen \nwith the Patients' Bill of Rights is a flip-flop. The lawyers will \ncontrol what goes on with health care in America as a result of what \nhas happened here, is that right, because the patients have lost and \nthe insurance companies have won?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Absolutely.\n  What will happen is that the lawyers will write the plans, and under \nevery single thing we have passed during the course of this week, the \nplan controls; the insurance company controls.\n  If anyone thinks for a minute that the lawyers who are hired by these \ninsurance companies are not going to write the plans in a way that \nprotects the plan and the HMOs and never protects the patient, they are \nliving in never-never land. That is exactly what will happen.\n\n  As a result, in its simplest terms, the insurance company and their \nteam of lawyers have won this battle. The patients have lost.\n  One last thing. We have heard lots of talk about cost from the other \nside. That is a false argument. It is a false argument for a simple \nreason. No. 1, what will happen under our real Patients' Bill of Rights \nis that we get patients to emergency rooms, to specialists, to the \ndoctors who they really need to see as quickly as possible. That has an \nextraordinarily important cost effect, which is they get treated more \nquickly, their condition and disease is diagnosed more quickly, and as \na result the long-term costs associated with that are reduced.\n  Our bill will reduce costs over the long haul. It will absolutely \nreduce costs when the long-term expenses and costs are considered.\n  Second, when an HMO or health insurance company acts recklessly and \nirresponsibly and a child, for example, is severely injured and that \nchild incurs millions and millions of health care costs over the course \nof his or her lifetime, the health insurance will not be held \naccountable. No way are they held accountable. Those costs--the \nmillions and millions of dollars--don't go away.\n  The question is, Who pays? The American people pay. The American \ntaxpayers pay. They pay through Medicaid. That is the only way those \ncosts will be paid. Instead of an HMO being responsible for paying, the \nAmerican taxpayer pays. The people listening to this pay.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are in the final inning, so it is time \nto bring out the scoreboard.\n  HMOs, 12; patients, zero. It is a shutout. On every amendment, \npatients have lost and the HMOs have won. Mr. President, 12-0 and \ncounting.\n  The Republican bill will pass. It is a bill supported by the \ninsurance industry. It is a bill supported by the HMOs.\n  This is what it leaves out: It leaves out OB/GYNs for women, the \nright to a specialist, the right to an emergency room, the right to a \nclinical trial for every fatal disease, the right for all Americans to \nbe covered--70 percent of\n\n[[Page S8590]]\n\nAmericans are not covered in the Republican bill. It leaves out the \nright to hold HMOs accountable if they kill you, if they maim you, if \nthey hurt you or any member of your family.\n  The Republican bill is a shutout. The American people are shut out \nfrom any protections. Patients are shut out. Decency and fairness are \nshut out. And the HMOs will continue to put their dollar signs ahead of \nour vital signs.\n  We will not give up. The innings may be over on this particular \nbattle, but we are going to be here. We will be here for several more \nyears and we will fight this. As Senator Dorgan said, a lot of these \nfights took a long time. It took a long time to get Medicare. There \nwere fights from the other side of the aisle that it was a horrible \nidea to give senior citizens coverage.\n  I could go back in history. We will be on the right side of history \nbecause we are fighting for what is right for the patients of this \ncountry, for the people of this country. It has been a good debate. I \nam glad we have had it. I think it does show the difference between the \nparties. I think we are very open and honest about our differences. I \nam proud to stand on this side of the aisle on this Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield the final 4 minutes to the person \nwho offered this amendment with Senator Kerrey, the junior Senator from \nthe State of Maryland, Barbara Mikulski.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, it has been interesting to me that \nduring the two hours I have been here, in the time allocated to this \namendment, no one from the other side has debated the merits of the \nKerrey-Mikulski amendment.\n  We have heard about the health care plan, we heard about Mrs. \nClinton's health plan, but no one challenged the fact that the American \npeople should have continuity of care. Just because a business changes \ntheir insurance company, you should not have to change your doctor.\n  Also, we heard a great deal about the States--let the States do it. I \nbring to the attention of my colleagues, only 22 States have a \ncontinuity-of-care provision; 28 States do not. So, 28 States are \nvulnerable to the lack of a continuity-of-care provision.\n  Also, all 50 States have a Constitution. So why should we have one \nourselves? Why should we have one? The reason we have a Federal \nConstitution is that we are one nation under a law that should protect \nall American people and we also have a Federal Constitution that we \nlove and cherish because we have a Bill of Rights.\n  Imagine if we were still waiting for the 14th amendment, if we were \ndoing it one State at a time. Imagine if we women had gotten the right \nto vote, if we had done it one State at a time. Do you think the \nrailroads would have let us have the direct vote by the people of the \nSenate? No; I think we would still be choo-choo-ing along under the old \nsystem.\n  Let's talk about the cost. I think that is a fallacy in the argument. \nThis Congress is going to debate in the next week or two a tax bill \nthat could plunge us into a deficit. Sure, we think we have a surplus, \nbut it is a promissory note surplus; it is not a guaranteed surplus. So \nwhile we are going to talk about cost, just wait until we start talking \nabout that tax bill.\n  The other thing is, we did not hesitate to pass the national \nballistic missile system. I will tell you something. My constituents in \nMaryland are more at risk for their lives and safety from insurance \ngatekeepers preventing them from having access to the medical care they \nneed than they are of some missile striking us in Baltimore, Crisfield, \nHagerstown, or all around the State, or this country.\n  So let's not talk about cost. And let's not invent phony arguments. \nLet's go back to what we are debating, the Kerrey-Mikulski amendment \nthat says let's provide continuity of care. It is very straightforward. \nIt would allow for a transition that, when a doctor is no longer \nincluded as a provider under a plan, or employers change plans, it \nwould provide 90-day transitional care for any patient undergoing an \nactive course of treatment with a doctor.\n  That means if you have diabetes, it means if you have high blood \npressure, it means if you have glaucoma, that you can at least have a \ntransition plan to have someone meet your needs.\n  Then we make three exceptions. We make them for pregnancy, we make \nthem for terminal illness, and we make them for someone who is \ninstitutionalized.\n  A patient who is dying should not have to change a doctor in the last \ndays of his or her life. If you are pregnant, I think you ought to have \nthe doctor through post-partum care that is directly related to \ndelivery. That's what we are fighting for today, and I hope we pass \nthis amendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I just want to say something and get it \noff my chest. It is offensive to me, and almost demeaning to this \nSenate, for people who disagree with the work that has been done by \npeople such as Dr. Bill Frist, and Senator Collins from Maine, and \nSenator Jeffords, who worked hard on this bill, to suggest that they \nare bought and paid for by insurance companies and HMOs.\n  I haven't talked to an HMO, but I have talked to some people who are \nconcerned about expanding costs of health care. It is Alabama \nbusinesses. We had the Business Council of Alabama in my office just a \nfew days ago, a group of them. It is the biggest group in the State. \nThe first thing they said was: Jeff, please don't vote for something \nthat is going to skyrocket health care costs. We are afraid of that. We \nhave already got an 8-percent inflation cost increase predicted for \nnext year; 8 percent already. You vote on a bill, the Kennedy bill, \nwith 6 percent more? Please don't do that. We can't afford to cover our \nemployees. They are going to lose health care.\n  And the numbers back that up. This is what we are about.\n  It offends me to have it suggested that some insurance company is \nhere--HMOs are not even here, that I have observed. They do not care \nwhat the rules are. You tell them what the coverage is, what the rules \nare, and they will write the policy and up the premium to pay for it. \nAnd working Americans are going to pay for it. That is what is really \nunfair to me.\n  For Senators to suggest that there is a scorecard and only truth and \njustice and decency and fairness occur when her amendment is voted on? \nWe have amendments. This whole bill mandates and controls and directs \nHMOs on behalf of patients. Everything that is in it, that is what it \ndoes. Some just want to go further, and whatever you do is never \nenough. There is always another amendment to go further.\n  It is a sad day when we have a group of fine Americans who worked on \nthis legislation for 2 years or more, to present a bill that is \ncoherent, that improves and protects the rights of people who are \ninsured to a degree that has never happened before, and have them \naccused of being a tool for some special interest group. It is just not \nso. The Members on the other side know it, and they ought not to be \nsaying it. It is wrong for them to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to comment on the process. We have \nseen pictures of infants with various medical challenges that I need to \nclear up. It keeps coming back and back again. The example of cleft \npalate is being used over and over. I want to demonstrate, to help \neducate our colleagues, because obviously it is not coming through what \nis in the bill, what will be in the final bill tonight.\n  No. 1, let's just say the baby is born with a cleft palate, which is \na defect in the upper part of the mouth. The doctor recommends surgery, \nregardless of what is in the health plan. The HMO contract says \n``cosmetic'' surgery is not covered.\n  So the medical claim is made. The doctor and the patient say: Yes, \nthis thing is medically indicated. The plan has written down that \ncosmetic surgery is not indicated. So they say: We want to do something \nabout it.\n  Today they have to throw up their hands. There is nothing they can \ndo. That is why we need a Patients' Bill of Rights. What happens? We \nhave an internal review built into the plan. So if there is a \ndisagreement, the doctor and\n\n[[Page S8591]]\n\nthe patient disagree with the plan, there is a process, for the first \ntime for most of these plans, for internal review. They may have other \nphysicians who are affiliated with the plan making that decision. Let's \njust say they came up with an adverse decision. Basically, the second \nopinion inside the plan, the internal review, said: No; I am with the \nplan. We are still not going to cover it.\n  Well, is it eligible, or is it not, for external review? Remember the \nexternal review plan. You have the managed care company; you have the \nentity that is government regulated; State, Federal, Department of \nHealth and Human Services regulates this entity. This entity appoints \nan independent doctor, a medical specialist, if necessary, to do the \nreview: Is it eligible or is it not?\n  The key worlds are, ``Is there an element of medical judgment?'' \nThere clearly is, because you have a doctor saying that cleft palate \nneeds to be repaired. So automatically--and that is the trigger--it \ngoes to an independent external review.\n  We have heard a lot of people say it is not independent. It is pretty \nindependent if you have a managed care company, you have an entity that \nis government regulated here that is unbiased--the words are actually \nin the plan--appointing an independent reviewer, who is a doctor. Or, \nif it happens to be a chiropractor of concern--it can be a \nchiropractor, I might add, who is independent, a specialist in the \nfield, who makes the final decision.\n  In the independent external review, the reviewer makes an independent \nmedical determination made on a whole list of things that we have in \nthere--not just what the plan considers, but best medical practice, \ngenerally accepted medical practice, the peer reviewed literature, the \nbest practices out there, what his colleagues are doing--and then a \ndecision is made and whatever decision is made, it is binding. It is \nbinding on the plan.\n  Let's just say it is binding on the plan, so let's have ``repaired'' \nhere. Let's say the plan says, ``We are still not going to do it. I \ndon't care what the reviewer says.'' You are going to see in the final \nbill that they have to do it. If they do not do it in a timely \nfashion--I want everybody to read the bill--they are going to be fined.\n  Mr. President, I ask for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for an additional 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the Chair.\n  So the decision has been made by the independent reviewer, and it is \nbinding on the plan that you do the repair, that it is medically \nnecessary and appropriate. The plan has to do it. We are still worried. \nWhat about that plan, if it just doesn't want to do it? Basically, what \nwe have are penalties that are built in the bill. They have to do it, \nthey have to do it in a timely fashion, and if they do not they are \nfined $10,000. Not only that, if they are fined $10,000 and still don't \ndo it, immediately you can go to somebody else and have it repaired. \nAnd who is going to pay for that? The initial plan.\n  To me, that is the way the process works. You have an independent \nreviewer. You guarantee the patient gets that repair in a timely \nfashion, if in that independent review it is thought to be medically \nnecessary and appropriate, regardless of what the HMO contract says.\n  Internal appeals, external appeals, independent reviewer with \npenalties built in if that is not carried out in a timely fashion, and \nthe guarantee that the care can get done because you can go, even have \na third party do it and charge it back to the initial plan--unbiased, \nindependent, internal, external appeals, and that is the accountability \nprovisions that are built into this bill. I am very proud of the fact \nit is there. It will change the way medicine is practiced by managed \ncare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 35 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Just for a question, may I yield a minute to Senator \nDorgan?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Yes. Sure.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I just wanted to observe for one moment, I listened to \nthe presentation. That presentation works with respect to the people \nwho are covered. But there are 120 million who are not covered. If one \nsays those who are not covered are covered by a State, we must point \nout that 38 States do not have provisions that guarantee access to \nspecialists. I want to make the point.\n  Mr. FRIST. Say again, covered by that?\n  Mr. DORGAN. There are 120 million people, roughly, not covered. And \nwe have 38 States--if the proposition is ``but if we don't cover them \nin our bill, the States do,'' there are 38 States that do not cover \nthem either.\n  Many of these children will simply not have access to a specialist. \nThose are the facts.\n  Mr. FRIST. May I respond on his time? This is a critical point \nbecause we have been debating scope. It is very important for the \nAmerican people to understand and for our colleagues to understand that \nscope, and when it comes to accountability, the internal and external \nappeals, the independent reviewer does not just apply the 48 million \npeople not covered by the States. It is covered by people who are both \nERISA covered, federally regulated, as well as the States, and it is \nimportant my colleagues understand that because that is a huge part of \nour bill. In many ways, it is the heart of our bill for the appeals \nprocess, the accountability, what I just went through, both ERISA, \nfederally regulated plans, and State plans. That is why it is so hard, \nin the last hours of this debate when it is so misunderstood what is in \nthis plan. That is why I tried to go through it very clearly. It covers \nall 124 million people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much times remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 21 seconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate the clarification made by \nour colleague from Tennessee. My colleague from Tennessee said we have \nthis appeal process which applies to all plans, State-regulated plans \nas well as federally regulated plans, and that is very important. For \npeople to say this would not have an appeal process, it would not apply \nto them, they are absolutely wrong. Any employer plan in the country \nwould, from the internal and external appeal under the bill which \nhopefully we will be passing shortly.\n  For the information of our colleagues, we are going to be voting in \nthe next minute or two on the pending amendment, and then we will take \nfinal action on the substitute that will be offered by Senator Lott and \nmyself and others. We expect to be voting on that, just for the \ninformation of our colleagues, by 8:15, hopefully no later than 8:30. \nWe are going to be wrapping this up.\n  I have one final comment. I urge my colleagues to vote no on the \npending amendment. The pending amendment deals with continuity of care, \nall of which we support, but it tells the States: We don't care what \nyou are doing. It is another one of these examples of we know better, \nwe can define continuity of care better from Washington, DC, than the \nStates. That is a serious mistake.\n  In addition to overruling State laws, it also takes away an existing \nright under ERISA. It eliminates injunctive relief which would apply to \neverybody in the plan. It eliminates class action and injunctive relief \non page 8 in the amendment. I do not know why they put it in. It is \nwrong. It is in the amendment. A person can go to court and say: I am \nentitled to the benefit under the plan, and the judge can agree, but \nthe court can only agree for that one individual. It cannot agree for \nall the participants in that plan. That is a violation of current law \nwhich takes away rights in existing law. It is a serious mistake and \nshould not be allowed. I urge my colleagues to vote no on the \nunderlying amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time. I ask for the yeas and nays \non the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n[[Page S8592]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1253. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative assistant called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions).

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott], for himself and \n     Mr. Nickles, proposes an amendment numbered 1254 to amendment \n     No. 1232.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have consulted with the Democratic leader, \nSenator Daschle, on this next unanimous consent request. I know Members \nwill be interested in this.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur on passage of S. 1344, as \namended, at 8:20 this evening, with the Lott substitute and amendment \nNo. 1232 having been agreed to and notwithstanding paragraph 4 of rule \nXII and the consent agreement of June 29, 1999.\n  I further ask that the time between now and 8:20 be equally divided \nbetween the two leaders, or their designees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, that having been agreed to, the final vote \nwill occur at 8:20, with the time equally divided between now and then. \nSo Senators who want to participate should be prepared to be here to be \ninvolved in the debate. Those who want to get supper at this point, now \nis the time to do it.\n  Having said that, I want to go ahead and make my statement on this \nsubstitute package at this time. Then I will yield to the assistant \nmajority leader, Senator Nickles, who will divide the balance of our \ntime between Members on our side of the aisle who wish to speak on the \nfinal package.\n  I think we have had a really good debate on this issue. We have been \non it 4 full days now, into the night on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, \nand now Thursday. There have been a number of amendments offered. Some \nof them have passed and some have failed. But I think it has been \nhandled quite well on both sides of the aisle. I believe we are now \nready to finish the debate and get to final action on this legislation.\n  I thank the floor managers for the good work they have done. Senator \nNickles and Senator Jeffords on our side have been ably assisted by a \nnumber of our colleagues who have spent long hours on the floor, \nincluding Senators Frist, Collins, and a number of others. Senator Reid \nhas done an excellent job as the whip on the Democratic side of the \naisle, working with Senator Nickles on behalf of the leaders to make \nsure time has been handled properly, and working out the charts on what \namendments would be offered when, which has proven not to be an easy \ntask, but one they have done a great job on.\n  Of course, I have enjoyed the exchanges that involved Senator Kennedy \nand sometimes Senator Gramm. It has been interesting, and I guess we \ncan say elucidating in some respects. I also thank the task force on \nour side that has worked for a year and a half on this issue to make \nsure we were ready to go with an alternative, or to go with a solution \nto the problems we found in this area. They have done excellent work. \nAgain, this task force was chaired by Senator Nickles. Other members \nwere Senators Roth, Gramm, Collins, Frist, Gregg, Santorum, Sessions, \nEnzi, and Hagel.\n  There has been a lot of great work by those members of the task force \nand members of the Health Committee who spent a lot of time and \nparticipated in the debate that has gone forward. I have really learned \nto appreciate the statement I heard on the floor earlier, that with Dr. \nFrist, you really don't need a second opinion. He has done a great job. \nSometimes it has been hard to understand for those of us who have not \nbeen in the medical profession. I appreciate that.\n  I think it is time we moved forward. We have done good work. Let's \nreport out this legislation and go to conference and let's get a \nresult.\n  There are certain things patients do need in America. Consumers do \nneed some guarantees. I could go through a list of areas where there \nare problems, and I am going to go over the solutions we have here. I \nthink the worst thing we can do now is to not wrap this up with a \nconcluding favorable vote.\n  Now, there are some who will say the President will veto this bill. \nWhen we passed the missile defense bill, the word was: I will veto it. \nBut we worked it out and he signed it. It was the same thing on \neducation flexibility. The word was, you have language in here on the \nIndividuals With Disabilities Education Act and we thought we should \nmeet our commitment there before we spent money on a lot of other \nprograms. In the end, we worked out the disagreements and the President \nsigned education flexibility.\n  Today, for the first time in history, enrolling, signing of a bill \nwas done by Senator Thurmond and by the Speaker, and it was sent by \nInternet to the White House--the Y2K liability bill. It came out of \ncommittee on a partisan vote, but some Democrats worked with all of the \nRepublicans and we got a bill through the Senate. It took us three \ntries. We were told the President would\n\n[[Page S8593]]\n\nveto this bill, but he is going to sign the bill.\n  The point is, to the President and to those of you who haven't \nsupported the Republican position on this Patients' Bill of Rights \nPlus, work with us. If you want to get something done, let's make it \nhappen. If you want an issue, you have got enough votes, you will have \nissues; so will we. And then what? Is America going to be better off? \nNo. Let's get results. We have done that in the past on other issues \nrelated to health. So I challenge our Democratic friends to join us in \nthis effort.\n  This is the main event. We have gone through a number of votes and we \nhave had our debate on these amendments. But now we are dealing with a \ncomprehensive package that the task force has developed on the \nRepublican side of the aisle, and it will strengthen the rights of \npatients and improve the way HMOs work, without wrecking the American \nhealth care system.\n  The American people don't want the Federal Government to take over \nhealth care. They don't want that. They don't want bureaucrats making \nthe decisions, and they don't want it being determined by a bunch of \nlawsuits. But they do want some action to clarify and solve some of the \nproblems we have.\n  Make no mistake about it, the version of this bill that we have \noffered is far superior to the Democratic bill, which I believe \ncontains a lot of bad policy. It is dangerous in many respects: \ndangerous because, under the guise of humanitarian concerns, it would \ndrive into the ranks of the uninsured some 1.8 million Americans; \ndangerous because, under its compassionate rhetoric, it would threaten \nthe ability of most small businesses to provide health insurance to \ntheir employees; dangerous because it would place the scalpels of \nlitigation into the hands of the trial lawyers and virtually invite \nthem to carve up the Nation's health care system.\n  I don't believe the American people want that. The system is not \nperfect. HMOs are not perfect, although the quality of their care, as \nevery other consumer product, can vary tremendously from one group to \nanother, from one region to another. In my own State of Mississippi, we \nonly have about 5 percent of our health care that is provided by \nmanaged care organizations--5 percent.\n  So we have a very different view and set of concerns than do some of \nthe other States where there is a lot more activity in this area.\n  If there is one thing we have learned from the downfall of the \nClinton health package in 1994, it is this: The American people don't \nwant the Government to control health care. They do want solutions, \nthough, to some of the real problems that exist, such as portability, \nwhich we did deal with. They want us to recognize the problems where \nthey really exist, but they don't want political grandstanding in \nWashington to imperil the highest quality health care in the world.\n  I heard it said yesterday on the floor, ``Health care in America is \nin real trouble.'' There are concerns about the evolution that is \noccurring.\n  But health care in America is still the best that the minds of men \nhave conceived.\n  My mother is alive today because of medical procedures. She is on her \nthird pacemaker. She is doing fine. If her knees would hold up, she \nwould still be out looking for a date.\n  And the pharmaceuticals and the medicines they make are miracle \ndrugs.\n  We should not kill the goose that laid the golden egg.\n  Can we improve it? Can we work with all those involved in the system \nto make it better. We can do that. That is what we are doing today.\n  I hate to think where we would be if the Congress, 20 or 30 years \nago, had attempted to micromanage health care the way this Democratic \nlegislation attempts to do now.\n  I wonder if we would, today, have the non-invasive surgery, the \nmiracle drugs, the sophisticated diagnostics that we all take for \ngranted.\n  If the Government moved in and said we are going to start dictating \nthis and say what you can do, what you can't do, and when you can do \nit, we would have a loss of that entrepreneurial, dramatic innovation \nand spirit that we have had in health care in America today.\n  The Congress should not imperil the continuing transformation of \nAmerican medicine. Will it be different in 10 years? You bet it will. \nSo will life in America. It is happening so fast that it is \nbreathtaking.\n  It is not our job to control or dictate that transformation.\n  Our job is to find ways for more Americans to have broader access to \nthose innovations in health care.\n  That is precisely the point of our Republican Patients' Bill of \nRights Plus. We want to give more clout to health care consumers while, \nequally important, making it easier for families to get insurance. They \nwill have a choice. They decide for themselves how they are going to \nget this care.\n  All the consumer rights in the world don't matter an aspirin if you \naren't able to become a consumer. That's why our Republican bill \ncreates new opportunities for uninsured Americans to buy into the \nhealth care system.\n  For starters, our bill makes all Americans eligible for medical \nsavings accounts, not just the 50,000 currently allowed in a pilot \nprogram.\n  Give people that option to get into a medical savings account and to \nmake the choice as to how they will use it. And give them the reward. \nIf they don't have to spend it, they get to keep it. What a great \nAmerican idea.\n  We offer full deductibility for health care costs. That alone will \nmake insurance more affordable for 16 million Americans.\n  That is the way to go. We should make it deductible--not just for the \nself-employed, although we ought to do that, but for all of them. That \nwould solve the problem of a lot of these small business men and women \nwho can't afford to provide the coverage for their employees. Let them \ndeduct the cost when they choose what they want.\n  We provide full deductibility for self-employed persons, so these 3.3 \nmillion hard-working people, and their families will have the same tax \nbreak that big business has. At least 132,000 households will be able \nto afford health coverage with this provision for the first time.\n  At every point, our approach is to expand access to health care. That \nis our greatest contrast with the other package that has been offered \nby Senator Kennedy and Senator Daschle.\n  It is worth repeating.\n  If we went with their proposal, it would result in the loss of \ninsurance for an estimated 2 million people.\n  That is far too heavy a price to pay for some of the things we have \nargued about this week.\n  This bill, the substitute amendment I am offering, is the main event \nof the debate of health care this week.\n  For the 48 million Americans whose health care plans are not \nprotected by existing State regulations--that is a critical point--it \nwill provide these things.\n  I want to emphasize that. The bill we are about to vote on will \nprovide these things:\n  Guaranteed access to emergency room care;\n  Direct access to OB/GYN without prior authorization;\n  Direct access to pediatrician without prior authorization;\n  Better continuity of care if your doctor leaves a health plan;\n  Guaranteed access to specialists;\n  Improved access to medications;\n  Protection of decisionmaking by doctors and patients;\n  And, very importantly, our bill provides a way to get a review.\n  Dr. Frist talked a lot about that. If the doctor makes a \nrecommendation, and he and the patient disagrees with what the managed \ncare organization says, they will have a chance to have a review \ninternally, and then one externally with expedited procedures. And, at \nthat point, there is still the opportunity for lawsuits. If they don't \ncomply with the result, there will be penalties for noncompliance.\n  Again, instead of getting a lawsuit--which may be nice when it is \nfinally concluded for your heirs--you will get action. You will get a \ndecision through an appeals process.\n  That is the way to go.\n  I am not critical of lawsuits because I have a problem with lawyers. \nI am one. I was on both sides of this issue for plaintiffs and \ndefendants when I practiced law. I was a public defender in my home \ncounty. I understand there is a necessity and a time for lawsuits. But\n\n[[Page S8594]]\n\nI don't think it should be the first resort. It should be the last \nresort. See if you can work it out. See if you can design an appeals \nprocess that will get you to a conclusion and that will get results, \nrather than a lawsuit that may be great for the deceased person's \nbeneficiaries.\n  We believe patients should have a timely and cost-free appeals \nprocedure to contest any denial of coverage. We believe patients should \nnot suffer discrimination based on genetic testing. Our bill forbids \nit.\n  We believe government should facilitate breakthroughs in medicine and \nhelp providers gain access to them. Our bill does that, too.\n  What we do not do is put American health care in the hands and in the \npockets of the trial lawyers.\n  Senator Jeffords has said it best: ``You can't sue your way to better \nhealth care.''\n  In that regard, the Democratic bill that has been before us this week \nreminds me of the old days of medicine. Well, we will bleed the \npatients. And, believe me, I think that is what would happen if we went \nwith what they have proposed. It would be bled with Federal-level \nbureaucrats. They would be bled in the courts.\n\n  That is not the answer. I think that is a bad idea. There is a better \nway--a way that protects the rights of patients without imperiling the \nNation's health care system; a way that opens the door to medical care; \nthat gets more people covered by the insurance of their choice; a way \nthat educates consumers so that they, rather than the government \nbureaucrats, can make their own informed choices.\n  That is the sum and substance of our Patients' Bill of Rights Plus. \nIt is ``plus,'' because it is a bill of rights, but also it provides \nsome tax opportunities through the medical savings accounts and the \ndeductibility.\n  I thank many Senators who have worked on this issue on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  I think we all know a little more about this subject than we did, and \nmaybe more than we ever wanted to know.\n  I have every expectation that it will win the Senate's approval and \nfind favor in the House of Representatives.\n  I am optimistic, as I always am, that we can get a result. If we make \nup our minds to do that, we will.\n  This bill addresses the real problems many Americans face with the \ndelivery of health care. It expands access to health insurance and \nmakes it more affordable. It bans genetic discrimination in health \ncare, expands research, and educates the consumers.\n  In short, it is the right thing to do, and this is the right time to \ndo it.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am a little bit confused over just what \nwe accomplished in the past week.\n  As I understand it--I think it is pretty accurate--the Republican \nbill will pass. However, the President has indicated that he is going \nto veto this bill. And there is no question that the veto will be \nsustained. Then where are we? What have we accomplished in a week?\n  It seems to me that we have let the American people down in a \nsituation such as has been outlined. People can say the President \nshouldn't veto. He is indicating he is going to do that. That is his \nprivilege, obviously. We have been through that before.\n  So, therefore, it seems to me that we have to ask ourselves: Could we \nhave done a better job? It seems to me that we could have.\n  I greatly regret we are not able to present the legislation which a \nbipartisan group of us had the privilege of working on. We believe that \nlegislation would have accomplished something that we were not able to \naccomplish, as I previously outlined.\n  I believe we ought to cover all Americans; that is, all privately \ninsured Americans--164 million. The legislation we will pass will not \ndo that.\n  I believe we ought to have an effective and timely external review \nprocess to resolve coverage disputes. I am not sure the legislation we \nhave before us--and that we will shortly pass and having examined it--\naccomplishes that.\n  I think we ought to be able to give patients the right to sue in \nFederal court for economic damages--only in the Federal court, and not \nin the State courts. I certainly have supported legislation to prevent \nthe suits in the State courts.\n  We have dropped from our bill the controversial provisions codifying \nthe Federal law--the professional standard of medical necessity. \nInstead, we added language to our external review provisions to ensure \nthat external reviewers have a meaningful standard of review.\n  It is with some regret that I announce that I recognize we are not \ngoing to have a chance to present our legislation, and I think it would \nhave been good. I think we would have avoided the problems we currently \nhave before us and that our Nation and our citizens would be better \noff.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as we prepare for final passage of the \nRepublican HMO legislation, I come to the Senate floor to express my \ndisappointment and my frustration with this end product. This bill is a \nfailure and ultimately we will all suffer the consequences of the \nmajority's reluctance to protect patients.\n  I had high hopes at the beginning of the week that we could come \ntogether on some of the key areas of agreement and produce a good \nbipartisan bill to protect patients. I had hoped for a bill to put the \nhealth care decisions back into the hands of patients and consumers.\n  Our health care system is in a state of flux. It has moved from a \nsystem that served people only when they got sick and encouraged \noverutilization. Now we have a system where economic barriers are \nerected to prevent patients from accessing care. We have gone from a \nsystem of waste and over-utilization to a system where patients cannot \nget the care for which they paid. Decisionmaking--life and death \ndecisionmaking--is now too often solely in the hands of insurance \nexecutives focused on profits and quarterly reports. Who is looking out \nfor the patients?\n  We need to restore a balance with a system where insurance protects \nyou when you become ill, but also helps prevent you from becoming sick \nin the first place. We need a system where the ultimate decision rests \nin the hands of patients based on the medical advice of their \nphysicians. We need a system where people are fighting illness, not \nfighting the insurance company. We need a system where doctors are not \nspending 45 minutes on the phone with an insurance company so a sick \nchild can be admitted to a hospital. We need a system where parents are \nfree to stop at the first, closest emergency room and not drive to the \none their insurer commands if their child has been hit by a car.\n  I know such a system does and can exit. One of my greatest concerns \nis what the failure of Patients' Bill of Rights means to managed, \ncoordinated care. Let me tell my colleagues, I support managed care. I \nsupport a coordinated care approach that is focused on prevention and \nearly detection of disease.\n  HMOs and managed care were born in my state of Washington. The \noriginal HMO law, signed by a Republican President in the early 1970's \nwas enacted because of the new, revolutionary form of health insurance \nstill in its infancy in Washington state. I want to be clear, health \nmaintenance organizations are not the enemy. One of my colleagues \nyesterday made a statement that the Democrats saw HMOs as the bad guys. \nHe tried to make a point that some how supporting the Health Security \nAct in 1994 and the Patients' Bill of Rights was contradictory. He was \nwrong. Our intent is to ensure patients the right to receive the care \nthey have paid for, not to eliminate coordinated care.\n\n  The experience in Washington state has taught me that we can have a \nsystem that reduces overutilization and unnecessary care while actually \nimproving health care benefits. I know that good managed care structure \nhas increased our immunization rates. I know that it has contributed to \nthe fact that almost 70 percent of women in Washington state over the \nage of 55\n\n[[Page S8595]]\n\nreceive mammagrams. I know that a good managed care structure has \nincreased our average life expectancy and reduced our infant mortality. \nIt has reduced the number of people who smoke and decreased the \nincidence of heart disease. We have a healthier population in \nWashington state, in part because we have the benefits of a coordinated \ncare delivery system that focuses on prevention and reduces wasteful, \nunnecessary health care services.\n  Unfortunately, things are changing in Washington. Due to mergers and \nacquisitions we now have health care plans being run by companies in \nCalifornia and other states. We now have for-profit insurance companies \nusing HMOs and more importantly, we have premiums from HMO participants \ngoing to enhance short term profits. Our once envied system has \ndeteriorated. I am hearing more and more from patients and physicians \nabout the obstacles they must over-come to access health care. They \nmust push hard to get wise health care decisions, not just big economic \nbenefits.\n  I honestly believe that if we fail to restore some kind of balance, \nmanaged care will become a thing of the past. People will demand \nchanges and will dismantle managed care. We will then be back to a \nsystem where only the very wealthy have regular and consistent access \nto quality health care and where you only see your doctor when you are \nill, not to prevent illness.\n  I had hoped that a uniformed standard set of protections for patients \nwould restore some trust to managed care. That is the only way we can \nensure that the ``outrage of the day'' does not become the guiding \nforce in state legislatures. If my colleagues think that by killing our \nbalanced and fair Patients' Bill of Rights it will end this debate, \nthink again. You can be sure that in the next session of the \nlegislature in each state there will be new patient protection bills \nranging from access to expanded, mandated benefits. Patients will \ndemand this.\n  Ultimately, these single ``outrage of the day'' bills will be the \nnail in the coffin for managed, coordinated care. We will see the end \nof a health care delivery system that encourages prevention and keeps \npeople healthier, longer. We will see a return to a system where access \nis only provided to the ill.\n  Not only does this jeopardize health insurance, it jeopardizes \nbiomedical research and development. Why invest in research that \nprevents illness or prevents hospital stays or detects cancer sooner, \nwhen no one will have access to it? Why double NIH research dollars, to \nprevent illness and to find cures for deadly diseases like cancer and \nMS, if patients are not encouraged to seek care to prevent illness or \nto seek regular, prevention and early detection care? Doesn't it seem \nto be a contradiction to encourage biomedical research when we do not \nhave a health care delivery system that invests in wellness?\n\n  Our Patients' Bill of Rights will not result in pushing people off of \ninsurance. Our bill is a reasonable, cost effective proposal that does \nenhance managed care, not diminish it. It rewards those insurance \ncompanies that do offer a good package and a good product. They will no \nlonger have to compete with companies that do not look at their \nbeneficiaries as people, but rather premiums. There are good insurance \ncompanies out there. I know this to be true as there are several in \nWashington state. While I have heard of some problems in the state, I \nbelieve it is a combination of consumer misinformation and distrust. \nBut, unfortunately these good companies have to compete in a very price \nsensitive market with companies that have policies in place to limit \nand deny access to quality care.\n  I am also disappointed that most of my Republican colleagues refused \nto engage in an open and honest debate. They offered amendments sold as \naccess to emergency room coverage or improvements in women's health or \naccess to clinical trials, when in fact their underlying bill is \nnothing more than a simple statement only saying we support patients, \nbut not supporting and enforcing access to care. My Republican \ncolleagues say they want these things, and as participants in the \nFederal Employees Health Benefit Plan we have these benefits and \nprotections, but they do not provide them to all insured Americans \nbecause the insurance lobby has told them to say no.\n  This is a short sighted strategy as parents with sick children, \ncancer survivors, patients with MS or Parkinsons, and women denied \naccess to ob/gyn care will ultimately be heard. Wait until they \ndiscover that for $2 more a month they cold have gone to the ER or they \ncould have participated in a new life saving clinical trial at the Fred \nHutchinson Cancer Research Center. They could have gone to see their \nob/gyn when they first found the lump on their breast or their child \ncould have seen a pediatric oncologist following a diagnosis of cancer. \nWhat do my colleagues think will happen when families realize that for \nthe price of a Happy Meal each month they could have saved their child? \nThere will be outrage and it will be heard all the way to Washington, \nDC.\n  I hope that this issue is not dead. I hope some how this is not the \nend of the debate and that like so many other issues we will be able to \nput aside partisan differences and work towards real patient \nprotections.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are coming to the close of a vital \ndebate, and I do not use that word casually. The issues we are voting \non in some cases have life and death consequences for the people we \nwere elected to represent.\n  The individual rights spelled out in our Patients' Bill of Rights are \nclear, and they are specific. They are strong, and they would work. \nThey have been painstakingly drafted and redrafted and then further \nrefined for more than a year.\n  They have the support of hundreds of medical and consumer \norganizations whose millions of members work directly in this field. \nThey would achieve for patients the very rights that our constituents \nhave repeatedly signaled that they want and need and deserve in this \nage of managed health care.\n  We have offered the Patients' Bill of Rights, point by point, reform \nby reform. In response, senators on the Republican side of the aisle \nhave cobbled together weak or illusory copies of these reforms, offered \nthem in place of the real thing, and hoped that nobody outside this \nChamber would notice the differences.\n  We have seen this happen with access to emergency case, with a \nwoman's access to an OB/GYN and with a patient's access to specialists.\n  This flurry of amendments, mixing genuine rights for patients and the \nphantom versions from the other side, has obscurred some of these \nissues in a cloud of political dust. Tonight, with the final votes of \nthis debate, that cloud will be lifted. Senators will decide whether \nthey will stand with patients and their doctors, or with the insurance \ncompanies.\n  Senators will decide whether 161 million Americans can enjoy the \nprotections of the Patients' Bill of Rights, or whether 113 million \nAmericans will be left in the waiting room.\n  There are many key differences between the Patients' Bill of Rights \nand the fall-back plan that Republican leaders have come up with. But \nthe most important differences are that our bill would cover everyone, \nour bill lets doctors make the medical decisions, and our plan holds \nplans accountable to take away incentives to minimize critical health \ncare decisions that can hurt or kill people.\n  Just this morning, we have heard the Republicans attempt to justify \nwhy it is okay to protect HMO's from accountability for their decisions \nthat lead to injury or death. Polls show that the public overwhelmingly \nsupports the key elements of our Patients' Bill of Rights. Americans--\nthe people that Democrats and Republicans alike say we are trying to \nprotect--want the protections the Democratic plan offers.\n  I have heard from many Vermonters on their experiences with managed \ncare. Each of these moving stories makes you ask: What if it was me, or \nsomeone I knew?\n  When I was home in Vermont last week, I picked up the Burlington Free \nPress and, beside a guest column he had written, was met with the \nfriendly face of an old friend, Dr. Charles Houston. He and I go way \nback to my days as a prosecutor in Burlington when he was a prominent \nphysician doing remarkable things in the Vermont medical community. He \nhas been a beacon of good advice to me throughout my time in the \nSenate. He is an indispensable Vermonter.\n  Dr. Houston's commentary depicted the devastating and tragic \nexperience\n\n[[Page S8596]]\n\nhe and his wife had with their managed care company that ultimately led \nto his wife's death.\n  My wife is a registered nurse, so I get a dose of the practical \nreality of these problems across the breakfast table, as well as from \nthe accounts I get from Vermonters. It is these personal accounts, like \nthis one from Charlie, that bring home the need for a Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  Mr. President, I will ask unanimous consent that Dr. Charles \nHouston's article be entered into the Record.\n  Mr. President, the question today is this: Will the Senate pass a \nbill that protects everyone--161 million Americans who get their health \ncare through a managed care program--or just a fraction of those \nfamilies, the 48 million who are in employer self-funded plans? Will we \ncontinue to hear and read stories from the people in our states who \nhave no protections? Will we continue to hear accounts like the tragic \none of Charlie Houston's wife? I hope not.\n  The President has indicated that he would veto a so-called Patients' \nBill of Rights if all we send him is one containing the weak Republican \nprovisions.\n  Maybe then we can rescue those millions of Americans the Senate today \nhas stranded in the waiting room without a real patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe article to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Burlington Free Press, July 2, 1999]\n\n                 Managed Care Needs Immediate Overhaul\n\n                      (By Dr. Charles S. Houston)\n\n       Can anything worthwhile be added to the billions of words \n     written and spoken about health care? Why is our medical care \n     today both better and worse than in the past? What happened?\n       Here's one story.\n       An 84-year-old nurse led an active life despite mild \n     chronic lung disease, but after a long plane trip developed \n     pneumonia. Finally admitted to the hospital, she was treated \n     aggressively by an ever-changing group of specialists and \n     nurses and went home after two weeks--but with diarrhea \n     either from antibiotics or a hospital infection.\n       She was weak and undernourished but her doctors could not \n     visit her at home, insisting she return to the hospital. When \n     she refused, they tried to direct her care by phone. She \n     drafted downhill and died two weeks later, a victim of \n     efforts to reshape medicine by managed care in recent years.\n       First, traditional care was scrapped and most doctors \n     forced to join systems and to abandon fee-for-service \n     medicine. We are told this was done because: 1. care was \n     getting too expensive; 2. too many people could not get care; \n     and 3. technology had become so complex.\n       Managed care, we were told, would decrease the cost, \n     eliminate waste, open the system to the needy, and provide \n     highly technical care through specialists. In the capitalist \n     mode, competition would cure all.\n       The goal became to provide the best possible care to \n     everyone. Who could quarrel with this? Yet a moment's thought \n     shows this was and will always be impossible: There aren't \n     enough providers and other resources. But you don't need a \n     Cadillac to go shopping; any car will do. Instead our goal \n     should be to make appropriate care easily available to all \n     who need and seek it. The treatment should match the problem, \n     the cost must be affordable.\n       So what has managed care done? 1. The costs of care have \n     skyrocketed even faster; and 2. specialization has led to \n     fragmentation and medical care by committee. What little \n     fraud had existed was replaced by the waste-filled octopus to \n     non-medical insurance administrators who can--and do--\n     overrule caregivers in major medical decisions. Doctors must \n     climb walls of paperwork, distancing them from patients. It \n     has become harder to reach or talk to your physician. \n     Administrators and stockholders in the managed care \n     organizations fatten on profits. Now many HMOs are failing or \n     increasing rates prohibitively.\n       Two other dominating forces must be mentioned. Medical \n     knowledge has expanded far more rapidly than has \n     understanding of how to use it appropriately. More and more \n     specialists with exotic devices do miracles, So, in part to \n     protect the patient, in part for self-protection, physicians \n     often feel compelled to consult experts, and some are \n     reluctant to take leadership in care of an individual. \n     Fragmentation became a worse danger than concentration of \n     responsibility.\n       There's no virtue in crying wolf, and screaming catastrophe \n     without offering a way of escape. Having been a practitioner \n     for many years, alone and in groups, and a teacher in our \n     medical school, I have watched and studied the destruction of \n     traditional care with dismay. I'm confident that many \n     patients and doctors feel as I do. Something must be done, \n     and soon. Managed care as we know it must go. Though over-\n     simplified, the following would be a strong start:\n       End or modify commercialization of health care. By \n     regulation make hospitals, medical groups and insurers non-\n     profit and monitor compliance.\n       Continue the lead role of a primary care provider as first \n     call and facilitate appropriate consultation and resources.\n       Require insurers to open enrollment for all, allowing them \n     a fair return on investment.\n       Since each state has different needs, develop statewide \n     insurance plans to provide appropriate health care to all its \n     citizens. Several years ago the Governor's Health Commission \n     prepared such a plan but it failed. Why? Lobbyists? Economic \n     fears? This plan deserves careful look.\n       Finally, a sad personal note. The patient described above \n     was my wife of 58 years. She was truly a victim of the new \n     medicine.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I strongly support the Patients' Bill of \nRights which Democrats have offered and fought for during these four \ndays of consideration and which the Republican majority has weakened at \nevery turn. I cannot support the inadequate substitute which \nRepublicans have now put before us. The Republican bill is full of \nloopholes in the fundamental protections for patients which we seek to \nprovide. In fact, the substitute Republican bill provides almost no \nprotections for nearly two-thirds of Americans with health insurance.\n  The Democratic bill would guarantee access to needed specialists. The \nRepublican bill fails to guarantee patients access to needed \nspecialists outside the HMO at no extra charge. The Democratic bill \nwould assure access to the closest emergency room. The Republican does \nnot guarantee access without financial penalty and prior authorization. \nThe Democratic bill gives women the right to choose their OB/GYN as \ntheir primary doctor, as many women wish to do and protects women from \n``drive-through mastectomies''. The Republican version is not adequate. \nAnd unlike the Democratic bill, the Republicans fail to hold HMOs \naccountable when their decisions and practices lead to the death or \ninjury of patients. And, the Republicans would continue to allow \ninsurance company officials to override the medical decisions of a \npatient's own doctors.\n  Mr. President, in short, the Republican substitute for the Democratic \nbill is a mere shadow which does not deserve the title, ``Patients' \nBill of Rights''.\n  The core of the Democratic effort has been to ensure that insurance \nadministrators not overrule a health care professional's medical \ndecisions, that HMOs can be held accountable for their actions which is \na responsibility every other industry has to its consumers, and to \nensure that all insured are protected. The Republicans have developed a \nbill that leaves more than 113 million Americans with insurance \nunprotected because most of the provisions in their bill for the most \npart are narrowly applied to only one type of insurance, self-funded \nemployer plans, which cover only 48 million of the 161 million people \nwith private insurance.\n  Our bill ensures that the special needs of children are met, \nincluding access to pediatric specialists. It provides important \nprotections specific to women in managed care such as direct access to \nob/gyn care and services and the ability to designate an ob/gyn as a \nprimary care provider, and provides specific protections regarding \nhospital length-of-stay for mastectomy, by allowing the physician and \npatient to make decisions the length of stay in a hospital following a \nmastectomy or lumpectomy. The Republican bill does not prevent ``drive-\nthrough mastectomies.'' Additionally, our bill speaks to the issue of \nspecialty care. Patients with special health conditions must have \naccess to providers who have the expertise to treat their problems. Our \namendment allows for referrals for enrollees to go out of the plan's \nnetwork for specialty care, at no extra cost to the enrollee, if there \nis no appropriate provider available in the network. There are about 30 \nmillion Americans who have had trouble seeing specialists with their \nHMO plans. This includes women and children with special needs who \neither had critical care delayed or, worse, had that care denied. On \nthe issue of emergency services, the Democratic amendment says that \nindividuals must have access to emergency care, without prior \nauthorization, in any situation that a ``prudent lay person'' would \nregard as an emergency.\n\n[[Page S8597]]\n\n  Survey after survey reveals that the American people support these \nproposed protections. And, there are over 200 patient groups and health \ncare provider organizations, workers' unions, and employee groups, that \nstand behind the need for these patient protections. That list includes \nthe American Medical Association, American Heart Association, American \nNurses Association, American Public Health Associations, Center for \nWomen Policy Studies and the Child Welfare League of America. We have a \nstark choice before us, a strong Patients' Bill of Rights that protects \npatients or a weak bill aimed at protecting insurance companies.\n  Earlier this week, Mr. Steve Geeter, husband and father of two young \nchildren of Grass Lake, Michigan, stopped by to visit with my office. \nMr. Geeter has terminal brain cancer and will be participating in an \nexperimental clinical trial at the National Institutes of Health over \nthe next several months. Mr. Geeter and his wife spent a considerable \namount of time with my staff discussing his options and limitations \nunder his HMO plan and the need for reforms, including access to \nclinical trials. I very much appreciate Mr. Geeter taking the time to \nshare his HMO experiences with my office. They substantiate the need \nfor the legislation before us. Several months ago, Mr. Geeter's HMO \nplan required that he be released from the hospital after 24 hours of \nintensive care following brain surgery. The plan's justification was \nthat Mr. Geeter had passed the neurological exams and transfer to a \nroom would cost too much. Mr. Geeter subsequently developed \ncomplications and had to be returned to the hospital emergency room. \nThis may have been averted with just an additional 1-day hospital stay-\nover. The Democratic amendment would have protected patients, such as \nMr. Geeter, from an insurance company official requiring that they be \ndischarged from the hospital prematurely. Plans would no longer be able \nto deny promised benefits based on an interpretation of medical \nnecessity defined by insurance companies rather than the patient's \nhealth care provider. The Democratic amendment used a professional \nstandard of medical necessity--based on case law and standards \nhistorically used by insurance companies.\n  Mr. Geeter also expressed strong support for the Democratic amendment \non access to clinical trials of experimental treatments, which offer \npatients access to cutting-edge technology and are the primary means of \ntesting new therapies for deadly diseases. Historically, insurance \nplans have paid the patient care costs for clinical trials, not the \ncosts of the experimental therapy itself. However, research \ninstitutions, particularly cancer centers, increasingly are finding \nthat trials, which once were paid for by health insurance, must be \ncurtailed because of lack of payment by managed care plans. Clinical \ntrials may be the only treatment option available for patients who, \nlike Mr. Geeter, have failed to respond to conventional therapies. \nUnder the amendment, trials are limited to those approved and funded \nthe National institutes of Health {NIH ; a cooperative group or center \nof the NIH; or, certain trials through the Department of Defense or the \nVeterans Administration. The Republican bill provides no hope for \npatients with no options other than a promising experimental treatment \ndown the road. A study is not enough for a patient with a life-\nthreatening disease when there are no other treatment options and there \nis nowhere else to turn.\n  In addition to having the benefit of the input of Mr. Geeter, I've \ncommunicated with others in my state. Over the past several months, I \nhave traveled around Michigan and met with constituents various \ncommunities to get their thoughts on our efforts here in the Senate. I \nhave had discussions with physicians, hospital administrators, nurses, \nseniors, city and county government representatives and health care \nadvocates.\n\n  Ms. Myrna Holland, a resident of Ferndale, Michigan and Director of \nNursing Education at Providence Hospital expressed concern that patient \nchoice is limited when HMOs engage in restrictive practices such as \n``doctor-only'' policies. These professionals include, but are not \nlimited to, certified nurse anesthetists, nurse practitioners physical \ntherapists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors. This is \nparticularly important for patients living in rural areas. Many rural \ncommunities have a difficult time recruiting physicians, and often non-\nphysician providers are the only source of health care in the local \narea. If a managed care plan covers a particular service, but there is \nno one in the community to provide it, rural patients are too often \nforced to drive long distances, incurring expense, to get the care they \nneed. The Democratic amendment would have prohibited HMOs from \narbitrarily refusing to allow health care professionals to participate \nin their plans by virtue of their licensure or certification. The \nRepublican bill would allow HMOs to continue restrictive practices, \nleaving consumers with an inadequate choice of health care providers or \nlimited access to health care.\n  Robert Casalou, Acting Administration of Providence Hospital in \nMichigan, raised concerns about continuity of care. The Democratic \namendment assured continuity of care. When health plans terminate \nproviders without cause or when employers switch health plans for their \nemployees, quality of care for patients currently undergoing treatment \ncan be severely threatened.. For example, a patient who is undergoing a \ncourse of chemotherapy should not have to change physicians abruptly in \nthe middle of treatment, and a woman who is pregnant should not have to \nchange doctors before she gives birth. The Democratic amendment allowed \nfor a transition to lessen those problems. When a doctor no longer is \nincluded as a provider under a plan, or an employee changes plans, our \namendment provided for at least 90 days of transitional care for any \npatients undergoing an active course of treatment with that doctor. The \namendment also provided special protections for pregnancy, terminal \nillness, and institutionalization.\n  Additionally, Mr. Casalou, and others, expressed support for holding \nHMOs accountable for their actions. Today, 123 million Americans who \nreceive insurance coverage through a private employer cannot seek \nredress for injuries caused by their insurer. All they can claim is the \ncost of the benefit denied or delayed. Even if an HMO has been directly \ninvolved in dictating, denying or delaying care for a patient, it can \nuse a loophole in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) \nto avoid any responsibility for the consequences of its actions. ERISA \nwas designed to protect employees from losing pension benefits due to \nfraud, mismanagement and employer bankruptcies during the 1960s, but \nthe law has had the effect of allowing an HMO to deny or delay care \nwith no effective remedy for patients. The Democratic amendment would \nhave closed this loophole, ensuring that HMOs can be held accountable \nfor their actions. It did not establish a right to sue. It simply says \nFederal law will no longer block what the States deem to be appropriate \nremedies for patients and families who are harmed. The only time an \nemployer can be held responsible is when the employer is involved \ndirectly in a specific case and makes a decision that leads to injury \nor death.\n  Donald Anderson, who I spoke with in Detroit, is a quadriplegic who \nis in a wheelchair who changed jobs and also changed health care \nproviders. Donald's new provider would not cover a rolling commode \nwheelchair for him after the wheel broke on the wheelchair he owned, \neven though his doctor classified the chair as a medical necessity. Our \namendment would have allowed the physician, not the insurance company, \nto decide what prescriptions and equipment are medically necessary. The \namendment provided that a plan may not arbitrarily interfere with or \nalter the decision of the treating physician regarding the manner or \nparticular services if the services are medically necessary. Under the \nDemocratic amendment, Donald would have received a rolling commode.\n  In Grand Rapids, I spoke with another constituent of mine, Dr. \nWillard Stawski, a general surgeon. Dr. Stawski told me about a patient \nof his who did not seek care for her hernia because she was told by her \nHMO that it was an unnecessary operation. Dr. Stawski told me that \nafter his patient elected not to have the operation, she became very \nill. Gangrene set in and she died several months later. Under\n\n[[Page S8598]]\n\nthe Democratic amendment, this tragedy might have been averted. What a \ndoctor deems to be medically necessary, is the medical treatment that \nthe patient receives. Thus, Dr. Stawski's patient would have had the \nsurgery because Dr. Stawski said that the surgery was medically \nnecessary.\n  All we were asking for with this amendment is that patients be able \nto receive the care that a doctor or other medical professionals deems \nto be medically necessary. Doctors are frustrated, patients are \nfrustrated. The Republican majority defeated our efforts to adopt these \ngood amendments.\n  Mr. President, while I cannot support the Republican susbstiutute \nbill, I hope we will have a later opportunity to pass a strong bill of \nrights. The public wants a strong one and they are right.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, for those Americans who have been harmed by \nthe decisions of managed care plans, this public debate is long \noverdue. For those who yet face a decision about their health care made \nby their managed care plan, the end to the wait cannot come soon \nenough.\n  The Democrats' Patients' Bill of Rights will ensure those who depend \non managed care plans for their health care will not be receiving a \nlesser standard of care than those who do not.\n  Last week while I was in Nevada, people voiced concerns about who \nreally makes their medical care decisions if they are in a managed care \nplan. They wanted to know what would happen, under the Democrats' \nPatients' Bill of Rights, when a patient is told by his or her \nphysician they need a specific treatment, and the physician informs the \npatient that the plan must first approve or disapprove his decision.\n  Would their physician be able to decide what treatments would be \nappropriate for their medical condition? Or, would they be at the mercy \nof a managed care plan bureaucrat far removed from the situation who \nwould decide ``yea or nay'' on treatment determined necessary by their \nphysician?\n  We can all empathize with the stress involved in this situation--your \ndoctor has determined what your medical condition requires for \nappropriate care, but you must wait to see if what you need is approved \nby the plan. If the answer is ``no'', then you must either forego the \ncare, or pay for it out-of-pocket --not a very good choice.\n  And what if you found yourself in the situation of a Nevada man, \ncovered by an HMO plan, who came into an emergency room suffering from \nan upper gastrointestinal bleed. The emergency room physician called \nfor a gastroenterologist to perform an emergency procedure to halt the \nbleeding. But the gastroenterologist would not treat this man without a \nprior authorization from the HMO plan. If he did the procedure without \nthe authorization, he would not be paid. The doctor tried to contact \nthe HMO for an hour to get the necessary authorization. During this \ntime, the emergency room had to give the patient four units of blood, \nwhich would not otherwise have been required if the procedure had been \ndone in a timely manner. Finally when it appeared the patient might not \nsurvive, the doctor contacted the HMO plan and said if he did not get \nauthorization for the procedure, he would go to the media about this \npatient. The HMO then authorized the procedure.\n  The Democrats' ``medical necessity'' amendment would prohibit all \nmanaged care plans from arbitrarily interfering with a doctor's \ndecision that the needed health care be provided in a particular \nsetting, or is medically necessary and appropriate.\n  The amendment's definition uses a professional standard of ``medical \nnecessity''. This is reasonable for both the patient and his or her \ntreating physician, and the particular managed care plan. If a decision \non whether or not to cover a particular treatment is made pursuant to a \nprofessional standard, it will be based on standards and case law \ninterpretations historically used by insurance companies.\n  If a managed care plan can use its own definition of ``medical \nnecessity'', any external review of a plan's treatment decisions would \nbe resolved using that definition. This very likely would not work to \nthe benefit of the patient.\n  The Democrats' approach would also maintain the important \nrelationship between a doctor and the patient. It is a relationship \nthat of necessity must be based on complete communication and trust \nbetween the two.\n  The Democrats' proposal will also ensure patients have a right to an \nexternal appeal from the decisions made by their managed care plans. \nOne of the key provisions of this amendment is its requirement the \nappeal process be timely--for both internal and external appeals. It \nalso requires ``expedited'' reviews when a patient is facing a medical \nemergency.\n  The Republican bill provides patients no guarantee of an expedited \nreview for medical emergencies. Additionally, a managed care plan could \nsimply delay sending the information needed for an appeal of one of its \ndecisions. There is no deadline requirement for a plan to respond to a \ndecision made by a reviewer. Without a timeliness requirement, patients \nare at the mercy of when, if ever, a plan wants to deal with an \nappealed case.\n  The Republican bill would drastically limit the application of its \nproposed patient protections to only one type of health care \ninsurance--the self-funded employer plans. Those types of managed care \nplans provide the medical insurance for many Nevadans who work in the \ngaming industry. Those employees should have protections. But, why \nshould 113 million people with private insurance be left unprotected? \nThat is what the Republican bill would do, and it is wrong. For those \nsmall businesses which provide health insurance for their employees, \nalmost all must depend upon the private insurance market for their \ncoverage. Why should small businesses' employees have less protection \nthan those workers in larger businesses which can afford to self-\ninsure? Why should Americans who have to purchase their health \ninsurance themselves, because they do not have an employer's \nassistance, be left unprotected?\n  The Republican bill will only cover 48 million Americans. The \nDemocrats' bill will cover 161 million Americans--both those covered by \nself-insured employers, and those covered by private insurance. Why \nshould 113 million Americans be without protection? Should we protect \nonly 48 million, or protect 161 million? It is an easy decision.\n  Women should be able to designate their OB/GYN as their primary \nphysician, and to have direct access to OB/GYN services without first \nhaving to obtain a specialist referral. Women also should make a \ndecision with their physicians about the length of their hospital stay \nwhen they have a mastectomy. I have long supported these efforts to \nlevel the field of health care services for women. The Democrats' \nPatients' Bill of Rights will ensure those protections.\n  For individuals who are chronically ill, or have medical problems \nrequiring access to speciality care, the Patients' Bill of Rights will \nrequire plans to provide access to specialists. If plans do not have an \nappropriate specialist within their plans, then the patient will be \nallowed to go outside the plan network, at no additional cost. The \nDemocrats' Patients' Bill of Rights will ensure this access.\n  Every American should be assured the quality of their health care and \ntheir access to health care options is not diminished, because they \nrely upon an HMO for their health care coverage.\n  All of the 161 million Americans throughout this country who receive \ntheir health care through managed care plans deserve the protections \nincluded in the Democrats' Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  The opportunity is before us to ensure those protections. But that \nopportunity is going to be lost today. And that is a tragedy for \neveryone who depends on managed health care.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I have been proud to join with Senators \nChafee, Graham, and other colleagues to express our shared \ndissatisfaction with the Senate's progress in reaching agreement on a \nstrong patients' bill of rights, and to prepare a balanced, \nthoughtfully-crafted alternative that we believe would protect the \nrights of health consumers and could attract the support of a \nbipartisan majority of the Senate.\n  Listening to the deeply partisan discussions we have heard on the \nfloor this week, I am reminded of the movie ``As Good As It Gets,'' \nwhich has become a cultural touchstone of sorts for venting the popular \nhostility toward HMOs.\n\n[[Page S8599]]\n\n  It is not any particular scene I am thinking of, but the title \nitself. I am moved to wonder if this debate, which seems to be \noperating on political autopilot and showing no signs of producing \nanything other than a Presidential veto, is as good as we get in the \nU.S. Senate, and as good it gets for the American people, who don't \nknow a second degree amendment from a first degree amendment, but who \ndo know that our managed care system badly needs a transfusion of basic \nfairness and accountability.\n  We are here today to say that we can and should do better for \nAmerica's families, that despite the apparent legislative logjam it is \nstill possible to pass a constructive reform proposal, and that we are \neager to offer a plan that Senators Chafee, Graham, and many of us have \nbeen fine-tuning over the last few days which fits that bill.\n  While Sherlock Holmes had the 7% solution, we are offering a 70% \nsolution.\n  Our bipartisan alternative includes roughly 70 percent of the patient \nprotections that most Members already agree on, and strikes some \nbalanced compromises on the remaining issues that continue to divide \nus.\n  The liability provisions in our bill are an example of our success in \nfinding a sensible middle ground.\n  This case, the managed care case, reminds me why we have tort law; \nwhy we have negligence law; why we have a system of civil justice. \nThere has been this odd result that ERISA has given total immunity to \nmanaged care plans who are today making life and death decisions about \nour lives.\n  The question is, how do we respond to that, how do we reform it? I \nthink, with all respect that the Democratic bill goes too far.\n  It opens up the system to the unlimited right to sue and creates the \nsame prospect for the lotteries that have been going on elsewhere in \nthe tort system. I am concerned that those ills will be repeated here--\nsome will get rich and others, many others, will not be adequately \ncompensated for the injuries they suffer as the result of the managed \ncare plan decisions.\n  And some small businesses and individual people will be priced out of \nhealth insurance by the costs that will be added as a result of runaway \njudgements.\n  I think the Republican plan, on the other hand, is not real reform \nbecause it essentially allows a patient, who is harmed by a negligent \ndecision of a managed care plan, to be denied any significant \ncompensation for their injury.\n  Under the Republican plan, patients have to traverse an elaborate \nseries of procedural hurdles to be eligible for compensatory damages. \nFirst, the patient has to fight their way through the appeals process. \nThen the independent appeals body must grant a decision in favor of the \npatient. Finally, if the plan doesn't accept and deliver that \ntreatment, then, under the Republican bill, the only right the \naggrieved health care consumer has, is to go to court for the value of \nthat lost treatment, plus $100 a day.\n  The amendment on liability which Senator Gregg offered went far \nbeyond striking the liability provisions from the Democratic bill and \nwould deny efforts to adequately compensate patients injured because of \nmanaged care plan decisions.\n  That's just not enough.\n  I think we've struck a reasonable compromise in our bipartisan bill. \nYou're entitled to sue for economic loss which includes not only the \ncost of your health care, but lost wages, replacement services, and the \nvalue of lost wages and replacement services for the rest of your life \nbased on the injury you've suffered.\n  And it allows for pain and suffering up to $250,000 or three times \neconomic loss whichever is greater. It has pain and suffering but with \na limit on it.\n  Another good example of our success in finding a sensible middle \nground comes in the form of our plan's consumer information section, on \nwhich I have worked. Both the Democratic and Republican bills provide \nbeneficiaries with information about coverage, cost sharing, out-of-\nnetwork care, formularies, grievance and appeals procedures. One area \nof sharp difference is health plan performance. The Republican bill \ndoes not include any requirement that the performance of the plan, its \ndoctors, and hospitals in preventing illness and saving lives be \nreported.\n  Our bipartisan alternative requires provider performance report cards \nbecause we believe this is critical information for consumers to have \nin deciding which managed care plan to choose. We also reached back to \nan earlier bipartisan bill I sponsored with Senator Jeffords to include \nwaivers and other language to ease the difficulty of administration for \nHMOs, PPOs, and providers.\n  The bottom line here is that patients rights don't have to lead to \npolitical fights. There is a path to dependable consumer protections \nthat does not require detours to bash HMOs or our colleagues. We have \npled with our leadership to give us the opportunity to offer our \nalternative as an amendment today and prove our case.\n  If not, I am prepared, and I believe our coalition is as well, to \noffer this proposal as an amendment to another legislative vehicle in \nthe Senate this session. The American people deserve more from this \ncritically important debate than high-glossed veto bait. We must show \nthem that we take their concerns and our responsibilities seriously, \nand pass a law that will in fact improve the quality of health care for \nmillions of American families.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this week the Senate is finally \naddressing an issue that is vitally important to the American people--\nmanaged health care reform.\n  The number of Americans who receive health care through managed care \norganizations continues to increase at a rapid rate. Today, \napproximately 75 percent of those with employer-provided health \ninsurance are covered by managed care plans.\n  Although managed care was put forth as promoting both greater \nefficiency and higher quality health care, all too often the lure of \ngreater profits has resulted in curtailing care to patients dependent \non managed plans for their medical needs. The American people are \nrightly demanding more patient protections, and it is clearly time for \nCongress to act to guarantee all Americans certain fundamental rights \nregarding their health care coverage.\n  The Democrats in both the House and Senate have worked hard to \nconvince the Republican Majority of the need to establish safeguards \nfor patients in managed care. For a long time the Majority chose to \nignore the patients' plight and refused to acknowledge the need for any \npatient protections at all. Last Congress we proposed a comprehensive \nset of reforms designed to ensure that patients receive the care they \nhave been promised and have paid for. I am proud to be an original co-\nsponsor of this Democratic bill again this Congress.\n  After seeing how the public responded to this Democratic initiative, \nthe Republican Majority did draft a managed care reform bill. But, \nunfortunately their bill calls for only the most minimal reforms; in \nmany respects it is a sham. In addition, until this week, they \npersisted in blocking the issue from being brought up on the floor.\n  However, the Democrats joined together in insisting that the needs of \nmanaged care patients be given careful consideration. After much hard \nwork by the Minority leader and others, an agreement was reached under \nwhich patients' rights legislation could be brought up on the Senate \nfloor this week.\n  The debate which has taken place highlights the difference between \nthe Democratic and the Republican approaches to this issue. The \nDemocrats seek to provide comprehensive coverage and protections; the \nRepublicans are minimalist in both respects. Let us look at some of the \ndifferences: the Democrats' bill would protect all 161 million \nAmericans with private insurance; the Republican proposal ignores the \nover 113 million people who work for other than the large self-insured \nemployers, or State or local governments, or who buy their own \ninsurance.\n  Our bill would guarantee basic patient protections to all consumers \nof private health insurance. The Republican proposal would cover only \nthe employees of businesses that assume the risk of self-insuring their \nemployees. Thus, the Republican bill leaves out more than 70 percent of \nthe consumers of private health insurance.\n  The Democrats' bill provides patients with access to specialists, \nwhereas the\n\n[[Page S8600]]\n\nRepublican bill is woefully inadequate in this regard. For those who \nare seriously or chronically ill, receiving treatment from a qualified \nmedical specialist can mean the difference between life and death. Our \nPatients' Bill of Rights would guarantee that patients with special \nconditions could go to providers with the expertise needed to treat \ntheir particular problems, even if the needed specialist was not a \nmember of a plan's provider network. Under the Republican bill, \npatients are not guaranteed access to the specialists they need and \ncould be charged exorbitant fees for going to an out-of-network \nprovider--even if the plan may be at fault for not having access to \nappropriate specialists.\n  The Democratic bill would prevent HMOs from arbitrarily interfering \nwith doctors' treatment decisions whereas the Republican bill does not \naddress this issue at all. The Republicans claim that our provision \nwould allow doctors to order unnecessary care, but that is not the \ncase. Under our bill, an insurer could still challenge a doctor's \nrecommendation, but their denial of coverage would have to be based on \nmedical facts not on their bottom line.\n  The Democratic bill would restore patients' ability to trust that \ntheir health care provider's advice is driven solely by health \nconcerns, not cost concerns. It would prohibit the coercive practices \nused by managed care companies to restrict which treatment options \ndoctors may discuss with their patients. The Republican bill would \nallow HMOs to continue terminating health care providers for having \nfrank and candid doctor-patient communications and would allow HMOs to \ncontinue using incentives to bias a doctor's medical decision-making.\n  Managed care companies regularly refuse to pay for emergency room \nservices without prior authorization. This unreasonable requirement has \ncaused countless tragedies as people are forced to waste critical time \nfinding an emergency room their HMO will pay for.\n  One of my constituents recently experienced this shocking treatment \nfrom an HMO. While hiking in the Shenandoah Mountains, she fell off a \n40-foot cliff. She sustained fractures to her arms, pelvis, and skull \nbut was quickly airlifted to a hospital in Virginia. Her HMO refused to \npay the over $10,000 in hospital bills because she failed to gain \n``pre-authorization'' for her emergency room visit. For over a year, \nshe challenged her HMO and faced personal bankruptcy. Ultimately, the \nMaryland Insurance Administration ordered the insurer to pay the \nhospital and fined them for refusing to pay from the outset. However, \nher struggles with the HMO were not yet over. Within a year, after \nfollow-up surgery for her injuries, she found herself again in need of \nan emergency room. This time she called the HMO beforehand, but was \ntold they would pay only for her screening fees because the visit was \nnot considered a medical emergency.\n  The Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights would guarantee that patients \ncould go to the nearest emergency room during a medical emergency \nwithout having to call their health plan for permission first. Patients \nwould have the right to receive the medical care they need without the \nlimitations currently imposed by HMOs. The Republicans, on the other \nhand, would not guarantee patients access to the nearest emergency room \nand would not ensure that patients could receive full medical care \nwithout prior authorization.\n  Our bill would also provide patients with meaningful recourse if they \nare harmed by a managed care plan's medical decision-making. Today, \nthere is nothing to discourage HMOs from denying critically necessary \ncare. Thus, our bill creates a fair, independent, and timely appeals \nprocess through which patients could challenge a plan's denial of care. \nUnder the Republican bill, HMOs could delay the appeals process \nindefinitely and many HMO decisions could not be appealed at all. \nFurthermore, where the Republican bill is silent, our bill would enable \nthose harmed by the medical-decision making of HMOs to hold those HMOs \nlegally accountable for second-guessing the advice of a treating \nphysician. The Republican plan would continue to shield HMOs from \naccountability for conduct that results in injury or death to patients.\n  The American people need a meaningful Patients' Bill of Rights. That \nis why I strongly support the Democratic proposal put forward by \nSenator Daschle.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, in a few short moments we will be proceeding \nto our final votes of our four day debate on the Republican and \nDemocratic versions of the Patients' Bill of Rights. I am taking the \nfloor this evening to explain why I oppose both these proposals and to \nexpress my support, again, for the bipartisan approach to managed care \nreform that I sponsored with my colleagues John Chafee, Bob Graham, Joe \nLieberman, Arlen Specter, Max Baucus and Chuck Robb.\n  One of the most difficult obstacles to meaningful health care reform \nis that there is an inherent tension between our two most important \nobjectives.\n  The first objective is to ensure the highest possible quality care. \nRegardless of our vantage point on the political spectrum, we can all \nagree that the United States offers the best quality health care in the \nworld. Men, women and children flock here from every corner of the \nglobe to gain access to our physicians and our hospitals. Maintaining \nthis high standard of care must be at the forefront of any attempt to \nreform the means by which Americans pay for their health care.\n  Seemingly at odds with the objective of highest quality care is the \nneed to make sure that health care is affordable. The ability to cure \ndisease or heal the injured is rendered almost meaningless if only a \nfraction of the population can afford it.\n  Spiraling health care costs have a negative impact upon society in a \nvariety of ways--some obvious and some not so obvious. I well remember \nthe situation in Indiana when I took over as Governor. In the midst of \nour worst recession since the 1930s, our Medicaid costs were increasing \nby 20% per year, an increase that mirrored substantial annual hikes in \nthe private market.\n  One clear result was that workers around the state were losing \ninsurance as business after business found themselves unable to pay for \neven basic health coverage.\n  But for both the state government and for those businesses that \nmaintained health insurance, the spiraling increases crowded out \nfunding for many other significant initiatives and investments. On the \nstate level, paying increased Medicaid bills meant less for education, \ntransportation and child care. For private businesses the choices were \nequally stark--pay increased insurance costs and in so doing postpone \nexpanding the workforce, offering pay increases, investing in research \nor modernizing factories and offices.\n  In 1989, we began to make some very tough decisions in Indiana to \nbring the Medicaid budget under control; private businesses similarly \nbegan to turn to managed care. For the past ten years, those changes \nhave helped to keep health care costs under control and have resulted \nin continuing insurance coverage without having to choose between \noffering health insurance or creating new jobs, or maintaining Medicaid \nor education funding.\n  But today, there is ample evidence--acknowledged by Democrats and \nRepublicans alike--that the pendulum may have swung too far towards \nkeeping costs down, and as a result, we are jeopardizing the quality of \nhealth care that Americans receive.\n  In trying to redress this imbalance, there are a few lessons that we \nlearned in Indiana that were useful principles for me to keep in mind \nas this debate progressed.\n  First, and perhaps most importantly, any significant reform had to be \nmarket-based. Any attempt to have the government control the health \ncare system would be doomed to failure.\n  The Chafee-Graham bi-partisan bill that I have supported since taking \noffice is market based; it sets some basic ground rules but leaves that \nactual management of health care to the experts in the private sector--\nthe patients, the doctors and the insurers.\n  Unfortunately, the Republican plan takes the concept of market-based \nreform to its illogical extreme. That plan falls far short of \nestablishing even the most basic protections for people in managed \ncare. Most egregiously, the Nickles-Lott bill would only cover a \nfraction--less than 30%--of the people who have private insurance. We \nhave all accepted the idea that there ought to be some minimum \nprotections and\n\n[[Page S8601]]\n\nguarantees offered to those in managed care to prevent the abuses that \nwe have witnessed over the past few years. But if all sides have \naccepted that principle, it seems very unfair that the majority would \nchoose to leave nearly 120 million people out of the protections we all \nbelieve are necessary.\n  I strongly support the elements of the Democratic approach that \nadvance these principles--access to specialists, proper emergency care, \naccess to obstetrician/gynecologists, independent reviews of denial of \ncare--but the bipartisan bill wisely avoids the one element of the \nDemocratic Patients' Bill of Rights that I believe will drive health \ncare costs up: expanded liability.\n  If health care costs do not remain under control, there are serious \nramifications for both the national economy and for the American \ntaxpayer.\n  The United States already pays more--expressed as a percentage of \nGDP--for health care than any other industrialized nation. A rise in \nthese costs will have an appreciable negative impact upon our economic \nstrength in an increasingly competitive global environment. With \npressure from a unified Europe and resurgent Asia, the last thing this \nCongress ought to do is to help spur a dramatic rise in health care \ncosts for a liability provision that is unlikely to make any American \nhealthier.\n  And the American taxpayer is at risk if health care costs spiral out \nof control because it is the taxpayer who will foot the bill if \nhundreds of thousands of people are suddenly forced into the Medicaid \nsystem if they lose their health benefits. We simply, as a nation, \ncannot afford a return to the days when health care costs increased by \ndouble digits every year.\n  The bipartisan bill does allow some tightly controlled access to the \nFederal courts for suits that seek restitution for economic loss. It \nseems to me that before we expose health care plans and employers to \nunlimited liability and to punitive damages, we must at least try this \nlimited, moderate approach.\n  Mr. President today we will face a test of whether Washington can \nstill work. The American people will be watching to see if their \ncynicism and apathy towards the political process in general and \nWashington, in particular, will be deepened or whether we can put \npartisanship aside and restore their confidence in our ability to \ngovern for the benefit of the nation.\n  Some in this chamber truly do not want to have any legislation that \nreforms the way in which HMOs operate; some do not want to have any \nlegislation so that they can have an issue for the 2000 elections.\n  Neither approach serves the American people very well and that is why \nI support the bi-partisan bill as the only possibility to actually get \nsomething done. The Democratic proposal will not pass the Senate; the \nRepublican proposal will be vetoed by the President and that veto will \nnot be overridden. Compromise is the only possibility before us for \nsuccess in this area.\n  The bipartisan bill strikes the right balance between additional \npatient protections and maintaining control of increasing health care \ncosts. In the final analysis, we have a choice to make: do we choose to \njust give more speeches that won't help anyone, or do we try to get \nsomething done? Are we going to insist upon everything that we want, or \nwill we put aside our partisan differences to get some of what the \nAmerican people want?\n  It is my hope, even if that vote doesn't occur today, that the \nmembers of this Senate will pass the test by finally putting aside the \nrancor and bitterness of the past four days, to put aside the desire to \nscore debating points off each other, and to rally around this \ncentrist, responsible bi-partisan bill that will give the American \npeople the key components of HMO reform that they need and deserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I commend my colleagues from Rhode Island and Florida for their \nefforts to try to craft a bipartisan compromise.\n  We succeeded in putting together legislation that I believe would \nhave led us to a bill that could become a law.\n  As Senator Chafee indicated, we are in a situation where a bill that \nis supported by an overwhelming majority of all of the health-related \norganizations--doctors, nurses, patients, and providers--is not going \nto enjoy enough votes on this floor to pass.\n  The bill that will pass is going to be vetoed by the President.\n  I hope we can find a way to crawl out of our fox holes and find the \ncommon ground that is necessary if we are going to address in a \nresponsible way the issues and the concerns we have been talking about \nfor this entire week. I commend the leadership for sticking to their \nagreement and giving everyone an opportunity to be heard. I regret \nthere was no sense of compromise on the floor. It is important we do \nthat. I hope we continue with that mission. I appreciate those who have \nworked hard to achieve that compromise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Ms. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I, too, compliment our colleagues from \nRhode Island and from Florida. We have had a train wreck in terms of \nthe health care proposals we tried to present this week in the Senate.\n  For the past few days in the Senate we have had a lot of colorful \ncharts and graphs. We have seen a lot of ads on TV paid for by special \ninterest groups. There has been a lot of partisan maneuvering. What we \nhaven't had, what the American people haven't seen, is a sensible, \nmoderate debate on this critical issue of health care.\n  Tonight, I am very proud to join my colleagues in trying to provide \nemergency relief, to find the middle ground in this debate with the \nproposal that should be acceptable to the majority of the people, the \nMembers of the Senate, and without a doubt is in the best interests of \nthe American people.\n  This issue is of great importance to the American public and they are \nwaiting to see if Washington--and more importantly, if the Senate--will \nbe able to do their job. And that is to present a plausible response to \nthe reforms that are needed in this Nation's health care program.\n  I applaud my colleagues.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Florida.\n  It has been a spirited debate. We must acknowledge there have been \nimpressive displays of party unity on both sides, but to what end? The \nend of the sound and fury is we will produce a bill we know the \nPresident will veto, and therefore there will be nothing done to help \nthe American people with the problems they have with health care.\n  It didn't have to be that way. There was a third way. There was a \nthird way that would have recognized and expressed something else the \ndebate has concealed: The fact that across party lines we agree on \nabout 70 percent of the topics we talked about. It was the aim of our \nbipartisan group to put that majority round of agreements on the bill. \nUnfortunately, we didn't have an opportunity to have it heard by our \ncolleagues in this debate.\n  We will be back. We are going to submit our proposals and there will \nbe another day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will consume such time as remains on our \nside.\n  There are a series of winners and losers as we conclude this debate. \nThe first winner is the status quo. We all know the result of the \neffort of the last 4 days will be nothing. We will be in exactly the \nsame position as we were before we started.\n  The losers are all those American families who have genuine concerns \nabout the way in which they are being treated--the arbitrariness, the \ninadequacy of services under their current health maintenance \norganization plan.\n  The winner is cynicism. The American people will again question \nwhether their political institutions are capable of responding to \nserious public issues. The loser will be the opportunity we had to \nbring together in the best spirit of the Senate a bipartisan plan, an \nAmerican plan that would have dealt with an American problem.\n\n[[Page S8602]]\n\n  The Miami Herald editorialized yesterday that what the American \npeople want is Senate action, not a showoff dictated by political \nconsultants.\n  Unfortunately, that is what they have received.\n  We will continue the effort to fashion a reasonable bipartisan plan \nthat will deal with the legitimate concerns, first of all, of the \nAmerican people--not a small percentage of the American people. We will \ndo so in a way that will be sensitive to the cost of health care but \nalso sensitive of the fact that people should get what they contract \nfor from their health maintenance organizations and will provide an \nenforcement mechanism that is meaningful.\n  This is not the last chapter in this debate. I anticipate that \nshortly we are going to have the rubble of a collapsed bill under the \nweight of a Presidential veto.\n  I urge my colleagues to use the time between now and then to think \nseriously about whether that is the last record we want to write on \nthis important national issue. I do not think it is what we want. We \ndon't want an issue. We want a result that will help American families.\n\n  The day to achieve that result is, unfortunately, not today, but it \nwill come. Hopefully, it will come soon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrat leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield 8 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the Chair would be good enough to let \nme know when 5 minutes remain.\n  Mr. President, a little over 2 years ago, a number of Members were \nworking with those involved in the health care field, those that have \nbeen injured because of actions taken by HMOs, and those doctors and \nnurses who believe that we could do better.\n  Tonight we are at a point in the development of a policy where we \nhave seen a setback in terms of protecting patients. We have seen a \nsetback in giving patients and their doctors the opportunity to make \nmedical judgments, rather than having their medical judgments \noverridden by the economic judgments made by gatekeepers, accountants \nor insurance company officials. We have received a setback, but I, for \none, am not discouraged. I believe that as a result of the last 4 days \nof debate not only do we have a better understanding about what is \nimportant, but I think the American people have a much better \nunderstanding.\n  I think the actions we can expect from the House of Representatives \nas we begin their debate and discussions starts at an entirely \ndifferent level. I am very hopeful we will get a strong bill out of the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  I am absolutely convinced, as I stand here, that we will have the \nopportunity to resolve this issue in favor of the concept underlying \nthe Democratic bill, a concept which as been supported by doctors, \nnurses, by children's advocates, women's advocates, and advocates for \nthe disabled: that when doctors and patients make a medical judgment, \npatients will get the type of health care they have actually paid for \nand not be prevented from getting the best health care.\n  I am absolutely convinced that is a concept that will be accepted. It \nwas not accepted during this debate. Others will have a different \njudgment on it. I believe that is inevitable. We have seen other \nbattles where we have seen the inevitability come to pass. I am \nconvinced of it.\n  I, for one, think this has been an enormously constructive and \nproductive debate these last 4 days. Quite frankly, as one who has been \nfortunate enough to be involved in this debate, rarely have I seen--at \nleast on our side--so much involvement by the Members, and their \nparticipation, their knowledge, their awareness and the wealth of \nexperience that was brought to illuminate so many of these issues. I \nthink that has to be to the benefit of the American people.\n  I am not discouraged. I regret that we were not successful, but we \nwill continue this battle and we will be successful.\n  In conclusion, I do thank the majority leader and thank the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, for they have responsibilities as leaders of this \ninstitution. I thank them for the way in which this debate has been \ndeveloped and the structures for the discussion that have been afforded \nto us over the past days.\n  I thank in particular our leader, the Democratic leader, Senator \nDaschle. I thank Senator Daschle on behalf of those of us who feel \nstrongly about this issue--it is not just, I know, those of us on this \nside. I am sure those on the other side also feel strongly but have \ncome to different conclusions than those we came to about this issue. \nWe would not have had the debate this week if it had not been for Tom \nDaschle of South Dakota. There are no ifs, ands or buts. This has been, \nI think, an extraordinary service to this institution, and I think it \nhas been an extraordinary service to the patients and the medical \nprofessionals in this country.\n  I thank my colleague and friend, Senator Reid, who was so much a part \nof the leadership, and of such help and assistance during this time.\n  I thank the members of our committee. I serve on a number of \ncommittees and have been proud to serve on all of them. But my heart is \nwith the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. All of our \nmembers were extremely active. Senator Dodd; Senator Harkin; Senator \nMikulski, who has been so involved in health care issues; Senator \nBingaman; Senator Wellstone; Senator Murray; Senator Reed--every one of \nthese Senators has been so engaged and involved in this issue.\n  I pay tribute to our chairman, Senator Jeffords, for his courtesies, \nand Dr. Frist, for his strong dedication to trying to find ways--which \nwe were unable to on this measure. But I have respect and affection for \nthe members.\n  I also thank so many others who were not on the committee who were so \ninvolved and engaged, particularly those on our side, although there \nwere others on the other side.\n  I also wish to thank the many staff people who have worked on this \nissue this week and for the past two years. From my staff, David Nexon, \nmy long time chief health advisor, Cybele Bjorklund, my deputy health \nadvisor, who worked so ably on this legislation, Michael Myers, my \nstaff director, for his leadership on this legislation, Will Keyser, \nJim Manley, Connie Garner, Melody Barnes, Carrie Coberly, Matt \nFerraguto, Jacqueline Gran, Jon Press, Ellen Gadbois, Stacey Sachs, \nTheresa Wizemann, Webster Crowley, Andrew Ellner, Paul Frey, Arlan \nFuller, Sharon Merkin, Dan Munoz, Malini Patel, and Kate Rooney.\n  From Senator Daschle's staff, Bill Corr, Laura Petrou, Ranit \nSchmelzer, Mark Patterson, Jane Loewenson, and Elizabeth Hargraves; the \nstaff of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department \nof Labor; the staff of the Democratic Policy Committee; and the staffs \nof so many other Senators that have played a critical role during this \ndebate.\n  I think, as always, their involvement and their support has been \ninvaluable, permitting us to have a level of discussion which I think \nwas worthy of this institution.\n  Finally, I want to say on this issue, as all of us would understand \nin our responsibilities, that we will be back. We may have a setback \ntonight, but I, for one, do not believe this is a setback in this \nissue. We will be back to fight, and fight, and fight again, and I \nbelieve ultimately to prevail.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will vote against the Republican \nalternative to the Patients' Bill of Rights. All week long, I have \nsupported amendments that would have strengthened the Republican bill \nand would have provided all privately insured Americans with meaningful \npatient protections. At each step along the way, the Democratic \namendments were rejected.\n  There are major deficiencies in the Republican bill. The bill that \nwill be passed by the majority covers only 48 million Americans who \nreceive their coverage through self-funded plans. What about the 113 \nmillion that their bill leaves out? Don't those 113 million people \ndeserve protections too? I believe that all 160 million Americans with \nprivate insurance deserve basic protections.\n  Another important weakness in the Republican plan, Mr. President, is \nthat it does not provide patients the opportunity to hold their health \nplans responsible under state law. If a health plan's decisions lead to \nthe injury or death of a patient, the plan should not be shielded from \naccountability.\n\n[[Page S8603]]\n\n  I regret that the Senate narrowly rejected the Robb amendment, which \nI cosponsored. This amendment would have provided women with important \naccess to their obstetrician/gynecologist (ob/gyn). The Republican bill \ndoes not allow a woman to designate her ob/gyn as her primary care \nprovider.\n  Another major distinction between the bills is who makes medical \ndecisions. Will it be the doctor or the insurance company? \nUnfortunately, the Republicans rejected our definition of medical \nnecessity. Under our bill, plans could not deny benefits based on the \ninsurance companies' definition of medical necessity instead of the \ndoctors' definition.\n  The Democratic version of managed care reform includes access to \nclinical trials for patients with life-threatening or serious \nillnesses. The Republican bill provides access to clinical trials only \nfor those suffering from cancer. In addition, their provision applies \nsolely to 48 million Americans. Their bill leaves too many seriously \nill Americans without the hope that experimental therapies through \nclinical trials provide.\n  I regret that the Senate has squandered this opportunity to enact a \ntrue Patients' Bill of Rights and provide important protections to all \nprivately insured Americans. I feel I must vote against this bill that \nputs health plans' profits ahead of patients' well-being. I hope that \nwe can revisit this issue one day and pass legislation that provides \nstrong patient protections.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts \nfor his statement, as well as Senator Reid. It has been a pleasure to \nwork with both. This has been a very productive and fruitful debate. As \na result, we ended up with a very good bill.\n  I am going to call on several members of our task force who helped \nput this bill together and worked very hard, not just for a week, not \njust for this week but, frankly, for the last year and a half. We had \ncountless meetings and a lot of people, a lot of staff, put in a lot of \neffort. This was an effort that we felt very strongly about because we \nwanted to improve the quality of health care without increasing costs \nand increasing the number of uninsured, and I think we have done it.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express my \nstrong support for the Republican Patient's Bill of Rights Plus Act. As \nprivate health coverage has shifted toward coordinated care, many \nconsumers are concerned that their health plan focuses more on cost \nthan on quality. Many consumers fear that they might be denied the \nhealth care they need. To respond to these concerns, both parties have \ndeveloped patient protection legislation.\n  Our colleagues Senators Daschle and Kennedy have offered a proposal \nwhich I believe takes the wrong direction. Their bill tries to impose a \none-size-fits-all solution in a manner which would override many of the \nreforms our states have decided--or, equally important, decided not \nto--enact. Their proposal includes liability provisions which will \ndramatically increase premiums and further expand the medical \nmalpractice industry in this country. In fact, their bill should be \ncalled the ``Lawyers' Right to Bill'' not the Patients' Bill of Rights \nand the tragedy of their lawsuit saturated approach is that it would \nmake health insurance unaffordable to 1.8 million Americans--including \n30,000 Kentuckians.\n  I am pleased to say that we have crafted a better proposal for \nprotecting America's families which is embodied in the Patient's Bill \nof Rights Plus Act. The Patient's Bill of Rights Plus Act provides \nneeded protections for Americans in a way which won't increase the \nnumber of uninsured Americans by driving up health care costs.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act guarantees access to emergency \ncare. It requires plans to pay for emergency medical screening and \nstabilization under a ``prudent layperson'' standard. If we pass this \nlegislation, we will never again have to hear heart-wrenching stories \nabout families with desperately ill children who bypass the nearest \nhospital in order to make it to a hospital which is in their plan's \nnetwork. Under our plan, if you have what a normal person would \nconsider an emergency, you can go to the nearest hospital, period.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act would provide direct access to \npediatricians and OB/GYN's. This common-sense provision would allow \nparents to take their children directly to one of the plan's \npediatricians without having to get a referral from their family's \nprimary care physician. Similarly our legislation would allow women to \ngo directly to a participating OB/GYN, without having to get a referral \nfrom their primary care physician.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act also bans ``gag clauses''. Gag \nclauses are contractual agreements between a doctor and a managed care \norganization that restrict the doctor's ability to discuss freely with \nthe patient information about the patient's diagnosis, medical care, \nand treatment options. Our legislation would put an end to this \npractice. I believe a doctor should be able to discuss treatment \nalternatives with a patient and provide the patient with their best \nmedical advice, regardless of whether or not those treatment options \nare covered by the health plan.\n  The Patient's Bill of Rights Plus Act also provides strong, \nindependent external appeals procedures to ensure that patients receive \nthe care they need. Many Americans are concerned that their health plan \ncan deny them care. If a plan denies a treatment on the basis that it \nis experimental or not medically necessary, a patient can appeal that \ndecision. The reviewer must be an independent, medical expert with \nexpertise in the diagnosis and treatment of the condition under review. \nIn routine reviews, the independent reviewer must make a decision \nwithin 30 days, but in urgent cases, they must do so in 72 hours. As \nopposed to the Kennedy plan which mandates a broad, one-size-fits-all \ndefinition of medical necessity, our plan allows those decisions to be \nmade on a case by case basis by an independent external medical doctor. \nUnlike the Kennedy bill which encourages lawsuits, the Patient's Bill \nof Rights Plus Act focuses instead on giving patients the care they \nneed. After all, when you're sick, don't you really need an appointment \nwith your doctor, not your lawyer?\n  The most troubling aspect of Senator Kennedy's legislation is that it \nwill further swell the numbers of uninsured Americans.\n  The Kennedy plan drives up health care costs and makes health \ninsurance unaffordable for more Americans. According to the very \nconservative estimates of the Congressional Budget Office, the Kennedy \nPatients Bill of Rights would increase insurance premiums 6.1 percent \n(Source: Congressional Budget Office Report on S.6, 4/23/99). This \nmeans that 1.8 million Americans would likely lose their health \ninsurance.\n  In Kentucky, 30,095 people would likely lose their health insurance.\n  In California, 271,927 people would likely lose their health \ninsurance.\n  In New York, 118,091 people would likely lose their health insurance.\n  In Minnesota, 36,315 people would likely lose their health insurance.\n  Even if the Kennedy bill does not pass, it is expected that health \ninsurance premiums will rise an average of seven percent next year \n(Source: Towers Perrins 1999 Health Care Cost Survey 1/99). At a time \nwhen premiums are rising well above the rate of inflation, do we really \nwant to pass legislation which raise premiums even more? The answer is \nclearly no.\n  Our Patients' Bill of Rights' Plus Act takes a better approach to the \nproblem of the uninsured. While avoiding provisions which will \ndrastically raise premiums, it includes important tax provisions to \nmake insurance more affordable. Earlier this week we passed the Nickles \nAmendment which will allow self-employed individuals to deduct 100% of \nthe cost of their health insurance. This is particularly important to \nthe 124,000 of Kentucky's farmers, ministers, stay-at-home moms, and \nyoung entrepreneurs who are self-employed. According to a study by the \nEmployee Benefits Research Initiative, nearly \\1/2\\ (43.6 percent) of \nall workers in the agriculture, forestry, and fishing sectors have no \nhealth insurance. By allowing the self-insured to fully deduct the \ncosts of health insurance, we are taking an important step in reducing \nthe numbers of uninsured.\n\n[[Page S8604]]\n\n  There are certainly significant differences between our two bills. \nHowever, no single issue distinguishes the two more than the question \nof liability. I believe we can and should find bi-partisan agreement on \nthe important issues of providing emergency care, ensuring direct \naccess to pediatricians and OB/GYN's, banning gag orders, deductibility \nof health insurance for the self-employed, and a whole myriad of issues \nexcept for one thing: The Kennedy bill insists on new powers to sue. \nLeafing with abandon through the yellow pages under the word \n``attorney'' is not what most Americans would call health care reform.\n  Simply put, I believe that when you are sick, you need a doctor, not \na lawyer. I am opposed to increasing litigation because it will drive \nup premiums, drive 1.8 million Americans out of the health insurance \nmarket, prevent millions more uninsured from being able to purchase \ninsurance, and aggravate an already seriously flawed medical \nmalpractice system.\n  If 1.8 million Americans lose their health insurance, 189,000 fewer \nwomen will have access to mamograms and 238,000 fewer women will have \naccess to pelvic exams. I have a question for the supporters of Sen. \nKennedy's bill. What kind of reform makes preventative services less \navailable? What kind of reform is that?\n  As if driving 1.8 million Americans out of the health insurance \nmarket wasn't reason enough to oppose the Kennedy bill, I am also \nstrongly opposed to expanding liability because it will exacerbate the \nproblems in our already flawed medical malpractice system. Typically \nthese lawsuits drag on for an average of 33 months. Even if at the end \nof this 33 months, only 43 cents of every dollar spent on medical \nliability actually reaches the victims of malpractice (Source: RAND \nCorporation, 1985). Most of the rest of the judgement goes to the \nlawyers. That's right, over half of the injured person's damages are \ngrabbed by the lawyers. Why would anyone want to expand this flawed \nsystem which is so heavily skewed in favor of the trial lawyers?\n  The Washington Post said last March that ``the threat of litigation \nis the wrong way to enforce the rational decision making that everyone \nclaims to have as a goal'' (Source: Washington Post 3/16/99). More \nrecently the Post said that the Senate should enact an external appeals \nprocess ``before subjecting an even greater share of medical practice \nto the vagaries of litigation'' (Source: Washington Post 7/13/99). The \nLos Angeles Times Editorial page called expanding liability to health \nplans ``bad medicine for both employees and employers'' and stated that \n``The key to fixing ERISA is not in radical measures like more \nlawsuits. . .'' (Source: Los Angeles Times 2/29/98)\n  Mr, President, I have always felt that this debate is about improving \nprivate health insurance in America. That the debate was about \nproviding better care, for more Americans not less.\n  We can and we should guarantee access to emergency services.\n  We can and we should ensure direct access to pediatricians.\n  We can and we should ban gag clauses.\n  We can and we should provide an independent external appeals process.\n  We can and we should provide full deductibility for the self-\nemployed.\n  By voting for the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act, we will have \ntaken all of these important steps and more. However, what we must not \ndo is take action which will deprive 1.8 million Americans of health \ninsurance. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote for this common-\nsense health care reform.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to address a point of some \ncontention on the floor over the past two days. Two days ago, I twice \nquoted from Dr. Robert Yelverton, Chairman of the Primary Care \nCommittee of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. \nThe precise quotes were as follows: First, ``The vast majority of OB/\nGYNs in this country have opted to remain as specialists rather than \nact as primary care physicians,'' and second, ``None of us could really \nqualify as primary care physicians under most of the plans, and most \nOB/GYN's would have to go back to school for a year or more to do so.''\n  These quotes, which were taken from the New York Times, on June 13, \n1999, were entirely accurate as reported by the Times. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record the New York Times article.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 13, 1999]\n\n        Beyond the Horror Stories, Good News About Managed Care\n\n                          By Larry Katzenstein\n\n       Most health plans these days are some form of managed care. \n     And for most families, it is the mother who decide which one \n     to use.\n       ``Women visit doctors more than men, and in a family \n     situation, they may be the ones who have primary \n     responsibility for taking children to the doctor,'' said \n     Elizabeth McGlynn, the director of the Center for Research on \n     Quality in Health Care at the Rand Corporation in Santa \n     Monica, Calif.\n       Wendy Schoales, a homemaker in Everett, Wash., offered \n     another reason: ``We're more picky.''\n       Mrs. Schoales's husband works or the Boeing Company, which, \n     like many large employers, offers several health-plan \n     options. Several years ago, when she switched her family from \n     traditional fee-for-service care to managed care to cut \n     expenses, an important motivation was her being able to \n     continue to use the obstetrician and gynecologist who had \n     delivered her first child, Ashlyn. ``When you find a doctor \n     you like, you want to stick with him, especially when it \n     comes to an ob-gyn,'' she said.\n       Two years ago, Mrs. Schoales's second child, Gavin, was \n     born under managed care but with the same obstetrician and \n     gynecologist. The care was just as good as it had been with \n     Ashlyn, she said, and the cost was significantly lower. \n     ``They charged us just one copayment for the whole maternity \n     experience,'' she said.\n       For the same reasons, Katherine Davidge of Newton, Mass., \n     also fared well under managed care during the births of her \n     two children. Her experience in getting her managed-care plan \n     to cover treatment for depression, on the other hand, was an \n     exercise in exasperation.\n       Ms. Davidge's plan subcontracts mental-health services to \n     another company, a common practice in managed care. ``I'd \n     call this company and ask, `Is Dr. X covered?' '' she said, \n     ``And they'd say no. And then the same thing would happen for \n     Dr. Y and Dr. Z. So, then I asked for a list of practitioners \n     I could see, and it was really bizarre because they just \n     wouldn't give us the list. They said they typically don't \n     give it out.''\n       After several months of phone calls and letters, Mr. \n     Davidge said, she received a list. ``It was so small that it \n     was almost impossible for me to find somebody that I knew \n     anything about,'' she said. ``So I gave up.''\n       Managed care would seem tailor-made for women. It provides \n     a coordinated system of care that makes preventive services \n     readily available--and women use preventive measures at twice \n     the rate men do. Health-maintenance organizations and other \n     managed-care plans remind members to come in for checkups. \n     With a primary-care doctor to facilitate matters, plans are \n     supposed to help route patients to  the most appropriate \n     specialist for their ailments--and all this for a more \n     affordable premium and limited out-of-pocket expenses.\n       ``One reason women's preventive services have always been \n     such a leading issue in managed care is that two of the tests \n     it emphasizes, Pap smears and mammograms, provide the best \n     evidence that preventive testing saves lives,'' said Dr. \n     Karen Scott Collins, an assistant vice president of The \n     Commonwealth Fund, a philanthropic foundation in New York \n     City that supports research on health and social policy.\n       Yet it is the darker side of managed care that has received \n     Most of the attention in recent years--the follies and \n     tragedies caused by restricted choice of physicians, barriers \n     to needed care, delays in service, limitations on care and a \n     zeal for cost-cutting.\n       Women, especially, could be excused for thinking that \n     managed care is bad for their health, because some of the \n     most highly publicized outrages attributed to health-\n     management organizations, or H.M.O.'s, and other managed-care \n     plans have involved women's issues: drive-by mastectomies, \n     drive-by deliveries, coverage denied for what were regarded \n     as promising breast-cancer treatments and refusal to let \n     obstetricians and gynecologists be primary-care physicians.\n       The abuses attributed to managed care have caused a \n     backlash in the form of legislation to make it more \n     accountable, particularly to women. This includes the \n     Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act of 1996, which \n     requires a minimum hospital stay of 48 hours after a normal \n     vaginal birth and 96 hours after a Caesarean section, unless \n     the mother and physician agree to an earlier discharge. Laws \n     in many states mandate that women in managed care be given \n     direct access to an obstetrician and gynecologist without a \n     referral from their primary-care physician, and a Patients' \n     Bill of rights Act pending in Congress would make choosing an \n     obstetrician and gynecologist for primary care the law of the \n     land.\n       Despite the mixed reviews that managed care gets from \n     patients and physicians, findings from a 1998 Commonwealth \n     Fund survey, announced last month, suggest that women in \n     managed-care plans fare better in some important ways than \n     those who receive traditional medical care.\n       ``The joke about managed care is that it doesn't manage and \n     it doesn't care,'' said\n\n[[Page S8605]]\n\n     Humphrey Taylor, the chairman of Louis Harris & Associates of \n     New York City, which conducted the survey. ``But the findings \n     from this survey suggest that managed care is serving women \n     at least as well as fee-for-service medicine, and certainly \n     better than some of the managed-care horror stories would \n     suggest.''\n       The survey, conducted by telephone, involved 1,140 women \n     with managed care and 351 women with traditional fee-for-\n     service care, all of them younger than 65. Among the key \n     findings were:\n       Women with managed care were more likely to identify a \n     particular doctor as their regular source of care (87 percent \n     of them did so versus 78 percent of those with traditional \n     care).\n       Women with managed care were more likely to say that their \n     health plan sends them reminders for preventive care (27 \n     percent versus 18 percent).\n       Women with managed care were more likely to have seen an \n     obstetrician and gynecologist as their primary care physician \n     (66 percent versus 61 percent).\n       Women with managed care were more likely to have received a \n     Pap smear in the last three years (74 percent versus 67 \n     percent).\n       Among women 50 and older, those with managed care were more \n     likely to have received colon-cancer screening (29 percent \n     versus 20 percent) and to have talked with their doctor about \n     hormone-replacement therapy (56 percent versus 50 percent).\n       One in five women under both types of coverage reported \n     problems in gaining access to health care, like obtaining an \n     expensive prescription or seeing a specialist.\n       But the survey has not made believers of many physicians \n     who specialize in women's health. ``As a gynecologist, my \n     biggest problem with managed care is the severe \n     restrictions that have been placed on my ability to make \n     independent decisions on how to treat disorders that might \n     require surgery,'' said Dr. Robert Yelverton of Tampa, \n     Fla., who estimated that 80 percent of his patients have \n     managed care.\n       Dr. Yelverton said that one managed-care company requires a \n     woman who is bleeding heavily from excessive menstrual flow \n     and has excessive pain with her periods to be confirmed \n     anemic and to be on iron supplements for three months without \n     improvement before being allowed to have a hysterectomy.\n       That requirement ``is based on the premise that too many \n     hysterectomies are done,'' said Dr. Yelverton, who said he \n     believes that most obstetricians and gynecologists would \n     first try hormonal treatment rather than surgery for such \n     problems. ``But when that doesn't work, we have patients who \n     are miserable,'' he said.\n       Dr. Yelverton, the chairman of the American College of \n     Obstetricians and Gynecologists' primary care committee, said \n     that one of the most highly publicized improvements is \n     managed care, allowing a woman to see an obstetrician and \n     gynecologist as her primary-care provider, ``hasn't worked \n     out.''\n       ``The vast majority of ob-gyns in this country have opted \n     to remain as specialists rather than act as primary-care \n     physicians,'' he said, attributing this to the stringent \n     standards that managed-care plans have set for primary-care \n     providers. ``None of us could really qualify as primary-care \n     physicians under most of the plans,'' he said. ``And most ob-\n     gyns would have to go back to school for a year or so to do \n     so.''\n       Health care experts consider the measures assessed in the \n     Commonwealth Fund survey--having a regular doctor or getting \n     regular Pap smears--to be good indicators of quality of care. \n     But the most crucial measures for evaluating any type of care \n     are the results: diagnosing breast cancer at an early stage, \n     for example. A study published last February in the Journal \n     of the American Medical Association looked at this result and \n     found that in this case, too, managed care had the edge over \n     traditional care.\n       The study involved nearly 22,000 women over age 65 whose \n     breast cancers were diagnosed between 1988 and 1993. \n     Researchers found that women enrolled in Medicare H.M.O.'s \n     were generally more likely than fee-for-service patients to \n     have had their cancers diagnosed at an earlier stage. And \n     among women who underwent breast-conserving surgery, known as \n     lumpectomy, the H.M.O. enrollees were significantly more \n     likely to have received radiation, the medically recommended \n     accompanying treatment.\n       So, where does that leave matters? ``With three-quarters of \n     all insured women now in some type of managed-care plan, the \n     time has come to shift the focus from whether managed care is \n     better or worse than fee-for-service to making sure that \n     women are receiving quality health care in whatever type of \n     managed-care plan they belong to,'' said Dr. Collins, the \n     Commonwealth Fund executive.\n       She and other health-care experts applaud a current \n     voluntary program in which managed-care plans are graded on \n     more than 50 measures, several pertaining to women's health.\n       This set of measures is known as the Health Plan Employer \n     Data and Information Set. It is administered by the National \n     Committee for Quality Assurance, a private, nonprofit \n     organization also involved in accrediting managed-care plans. \n     The committee's most recent compilation of information, known \n     as Quality Compass 1998, includes Health Plan Employer Data \n     scores and consumer-satisfaction data submitted by 447 \n     commercial managed-care health plans that collectively cover \n     60 million Americans.\n       Some managed-care plans do not participate in the program. \n     Others do but do not allow their scores to be publicly \n     reported. But several large employers, including Xerox and \n     General Motors, strongly encourage managed-care plans under \n     contract with them to make their scores public. And some \n     states, including New York, New Jersey and Maryland, require \n     plans to release this information. Working with the \n     committee, the states issue annual managed-care report cards \n     through pamphlets and on their Web sites. The \n     www.health.state.ny.us site has information for New Yorkers.\n       Regarding mammography screening rates, for example, New \n     York residents can learn the names of the seven health \n     plans--CDPHP, CHP/Kaiser, Finger Lakes, Health Care Plan, \n     Healthsource HMO, HMO CNY and Preferred Care--that \n     performed significantly better than the statewide average \n     during 1996 and 1997, and the five health plans--CIGNA \n     Health Care, MVP, Physicians Health Service, Prudential \n     Health Care Plan and United Healthcare-NYC--that performed \n     significantly worse.\n       Some physicians believe that these efforts are having a \n     positive effect. One is Dr. Jeffrey Hankoff, a family \n     physician in Santa Barbara, Calif., who takes care of a large \n     managed-care population and is the medical director of an \n     independent practice association, or I.P.A., a group of about \n     30 physicians who collectively negotiate contracts with \n     managed-care plans.\n       ``One thing managed care has brought to the table is that \n     quality is the major focus and not a token effort,'' Dr. \n     Hankoff said. ``Every time a patient writes a letter of \n     complaint, our I.P.A. has a committee that reviews it. We're \n     really attempting to make sure that people are getting the \n     care they're supposed to be getting. In a managed-care \n     operation, that's monitored all the time because the plans \n     demand it and the Government demands it of the plans. It's \n     something that managed care really hasn't received credit \n     for.''\n       Look at the Stats, Talk to Friends\n       Here are steps that women can take for choosing a high-\n     quality managed-care plan:\n       Ask your employer's benefits department if its plans make \n     their Health Plan Employer Date and Information Set (Hedis) \n     scores public, and ask to see them. ``You should prefer a \n     plan that's willing to show its Hedis numbers,'' said \n     Elizabeth McGlynn of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, \n     Calif.\n       Find out whether a plan is fully accredited by the National \n     Committee for Quality Assurance, and reject plans that have \n     applied for accreditation and failed. Accreditation provides \n     assurance that a plan has a quality-improvement program. \n     Accreditation information for most plans is available on the \n     committee's Web site (www.ncqa.org) or by calling (888) 275-\n     7585.\n       Ask if the plan offers a specific program for women's \n     health, has it own medical director for women's health, or \n     has a network of providers that includes a women's health \n     center. Then try to find out if they're more than gimmicks.\n       ``There are certainly some issues of women's health that \n     have been picked up by managed-care organizations purely for \n     advertising purposes, to attract women,'' said Mark Chassin, \n     chairman of the department of health policy at Mount Sinai \n     School of Medicine in New York City. ``But it has been \n     difficult for women to get customized or gender-based advice \n     about important treatment issues such as heart disease, for \n     example, where women have different risk factors from men and \n     need to be managed differently and to consult with \n     specialists who understand those differences.''\n       Talk to people in the plan. ``Word of mouth is probably \n     underestimated as a good indicator of quality,'' said Donald \n     Berwick, who directs the Institute for Health Care \n     Improvement in Boston.\n       Consider the doctors. ``The most important aspect of \n     quality in managed care is the provider you choose rather \n     than the plan,'' said David Blumenthal, director of the \n     Institute for Health Policy at Massachusetts General Hospital \n     and Partners Health System in Boston. Because doctors belong \n     to an average of eight plans, ``in most communities right \n     now, most managed-care companies include most doctors in that \n     community, so you can get almost any doctor on any plan,'' \n     Dr. Blumenthal noted. ``The quality variations among plans \n     probably mostly reflect the different doctors.''\n       For many people, the worst aspect of managed care is having \n     to stop seeing a doctor who is not in the plan. So before \n     joining a plan, find out if your doctor participates and, if \n     not, what it will cost if you continue seeing that doctor.\n       Ask whether the plan covers prescription drugs. This is \n     especially important for women taking hormone replacement \n     therapy or oral contraceptives.\n        If you have children, ask if the plan provides baby-\n     sitting or has provisions for combining child and adult \n     visits.\n  Mr. FRIST. Unfortunately, before introducing these statements, I \napparently misspoke and said, ``Let me share with Members what one \nperson told me.'' I should have said, ``As Dr. Yelverton was quoted in \nthe New York Times as stating.'' So, I wish to clarify the Record.\n  Dr. Yelverton has taken offense at my use of his quotes. In fact, he \ncontends that I ``misused'' his quotes. At\n\n[[Page S8606]]\n\nthis time, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed a \nletter from Dr. Ralph Hale, with an attached memo from Dr. Yelverton, \ninto the Record, so that his views may be clear.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                           The American College of\n\n\n                              Obstetricians and Gynecologists,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 1999.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: As Executive Vice President of the \n     American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists (ACOG), I \n     feel it necessary to clarify ACOG's position on the Robb/\n     Murray amendment to allow women in managed care plans direct \n     access to ob-gyn care. I've also attached a memo from Dr. \n     Robert Yelverton, Chairman of ACOG's Primary Care Committee, \n     correcting your misuse of his statements in a June 13 New \n     York Times article.\n       ACOG and Dr. Yelverton fully support efforts in Congress, \n     including the Robb/Murray amendment, which would enable ob-\n     gyns to be designated as primary care providers. A recent \n     ACOG/Princeton Survey Research Associates survey found that \n     nearly one-third of all ob-gyns in managed care plans are \n     denied the opportunity to be designated as primary care \n     physicians. Ob-gyns are often the only health care provider \n     many women see throughout their adult lives and are best \n     suited to understand and evaluate the health care needs of \n     their patients. While not all ob-gyns may choose to accept a \n     PCP designation, all ob-gyns should have the opportunity to \n     be designated as a woman's PCP under managed care.\n       We also strongly endorse the Robb/Murray amendment's \n     provision that would require managed care plans to allow \n     women direct access to the full array of covered ob-gyn \n     services provided under the plan.\n       While the amendment failed yesterday on a 48 to 52 vote, we \n     are hopeful the Senate will take up this important issue \n     again. Dr. Yelverton and I urge you to vote in favor of these \n     important policies.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Ralph W. Hale, M.D.,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Tampa Bay Women's Care\n\n                                         Tampa, FL, July 13, 1999.\n     To: Lucia DiVenere, ACOG Government Relations.\n     From: Robert W. Yelverton, M.D., Chairman, Primary Care \n         Committee.\n\n       I received your fax tonight and offer the following in \n     response.\n       I have never spoken directly to Senator Bill Frist (R-TN) \n     or any member of his staff on the subject of OB/GYNs as \n     primary care physicians or on any other subject. The quote \n     that Senator Frist attributed to me on the floor of the \n     Senate today came from an article in the June 13, 1999, \n     edition of the New York Times. The article may be viewed on \n     the New York Times website (go to www.nytimes.com, then click \n     on Health and Science). I was contacted by the article's \n     author, Larry Katzenstein, and asked to comment on the impact \n     of managed care on women's healthcare in this country. In my \n     interview with Mr. Katzenstein, I discussed ``barriers'' that \n     managed care organizations have raised against the efforts of \n     OB/GYNs to become primary care physicians. The quote \n     attributed to me by Senator Frist was from a non-quote in \n     this article. I told Mr. Katzenstein that some managed care \n     organizations have placed barriers consisting of such \n     stringent (not ``high,'' as Senator Frist stated) standards \n     for their qualifications as primary care physicians that most \n     OB/GYNs would not be able to meet them without further \n     training.\n       One objective of my comments was to demonstrate that the \n     College's interests were to allow OB/GYNs to provide women's \n     healthcare to their patients unimpeded by the cumbersome \n     requirements of managed care referral systems. Mr. \n     Katzenstein's article did not emphasize to the degree it \n     should have that these were barriers to OB/GYNs being \n     designated primary care physicians--not ``high standards''--\n     as has been discussed repeatedly in meetings of the Primary \n     Care Committee. I went on to say to Mr. Katzenstein that the \n     qualification requirements that some managed care \n     organizations impose on OB/GYNs in certain instances exceeded \n     even those required of family physicians. He chose not to \n     include that statement in his article.\n       Senator Frist's misuse of my statement in support of his \n     position that OB/GYNs could not act as primary care \n     physicians because of the ``high standards'' that managed \n     care organizations set for primary care physicians, is \n     regrettably misleading, to say the least, and does an \n     injustice to the true intent of my statements.\n       I personally supported then and I support now the amendment \n     sponsored by ACOG to allow OB/GYNs to act as primary care \n     physicians and to allow direct access for women's healthcare \n     and did, in fact, spend a portion of this very afternoon e-\n     mailing my senators and encouraging them to vote in support \n     of the amendment.\n       Please contact me at (813) 269-7752 after 9:00 a.m. \n     tomorrow (Wednesday). I will be glad to discuss this matter \n     with you at that time and will support any effort that you \n     want to undertake to clarify this issue now on the floor of \n     the Senate.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. The gist of Dr. Yelverton's complaint is that he was \ninformed that I used his quotes to oppose an amendment which sought to \nallow OB/GYNs to be treated as primary care physicians. Dr. Yelverton \nsupports allowing OB/GYNs to serve as primary care physicians and he \nsupports ``direct access for women's healthcare.'' My position is that \nwe should not be confusing the issue and saying that OB/GYNs--\nspecialists--are ``primary care physicians'' and thus have the implied \nresponsibility of serving as overall gatekeepers for insurance plans. \nInstead, I believe we should insure that women have direct access to \nOB/GYNs for obstetrical and gynecological care without going through a \ngatekeeper. In that spirit, I used Dr. Yelverton's reported quotes.\n  I continue to believe that our task is to see that women can have \ndirect unimpeded access to OB/GYNs. We will do that, without saying \nthat OB/GYNs must be designated as ``primary care physicians'' who are \nresponsible for treating all aspects of the patient's health needs, \nincluding ear infections and the like. I sincerely believe that direct \naccess to OB/GYNs is the issue, not whether we label OB/GYNs as \n``primary care physicians.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, as debate draws to a close on managed care \nreform, I want to talk about a few of the key provisions that I \nstrongly support in the comprehensive legislation developed by the \nRepublican Health Care Task Force and my colleagues on the Senate \nHealth Committee.\n  All throughout the process of developing responsible managed care \nreform legislation, I have shared the same overall policy goal held by \nmost of my colleagues: to reform the managed care system without \nreducing quality, without increasing cost and without adding to the \nranks of Americans who cannot afford health insurance. These are \nimportant issues for individuals and families.\n  Just as important to them, and to me, is the impact of managed care \non the quality of health care provided to children. That issue, perhaps \nmore than any other, governed how I examined and worked on this very \nimportant legislation.\n  Working with my friend and colleague from Tennessee, Senator Bill \nFrist, I worked to ensure that the bill approved earlier this year by \nthe Senate Health Committee protected the interests of families with \nchildren. The bill approved by the Committee and included in the Task \nForce bill provides for direct access to pediatricians. For any family, \nthis is common sense. Pediatricians are general practitioners for \nchildren. Why should parents have to take their child to a primary care \nphysician in order to be given permission to have the child see a \npediatrician? This ``gatekeeping'' role is just not necessary.\n  That's why Senator Frist and I worked to include language in the \nCommittee-passed bill that lets parents bypass the gatekeeper. Under \nthis bill, parents can take their child straight to the pediatrician. \nThe Task Force bill also includes this language.\n  The larger debate concerns pediatric specialists. My view on this, \nbased, I might add, on considerable personal experience, is that \nchildren are not simply a smaller version of adults. Fortunately, for \nthe most part, children are proportionately healthier than adults. This \nmeans that for the small number of children who suffer from illnesses \nand conditions, they are the exception to the rule. To a parent who \nloves them, however, this is no consolation. Not only is their child \nsuffering, but treatment can also be extremely expensive.\n  Children who suffer from cancer, to take one example, should be able \nto see a pediatric oncologist, not an oncologist who was trained to \ntreat adults. That is why Senator Frist and I worked to include in the \nCommittee-approved bill an amendment that would require the \npractitioner, facility or center to have, and I quote from our \namendment, ``adequate expertise (including age-appropriate expertise) \nthrough appropriate training and experience.'' By requiring age-\nappropriate expertise, we are saying that a child will see a pediatric \nspecialist and an elderly patient will see a geriatric specialist. We \nare ensuring that the most vulnerable people--the youngest and\n\n[[Page S8607]]\n\nthe oldest--within our population are referred to the specialists who \nare trained to treat their particular age group. We have also clarified \nthis language to ensure ``timely'' access to such specialty care.\n  Mr. President, let's not lose sight of our bottom line goal: to \nensure quality health care without compromising access to care. We \nalready have 43 million Americans who are without any health care \ncoverage. Excessive mandates on the quality of care will only drive up \nthe cost of providing care, and could price health care out of the \nrange of affordability. Our legislative efforts must not add to the \nuninsured. Mr. President, employer-provided health insurance is \nstrictly voluntary--employers do not have to offer health insurance to \ntheir employees. So, we are walking a fine line between ensuring that \nour nation's health care quality remains high, while still keeping such \ncare affordable.\n  In my home state of Ohio alone, 1.3 million of 11 million Ohioans are \nuninsured--they have no health care coverage at all. Worse still, in \nOhio we have 305,000 children who have no health insurance coverage. \nWith health care costs estimated to increase by 7-8 percent due to \ninflation alone, it is clear that we should not add to this cost \nincrease.\n  On this score, there is serious cause for concern. A Lewin Group \nstudy found that for every one percent rise in premiums, 300,000 more \npeople become uninsured. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \nestimated that the Daschle-Kennedy Patients' Bill of Rights bill would \nincrease health care premiums by 6.1 percent. That means an additional \n1.8 million Americans would lose health insurance if that particular \nbill becomes law. Based on data provided by the CBO, that bill would \nadd $355 each year to the average worker's health care premium. If that \nis not enough to drive Americans to the ranks of the uninsured, it will \ncertainly add to the cost of living for American families.\n  I support the Task Force legislation, which CBO estimated would raise \npremiums by only 0.8 percent--that's eight-tenths of one percent. This \nlegislation also would provide direct access to pediatricians and \naccess to specialty care. This legislation would provide for an \nindependent external review process for all adverse coverage decisions \nthat are based on a lack of medical necessity or investigational or \nexperimental nature of the treatment. This process will better protect \neveryone, including children and the elderly, because it would ensure \nthat the independent external reviewer assigned to review an adverse \ncoverage determination has expertise (including age-appropriate \nexpertise) in the diagnosis or treatment under review. All of these \npatient protections are included, while still keeping health care \naffordable.\n  I also support this legislation because it would help 317,000 Ohioans \nand close to 9 million other Americans nationwide who are self-\nemployed, but can only currently deduct 45 percent of their health care \ncosts. The self-employed are mainly farmers, family-owned and operated \nbusinesses, and independent business people and entrepreneurs. They \nrepresent the heart and soul of our economy, but the tax code treats \nthese first-class workers like second-class citizens.\n  Mr. President, in the last several years, I have voted for \nlegislation that would move this important tax break to full \ndeductibility, which large corporations already have. By making such \nhealth care costs 100 percent deductible for the self-employed, we have \nthe opportunity to reduce the ranks of the uninsured. We would be \nmaking health insurance more affordable, and more accessible for our \ncountry's self-employed workers and their families.\n  These are just some of the provisions that would improve our managed \ncare system--improvements that would not compromise affordability and \naccessibility. That is why I will vote for the Task Force bill later \ntoday.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this week the United States Senate has \nbeen debating the provisions of two pieces of legislation dealing with \nincreased patient protections for individuals with health plans. The \nbill that I support is called the ``Patients' Bill of Rights Plus \nAct.'' The other bill under consideration is called the ``Patients' \nBill of Rights.'' Though these bill have similar names, they differ \ngreatly in what they will in fact accomplish. After I briefly summarize \nthe major components of these bills, it will be clear that the title of \nthe ``Patients' Bill of Rights'' is a misnomer. It will also be clear \nthat the ``Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act'' is a bill that is truly \nfocused on the American people. Through its major components, this bill \nwill provide consumer protections, enhance health care quality, and \nincrease access to healthcare.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act contains a number of provisions \nthat are key consumer protections. These provisions will greatly \nenhance the health plans of the 48 million Americans who are covered by \nself-funded group health plans governed exclusively by the Employee \nRetirement and Income Security Act (``ERISA'') and will enhance the \nquality of healthcare.\n  First, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act has emergency care \nprotection for consumers. Currently, some plans and managed care \norganizations require prior authorization for emergency department \nservices and/or have denied payment for emergency room services if it \nturns out the patient's situation does not meet the plan or \norganization's definition of an emergency. As a result, a participant \nmay be liable for the entire emergency room bill. This potential large \ncost to the patient, and the uncertainty of coverage, has a significant \nnegative impact on the patient seeking emergency room care, even if \nsuch a visit is reasonable. What a tragedy it would be for a person to \ndie because that person refused to go to the emergency room out of fear \nthat coverage would be denied later?\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus remedies this situation in a cost \neffective manner by requiring self-funded ERISA plans that provide \ncoverage for emergency services to pay for emergency medical screening \nexams using a ``prudent layperson standard.'' The bill also requires \nthese ERISA plans to provide coverage for any additional emergency care \nnecessary to stabilize an emergency condition after a screening exam. \nUnder the prudent layperson standard, an ERISA plan would be required \nto cover emergency medical screenings if a person with an average \nknowledge of health and medicine would expect that the absence of \nimmediate medical attention would result in serious jeopardy to the \nindividual's health. For example, let's say an individual is \nexperiencing chest pain. Though I am not a doctor (my father was), I do \nknow that chest pain could at least be a symptom of indigestion, heart \nburn, or a heart attack. If this individual went to the emergency room \nbecause of these chest pains, the prudent layperson standard would \ncover emergency screening, even if the heart pain turned out to be a \ncase of indigestion.\n  Another problem that I continuously hear people complaining about is \ngatekeepers. Many plans require patients to visit their primary care \nphysicians and obtain a referral before they can visit a specialty \ndoctor. These gatekeeping provisions can, in certain circumstances, \ndrive up the cost of healthcare, and also make it more difficult for \npatients to access appropriate medical care. Moreover, certain \ngatekeeping provisions fail to recognize that women and children have \nunique health care needs. The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act also \nremedies these problems by requiring self-funded ERISA plans to provide \ndirect access to routine obstetric and gynecological (``ob/gyn'') care \nand routine pediatric care without requiring prior authorization.\n  Third, in addition to improving access to emergency care services, \nob/gyns, and pediatricians, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act \nensures access to covered specialty care by requiring ERISA plans to \nprovide patients access to covered speciality care within network, or, \nif necessary, through contractual arrangements with specialists outside \nthe network. While this bill would not prevent a plan from requiring a \nreferral by a patient's primary care physician in order to obtain some \nspecialty services, the bill does require a plan to provide for an \nadequate number of visits to the specialist when the plan requires a \nreferral.\n  Fourth, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act also addresses the \nsituation of when a patient's physician under a\n\n[[Page S8608]]\n\nplan is terminated or is not renewed by the plan. This bill requires an \nERISA plan to continue coverage with a patients' provider, if the \npatient is undergoing a course of treatment that includes institutional \ncare, care for a terminal illness, or care starting from the second \ntrimester of pregnancy. Coverage duration is for up to 90 days for a \npatient who is terminally ill or who is receiving institutional care. \nFor a pregnant woman who is in her second or third trimester, coverage \nis required to be continued through the postpartum period.\n  In addition to providing these key consumer protections to the 48 \nmillion Americans who are covered by self-funded group health plans \ngoverned exclusively by ERISA, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act \ncreates appeals procedures for the 124 million Americans covered by \nboth self-insured and fully-insured group health plans. These appeal \nprovisions are essential protections to ensure that Americans receive \nthe service and coverage they are entitled.\n  Simply put, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act requires an \ninternal and external review process under which consumers can appeal a \nplan's denial of coverage. A plan must complete a consumer's internal \nappeal within 30 working days from the request for an appeal. An \ninternal coverage appeal can also be expedited, meaning the \ndetermination must be made within 72 hours, in accordance with the \nmedical exigencies of the case, after a request is received by the plan \nor issuer. In the event that the plan denies coverage because the \ntreatment was not medically necessary or appropriate or was \nexperimental, the internal review must be conducted by a physician who \nhas appropriate expertise and who was not directly involved in the \ninitial coverage decision.\n  A consumer who is denied coverage and who loses an internal appeal \nstill may have an avenue to pursue coverage through an external appeal. \nAn external review is available when a plan has denied coverage based \non lack of medical necessity and appropriateness and the amount \ninvolved exceeds a significant financial threshold or there is a \nsignificant risk of placing the life or health of the individual in \njeopardy. Once an external review is requested, a plan must select a \nqualified external review entity, in accordance with the medical \nexigencies of the case. The plan must select the entity in an unbiased \nmanner and the entity must be: (1) an independent external review \nentity licensed or credentialed by a State; (2) a State agency \nestablished for the purpose of conducting independent external review; \n(3) an entity under contract with the Federal Government to provide \nindependent external review services; or (4) any other entity meeting \ncriteria established by the Secretary of Labor.\n  The external review entity then selects the independent expert to \nconduct the external review. This independent expert reviewer must have \nappropriate expertise and credentials, must have expertise in the \ndiagnosis or treatment under review, must be of the same specialty as \nthe treating physician when such an expert is reasonably available, and \nmust not have certain affiliations with the case or any of the parties \ninvolved. This expert's job under the external review is to render an \nindependent decision based on valid, relevant, scientific, and clinical \nevidence. This includes information from the treating physician, the \npatient's medical records, expert consensus, and peer-reviewed medical \nliterature to assure that standards of care are reviewed in a manner \nthat takes into account the unique needs of the patient.\n\n  This internal and external review process is integral to ensuring \nthat patients get the medical care they need. Again, the bill provides \nfor an Independent medical judgment by a qualified and non-biased \nmedical expert. This will protect against the possibility that a health \nplan might try to ``short change'' its consumers. Our bill is a \nresponsible approach that will not drive up costs and cause more \nAmericans to lose health insurance coverage.\n  Sixth, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act protects health \ninsurance consumers against the use of a technological innovation that \ncould prove costly to them. Scientists today believe that most people \ncarry genes with certain characteristics that may place these people at \nrisk for future diseases. Consequently, insurance companies could use \nthis technology and charge higher premiums to those individuals who are \ngenetically predisposed to certain diseases. The Patients' Bill of \nRights Plus Act protects against this by prohibiting all group health \nplans and health insurance issuers from denying coverage, or adjusting \npremiums or rates based on ``predictive genetic information'' for the \n140 million Americans covered by both self-insured and fully insured \ngroup health plans and individual health insurance plans.\n  Finally, this bill protects consumers and increases the quality of \nhealth care by protecting patient-provider communications. The \ncommunications are protected through the elimination of gag rules, \nwhich restrict physicians and other health care providers from \ndiscussing patient treatment options not covered by patients' plans. I \nbelieve in providing patients with the most information possible so \nthat they can make informative healthcare decisions, in consultation \nwith their health care provider. The gag rule prohibition in this bill \nwill permit health care professionals to discuss treatment alternatives \nwith patients and render good medical advice, regardless of whether the \ntreatments or alternatives are covered benefits under the plan.\n  Not only does the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act provide consumer \nprotections and increase health care quality, this legislation also \nincreases access to the health care system. First, this bill expands \nthe use of Medical Savings Accounts (``MSA''). These accounts were \ncreated in 1994 but are currently only available for employees of firms \nwith 50 or fewer employees. This bill expands MSA availability to all \nindividuals. This bill also loosens some of the restrictions on \nFlexible Savings Accounts (``FSA''). An FSA is an account which an \nemployee can deposit money into to cover healthcare costs that are not \ncovered by the plan. Current law, however, provides that any money in \nthe FSA that is not used by the end of the year is lost. This bill \nwould allow workers to keep up to $500 of unused FSA funds in tax-\npreferred accounts every year, giving those patients greater control \nover their health care. I have long been a supporter of giving \nAmericans the ability to better control their own health care costs by \npurchasing special tax-preferred savings accounts for basic medical \nexpenses. Finally, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act expands access \nto health care by allowing self-employed Americans to deduct 100 \npercent of health insurance expenses from their taxes. Combined, MSAs, \nFSAs, and the full deductibility of health care costs for the self-\nemployed will increase Americans flexibility in health care coverage \noptions and decrease the number of uninsured.\n  Mr. President, this is just a brief summary that highlights some of \nthe major provisions of the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act. As I am \nsure you can see Mr. President, that this bill is truly a Patients' \nBill of Rights. This bill provides consumers with a number of \nprotections against health plans and increases accessibility to the \nhealth care system. Consequently, I am proud to be a cosponsor of this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  On the other hand, because I feel so strongly that we as a Congress \nmust work toward increasing accessibility to the heath care system, I \nfeel compelled to speak out against the so called ``Patients' Bill of \nRights.'' This bill, by prescribing more mandates, more regulations, \nmore bureaucracy, and more lawsuits, will certainly raise the costs of \nhealth care and close the access door to many Americans.\n  Health care costs are already high in this country, and many \nAmericans cannot afford health insurance. According to Dan Crippen, \ndirector of the Congressional Budget Office, there were approximately \n43 million Americans under the age of 65 that lacked health insurance \ncoverage in 1997. As health care costs continue to rise, who do you \nthink is going to pay for the increased cost? Well, I am fairly certain \nit will not be the insurance companies or the health care providers. \nRather, increased costs will be passed on to the consumers through \nhigher premiums and reduced benefits. That means the consumer will have \nto bear the cost by paying higher premiums for their health plans and \nreceiving less benefits. Higher premiums for consumers\n\n[[Page S8609]]\n\nmean even more Americans will be unable to afford health insurance \ncoverage.\n  Mr. President, I believe the United States Congress should pass a \nPatients' Bill of Rights that provides consumer protections and does \nnot result in people losing access to the health care system. The \n``Patients' Bill of Rights'' does not achieve these objectives.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has conducted a cost estimate of the \n``Patients' Bill of Rights.'' The original cost estimate of this bill \nwas that it would increase premiums 6.1%. It is not difficult to \nunderstand that higher premiums are likely to result in some loss of \nhealth insurance coverage. If you increase costs, some people will not \nbe able to afford health insurance. Americans should not have to choose \nbetween the basic necessities of life like food and shelter and health \ninsurance. Mr. President, given the number of uninsured Americans and \nthe prospect of increasing health care costs, the ``Patients' Bill of \nRights,'' by increasing premiums by 6.1%, is simply irresponsible.\n  Predicting the exact number of Americans that will be uninsured if \nthe ``Patients' Bill of Rights'' becomes law is difficult. However, the \nnumbers the experts keep telling me are that this bill will result in \nover 1 million Americans losing their health insurance coverage. Of \nthis over 1 million Americans, an economic consulting firm estimates \nthat this bill will cause over 34,700 Virginians to lose their health \ninsurance. Let me reiterate this point Mr. President. The experts have \nbeen telling me that due to the 6.1% premium increase in the \n``Patients' Bill of Rights,'' over 1 million Americans and \napproximately 34,000 Virginians are likely to lose their health \ninsurance. This, Mr. President, I cannot accept.\n  Mr. President, legislation that will cause so many Americans and so \nmany Virginians to lose health insurance coverage is not a true \nPatients' Bill of Rights; therefore, I am unable to support the \ninappropriately titled, ``Patients' Bill of Rights.'' On the other \nhand, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act is a true Patients' Bill of \nRights. The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act increases access to the \nhealth care system and provides key consumer protections. I am proud to \nbe a cosponsor of this legislation, and I urge my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to support this true patient protection piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I commend the leadership, Senator Lott and Senator \nNickles, and the minority leader, Senator Daschle, for coming to an \nagreement to bring this very important legislation, the Patients' Bill \nof Rights, to the Senate floor for debate. I know this is a politically \ncharged issue, but I believe there is enough in common on both sides of \nthe aisle to pass a good, strong, bipartisan bill. At the end of the \nday, we can have legislation that will provide patients with the \nnecessary protections they want, and deserve, without driving up the \ncost of insurance so high that we add to the number of uninsured.\n  Many of the provisions in the bills that have been introduced during \nthis Congress and last Congress are similar to provisions I put forth \nin my Medicare patient bill of rights bill or S. 701, which was adopted \nas part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The cornerstone of my \nMedicare legislation was an expedited appeals process with a strong \nindependent external review procedure and user-friendly, comparative \nconsumer information so Medicare enrollees could make informed choices \nabout their health plan options. Although the Medicare program already \nhad an external review process, there were problems with the timeliness \nof reviews, particularly in urgent situations where a patient's health \nwas in jeopardy. My bill codified the appeals process to ensure that \nthese situations would be rectified. Independent reviews would be \ncompleted in 72 hours when considered urgent and 30 days for non-urgent \nsituations.\n  My legislation also addressed another problem with the Medicare \nprogram. The program did not offer enrollees clear, concise, and \ndetailed information about health plan choices and beneficiary rights \nin managed care. As more and more plans entered the Medicare market, it \nbecame increasingly clear that beneficiaries needed access to detailed, \nobjective information about their options and about the protections \nthey have under the Medicare program. S. 701 included new requirements \nfor the program to provide enrollees comparative and user-friendly \nconsumer information that became the foundation for the National \nMedicare Beneficiary Education program that is in existence today.\n  In addition to the expedited appeals process and the consumer \ninformation program, S. 701 contained other items like prohibiting gag \nclauses in Medicare managed care contracts, offering a point-of-service \noption, and assuring access to specialists when medically necessary. \nNot all of these provisions were included in the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997, but I am proud to say most were and, as a result, Medicare \nbeneficiaries enjoy these rights today.\n  Senator Jeffords' bill reported out of committee, and the Republican \nleadership bill, S. 300, also share many of the patient protections I \nadvanced for Medicare for individuals currently insured under the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). While there have been \nsome who have criticized the Republican bill for not covering all \ninsured individuals, the reality is most individuals are covered under \nstate consumer protections. However, for the 48 million people who are \nsolely covered under ERISA, our bill would provide them similar \nprotections to what most individuals enjoy today under their state \nlaws. Furthermore, our bill would extend the two most fundamental and \nimportant protections to all employer-sponsored plans--an appeals \nprocess with a strong external review mechanism, and detailed, user-\nfriendly consumer information so that individuals can make the best \nhealth plan choice possible for their needs. Our bill would not \nduplicate state regulation, thus avoiding unnecessary costs and \nregulatory burdens for employers. These costs ultimately get passed on \nin the form of lower wages, reduced health benefits, and fewer jobs.\n  To argue that the cost of this additional regulatory burden, and I \nmight add this unnecessary cost, is worth it because everyone should \nhave the same federal protections is short-sighted and just plain \nwrong. Health insurance coverage is a benefit that Americans want and \ndesperately need. It is a benefit that employers voluntarily provide. \nIf we require that all plans, even those already regulated by the \nstate, be subjected to any new federal law, we will increase the cost \nof providing health insurance coverage. There is no dispute here. We \nhave the figures from the Congressional Budget Office. In fact, the CBO \nprovided us with a breakdown of the cost of each new patient \nprotection. And guess what? The costs go up as we mandate more \ngovernment regulation. This is not rocket science, this is common \nsense.\n  We need to ask ourselves as members of the Senate if we want to \njeopardize the health insurance coverage of hard-working Americans for \nour own political and personal gain. We have guaranteed health \ninsurance, so we don't need to worry about losing our coverage. But \nwhat about the voters, the people we are supposedly trying to help with \nthis bill:\n  Should we pass this bill without regard to the cost or the impact it \nwill have on people's coverage?\n  Should we be telling our constituents who are content with their \nhealth plan that the cost doesn't matter because what matters most is \nhelping people who were harmed by their managed care plan?\n  Should our response be to folks back home that they should be willing \nto pay more for protections they already have under state law so that \nthe federal government can step in to do what the states are already \ndoing?\n  In addition to the rise in premiums patient protections will most \ncertainly cause, the private sector is now predicting health care costs \nwill increase even further than anticipated. A recent survey released \nby a human resources consulting firm indicates health insurers and \nhealth plan administrators expect HMO costs to increase 6 percent. \nPoint-of-service plans are expected to rise 7.7 percent. According to a \nGeneral Accounting Office (GAO) report, a 6 percent premium increase \nwill result in approximately 1.8 million Americans losing their health \ninsurance. This is without Congress taking any action. If the Democrats \nhad their way, we would\n\n[[Page S8610]]\n\nbe adding another 5 to 6 percent on top of the 6 percent increase \nalready projected. What good are patient protections when you don't \nhave any health insurance? And the costs of higher insurance premiums \nare not only measured by the loss of coverage. Families will have to \nmake choices between a better education for their children; preparing \nfor retirement; starting a business; or simply affording to each out on \noccasion just to pay their higher premiums to keep their health care \ncoverage.\n\n  The survey goes on to cite reasons for these higher than expected \npremium increases. At the top of the list of reported reasons is new \nstate and federal mandates. Do not be mistaken. The impact of increased \nregulation is real. And the cost is far greater than some monetary \nfigure or percentage increase can possibly demonstrate. We are talking \nabout peoples' health insurance coverage, and ultimately their health. \nFor research has shown there is a direct correlation between a person's \nhealth and whether that person has insurance.\n  The Republican bill attempts to target protections where no state \nprotections exist under ERISA. It provides two fundamental federal \nprotections to all employer-sponsored plans. One of these provisions, \nwhich will offer patients the ability to solve disputes with managed \ncare plans, is the appeals process. This provision, in my estimation, \nwould solve many of the problems people experience with their managed \ncare plans. This approach, unlike the Democratic approach, would \nprovide assistance to the patient when they need it the most--at the \ntime when care is needed. What good is it to know you can sue your \nhealth plan when your health has already been harmed or worse yet, you \nare dead? What good is to sue when most of the money ends up in the \nhands of trial lawyers?\n  Our bill would allow for any dispute regarding medical necessity \ndecisions or a treatment determined to be experimental by the plan to \nbe appealed to an external independent review board. This board would \nbe made up of medical experts in the area of dispute. The appeals \nprocess would be timely, independent, and binding on the health plan. \nPatients would get health care when they need it, not a lawsuit after \nits too late.\n  The other new Federal protection that is fundamental to consumer \nchoice is the availability of consumer information. The Republican bill \nwould establish new disclosure and detailed plan information \nrequirements for all employer-sponsored plans. This information would \nbe available to people to ensure they understand what their plan \ncovers, how it defines medical necessity, what they should do when a \ndispute arises, and much, much more. This provision will enable \npatients to make decisions about their health care and will create \ngreater competition among health plans to provide quality care and \nservice.\n  Throughout this debate we must remember what the purpose of this \nlegislation is. We must not let rhetoric cloud our judgment about what \nwill truly benefit patients and not special interest groups. We must \nremember this debate is about patients; not trial lawyers; not doctors; \nand not bureaucrats in Washington. We need to act responsibly to pass a \nbill that will provide meaningful patient protections while preserving \nthe health insurance coverage of millions of hard-working Americans. \nAgain, I ask the fundamental question we must consider. What good is a \npatient bill of rights when you don't have insurance?\n  Republicans and Democrats agree on a number of issues that really \nmatter to our constituents. We should be able to pass a bipartisan bill \nwith those provisions we all support. Both sides may have to \ncompromise. But that is part of making the legislative process work. I \nask my colleagues to remember on whom this debate should focus on. Let \nus not forget, it is the patients' bill of rights.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to join my colleagues in \nthe important debate on ensuring the health care rights of patients \nacross America.\n  Our nation has the best health care in the world, yet there is a \ngrowing concern over changes in how most Americans receive health care. \nIndividuals once accustomed to choosing a doctor and paying for medical \ntreatment are now thrown into managed care systems or HMOs. Too often \nfor the patient, HMO rules, restrictions and concern for profit seem of \nmore consequence than providing quality health care.\n  The Republican plan, called Patients' Bill of Rights Plus, is a \ndirect response to patient concerns. In a nutshell, the Republican bill \nguarantees affordable, quality health care and provides access to the \nbest doctors and specialists available.\n  The Republican bill will protect the unprotected by establishing a \nBill of Rights for patients whose plans are not already regulated by \nexisting consumer protection laws. Under our bill, patients will have \nthe right to talk openly and freely with their doctor about all \ntreatment options; the right to coverage for emergency care; and the \nright to see the doctor of their choice.\n  It will make health insurance more affordable and accessible by \naccelerating full tax deductibility of health premiums for the self \nemployed; and expanding the Medical Savings Account pilot program to \nall of America.\n  It will empower patients by providing a timely and inexpensive \nappeals procedure for all patients who are denied coverage by an HMO.\n  Why is the Republican plan a better alternative?\n  The Democrat bill, called ``The Patients Bill of Rights Act,'' may \nhave a similar title to the Republican bill, but the two bills \nrepresent entirely different approaches to the role of government in \nhealth care:\n  The Democrat bill encourages litigation.\n  Our plan insures patients will get the care they need, not a trial \nlawyer knocking at their door. It creates a fair and efficient process \nto resolve disputes with HMOs.\n  The Democrat plan, will enhance lawsuits, not the delivery of health \ncare. Mr. President, health care cannot be improved through the court \nsystem.\n  The Democrat plan creates massive Federal bureaucracy. The Democrat \nplan regulates all health insurance at the federal level--thereby pre-\nempting state laws. The Democrat plan is a litany of federal mandates \non private health insurance. It's one step closer to a federal take-\nover of America's health care system.\n  The Democrat plan is a ``one-size-fits-all plan.'' The Democrat bill \nsqueezes patients into a one-size-fits-all health plan. The Democrat \nplan puts one of the most ineffective agencies, the Health Care \nFinancing Administration, in charge of it all!\n  Maybe that works in Massachusetts, but it won't work in my State of \nAlaska. Let me explain.\n  The Federal Intrusion in Alaska doesn't work. Mr. President, a one-\nsize-fits-all'' approach doesn't fit Alaska's health care needs. Let me \ntell you the facts:\n  Alaska contains the most rural, remote areas in the nation;\n  Alaska is 74 percent medically underserved; and most importantly;\n  Alaska is a state in which the Federal Government, and in particular, \nthe Health Care Financing Administration, just doesn't understand.\n  Let me tell you about three health care problems in Alaska that were \nexacerbated by Federal intrusion:\n  Federal intervention threatens to destroy Alaska's Rural Physician \nResidency Program. Alaska's rural health care problems are tough. \nPhysician turn-over rate is high. At Bethel Hospital, 4 of the 16 \nprimary care physicians on staff leave every year. Many villages \npopulated by 25-1,000 individuals never even have access to physicians.\n  The result is that bush Alaska has the highest rates of preventable \ndiseases in America. Doctor Harold Johnson, head physician of the \nAlaska Family Residency Program described the physician needs of Alaska \nas follows:\n\n       The history of physician turnover, isolation and general \n     burn-out had been continuing in bush Alaska settings without \n     any sign of improvement for the last 45 years. The Alaska \n     Family Practice residency is a vital program designed to \n     train a workforce to handle bush Alaska's harsh conditions, \n     isolation and unique culture.\n\n  I worked to protect that residency program with specific language in \nthe Balanced Budget Act, but still this important program is \nthreatened.\n\n[[Page S8611]]\n\n  Why? Because the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) \nimproperly interpreted my language, thereby preventing our doctors from \ntraining in rural Alaska and other rural areas across the nation. \nSenator Collins and I had to introduce legislation to stop HCFA from \nharming these rural programs. It's this agency, HCFA, that Democrats \nnow ask to run health care for most of America.\n  HCFA ignores Alaska's Medicare access problems. Access to health care \nis the over-riding problem for Alaska's elderly. Fourteen of nineteen \nprimary care physicians in a major hospital in Anchorage will no longer \naccept Medicare patients. Why? Because doctors in rural areas lose \nmoney on Medicare patients in rural areas.\n  I have stated my concern over and over to the Health Care Financing \nAdministration, but was ignored. As a matter of fact, the Administrator \nof the agency testified before the Finance Committee on February 26, \n1998 that her agency has found ``no overall problem with access to \ncare'' anywhere in the nation.\n  Why is HCFA ignoring rural America? I have been working with her \nagency for the past year to educate them--and have even brought \nrepresentatives up to Alaska. But the problem persists.\n  Once again I stress that HCFA is not the agency to run all of \nAmerica's health care. HCFA's approach of a one-size-fits all'' \nsolution never seems to consider rural America.\n  And, lastly,\n  Health care access is denied to King Cove, Alaska. This debate is \nabout ``patients rights''--about the rights of American citizens to \nhave certain guarantees when they need medical attention. But when I \nthink of King Cove, Alaska, I can't help but note a certain level of \nhypocracy by the party on the other side of the aisle.\n  It was one of the last votes Congress cast last year, ``The King Cove \nHealth and Safety Act of 1998''--here's the background.\n  King Cove is located in the westermost part of Alaska and is \naccessible only by sea or air. Air traffic is often completely stopped \ndue to a combination of prevailing northernly winds, heavy snows, \nstrong crosswinds and turbulence.\n  Since 1981, there have been 11 air crash fatalities and countless \nother air crashes and injuries from the King Cove airport. One fatal \naccident involved a medivac flight headed for Anchorage.\n  The people of King Cove came to Congress to ask for access to health \ncare--to ask for permission to build a small gravel road to a nearby, \n24-hour, ``all-weather capability'' airport in the town of Cold Bay. \nPermission from Congress was needed because the Department of Interior \nprevented the gravel road from crossing a mere seven miles of federal \nproperty.\n  I am not talking about the ability for a King Cove resident to get an \nM.R.I., or the ability to choose their own specialist. I am talking \nabout the most basic of all health care rights--access--the ability to \nsimply get to a hospital.\n  My bill to allow that access was vigorously opposed by the Democrats. \nAnd President Clinton threatened a veto. Why? Because a big ``one-size-\nfits-all'' federal law prevented a 7-mile road. Once again those big \n``one size fits all'' laws don't seem to fit Alaska.\n  Sadly, the majority of Democrats last year voted to deny the most \nbasic right--access to health care--to Alaska residents. So the \nDemocrats can ``talk the talk'' all they want about HMOs, and access to \nemergency rooms, but when it came time to ``walk-the-walk'' for the \npeople of Alaska, they could not and would not do it.\n  I ask my colleagues, how can we be on the floor of the Senate \ndebating what happens to a person after he gets to a doctor or hospital \nwhen many here were unwilling to provide Alaskans with access to that \ndoctor or hospital?\n  Mr. President, that is what Federal intrusion has done to health care \nin Alaska. Again I stress that a ``one-size-fits-all'' package doesn't \nwork in rural America.\n  Public health is too important to be sacrificed to such a big-\ngovernment vision.\n  I favor patients rights that will strike against government control \nof the health-care system; I favor a plan that makes coverage more \naffordable and puts patients in control of their medical care; I favor \nthe Republican bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, over the past four days, we have cast many \ndifficult votes. Often, as you know, several issues are addressed in a \nsingle amendment or series of votes. Therefore, in order to ensure that \nmy positions on these matters are fully understood by my constituents, \nI ask unanimous consent that an explanation of my votes on health care \namendments be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the explanation was ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n           Senator McCain's Votes on Patients' Bill of Rights\n\n       7/15/99: Kerrey Amendment #1253--JSM voted no because it \n     was too broad in scope requiring an unlimited continuation of \n     care from all plans with too many exceptions causing \n     excessive costs for patients. Failed 48-52\n       7/15/99: Collins Amendment #1243--JSM voted yes because it \n     made long term health care more affordable while also \n     expanding direct access to obstetric and gynecologist care \n     for women; providing timely access to specialists; and \n     expanding patient access to emergency care. Passed 54-46\n       7/15/99: Ashcroft Amendment #1252--JSM voted yes because \n     the amendment tightens up the external review process, making \n     it more independent of the influence of insurance companies, \n     and because it moves toward requiring insurance companies to \n     pay for the costs of individuals participating in clinical \n     trials. Amendment was adopted 54-46.\n       7/15/99: Gregg Amendment #1250--JSM voted yes because the \n     amendment eliminates the provisions in the Democrat bill that \n     would allow excessive and unnecessary litigation. He \n     believes, however, that patients should be permitted \n     reasonable and limited access to the courts to recover \n     compensatory damages when denied proper health care by their \n     insurer. Amendment was adopted 53-47.\n       7/14/99: Dodd Amendment #1239--No recorded vote on text of \n     Dodd amendment regarding insurance coverage for individuals \n     participating in clinical trials and access to approved drugs \n     and devices; text of amendment was eliminated by adoption of \n     Snowe Amendment #1241.\n       7/14/99: Kennedy Amendment #1242--JSM voted yes because he \n     believes the patient protections afforded by the underlying \n     legislation should be extended to as many people as possible, \n     without precluding states from establishing additional \n     protections. Amendment failed 48-52.\n       7/14/99: Snowe Amendment #1241--JSM voted yes because the \n     amendment establishes requirements for extended coverage and \n     overnight hospital care for mastectomies and similar \n     procedures. Amendment was adopted 55-45.\n       7/14/99: Bingaman Amendment #1243--JSM voted no because he \n     felt it did not fully address the problem which is why he \n     preferred the amendment offered by Senator Collins providing \n     timely access to specialists while also expanding access to \n     emergency room services, women access to obstetric and \n     gynecological care and expansion of deductibility of long-\n     term care to individuals. Failed 47-53.\n       7/13/99: Santorum Amendment #1234--JSM voted yes because \n     the amendment provides for full deductibility of the costs of \n     health insurance for self-employed individuals and restates \n     states' rights to regulate health plans which are not exempt \n     from state control. Amendment was adopted 53-47.\n       7/13/99: Graham Amendment #1235--JSM voted no because the \n     amendment would allow individuals to receive non-emergency \n     care in emergency facilities if a non-life threatening \n     medical condition was discovered during the course of \n     treatment for a life-threatening condition. He supported the \n     language in the amendment mandating that all patients have \n     access to emergency facilities, but felt that authorizing \n     post-stabilization care in an emergency facility would open \n     the door for people to receive a litany of unauthorized, \n     costly health services if they come into an emergency room \n     under the pretense of a life-threatening condition. \n     Conditions discovered during the course of an examination in \n     an emergency facility, should be handled through the normal \n     referral process using non-emergency doctors and facilities. \n     Amendment failed 47-53.\n       7/13/99: Nickles Amendment #1236--JSM voted yes because the \n     amendment waives the requirements of the underlying \n     legislation if their implementation would result in a 1 \n     percent increase in premiums or make health care unaffordable \n     for 100,000 Americans. Amendment was adopted 52-48.\n       7/13/99: Robb Amendment #1237--JSM voted no because the \n     amendment would eliminate the threshold exemptions in the \n     Nickles amendment #1236. He supported the provisions of the \n     amendment that required coverage and established minimum \n     hospital stays for patients undergoing mastectomies and \n     related procedures. These provisions were subsequently \n     adopted in the Snowe Amendment #1241. Amendment was defeated \n     48-52.\n       7/13/99: Frist Amendment #1238--JSM voted yes because it \n     made health plans accountable for their actions and delivery \n     of medical care to patients. 52-48.\n\n[[Page S8612]]\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as a parent and grandparent, I know there \nis nothing as important as taking care of one's family, especially if a \nfamily member is sick. If your daughter gets hurt, you want her healed. \nIf your dad is ill, you want him to get better. It's human nature. Our \ncompassion and desire to help our loved ones is limitless. Caring for \nyour family is as natural as breathing. That's why good medical care is \nso important to all Americans.\n  Health care is about security, it's about peace of mind. It's very \npersonal. It's about your doctor, your hospital, and your health care \nplan. It should not be about attorneys, paperwork, and the massive \nfederal government.\n  America is blessed with the best medical care in the world, but the \nquality of our health care will be jeopardized if we fail to prepare \nfor the challenges of this rapidly developing field.\n  As Congress takes a hard look at the health care system, we need to \ntake a step back from the partisan bickering so often associated with \nthe political system and instead do what's best for our families.\n  So as this debate in Congress ensues, I will support proposals, from \neither party, that will make health care better.\n  These are the principles I advocate:\n  Ensuring that Americans have access to the highest quality health \ncare available;\n  Making sure that your medical decisions are made by a doctor;\n  Access to healthcare that is affordable; and\n  Creating opportunities for families that are now uninsured to buy \nhealth care coverage.\n  Washington families from Poulsbo to Pullman should have access to the \nbest available care when they need it. Congress should implement common \nsense consumer protections for patients not covered by existing state \nlaws.\n  Patients should be able to go to the nearest emergency room without \nworrying about whether that hospital is a part of his or her insurance \nplan's network. They should simply get the care they or their families \nneed.\n  Woman should also have direct access to their ob-gyn for their health \ncare needs, and children need to be able to see pediatricians who \nspecialize in children's health care.\n  The patient-doctor relationship is unique and very personal. Patients \nshould be able to choose their physician; under the Patients' Bill of \nRights Plus Act, which I support, they can.\n  Patients should also be confident they are receiving the highest \nquality health care. It is difficult to keep abreast of the new \ndevelopments and treatments in the fast-changing world of modern \nmedicine. We have learned more in the last five years about how to \nimprove health care than we learned in the prior 25 years. We need to \nmake sure that hard-working doctors have the tools and the best \ninformation they need to provide the best care.\n  Should patients have recourse if they think their plan has been \nnegligent or unfairly denied them treatment? Absolutely. We need to \nlook at models that work during this debate, and adopt health care \nreforms that move the standard of patient care forward, not back.\n  Some in Washington, DC want to complicate the health care equation. \nInstead of a quick resolution and access to care when patients need it, \npatients would have to wait years for the courts to resolve the issue. \nThe problem with that philosophy is that lawsuits are after the fact--\nthe damage is already done. We should focus on quality health care and \non treating patients, not spending all time in court. After all, you \ncan't sue your way back to health.\n  Who benefits if we have more lawsuits? Clearly not the patients. One \nGAO study from 1987 found that cases with merit below $50,000 were \nunlikely to be pursued by plaintiff's attorneys. And, the time to \npayoff--if any--takes on average 33 months to be resolved; and medical \nmalpractice claimants only received 43 cents on the dollar.\n  Their plan would allow employers to be sued. But, for many small \nbusinesses one lawsuit would put them out of business. In fact 57% of \nsmall businesses said they would drop health care coverage for their \nemployees rather than risk a lawsuit that could put them out of \nbusiness. That is not good for families.\n  I believe there is a better way. Patients should be able to hold \ntheir health plans accountable. New internal and external appeals \nprovisions give all patients in group health plans that ability. If a \npatient believes his plan wrongly denied coverage for a health care \nservice he can access a timely internal review conducted by the plan. \nIf he still disagrees with the plan's determination, a patient can ask \nfor an independent review conducted by a doctor who is a specialist in \nthe area of dispute. The decision of the external review is binding on \nthe plan and the court is able to award monetary penalties if the plan \ndoes not comply.\n  There are those in Washington, DC that would extend the arm of the \nfederal government into your families' health insurance--requiring you \nto pay for benefits you may or may not need. The Congressional Budget \nOffice concludes that the bill offered by the Democrats would cause \npremiums to rise by 6.1 percent, or $355 per family.\n  Ultimately, increased costs mean more American families can't afford \ninsurance. The Lewin Group estimates that for every 1 percent increase \nin premiums 300,000 people lose their insurance coverage. A 6.1 percent \nincrease would put health care out of reach for 1.8 million more \nAmericans. In Washington state it means as many as 50,000 more \nWashingtonians may be unable to afford health insurance. That's \nunconscionable.\n  Instead, insurance coverage needs to be more accessible to American \nfamilies. One way to do that is to allow full deductibility of health \ninsurance costs for those who are self-employed--the same benefit many \nbusinesses receive. Employees who pay for their families' insurance \npremiums should also be allowed that same tax deduction. Medical \nSavings Accounts should be made more broadly available--37 percent of \nthe people currently enrolled in the MSA pilot program were previously \nuninsured.\n  Our mandate is clear: ``first do no harm.'' This time-tested creed of \nthe medical profession applies to this debate. The challenge is to \nprovide common sense improvements to the current system but not at the \nexpense of increased costs, more uninsured families, fewer health care \nchoices, and another layer of government bureaucracy between patients \nand their doctors.\n  Let me add, Mr. President, that I think it is important that we have \nthis debate. But, unfortunately, both parties are engaging in political \ngamesmanship and procedural antics on the Senate floor; each hoping to \nprove it is the champion of the health care issue. What's the end \nresult? A debate--but, just a debate.\n  That result--no real progress--seems to me the exact result that \npolitical Washington, DC is hoping for. Where there was a glimmer of \nbipartisanship--for example on amendments that would give patients \naccess to clinical trials or end the practice of drive-thru \nmastectomies--politics reigned.\n  In the meantime, there is a growing crisis in our rural areas as \nseniors continue to lose access and choice in their health care \noptions. We know that as mandates pile up the cost of providing health \ncare increases. Yet, the Administration's answer to Medicare has been \nacross the board reductions in payments to hospitals and insurance \nplans. Just two weeks ago a number of plans decided they could no \nlonger afford to do business in Eastern Washington. There is now only \nfee-for-service in most of Eastern Washington meaning seniors will end \nup paying more for fewer benefits.\n  Earlier this week, I attended a hearing at which rural hospital \nadministrators testified about the impact of Medicare changes on access \nto care for seniors in rural areas. As the Administration develops \npayment systems, and issues its regulations and guidance for Medicare, \nI continually hear from the medical community, particularly those in \nrural areas, that the payment reductions and increased paperwork burden \nare simply intolerable. If hospitals and doctors can no longer do \nbusiness in rural areas it ultimately means that the quality of care \nfor seniors and other families living in our rural communities is in \njeopardy.\n  We must work towards more choice, access and quality care for all \nAmericans; for those who may be in group health plans, the subject of \nthis current debate, but also for seniors and those Americans living in \nrural communities.\n\n[[Page S8613]]\n\n  Congress' focus should be to create new opportunities for covering \nthe uninsured by enacting provisions to make health insurance more \naffordable and accessible. We should pass common sense patient \nprotections for those who are currently unprotected by state laws and \nall patients should be able to hold their health plans accountable.\n  After all, health care is about security, it's about peace of mind, \nit's about your doctor, and your hospital; but most importantly, its \nabout your family.\n  Mrs. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nof the Patients' Bill of Rights. This bill will provide needed reform \nto our managed care system and ensure some basic patient protections \nfor those with health insurance who do not fall under state \njurisdiction.\n  This week the Senate debated an issue that goes to the heart of the \npersonal security of every American. . .an issue that underlies all \nother issues. . .that cuts across racial lines, income levels, gender, \nor profession. Health care in this Nation affects all of us, touches \nall of our lives. And I am pleased that we are having this opportunity \nto discuss how we can ensure that health care delivery in the new \ncentury never loses sight of its most important component--the patient.\n  We need to have this discussion because, to paraphrase the recent car \ncommercial, this is not your father's health care system. It isn't even \nthe system we knew ten or fifteen years ago. Not so long ago, health \ncare was delivered on a fee-for-service basis. Today, an explosion of \nadvances in medicine and technology along with the advent of managed \ncare, HMO-based networks, have changed the face of health care in \nAmerica. And it is time to take stock.\n  We need to ensure that medical decisions are dictated by patients and \ntheir doctors--not the fine print on an insurance policy. And we must \ndo so in a way that doesn't step on the toes of sound policies already \nput in place by individual states and doesn't substitute endless \ncourtroom litigation for immediate medical treatment.\n  As more and more people enter into managed care plans, we hear of \nmore and more problems--in some instances, it seems that patients are \nbarely off the operating room table before they are sent home, whether \nthey are ready or not. Or patients are denied access to a treatment or \nthe specialist they need--something my state staff hears time and time \nagain from constituents.\n  I happen to think that medical tests and medical doctors should be \ndriving medical decisions, not actuaries or accountants. In all too \nmany cases, it seems as though health care has become too much about \ncrunching numbers and not enough about healing patients.\n  Indeed, the whole drive toward managed care has been prompted by an \neffort to contain and reduce health care costs in this nation--by \nitself, a worthy goal. And by-and-large, managed care has proven less \ncostly than the traditional fee-for-service system--in fact, last year, \nthe average premiums for traditional fee-for-service plans were almost \n20 percent higher than HMO premiums and about 7 percent higher than \npremiums for preferred provider organizations.\n  But the question is, at what price? There is a real feeling among \nmany Americans that, in some far off place, bureaucrats they will never \nsee are making decisions that will dictate the quality and level of \ncare they will receive. There's a real feeling that the average \nAmerican has little say in what is probably the most deeply personal \nissue there is--and that the dollar sign is more compelling than any X-\nray or MRI.\n  This bill addresses these concerns in a number of important and \neffective ways, all designed to put patients first.\n  This bill recognizes that medical emergencies are just that--\nemergencies. If you are being rushed to the hospital with a heart \nattack, that's hardly the time to have to phone ahead for prior \napproval--under this bill you'll know you're covered.\n  This bill protects a patient's right to hear the full range of \ntreatment options from their doctor. It is outrageous that patients are \noften denied the best possible information just when they need it most, \nand this legislation would make these so-called ``gag clauses'' a thing \nof the past.\n  This bill would allow parents to bring their children directly to \npediatricians, instead of having to go through primary care physicians. \nHow much sense does it make that some managed care plans consider \npediatricians to be specialists? The last time I checked, being a child \nis not a sickness--children deserve the quick and direct access they \nneed to doctors who are really just general practitioners for kids, and \nunder this bill they get it.\n  This bill would protect one's right to see a specialist. If a patient \nbelieves that seeing a specialist is the only way to get a sound \ndiagnosis, they should not be denied that option.\n  And finally, this bill allows patients who are pregnant, terminally \nill, or in the hospital to continue to see their current doctor, even \nif that doctor is no longer participating in the patient's health care \nplan. It's unconscionable that, after seeing a doctor who knows your \ncondition better than anyone else, you could be asked to return to \nsquare one--and that would no longer happen under this legislation.\n  I realize that both parties have identified some of the more pressing \nproblems with managed care, and both have laid out ideas on how to \naddress these problems. And I truly believe that Senators on both sides \nof the aisle are concerned with what they've seen and heard from their \nconstituents. The point that must be made here is that it is not so \nmuch our goals that differ, but rather the path we take in getting \nthere.\n  And one of the most glaring differences is the way we approach \nexisting state laws. Not surprisingly, many states have already beaten \nus to the punch when it comes to patient protections, and this bill \nrespects the work they have done by complementing, rather than \nundercutting, their efforts.\n  Maine, for example, banned so-called ``gag clauses'' back in 1995, \nprovided direct access to ob/gyns in 1996, and instituted the prudent \nlayperson standard for emergency care in 1998. Wouldn't it make a lot \nmore sense for the federal government to focus on fixing what's broken, \ninstead of the problems that states like Maine have already fixed?\n  Yet, the Kennedy-Daschle bill asks us to overturn all the laws duly \npassed by 50 state legislatures and substitute then with a ``father \nknows best'' approach. It basically says, ``thanks for all your efforts \non this issue --now step aside and let the real experts take over''. We \nthink a better idea is to complement, not displace, state decisions and \nthis bill does just that by providing benchmark protections for \npatients who are not already covered by State regulated plans.\n\n  We also take a different approach when it comes to disputes over \ncare, emphasizing swift access to providers over the slow grind of the \nlegal system. Under this bill, if an individual has a problem with a \ndecision about their health, they can appeal, under an expedited \nprocess, to an independent party who is an expert in the condition \nbeing reviewed.\n  Why? Because what patients need first and foremost is medical relief \nnow, not legal relief later. If I were sick today and I didn't believe \nI was getting the care or treatment I needed, I would rather see a \ndoctor than a lawyer. The bottom line is getting well, and this bill \nwould rather put medication ahead of litigation.\n  Finally, let me just say that I believe no patients bill of rights \ncould be complete without a provision to protect against genetic \ndiscrimination.\n  Every day, scientists are finding links to a whole host of diseases. \nAn estimated 15 million people are affected by over 4,000 currently \nknown genetic disorders. Today, testing is available for about 450 \ndisorders--but testing is useless if people are afraid to take \nadvantage of it for fear of insurance discrimination.\n  No wonder then a reported 8 out of 10 people who undergo genetic \ntesting pay for it out of their own pockets. Others simply forgo \ntesting altogether. And still others refuse to participate in important \nmedical research.\n  This is a travesty that must be remedied, and it would be remedied by \nthis bill, which includes a provision I authored that provides \nabsolutely fundamental protections against genetic discrimination in \nhealth insurance. This language has a long history--I first introduced \nthese protections in the 104th\n\n[[Page S8614]]\n\nCongress in conjunction with Representative Louise Slaughter in the \nHouse.\n  Since then I have worked extensively with Senators Jeffords and Frist \nto ensure that this bill effectively addresses the need for protections \nagainst genetic discrimination in the health insurance industry.\n  Americans should not live in fear of knowing the truth about their \nhealth status. They should not be afraid that critical health \ninformation could be misused. They should not be forced to choose \nbetween insurance coverage and critical health information that can \nhelp inform their decisions. They should not fear disclosing their \ngenetic status to their doctors. And they should not fear participating \nin medical research.\n  We have laid out stringent, tough, and sensible guidelines that allow \npeople to use the information that can be obtained from genetic testing \nwithout fear. Any of my colleagues who have heard me talk about \ngenetics know about my constituent, Bonnie Lee Tucker, who is afraid to \nhave a genetic test for breast cancer--despite the fact that she has \nnine immediate family members who have had this killer--and despite the \nfact that she believes this information could help protect her \ndaughter. Why? Because she is afraid it will negatively impact her \nability and her daughter's ability to get insurance.\n\n  Our language ensures that people who are insured for the very first \ntime, or who become insured after a long period of being uninsured, do \nnot face genetic discrimination. It ensures that people are not charged \nexorbitant premiums based on such information.\n  It ensures that insurance companies cannot discriminate against \nindividuals who have requested or received genetic services. It ensures \nthat insurance companies cannot release a person's genetic information \nwithout their prior written consent. And it ensures that health \ninsurance companies cannot carve out covered services because of an \ninherited genetic disorder.\n  In short, it ensures that Bonnie Lee Tucker, and the thousands of \nAmericans like her, can take advantage of the latest scientific \nbreakthroughs to protect their health and well-being without losing \ntheir insurance coverage.\n  There will be no issue more important in the 106th Congress than the \none before us this week. No issue affects people more personally than \nhealth care, and we have a real responsibility to ensure that any \nchanges we make put the patient's interests first. I believe this \nlegislation puts patients first without unnecessary bureaucracy, \nwithout excessive involvement from the federal government, without \ntrampling the laws already on the books in all fifty states, without \nincreasing the costs of insurance or increasing the number of the \nuninsured.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I rise in opposition to the Kennedy health care bill and \nin support of the Republican alternative--the Patients' Bill of Rights \nPlus.\n  Mr. President, when the rhetoric starts heating up, it is often \ndifficult to tell exactly what is going on.\n  However, it has been my experience that quite frequently, the best \nway to determine where people are headed is to look at where they have \nbeen. You can often tell where people are going if you look back to \nwhere they are coming from.\n  And, quite honestly, I get a little nervous when I hear people \ntalking about providing a bill of rights for patients that sounds very \nenticing. Without looking into the facts, I get a little nervous \nbecause I know where the supporters of the Kennedy bill have been.\n  I know where the President has been. We know where they are coming \nfrom on health care.\n  Where are they coming from? Well, back in 1994, these same people \nwere trying to sell us on Clinton Care--the President's misguided \nproposal which would have taken away a patient choice and freedom and \nwhich would have put the Federal Government in charge of the Nation's \nentire health care system.\n  Fortunately, that proposal was rejected by Congress and the American \npeople. It failed because it was recognized for what it really was--a \nbig government proposal that would have moved us closer to single-\npayor, government-run health care system.\n  And the American people made it clear back in 1994 they simply didn't \nhave a great deal of confidence that letting the Federal Government run \nhealth care would be any kind of improvement.\n  Now, the debate has changed. We are talking about ``expanding \npatients' rights.'' And who can be against that?\n  But if you look at the people who are talking the loudest about these \nnew rights, you will see the very same folks who supported Clinton \nCare--and who have consistently supported single payer, socialization \nof medicine all along. And that should concern everyone.\n  Have they changed their spots? I don't think so.\n  Be that as it may, even if you ignore the past and simply accept the \nKennedy bill as a stand-alone measure that has nothing to do with past \ncongressional efforts to put the Government in charge of health care, \nthere are some very good reasons to oppose it. And there are some \nequally strong reasons to support the Republican alternative.\n  The reasons to oppose the Kennedy bill are simple. It will increase \nhealth care costs. It will increase the number of people who have no \nhealth insurance coverage dramatically. And it will seriously threaten \nour existing system of voluntary employer provided health care \ninsurance.\n  It promises new ``patient rights'' which sound appealing at first \nblush, but when you look at it a little closer you discover that the \ncosts are awfully high and the only ones who really benefit from those \nnew rights are the lawyers and the bureaucrats.\n  I would like to talk about a couple of the problems that I see with \nthe Kennedy bill and then point out a couple of the reasons that the \nRepublican alternative is better.\n  First is the scope of the Kennedy bill--who will be affected. Today, \nmuch of the health care is regulated under the Federal ERISA statute--\nthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act.\n  Today 42 million Americans get health care insurance through their \nemployer as part of a plan that is directly governed by ERISA.\n  But, an even larger number--84 million--get their insurance through \nhealth plans that ERISA leaves to State regulation. Under the Kennedy \nbill, this would change.\n  The scope of the Kennedy bill is so broad that the States would be \ncut out of health care regulation. Uncle Sam would be in the driver's \nseat.\n  That's not what we want. One of the reasons the Clinton health bill \nfailed was because Americans were suspicious of the Federal Government \nmaking health care decisions.\n  Many of us believe these decisions need to be kept as far from \nWashington as possible. The States have a role to play. Mr. President, \neven in Kentucky where our States general assembly has made some \nmistakes with health care recently, we want to keep working before \nturning everything over to Uncle Same.\n  So, the scope of this bill is troubling.\n  But even more troubling is the cost of the Kennedy bill. That is what \nhealth insurance is all about in the first place--the cost of health \ncare.\n  And cost is certainly the one single health care issue that \nKentuckians talk the most to me about. The cost of insurance premiums, \nprescription drug prices, medical equipment.\n  People are worried about their bottom lines. They are worried about \nhow much is going to come out of their pockets. They want to know if \nthey are going to be able to continue to afford to take care of \nthemselves and their families.\n  For the folks who are worried about costs, the Kennedy bill is \ndefinitely the wrong prescription because it will increase costs, it \nwill raise prices and it will swell the number of uninsured American \nfamilies.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reports that the Kennedy \nbill would raise health insurance premiums 6.1 percent above inflation \nover the next three years.\n  In Kentucky this translates into $190 in higher insurance premiums \nthat families would have to pay each year.\n  The worst part of these higher costs is that they mean fewer \nAmericans will be able to afford health insurance.\n  CBO estimates the Kennedy bill will cost 1.4 million Americans their \nhealth insurance.\n\n[[Page S8615]]\n\n  As many as 30,000 Kentuckians could lose their insurance coverage \nbecause of the higher costs imposed by the Kennedy bill.\n  According to at least one estimate, all of the new regulations and \nmandates in the Kennedy bill will cost almost $60 billion.\n  Somebody is going to pay those costs. Insurers are going to pass \ntheir costs along to the employers. And the employers will have to make \na decision on whether to pass those increases along to their employees. \nAnd some of them may decide to drop the health care benefits they \ncurrently offer to their employees altogether.\n  So, that's the bottom line. the Kennedy bill of rights will mean that \nfewer people have health insurance--and those who still have it, will \npay a lot more for it.\n  On the other hand, the GOP plan addresses health care quality without \nsignificantly raising costs. It would increase costs less than 1 \npercent.\n  That's a mighty big difference for the 1.4 million Americans who \nwould be priced out of the market by the Kennedy bill, and for the \nmillions of other Americans who would have to pay more out of their \npockets for higher premiums.\n  A new bill of rights doesn't help you much if you lose your insurance \ncoverage because you or your employer can't afford the premiums.\n  Our bill doesn't drive up costs, and it won't cause more Americans to \nlose their coverage because it doesn't have all of the new mandates and \nnew regulations that the Kennedy bill does.\n  In fact, the Republican alternative actually includes provisions to \nhelp expand the availability of health insurance coverage and to help \nreduce the costs of insurance.\n  Our bill makes health insurance premiums 100 percent deductible \nimmediately. That makes health insurance more affordable for 125,000 \nKentuckians and millions more across the country who are self-employed.\n  The Republican bill also would lift the cap on the number of medical \nsavings accounts that can be set up. Currently there is a national \nlimit of 750,000. Our bill would allow every American who wants to set \nup a medical savings account the opportunity to do so.\n  MSAs might not be the right thing for everyone, but they make sense \nfor a lot of families and they can really cut costs for many of them.\n  Our bill also improves on the existing ``flex accounts'' that many \nemployees use to get health insurance coverage through cafeteria plans. \nRight now, many employees can use flex accounts to help cut medical \ncosts and save money. Our bill would give employees even more \nflexibility to shift their coverage from one insurer to another and to \nmake sure they can continue to see their own doctor.\n  Our bill contains these provisions to help reduce the costs of health \ncare, and to expand health insurance coverage. The Kennedy bill \nincludes none of them.\n  Over 40 million Americans have no health insurance coverage at all. \nThe last thing we should do here in the Senate is pass legislation that \nis just going to make that number rise.\n  But that is what will happen if we pass the Kennedy bill. The \nsupporters of this legislation claim that they want to give more rights \nto patients, that they want to protect Americans from the HMOs and the \nbig insurance companies.\n  But, instead, their bill is an empty promise that would actually give \nAmericans fewer rights. You can't have patient rights to fight your \ninsurer if you can't even afford to buy insurance in the first place.\n  Imposing more regulations and more requirements on employers and \ninsurers might have a gut appeal, but in the end it's not going to fix \nanything. It's only a placebo--a sugar pill--that turns out just to be \nan empty promise that won't cure this patient.\n  The next issue I want to address has to do with liability and \nlawsuits.\n  Everybody has heard the horror stories and a lot of Americans are \nbecoming more and more worried that they are not going to be able to \nget the care they need because their insurance company refuses to pay \nfor the treatment their doctor recommends.\n  When that happens, the question for patients becomes--what do you do \nif your insurer disagrees with your doctor?\n  The Kennedy bill's answer to this question is simple--it says sue \nyour HMO or your employer. Sue your insurance company. Go to court and \nlet the lawyers fight it out about your health care.\n  Under current law, patients can already sue their HMO in Federal \ncourt, and many of them are doing this. But, the Kennedy bill goes a \nstep further and sets up a litigation lottery by lifting the Federal \npreemption and making it easier for patients to sue in State courts \ntoo.\n  The bill's supporters make a big deal out of liability and say that \nlawsuits are the best way to hold HMOs and employers accountable for \ndecisions. And at first, suing your HMO--the big bad insurance \ncompany--might sound like a good idea, a sort of rough justice.\n  But I don't think anyone really believes that getting lawyers \ninvolved and going to court is the best way to obtain better medical \ncare.\n  If your insurance company denies you coverage for a specific problem \nor a specific treatment, and you need medical care quickly, suing is \nnot a very effective answer.\n  And I don't see how suing an employer about your health plan is going \nto help make things better. It's just going to make it more expensive, \nand give employers an incentive not to offer health care to their \nemployees.\n  If you do sue under the Kennedy bill, there is no telling how long \nyou are going to be in court, even if you can afford to pay a lawyer to \ntake the case. And going to court to get a judge to rule on medical \ndecisions isn't going to help a patient get help any more faster.\n  More lawsuits are only going to clog up the courts and increase legal \nbills, and in the end that is just going to drive up health care cost.\n  According to the General Accounting Office, it takes 33 months--\nalmost three years--to resolve the average medical malpractice claim.\n  Some take much longer, and most patients can't wait that long for \nmedical care.\n  Everyone knows that there are too many lawsuits in America. We hear \nit all the time. Most of the time in Congress, we are debating changes \nto the liability rules to cut down on litigation, to keep matters out \nof the courts.\n  For instance, we just passed the Y2K bill to give businesses and high \ntech firms more incentives to fix problems before they occur.\n  That's what we should do with health care. It just doesn't make sense \nto say we are going to improve health care by filing more suits in our \ncourts. Making it easier to sue insurance companies or employers is a \nknee-jerk, feel-good reaction that isn't going to help anybody get \nmedical care any faster.\n  On the other hand, the Republican bill says that if you are a patient \nand you think you're not getting a fair shake from your insurer, you \ncan immediately appeal for a speedy internal review of the case. No \nlawyers, no courtrooms, no legal games.\n  And, after that review, if you think you still aren't being treated \nfairly, you can demand a quick and timely independent review by outside \nexperts.\n  The Kennedy bill claims to have external reviews too. But the bill's \nprimary focus is on making it easier to sue, and that means the primary \narena for external reviews is going to be the courts.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, patients already can sue their HMOs \nin Federal court. They have that right today.\n  But instead of encouraging quick resolutions of disputes, the Kennedy \nbill encourages even more lawsuits in State courts. This will only \nshift scarce resources from the operating room to the courtroom, and \nthat's the last thing we need.\n  You can't sue yourself healthy.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I would like to tell my colleagues \nabout what happened in Kentucky when our State adopted a health care \nbill that increased regulations, took away patients' freedoms and \ninjected the government further into medical care. It's a living \nexample of what could happen is we passed the Kennedy bill.\n  a couple years ago our general assembly passed a Clinton-lite health \ncare bill. Back then we heard a lot of the same arguments that we do \nnow about the need for more regulations and more government involvement \nin health care.\n\n[[Page S8616]]\n\n  The proponents argued that the government had to step in to protect \npatients from insurers and to hold the line on costs.\n  Well guess what happened in Kentucky? We passed a big government \nhealth plan with all sorts of new mandates on insurers. The legislation \nwas designed to protect patients, and give them more rights by the \npower of government intervention.\n  What happened was predictable. The insurance companies fled Kentucky \nin droves. For a while there were only two insurers who would \nunderwrite individual health plans in our State--Blue Cross/Blue \nShield, and State Government. That's it. Everyone else left us high and \ndry.\n  The number of uninsured Kentuckians rose. Costs increased. Medical \ncare became more expensive and harder to get.\n  Sicne then, our State legislature has been backtracking and paring \nback those regulations and mandates. And guess what. Insurance is \nbecoming more available again and prices have stabilized.\n  That's the sort of situation we are looking at if the Kennedy plan \npasses. More regulation, more government in your personal life, higher \ncosts, and worse health care. It happened in Kentucky, and it can \nhappen in the rest of the country if we pass the Kennedy bill.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Kennedy bill. It's \nthe wrong prescription for America. We know that more regulation and \nmore government aren't the answer, but we have to keep fighting this \nbattle.\n  It wasn't the answer in the Clinton health bill, it wasn't the answer \nwhen we passed health care reform in Kentucky, and it's not the answer \ntoday.\n  If you want higher medical costs, if you want more uninsured \nAmericans, if you want more government rules and fewer choices for \nindividuals, then support the Kennedy bill.\n  But, Mr. President, that's not what we really need. We need more \naffordable, more available, health insurance. We need a reliable, fast, \nand fair system of reviews to keep insurance companies honest but we \ndon't need a flood of lawsuits. That is what the Republican bill \noffers.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, our personal health and the health of our \nloved ones is the most valuable thing we possess. Unfortunately, we \noften take good health for granted until tragedy strikes and the health \nor well-being of a family member is jeopardized by disease, accident, \nor the ills often associated with aging. This is when we fully \nappreciate the value of good health, as well as the importance of \naccess to quality health care.\n  When one of us or a loved one becomes ill, the obstacles of daily \nlife become insignificant in comparison to ensuring the best health \ncare services are available to ensure a full and speedy recovery. Our \npriority instantly becomes seeking and receiving the best possible care \nfrom qualified medical professionals.\n  Unfortunately, too many Americans feel powerless when faced with a \nhealth care crisis in their personal life. Many feel as if important, \nlife-altering decisions are being micro-managed by business people \nrather than medical professionals, and too many Americans believe they \nhave no access to quality care or cannot receive the necessary medical \ntreatment recommended by their personal physician.\n  Many Americans work hard and live on strict budgets so they can \nafford health insurance coverage for their family. Then, the moment \nthey need health care, they are confronted with obstacles limiting \nwhich services are available to them: confronted by frustrating \nbureaucratic hoops; and confronted by health plans that provide little, \nif any, opportunity for patients to redress grievances. This happens \ntoo often and can be attributed to several factors.\n  Our health care system is very complicated. It is comprised of \nthousands of acronyms and codes, and even has acronyms for acronyms. \nOur overly complex health insurance system intimidates and confuses \nmany Americans. Many of us fail to fully examine the coverage provided \nby our health plans until we become ill, and then it is difficult to \nunderstand the legalese of the plan documents. Another contributing \nfactor is the depersonalization of health care, which has become \nfocused more on profits than on proper patient care.\n  I am not embarrassed to admit that I find the complexity of the \nhealth system very disconcerting and am often overwhelmed by its \nintricacies. I can certainly relate to the majority of Americans who \nare overwhelmed by a system which does not meet their basic needs in a \nsimple, efficient and affordable manner.\n  Let me stress that I am not here today to bash managed care. I am not \nhere to condemn Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) and the \nservices they provide millions of Americans. I applaud the success of \nmanaged care in reining in skyrocketing health care costs, eradicating \nexcessive and costly health care expenditures, and significantly \nreducing unnecessary overuse of the system. Managed care has played a \ndirect role in reducing health care costs so that health care coverage \nis affordable for millions of hard-working American families.\n  However, while I appreciate the important contributions of managed \ncare, we must protect the rights of patients in our Nation's health \ncare system. Too many Americans feel trapped in a system which does not \nput their health care needs first. They believe that HMOs value a paper \ndollar more than they do a human life.\n  I know that my colleagues share my view, as do most managed care \ncompanies, that we cannot continue to ignore the rights of patients. \nFor far too long, we have allowed the health care reform debate to be \ndetermined by special interest groups. Democrats are perceived as \nadvocating certain principles and priorities for the trial lawyers, who \nare drooling over the prospect of unlimited and excessively costly \nlitigation against insurers. Meanwhile, Republicans are perceived as \nworking to protect the profit margin of the insurance companies and big \nbusiness. As a result, this critical debate is overwhelmed with \npartisan bickering, and millions of Americans are left with no \nrepresentation and inadequate health care.\n  It is time for all of us to put aside partisanship and the influence \nof special interests to work together for what is needed and wanted by \nour constituents--safe, quality, affordable health care.\n  I believe several fundamental health care principles must guide our \nhealth care debate:\n  First, we must put Americans in charge of their own health care. \nThere are too many people who feel overpowered and overwhelmed by the \ncurrent medical system. The current structure has created a caste \nsystem, and many patients believe they have become the serfs. Patients \nand their doctors should control their health care decisions, not HMO \nbureaucrats or political bureaucrats in Washington. Physicians \nutilizing the best medical data must make the medical decisions, not \ninsurance companies or trial lawyers. We need to put in place a \nbalanced system that allows managed care companies to reduce costs but \nalso reinvigorates the patient-doctor relationship which is essential \nfor receiving optimal care.\n  On the other hand, patients need to recognize that they cannot rely \nsolely on doctors to always provide the best medical options. We each \nhave a responsibility to learn how our medical plan operates, read \nabout the options available to us and our family before we become sick, \nand most importantly, become better consumers of health care. I don't \nthink many people would enter a salesroom or bank unprepared with the \npertinent information for purchasing a new car or home, but too many of \nus blindly enter into major decisions affecting our health without \ndoing any research. I know this is not easy, particularly with our very \ncomplex health care system and when so many of us barely find the time \nfor sleep between work and family responsibilities. But we must become \nbetter advocates for ourselves in this complex medical system.\n  To that end, the government should help Americans become educated \nconsumers by ensuring pertinent health care information is readily \naccessible. I have advocated and will continue to advocate a central \nweb site or other service which simplifies research for Americans as \nthey gather data on available health care options.\n\n[[Page S8617]]\n\n  Second, we must improve access to affordable health care. It is \nsimply disgraceful that 43 million Americans can not afford health care \ncoverage. This is the largest number of uninsured citizens in over a \ndecade, despite our strong economy and past actions to provide greater \naccess to medical care. We must continue building upon already enacted \nreforms by expanding medical savings accounts, offering flexible \nsavings accounts, providing full tax deductibility for self-employed \nhealth insurance costs, and allowing tax deductibility for long-term \ncare expenses.\n  We must stop wasting our limited resources on pork and wasteful \nspending projects, so that we have more money to assist Americans who \nare uninsured and can not afford to put money away in medical savings \naccounts or will not be able to benefit from a tax credit. We should \nprovide more funding for our nation's community health centers which \nare a tremendous resource in helping millions of Americans gain access \nto health care who would otherwise go without. Community health centers \nhave instituted a sliding fee schedule which allows people to \ncontribute what they can afford and still receive health benefits. We \nshould strengthen and expand these successful centers throughout our \ncountry.\n  In addition, our tax code impedes a competitive market by prohibiting \nmany Americans from truly being health care consumers. Many people lack \npurchasing power and are dependent on their employers for health care \ncoverage. Tax benefits should not be limited for health care purchased \nonly by big businesses. We should develop a method for providing the \nsame tax benefits to individuals and families.\n  Third, Americans must have a choice of doctors to meet their health \ncare needs. Today, too many women cannot go directly to an obstetrician \nor gynecologist for medical care. Instead, they are forced to waste \nvaluable time seeking a perfunctory referral from a ``gatekeeper'' \ndoctor before they can go directly to their OB/GYN. The same is true \nfor children. Mothers and fathers should be allowed to take their \nchildren directly to a pediatrician. Instead, the current system forces \nthem to go through a gatekeeper for referral. Women and children must \nbe given the opportunity to seek care directly from the trained \nprofessionals best suited to address their unique health needs.\n  Additionally, Americans should be free to choose their doctors, \nincluding specialists, if they are willing to bear the additional costs \nwhich may accompany this freedom. People should be able to enroll in a \npoint-of-service plan with access to a multitude of physicians, rather \nthan be limited to an HMO which restricts freedom of choice in doctors.\n  Fourth, we must guarantee access to emergency care. If a man or woman \nin Phoenix, Arizona fears they are having a heart attack, they should \nnot be required to seek approval from their managed care company prior \nto calling an ambulance and going to an emergency room. Any bill we \npass must guarantee care in an emergency room without prior approval \nfrom an HMO if the person believes that it is an emergency situation.\n  Fifth, we must ensure continuity of care. Individuals who are \npregnant, terminally ill, or institutionalized should be given special \nconsideration so that their necessary care is not interrupted abruptly \nif their employer changes health plans.\n  Sixth, doctors must be able to communicate openly and fully with \ntheir patients. Today, some doctors are prevented by HMOs from openly \ndiscussing all medical treatments available to a patient. This is \nunconscionable. HMOs must not be allowed to stop doctors from openly \ndiscussing all possible care available, even if the procedures are not \ncovered by the HMO. A doctor's loyalty must be to the patient and not \nan HMO's bottom line.\n  Seventh, a free and fair grievance process must be available in the \nevent an HMO denies medical care. A mother should have options when she \nis told her son or daughter's cancer treatment is not necessary and \nwill not be covered by her insurance. We can not support a system that \nleaves that mother powerless against corporate health care. She must \nhave access to both internal and external appeals processes which are \nfair and readily available and which use neutral experts who are not \nselected, paid, or otherwise beholden to the HMO. In life-threatening \ncases, there must be an expedited process.\n  Finally, once all options to receive necessary medical care have been \nexhausted, including an external appeals process, and that care has not \nbeen appropriately provided, every American should have the right to \nseek reasonable relief in the courts. I find it incredible that HMOs \nand their employees are able to avoid responsibility for negligent or \nharmful medical care. Americans covered by ERISA health plans should \nhave the same right of redress in the courts as those who are enrolled \nin non-ERISA plans if they are unable to receive a fair resolution \nthrough an unbiased appeals process. We must ensure that patients \nreceive the benefits for which they have paid and rightfully deserve. \nWe must also ensure that unscrupulous health plans not go unpunished \nwhen they act negligently, resulting in harm to a patient.\n  I drafted a compromise on this issue which would be fair to patients \nand HMOs and would not cause excessive and costly lawsuits. The \nproposal, which is filed as amendment number 1246, would require \npatients to go through both the internal and external appeal processes \nif they were unsatisfied with care or decisions of their HMO. Once the \nappeal process reached a decision, they could accept the decision, or \nif they felt they still had not been treated fairly, they could go to \nthe courts. In court, they could receive compensatory damages with a \ncap of $250,000 on non-economic damages.\n  I believe this is a fair and reasonable compromise which would allow \npatients to be compensated, but eliminates the potential for \nextravagant awards that could drive up the cost of health care. \nUnfortunately, I was precluded from calling up this amendment and \nanother amendment which would have protected the rights of children \nborn with birth defects (amendment number 1247) because of the \nstringent controls established by the Leadership for debate on this \nbill.\n  It is unfortunate that this health care reform debate has been \ncontrolled by special interest groups on both sides and mired in \npartisan political maneuvering. This has become a debate--not about \nproviding affordable access to quality health care for all Americans--\nbut a debate about preserving the positions of competing special \ninterests. It has become a debate about the interests of trial lawyers \nversus the interests of insurance companies--not the interests of \npatients. No reasonable compromise has been offered on either side to \nresolve issues like liability, choice, access, and cost. Instead, we \nare voting on competing proposals at the extremes.\n  This is not a debate. It is a contest--a contest between parties and \nspecial interests. And it is a contest that no one--not Republicans, \nnot Democrats, certainly not the American people--wins, except, of \ncourse, the special interests who are only concerned about their \nfinancial well-being, rather than the physical or financial well-being \nof every American. It is a shame that this body is so controlled by \nspecial interests that we cannot even put the health of the American \npeople ahead of politics.\n  I cosponsored the original Republican Patients' Bill of Rights, S. \n326. And despite the concerted efforts of the trial lawyers and the \ninsurance companies and those more interested in partisan politics than \nthe health of the American people, we have succeeded in adopting some \nmuch-needed improvements to the original bill. For example, the \nexternal appeal process has been made more independent of the influence \nof the insurance companies; a small step has been taken toward \nrequiring HMOs to pay for an individual's participation in a clinical \ntrial; it requires expanded access to specialists and emergency medical \ncare; and it mandates extended hospital care following mastectomies and \nrelated surgeries. These improvements are a step in the right \ndirection--toward putting the needs of patients first.\n  Because of these changes, I am reluctantly supporting final passage \nof this legislation. I am doing this because I believe it is important \nto move forward and enact legislation to implement\n\n[[Page S8618]]\n\nmuch-needed health care reform. The House will soon take up health care \nreform, and I hope they will pass a reasonable health care reform bill \nwhich honestly puts the needs of patients first. We can then work for a \npractical and fair compromise during conference.\n  I want to put my colleagues on notice that, if a conference agreement \ncomes back to the Senate that does not meet the standard of putting \npatients first, then I will have to oppose that legislation. This is \ntoo important an issue to allow the influence of special interests to \nprevent us from doing what is right for all Americans.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I call on the chairman of the HELP \nCommittee, Senator Jeffords, for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will make my full statement after the \nvote, but this bill gives new consumer protections to the 48 million \nAmericans in self-insured plans that the States are unable to protect. \nThis bill creates a new, binding, internal/external appeals process for \n124 million Americans. This bill also protects 140 million Americans \nfrom having their predictive genetic information used to deny them \nhealth insurance coverage, and it expands access to health insurance \nthrough increasing affordability and choice of health care options.\n  As we prepared this legislation, we had three goals in mind. First, \nto give families the protections they want and need; second, to ensure \nthat medical decisions are made by physicians in consultation with \ntheir patients; and finally, to keep the cost of this legislation low \nso it does not displace anyone from being able to get health care \ncoverage.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights was not crafted easily and it was not \ncrafted hastily. This legislation is a result of over 2 years of work \nby the Senate HELP Committee. In March of 1997, I chaired the first of \n17 hearings on the topic of improving health care quality. In April of \n1998, I chaired a committee field hearing at Fletcher Allen Hospital, \nin Burlington, VT. Numerous leaders from the Vermont medical profession \nand Vermont insurance regulators pointed out the State of Vermont \nalready has passed 22 patient protections, including direct access to \nOB/GYNs and a ban on gag rules and a continuity of health care \nprovision. Vermont's most pressing need, according to these State \nproviders, was to enact protections for those individuals in self-\nfunded plans that the States could not protect.\n  The Vermont health providers also stressed their strong concern that \nany Federal health care legislation not increase costs. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that the Kennedy proposal would \nhave raised health insurance premiums by 6.1 percent. A study \ncommissioned by the AFL-CIO concluded that such an increase would cause \n1.8 million Americans to lose their health insurance. This would mean \napproximately 4,000 Vermonters would lose their health insurance. The \nVermonter who could still afford health insurance would have to pay an \nadditional $328 a year for family coverage.\n  During the battles over the last few weeks, we have heard a great \ndeal of biting, political rhetoric. But we cannot forget that the real \nissue is to give Americans the protections they want and need in a \npackage they can afford and that we can enact. We must pass this bill.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time remains for both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. For the majority, 11 minutes 20 seconds, and \n13 minutes 1 second to the Democratic side.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania, also \na very strong contributor to the membership of our task force.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank Senator Nickles for his \noutstanding leadership on this task force. We would not be where we are \ntoday, passing what I believe is a very useful and precise way to \nrespond to a very complicated problem. Senator Nickles shepherded this \ntask force with great skill. He deserves a great amount of the credit \nfor what is being accomplished today.\n  With respect to the comments that this bill is dead, it is not going \nanywhere, the President is going to veto it, I would say this: Of all \nthe criticism I heard about the Republican bill, most of it is it just \ndoes not go far enough. It is not that what we are doing is not right \nor it is not in the right direction; it just does not do enough.\n  I do not know about you, but I have watched Congress for a long time. \nI have seen a lot of things happen in this institution, where sometimes \nit is good just to do something in the right direction, that we all \nagree is in the right direction. I do not think anyone is saying what \nyou are doing is absolutely antithetical to good health care, you say \ninternal/external--no. We need more of that, we need a tougher one, but \nnot to say what we are doing is bad. It just is not enough. I am \nhopeful people will say doing something that is good should not be the \nenemy of what some believe is the best.\n  So I am hopeful we can get together, the House has to act, they are \ngoing to pass a different bill, and then we can sit down with the \nPresident and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle and do \nsomething that is good. Let's do something on which we can agree. Let's \ndo something that can move the ball forward and work together so we can \ngo out and say: We, in fact, did protect patients. We did improve the \nquality of health care. Maybe not as much as some would suggest we \ncould--I differ with that--but we did do something positive. We did \nimprove access to health insurance. We did not blow a hole and increase \ncosts dramatically to drive people out from health coverage. That is \nwhat we need to do, to move forward and do something good.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nMissouri, Mr. Ashcroft.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, we have a great opportunity, which we \nwill capitalize on this evening, by voting for this measure which has \nbeen the result of hard work by a team and task force of individuals \ndedicated to improving the health care of Americans and access to \nhealth care. I am grateful for it. I totally reject the notion that \nthis is a victory for the status quo. One person can make this a \nvictory for the status quo. Bill Clinton can. He could veto this. I do \nnot believe we should think that he will. I believe we should continue \nto work and present him with this great opportunity to lift the status \nof health care of Americans.\n  One area I was concerned was that people ought to get the right \ntreatment from HMOs and that, if they have a disagreement with an HMO, \nthey ought to be able to settle that disagreement in a way that gets \nthem treatment. So an appeals process was established for an internal \nappeal by the patient and an external appeal.\n  I sought to improve the bill. It did not include this provision, but \nI offered an amendment which said, if the external appeal agreed with \nthe patient and said that the patient deserved the treatment and \nordered the HMO to do it, and if the HMO would not provide the \ntreatment--we have amended this bill now so the person is eligible to \ngo and get the treatment elsewhere and charge the HMO, and the HMO that \nwrongfully refused the treatment to the patient has to give a $10,000 \npenalty payment to the patient.\n  This really gives the patient what the patient needs, health care. \nThe Democratic proposal sends the patient to court. How disappointed \nwould you be, as a person, if you called for an ambulance and you found \nthem taking you to the court instead of to the hospital?\n  We do not want to end up with a dead relative and a good law case. We \nwant to end up with good treatment, and that is what this bill will do. \nIt has a strong set of enforcement provisions to respect the rights of \nindividuals, and if the HMO fails to comply with that enforcement, we \nsend the people to the hospital, not to the courtroom.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time? The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise this evening with great regret, regret that we \nhave\n\n[[Page S8619]]\n\nnot done what we should have done to protect the children of America \nwho are in a managed care plan. The bill before us that we will vote \nupon is a litany of missed opportunities and missed statements with \nrespect to the status of children in managed care. For example, access \nto pediatricians. They are classified as specialists, so they cannot be \nautomatically the primary care provider to children. Frankly, most \nAmericans believe that is exactly who they are.\n  Second, there is no guaranteed access to pediatric specialists. We \nhave language in this Republican proposal that talks about age-\nappropriate specialists. That is language written by HMO lawyers to \nensure that they can magically transform an adult specialist, who might \nhave seen a child at 1 year or 2 years, into an age-appropriate \nspecialist, just as they do today.\n  We have a situation in which we have not provided for expedited \ninternal and external appeals based upon developmental needs of a \nchild. Children are different from adults. They have conditions for \nwhich an adult could wait months and months and months for adequate \ncare, but in a child they become critical because the child's \ndevelopment is critical. These are shortcomings that will leave the \nchildren of America shortchanged.\n  We can and must do more. We could have done more, and we could have \ngiven all the individuals in managed care the right at least to go to \nconsumer assistance centers, ombudsman programs, so they could have \ntheir questions resolved, and we pushed that aside.\n  Frankly, the greatest disappointment I have is that we heard a lot of \ndiscussion this evening and the last few days about the cost of this \nbill. We could give all these protections to children, every item in \nthe Democratic proposal, and the cost would be negligible, because one \nof the good news issues is that children are generally healthy. But for \nthose chronically ill children, it would have made all the difference \nin the world.\n  Today is not the day we are helping the children of America in \nmanaged care, but I hope we will some day, and that day will come, and \nit must come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, for the last 2 years, Democrats have \nworked tirelessly for this moment. We have been guided by a very simple \ngoal. That goal is to protect the rights of 160 million Americans who \nhave private health insurance. Democrats have tried to answer the \nquestion: What should motivate that system, money or medicine? What \nshould be the crux of our health care system? Do we put a money screen \non decisions, or do we put a medical screen on decisions? We concluded \nthat when it comes to someone's life, someone's health, the answer to \nthat question is very simple.\n  Democrats have outlined six basic principles. The first is that all \n160 million Americans ought to be covered by patient protections. We \noffered an amendment to ensure that all 160 million Americans would be \ncovered, and our Republican colleagues defeated it.\n  The second principle is to ensure we provide access to needed care \nregardless of circumstances: access to qualified specialists, real \naccess to emergency rooms, access to lifesaving treatments and drugs, \naccess to quality care that is unique to America in some cases. We \noffered amendments to provide these protections, and our Republican \ncolleagues defeated them.\n\n  The third principle is simply this: That doctors ought to make \nmedical decisions. Not accountants, not bureaucrats, not people with \ngreen eyeshades who make monetary decisions instead of medical ones. \nLet doctors make those decisions. We offered an amendment, and our \nRepublican colleagues defeated it.\n  The fourth principle is quite simple to understand, but extremely \nimportant to millions of Americans. Let us, above everything else, \nprotect the doctor-patient relationship. Let us ensure that all doctors \ncan talk about all medical options with their patients when they are \nfacing critical medical decisions. Let us ensure that we protect \ndoctors from retaliation by managed care companies. And let us ensure \nthat chronically ill patients get to keep their doctors.\n  Mr. President, that is not too much to ask. When we talk about \nrights, basic rights in this country, what could be more basic than \nthat? We offered an amendment, and our Republican colleagues defeated \nit.\n  The fifth principle is one we also feel strongly about, and that is \naccountability. I have heard many of our Republican colleagues say: You \nshould not have to go to court to get your health care; the important \nthing is getting the care you need.\n  We agree with that, and we provide a strong, independent appeals \nprocess. But all too often, HMOs make decisions that are wrong. And all \ntoo often, patients are left with absolutely no recourse. We simply \nbelieve that when this happens, when an HMO or an insurance company \nmakes the wrong decision, you ought to have some recourse. You ought to \nbe able to hold them accountable. You can with a doctor. You can with a \nhospital. Why not with an insurance company?\n  Finally, I have never been more proud of our women Senators, and I \nhave never been more convinced that we need more women in the Senate \nthan I am tonight, because they have enlightened us, Mr. President, in \nour caucus and on the floor. They have sensitized us to women's issues \nunlike anything I have ever heard before. There isn't a man in the \nSenate who can tell us what they told us, with the eloquence, with the \npassion, with the feeling. They told us there are special needs of \nwomen that just are not being addressed. If we are going to make this \nsystem work better for millions of Americans, we ought to understand \nthat. So we offered an amendment to ensure that women's needs are \nprotected, and our Republican colleagues defeated it.\n  Tonight, I agree with those who have said we missed a golden \nopportunity to pass a real Patients' Bill of Rights. We have offered \nclear choices. The majority has opposed us every step of the way. The \nmajority leader said, let's work together, work with us. We have made \nevery effort to work with our colleagues, but the only thing we have \ngotten back is what I believe the Republican bill truly stands for when \nit calls itself HMO reform. In my view, HMO stands for ``half measures \nonly.'' That is all we have gotten--half measures. To those who say, \nisn't this just a little bit better? my answer is no. In all sincerity, \nI believe we will actually lower the standard when we pass this bill \ntonight. We have not made progress; we have moved backward.\n  I am always amused, frankly, that our Republican colleagues turn to \ntaxes anytime they want to fix a problem. I am surprised there is not a \ntax break for observing the speed limit. Tonight, there is another $13 \nbillion bill that we will be voting on, most of which is a tax break. I \nsupport meaningful tax reform, targeted especially to working families. \nBut when we talk about a Patients' Bill of Rights, are we really \ntalking about the need for a tax break, or a break from the kind of \noppression that many people feel with their insurance and managed care \ncompanies?\n  I also regret the fact that we did not have an opportunity to debate \nthe bipartisan bill. I wish we could have had a good debate on the \nGraham-Chafee bill. I wish we could have at least moved forward with \nthat piece of legislation. I believe there would have been 45 \nDemocratic votes for that bill tonight. The problem is, as I understand \nit, there are only three on the Republican side.\n  Even if we offered a bipartisan bill, cosponsored by two very \nprominent Members of our Senate tonight, we would only have the same 48 \nvotes we had on almost every single amendment we offered.\n  The President will veto this bill because he and we know we can do \nbetter than this, that we should not lower the standard. We should do \nfar more to ensure that we cover all patients, all 160 million. \nUltimately, I believe, as Senator Kennedy noted, we will pass a \ncomprehensive Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  This afternoon I was reminded again of how critical this is to real \npeople. Throughout this debate, what meant most to me is the experience \nI have had in talking to real people whose lives have been affected by \nmanaged care companies, whose lives have been directly, and in some \ncases, negatively affected by their decisions.\n\n[[Page S8620]]\n\n  Justin Dart, a full-fledged lifelong Republican was out on the lawn \nthis afternoon. He was there in his wheelchair, surrounded by medical \nequipment needed to function and maintain his health. He has \nexperienced medical care. He has benefited from it, and, unfortunately, \nas he related again today, he has been disappointed by it.\n  In the most passionate and most eloquent way he could say it, with \nhis lips quivering, speaking to all of us, as he urged the Senate to do \nthe right thing tonight, he said: ``I'll give my life for my country, \nbut I won't give it to an insurance company.''\n  Too many people have given their good health, and in some cases their \nlives, because decisions have been made by insurance companies for the \nwrong reasons. We are going to fix that. I am hopeful, as others have \nexpressed, we can do better, we can find a way to ensure that all \nAmericans are going to be protected, as we know they should be. We \nshould not give up until we know we have done the job right.\n  Mr. President, over the past three-and-a-half days, we have finally \nhad the opportunity to have a good debate on several critical issues \naffecting patients' rights. Senate Democrats--and the patients of \nAmerica--have waited a long time for it. Because of limited time, other \ncritical issues remain to be debated. Still, we are glad the Senate has \nspent most of this week debating two dramatically different approaches \nto patients' rights. The American people deserve to understand the \ndifferences. They are important.\n  Mr. President, the Senate has indeed missed a golden opportunity to \npass a real Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Instead, the Republican majority is handing the insurance industry \nits version of HMO reform: Half Measures Only.\n  On critical issues, we gave our colleagues a choice: guaranteed \npatient access to the closest emergency room versus ambiguous \nassurances of limited emergency care; access to clinical trials for all \nlife-threatening and disabling diseases versus limited clinical trials \nonly for cancer; medical determinations made by doctors and other \nhealth professionals versus decisions made by HMO accountants; the \nright to hold HMOs accountable for their decisions that harm or kill \npatients versus the right to live with whatever bad decisions an HMO \nmight make; and, of course, the extension of basic rights to all \nprivately insured Americans versus the exclusion of over 100 million \nAmericans.\n  The list goes on.\n  All that was necessary on the Senate's part was to listen to the \ndoctors and nurses and other health professionals. To listen to the \nAmerican people. Unfortunately, a majority of the Senate chose to \nignore those voices and listen instead to the industry that stands to \ncontinue to profit from our failure to provide meaningful patient \nprotections. The industry that opposes even minimal protections and any \nmeans of enforcing them.\n\n  Frankly, we are astounded. Yes, we were told repeatedly by Senator \nNickles and Senator Gramm and Senator Frist that this would happen. \nThat their plan was simply to block this legislation from ever coming \nto the Senate floor, since they did not want to be in a position of \nhaving to defend an indefensible position. When that plan failed, they \nmade it clear their strategy was focused on political cover instead of \nmeaningful reforms. (That cynical strategy will ultimately fail, too.)\n  Still, we held out hope--that reason would win out in the end. That \nthe overwhelming public support for our modest reforms --support that \nknows no partisan boundaries outside of Washington, DC--would influence \nat least a handful of Senate Republicans. We are astounded that it did \nnot--that there are not five Republican senators willing to challenge \ntheir leadership in order to please over 80% of the American people.\n  Maybe some of them just didn't read the two bills. The other day, \nSenator Gramm again invoked the name of his ``mama'' and said he wants \nher to be able to call her doctor instead of a bureaucrat when she gets \nsick. Well, we agree. But, given his concern, Senator Gramm and the \nvast majority of his Republican colleagues are supporting the wrong \nlegislation.\n  It is the Democratic bill that protects patients' rights to \ncommunicate directly with their doctor and make medical decisions with \ntheir doctor--without inappropriate interference from a nameless, \nfaceless HMO accountant.\n  Senator Gramm and other opponents argue: ``The Democratic bill is a \nstep toward government-run health care.''\n  That charge is simply untrue--under our bill, health care \nprofessionals, not the government, would make decisions.\n  Ours is not a step toward government-run health care; it's a step \naway from HMO accountant-run health care.\n  The insurance industry's TV ads opposing the Democratic bill warn \nthat people get hurt ``when politicians play doctor.'' Again, that is \nthe height of irony.\n  Senate Democrats are not playing doctor. Under the current system, \nand under the Republican bill, it is HMO accountants who are playing \ndoctor, denying the real doctors the ability to implement medically \nsound decisions. And real people are getting hurt every day.\n  Let's be clear--we're not opposed to managed care.\n  The theory of managed care--that a primary care physician and health \nnetwork will understand the whole patient and manage his or her care to \nimprove patient health--is a good one. But all too often that theory \nhas been corrupted in practice.\n  Too often, instead of managed care, we have managed costs.\n  The Hippocratic Oath is not about saving money; it's about saving \nlives. And while we should take reasonable actions to curb health care \ncosts, we cannot do it at the expense of Americans' health. \nFurthermore, any costs associated with the Democratic bill would be \nminimal--and nonexistent for HMOs that already provide the medical \nservices they should.\n  The United States has the best health care in the world--the best \ndoctors, nurses, facilities, and equipment. But what good is the best \nhealth care in the world if insurance company accountants block your \naccess to it?\n\n  Over the course of the last several days, my Republican colleagues \nhave rejected every Democratic proposal to improve Americans' access to \nbetter health care. In one twist, they rejected our proposal to protect \nwomen from being discharged from the hospital too soon after breast \ncancer surgery, only to turn around the next day and take credit for \nthat proposal at the same time they denied those same breast cancer \nvictims--and other women and men--access to clinical trials for new, \nlife-saving treatments.\n  It has been a pattern all week: reject the real patient protections, \nand, in the specific cases where there's enough of a public outcry, \noffer up a half-measure that pretends to solve one problem at the \nexpense of another. We saw the same tactic on the juvenile crime bill, \nwhen Republicans bent over backwards to avoid any meaningful gun \nlegislation. Their operating principle: block the real solution and \ntake credit for a false one.\n  Perhaps the most egregious and disheartening example of hypocrisy is \nthe majority's approach to determining which Americans will benefit \nfrom the half-measures they are willing to support. Democrats believe \nall 161 million privately insured Americans should be guaranteed a \nnational floor of patients' rights. We are talking about the basic \nrights of American patients. Two people living on the same street--\npossibly insured by the very same company--should not have two \ndifferent sets of ``basic rights'' simply because they work for \ndifferent employers.\n  Under the Republican bill, only 48 million Americans--those in self-\nfunded plans--are covered by the vast majority of their protections. \nThey exclude over 100 million Americans from their so-called \nprotections.\n  The majority has argued that this exclusion is necessary to satisfy \none of their core principles: that the states should be left to \nregulate HMOs. In the Nickles amendment striking the Kennedy amendment \nto cover all privately insured Americans, the majority stated, ``It \nwould be inappropriate to set federal health insurance standards. . . . \nOne size does not fit all, and what may be appropriate for one State \nmay not be necessary in another.'' That amendment passed Tuesday, by a \nlargely party-line vote.\n  So the majority established that as its core principle, one that \noverrides\n\n[[Page S8621]]\n\nthe need to provide all Americans basic health care rights. Yet listen \nto the core principle laid out in the Snowe amendment I mentioned \nearlier. (Curiously, the Snowe amendment, which every Republican \nsenator supported, extended its protections to all privately insured \nwomen.)\n  In the Snowe amendment, the majority stated a ``core principle'' \ndiametrically opposed to the core principle of the Nickles amendment: \n``In order to provide for uniform treatment of health care providers \nand patients among the States, it is necessary to cover health plans \noperating in 1 State as well as health plans operating among the \nseveral States.'' That amendment passed Wednesday at 1:23 pm.\n  Two-and-a-half hours later, the Republican majority reversed itself \nonce again. They voted against a Democratic amendment to expand \ncoverage to all privately insured Americans, regardless of their \ncondition or disease--not just women with breast cancer. The whole idea \nbehind a comprehensive Patients' Bill of Rights is that it will cover \nall people and all diseases, not simply those that get the most media \ncoverage.\n\n  Some of my colleagues seem to have two contradictory sets of core \nprinciples on the same issue on the same day. And, at the end of the \nday, the result is that, for all but one disease, the majority has \nchosen to deny more than 100 million Americans any protections at all.\n  It's a cynical, and destructive, philosophy. The American people are \nsure to reject it, for they understand this issue far better than some \npoliticians seem to think. How could they not understand? Every \nAmerican knows someone who has been denied timely, necessary treatment \nby an HMO that put costs above patient care.\n  Our bill is a modest one. It would guarantee American patients a \nminimum level of protection to ensure timely access to quality health \ncare. That's what Americans expect when they buy health insurance, and \nthat's the least they deserve.\n  I am disappointed that, this week, America's patients were denied \nthat minimal protection. But I can assure them that the fight for their \nrights is far from over. Senate Democrats--and maybe even a few brave \nRepublicans--are committed to a real Patients' Bill of Rights, and it \nwill pass, whether it's next week, next year, or next Congress. I \nguarantee it.\n  Mr. President, I also want to take a moment to thank some of the \nmultitudes of people who have fought so hard for a real Patients' Bill \nof Rights and who are committed to that fight until we succeed.\n  I thank Senator Kennedy. I must say, I do not know if we have a more \npassionate, more articulate, more aggressive defender for working \npeople in this country than we have in Ted Kennedy. He is an \ninspiration. We all are deeply indebted once more for the leadership he \nhas provided not only in our caucus but in the Senate on this \nextraordinarily important issue. I am proud to have worked with him to \ndevelop S. 6. Also, he, like many others, has been tireless on the \nfloor this week, and I commend him for doing such a good job for our \nentire caucus.\n  I thank my assistant Democratic leader whose presence on the floor \nhas just been phenomenal. I do not know how I could do what I do were \nit not for the fact that he is always there--always there.\n  I thank my caucus. I do not know that I have ever been more proud of \nthe caucus than I am tonight for their participation, for their \nleadership, for their willingness to roll up their sleeves to do their \nhomework, to come to the floor and debate, as they did so aggressively \nall week. In one way or another, every member of our caucus has \ncontributed to this debate and to the two-year effort to make it \npossible. More of them than I could name right now have contributed \nenormously, often selflessly. Our caucus has never been more unified. \nWe believe in patients' rights, and we are committed to fight for them.\n  So, I thank every Democratic senator. I say to each of you, it truly \nwould not have been possible without you.\n  I thank, as well, the majority leader for allowing this debate, and \nthe assistant Republican leader. This debate happened because they \nagreed to schedule it. It would not have happened were it not for that \nagreement, and I am grateful for that.\n  I thank Senator Frist for his involvement because of his unique \nexperience in life.\n  A special thanks goes to the more than 200 organizations representing \ndoctors, nurses, and other health care providers as well as consumer \ngroups, that have supported our bill. They pulled out all the stops \nthey could, with whatever limited resources they had, to ensure that \nthey were part of this American Democratic system. Again, I cannot name \nthem all. But their shared commitment to a comprehensive, meaningful \nPatients' Bill of Rights has been critical to this process. And I say \nto each of them, don't be disheartened by today's loss. As I said \nbefore, we will ultimately prevail, and patients will ultimately be \nprotected.\n  I should send that same message to Justin Dart and all the men, \nwomen, and children who have shared their stories--often painful \nstories--with us. This debate could not have been held were it not for \nthe fact that they put meaning to this debate in ways that only they \ncan. Their stories remind us that this is not a theoretical debate. It \nis a real choice affecting real people who have suffered and will \ncontinue to suffer in the absence of meaningful reforms. We thank you, \nand we will continue the fight.\n  Last, I want to thank the people who are too often thanked last, the \nstaff--the staff in every office who have worked in various ways to \nensure our long struggle led to a real floor debate.\n  Senator Kennedy's staff deserves special recognition. I'm sure there \nwere many others, but I want to recognize four of them in particular: \nMichael Myers, David Nexon, Cybele Bjorklund, and Jim Manley. As \nalways, they are as amazing as their boss. They have been absolutely \nessential to the effort.\n  Finally, I want to thank my own staff--both those in my own office \nand those throughout the Leadership Committees. At the risk of leaving \nsomeone out, I'm going to try to name most of them. Few people know how \nhard they work, and their commitment to service and to this cause of \npatients' rights is unsurpassed.\n  From my staff, I want to thank especially: Jane Loewenson, Elizabeth \nHargrave, Shelly Ten Napel, Pete Rouse, Laura Petrou, Bill Corr, Mark \nPatterson, Ranit Schmelzer, Molly Rowley, Marc Kimball, Chris Bois, and \nElizabeth Lietz.\n  From the Floor Staff, I thank Marty Paone, Lula Davis, Gary Myrick, \nand Paul Brown. We are very lucky, as Republicans and Democrats, to \nhave the floor staff that we do. We owe them a big debt of gratitude, \nbecause without them we could not do what we do.\n  From the Leadership Committees, my special thanks to: Bonnie Hogue, \nCaroline Chambers, Chuck Cooper, Maryam Moezzi, Tim Mitchell, Jodi \nGrant, Nicole Bennett, Maria Meier, Alexis King, Jamie Houton, Andy \nDavis, Mary Helen Fuller, Marguerite Beck-Rex, Brian Barrie, Kobye \nNoel, Katherine Moore, Nate Ackerman, Rick Singer, Clare Flood, Adriana \nSurfas, Kevin Kelleher, Brian Jones, Russell Gordon, Robyn Altman, \nJeremy Dorin, Paige Smith, Chris Casey, Jeff Hecker, and Toby Hayman.\n  So tonight, Mr. President, the fight goes on. I am optimistic that in \nthe end we will have the opportunity to debate, once more, how we can \nresolve this issue, how we can stick to those six principles, how we \ncan ensure that this American health system, which is so good in so \nmany ways, can be made better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time is left on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes 47 seconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. First, I compliment my colleague and friend, Senator \nDaschle--this has been a good debate--as well as Senator Reid and \nSenator Kennedy. We have had a good debate, good discussion of the \nissue. We have never had a cross word. We have had some good debate, \nexcited debate.\n  I want to call on an additional couple members of our task force--\nfirst Senator Collins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n[[Page S8622]]\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I begin by expressing my appreciation to Senator Nickles and my other \ncolleagues on the health task force. We have labored hard during the \npast year and a half, and I am very proud of the legislation we \nintroduced.\n  I also thank our staff, particularly Priscilla Hanley on my staff who \nhas worked night and day during the debate.\n  We are on the verge of passing landmark legislation that will expand \naccess to health care, that will hold HMOs accountable for providing \nthe care that they have promised, and that will improve the quality of \nhealth care in this country.\n  I am particularly pleased that the final bill contains provisions I \noffered to provide a tax deduction for the purchase of long-term care \ninsurance, to ensure that women have direct access to OB/GYNs without \nhaving to go through a gatekeeper, to guarantee that a terminally ill \npatient is able to keep his or her doctor even if that doctor has left \nthe HMO network, and to expand patient access to a variety of health \ncare providers.\n  At the heart of this bill is the internal and external appeals \nprocess that will provide coverage and protections to everyone in all \nemployer-sponsored health plans. This appeals process will ensure that \nconsumers receive the care they have been promised up front, before \nharm is done, and without having to hire an expensive lawyer and resort \nto a lawsuit in order to get the care they need.\n  That is the heart of this bill. We have worked hard to provide these \nkinds of protections which will ensure that people do get the treatment \nthey need when they need it--not damages years later in a courtroom.\n  I thank the assistant majority leader for the time.\n  I am proud to be a supporter of this important legislation.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank the Senator from Maine for her outstanding \nleadership. I also thank the Senator from Missouri who mentioned a few \nof the changes he made in the appeals process that I hope my colleagues \nlistened to. He made this a much better bill. I thank my colleague.\n  When you look at the appeals process that Senator Ashcroft has \nexplained and Senator Frist has explained, no one can say this isn't a \nvery substantive bill that applies to all employer-sponsored plans.\n  Next, Mr. President, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I just want to openly thank Members on both \nsides of the aisle. This has been a very challenging bill. Although I \nthink it is going to be more satisfactory to this side of the aisle \nthan the other side, it is a bill that I think we can all, after \ntonight, go home, think about, talk to our constituents about, and \nrecognize that we have accomplished exactly what at least I wanted to \naccomplish; and that is, as I said 4 days ago when this first started, \nto keep the patient at the center of all of this debate--not special \ninterests and not the rhetoric that goes back and forth, but how we can \nultimately come up with a bill that helps patients.\n  We have strong patient protections. We have addressed quality head on \nand hit it with internal, external review. It has been strengthened \nfrom both sides of the aisle. It has been strengthened by \nrecommendations that we have had through our staff and working \ntogether.\n  If we look at the access provisions, they are very strong, the \nmedical savings accounts, the full deductibility for the self-employed, \nall of which we have done, the gag clauses, the access to specialists, \ndirect access to obstetricians, what we have accomplished in terms of \nemergency room access, continuity of care. If we put it altogether, it \ncomes back to the benefit of the patients, smack-dab at the heart.\n  When people ask me all the time, what can you do as a Senator to \nreally help individual people, it comes down to this bill, I believe, a \nfirst step.\n  Our bill does take medical decisions out of the hands of a huge HMO \nbureaucracy and puts them back to that very special relationship, one I \nhave been blessed to participate in again and again, that special \nrelationship of the doctor-physician, the provider and the patients, \nwho entrust their lives to you, their lives to you, their health care, \ntheir quality of life, their ability to see, to walk, to have that \nheart keep beating. That is entrusted to you. We have benefited that. \nWe have enriched that. We have made that better. That is what we have \naccomplished tonight.\n  We have done it without markedly increasing cost because we all know, \nwhen cost goes up, out of control, it drives premiums up and access \nfalls, and the number of uninsured are important.\n  I appreciate the support.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 28 seconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank all of my colleagues and, \nfrankly, the entire Senate for a very good debate.\n  I believe we came up with a very good bill. I think we passed a bill \nthat will improve health care quality. We passed a bill for anybody in \nAmerica who has an employer-sponsored plan to have an appeal, an appeal \nthat will be decided by doctors, despite some of the advertisements we \nhave seen, appeals that are decided by experts, by doctors. That is \nbinding and that is real. So I hope that maybe some of the rhetoric \nwill tone down a little bit and we will look at what is in it.\n  We also didn't do damage. We didn't say we are going to turn over \nhealth care plans to the Health Care Financing Administration. We are \nnot going to duplicate State regulation. We will not confuse the States \nand say, no matter what you have done, Washington knows better. We \ndidn't make those mistakes.\n  We didn't astronomically increase health care costs. We didn't pass a \nbill that would increase the number of uninsured by a couple million.\n  Final comment on the President. I hope the President decides not to \nplay politics and say: We are going to veto that bill; it doesn't do \nwhat I want it to do.\n  I hope he will work with us to pass a positive bill that will benefit \nand improve health care quality for all Americans. If he wants to play \npolitics, that is his choice. If he wants to, then we don't have to \nhave a bill. It is up to him. If he wants to help us pass a good bill, \nI think we can do so, that would improve health care quality for all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the two pending \namendments are agreed to.\n  The amendments (Nos. 1254 and 1232) were agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The question is, Shall the bill, \nas amended, pass? The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 53, nays 47, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 210 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--53\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--47\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n\n[[Page S8623]]\n\n\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The bill (S. 1344), as amended, was passed.\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I would like to make a couple of comments \nconcerning the bill. I have already stated that I very much respect and \nappreciate the tenor of the debate that we had throughout this week \nwith proponents and opponents of the legislation we just passed, \nincluding Senator Kennedy, Senator Reid, Senator Daschle, and others. I \nthink we had an excellent debate.\n  I also want to thank my colleagues who really did work hard, and \nespecially I thank Senator Jeffords for his leadership, and Senator \nCollins, Senator Frist, and all the members of the task force. They did \na fantastic job.\n  In addition to the Senators I just mentioned, I want to thank other \nmembers of the task force, including Senator Hagel from Nebraska, the \nPresiding Officer of the Senate, Senator Santorum, and other Senators \nwho worked so hard.\n  Also, Senator Enzi joined us and did a fantastic job on the floor, as \nwell as in the Health Committee.\n  A lot of people put in a lot of time and effort, and a lot of staff \nmembers worked very hard on both the majority side and the minority \nside. I want to recognize a few.\n  First, from my staff, I thank Stacey Hughes and Megan Hauck. Eric \nUeland, Hazen Marshall, and Mark Kirk did a fantastic job.\n  In addition, I want to recognize some staff members from other staffs \nwho probably spent more time in the last year and a half working on \nthis issue than any other issue. I can assure you that in the last \nmonth, and in particular the last 2 weeks, this has been a full-time \njob, including Saturday and Sunday, and late nights almost every night: \nWith Senator Collins, Priscilla Hanley; Senator DeWine, Helen Rhee; \nSenator Enzi, Chris Spear, Ray Geary, and Jen Woodbury; Senator Frist, \nAnne Phelps and Sue Ramthun did a fantastic job on a number of \nprovisions; Senator Gramm, Mike Solon; Senator Gregg, Alan Gilbert; \nSenator Hagel, Steve Irizarry; Senator Hutchinson, Kate Hull; Senator \nJeffords, Paul Harrington, who did a fantastic job both in the Health \nCommittee and also on the floor, and Kim Monk, Tom Valuck, and Carole \nVannier did a fantastic job; Senator Lott, Sharon Soderstrom and Keith \nHennessy; Senator Craig, Michael Cannon; Senator Roth, Kathy Means, \nDede Spitznagel, and Bill Sweetnam; Senator Santorum, Peter Stein; \nSenator Sessions, Rick Deeborn, and Libby Rolfe.\n  This is an understatement because these staff members worked very \nhard.\n  In additional, I wish to recognize Senator Gramm, who worked on this \ntask force, and was the primary promoter of the medical savings \naccount, which is a very important thing for bringing tax equity and \nrelief.\n  I have already mentioned Senator Roth helped us, as well as his \nstaff. Senator Gregg, who led the fight, frankly, against having a \npropensity for lawsuits, did a fantastic job; Senator Hutchinson, and \nSenator Sessions.\n  This was not an easy effort. It was a challenge. I think it was a \ngood effort, and I think we produced a good bill because we had a lot \nof Senators who were willing to spend a lot of time trying to improve \nthe quality of health care in America.\n  I hope the President will not look at the rhetoric that was sometimes \non the floor, but will look to the substance of the legislation and \nwork with us to see that it will become the law of the land.\n  My thanks to Senator Jeffords and others who worked so hard to make \nthis happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I truly believe that tonight is a win-win \nsituation. We have made health coverage significantly better for those \npeople who have such coverage today, but, almost more importantly, we \nmake it more accessible for others, and more affordable for others in \naccomplishing the many patient protections--the improvement in quality, \nthe appeals, internal and external.\n  A lot of people have been involved over the course of the last year. \nI simply want to add my thanks to the two leaders in this effort, \nSenator Jeffords, chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee, for whose committee this bill passed and was \ndebated. And, through much bipartisan discussion, the amendment process \nimproved a bill that the task force, after about 6 to 8 months of very \nhard work, developed.\n  It was under Senator Jeffords' leadership that this bill took its \nfinal shape so that it finally arrived on the floor, and we were able \nto debate it.\n  Senator Nickles for the last year and a half has chaired a task \nforce, has been the quarterback, the manager of a broad range of people \nwho participated in the study of the issues, true substantive study--\nnot superficial policy reviews but a substantive study of the issues. \nSenator Nickles oversaw and managed a group of people on that committee \nwho have already been mentioned, including Senators Enzi, Gregg, Hagel, \nand Senator Collins who literally has been on the floor for the last 4 \ndays almost without leaving, participating in the debate on issue after \nissue.\n  Thanks also to Senator Santorum, Senator Gramm of Texas, Senator \nLott--especially our majority leader, Senator Lott, who spoke so \neloquently a bit ago summarizing what this bill has been about, what it \nwill accomplish, the confidence that he placed in both the task force \nand the Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee.\n  I especially want to thank several staff members: Stacy Hughes and \nMeg Hauck, who have shown leadership among all the staff members; Anne \nPhelps and Sue Ramthun, two people with whom I worked most closely with \nand who have gathered the information, digested the issues, and spent \nlate nights here.\n  I had the opportunity to work with Sue Ramthun over the last several \nyears on health issue after health issue. This will be the last bill \nthat she participates in, in the Senate--at least for a while. I say \n``for a while'' because I am hopeful she will come back to our staff. I \nrecognize her tremendous leadership and her knowledge of what has gone \non in this body in the past. It has been immensely helpful to me, \ncoming here just 5 years ago, to be able to work with an individual who \nunderstands the institution, understands the issues, and who has been \ninvolved in health issues long before I came to this body.\n  I want to mention Bill Baird, legislative counsel, who over the last \n4 days--and also over the past years--has participated so directly in \nallowing Members to translate these ideas to specific language for the \nbill we were able to ultimately pass. It is a win-win.\n  As I said in my closing remarks tonight, the thing I will think about \nas I go home and reflect on over the last 4 days is we made real \nprogress. We don't have all the answers. We don't pretend this bill has \nall the answers in establishing an appropriate balance between managed \ncare, coordinated care, and that doctor-patient relationship. But we \nare getting it back into balance because it has been out of balance for \na period of time. Our bill does take that whole doctor-patient \nrelationship and make it the heart of this managed care environment.\n  In closing, it has been a wonderful opportunity for me to be able to \nwork, again, on both sides of the aisle as we developed this bill which \nwill significantly improve the quality and access of health care for \nAmericans.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this is a time of trial for so many \nMembers to finally come to this end and have a victory which hopefully \nwill not stop here but will continue. There is too much good in this \nbill not to have it become legislation that will be passed into law. I \nam confident the President, when he understands what is in here, and we \nwork with the House and make\n\n[[Page S8624]]\n\nsome changes--I am sure we can accommodate the other side and we can \nend up with a piece of legislation. Hopefully it will be done this \nyear.\n  Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions, which had jurisdiction over this bill, I would \nlike to take a moment to thank all those who have worked so hard to \nmake this bill possible. This legislation has been developed over the \ncourse of more than two years, and a great number of people have \npositively contributed to the process.\n  This bill represents a tremendous effort by the members of the HELP \nCommittee. I want to thank the members of the Nickles Task Force for \ntheir guidance. I wish to thank Senator Nickles himself, and also the \nmajority leader for their dedication to see this legislation through to \nthe end.\n  The staff to the members of the HELP Committee have contributed \ngreatly to this bill. Rob Wasinger with Senator Brownback, Prescilla \nHanley with Senator Collins, Libby Rolfe with Senator Sessions, and \nKate Hull with Senator Hutchinson.\n  The staff of the subcommittees carried a great deal of weight. This \nincludes Helen Rhee with Senator DeWine, Chris Spear and Raissa Geray \nwith Senator Enzi, Anne Phelps and Sue Ramthum with Senator Frist, and \nAlan Gilbert with Senator Gregg.\n  The committee markup of this legislation lasted over 11 hours and so \nI must acknowledge the tireless efforts of Denis O'Donovan, Steve \nChapman, and Leah Cooper from the full Committee staff. I also thank \nBill Baird of the Legislative Counsel Office. He has provided enormous \nhelp.\n  I am grateful for the efforts by the staff of the GOP Health Care \nTask Force. Michael Cannon with the RPC, Steve Irizarry with Senator \nHagel, Mike Solon with Senator Gramm, Peter Stein with Senator \nSantorum, and Kathy Means, Bill Sweetnam, and Dede Spritznagel with \nSenator Roth.\n  Finally, I would like to thank the assistant majority leader's staff \nfor their leadership. Stacey Hughes, Meg Hauck, Hazen Marshall, Matt \nKirk, Brooke Simmons, Gail Osterberg, and Eric Ueland were invaluable. \nAs well as Sharon Soderstrom and Keith Hennessy from the majority \nleader's Office.\n  On my own staff, I would like to thank Paul Harrington, Sean Donohue, \nDirksen Lehman, Kim Monk, and Philo Hall and Marle Power my Staff \nDirector. This certainly could not have happened without my health \npolicy fellows, Tom Valuck, Kathy Matt, and Carol Vannier. I especially \nwant to thank Karen Guice and Pat Stroup, who each provided two years \nof groundwork on this legislation.\n  The round the clock work, particularly over the past week, of all the \nstaff involved is greatly appreciated.\n  Mr. President, I could not be more proud of all these people.\n  Around-the-clock work, particularly over the past week, of all the \nstaff is greatly appreciated. I cannot be more proud of these people. I \nwant to commend them and thank them profusely. I also thank, of course, \nthe people who work in this great body to make sure that we end up \ndoing the right things at the right time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/15/senate-section/article/S8624-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, I take this opportunity to provide a \nreport to my colleagues on the successful congressional delegate trip \nlast week to St. Petersburg, Russia, to participate in the Eighth \nAnnual Parliamentary Assembly Session of the Organization for Security \nand Cooperation in Europe, known as the OSCE PA. As Co-chairman of the \nHelsinki Commission, I headed the Senate delegation in coordination \nwith the Commission Chairman, Congressman Chris Smith.\n\n\n                       the parliamentary assembly\n\n  This year's congressional delegation of 17 members was the largest \nrepresentation by any country at the proceedings and was welcomed as a \ndemonstration of continued U.S. commitment to security in Europe. \nApproximately 300 parliamentarians from 52 OSCE participating states \ntook part in this year's meeting of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.\n  My objectives in St. Petersburg were to advance American interests in \na region of vital security and economic importance to the United \nStates; to elevate the issues of crime and corruption among the 54 OSCE \ncountries; to develop new linkages for my home state of Colorado; and \nto identify concrete ways to help American businesses.\n\n\n                          crime and corruption\n\n  The three General Committees focused on a central theme: ``Common \nSecurity and Democracy in the Twenty-First Century.'' I served on the \nEconomic Affairs, Science, Technology and the Environment Committee \nwhich took up the issue of corruption and its impact on business and \nthe rule of law. I sponsored two amendments that highlighted the \nimportance of combating corruption and organized crime, offering \nconcrete proposals for the establishment of high-level inter-agency \nmechanisms to fight corruption in each of the OSCE participating \nstates. My amendments also called for the convening of a ministerial \nmeeting to promote cooperation among these states to combat corruption \nand organized crime.\n  My anti-corruption amendment was based on the premise that corruption \nhas a negative impact on foreign investment, on human rights, on \ndemocracy building and on the rule of law. Any investor nation should \nhave the right to expect anti-corruption practices in those countries \nin which they seek to invest.\n  Significant progress has been made with the ratification of the new \nOECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in \nInternational Business Transactions. Under the OECD Convention, \ncompanies from the leading exporting nations will have to comply with \ncertain ethical standards in their business dealings with foreign \npublic officials. And, last July, the OSCE and the OECD held a joint \nconference to assess ways to combat corruption and organized crime \nwithin the OSCE region. I believe we must build on this initiative, and \noffered my amendment to urge the convening of a ministerial meeting \nwith the goal of making specific recommendations to the member states \nabout steps which can be taken to eliminate this primary threat to \neconomic stability and security and major obstacle to U.S. businesses \nseeking to invest and operate abroad.\n  My anti-crime amendment was intended to address the negative impact \nthat crime has on our countries and our citizens. Violent crime, \ninternational crime, organized crime and drug trafficking all undermine \nthe rule of law, a healthy business climate and democracy building.\n  This amendment was based on my personal experiences as one of the \nonly members of the United States Senate with a law enforcement \nbackground and on congressional testimony that we are witnessing an \nincrease in the incidence of international crime, and we are seeing a \ntype of crime which our countries have not dealt with before.\n  During the opening Plenary Session on July 6, we heard from the \nGovernor of St. Petersburg, Vladimir Yakolev, about how the use of \ndrugs is on the rise in Russia and how more needs to be done to help \nour youth.\n  On July 7, I had the opportunity to visit the Russian Police Training \nAcademy at St. Petersburg University and met with General Victor \nSalnikov, the Chief of the University. I was impressed with the \nGeneral's accomplishments and how many senior Russian officials who are \ngraduates of the university, including the Prime Minister, governors, \nand members of the Duma.\n  General Salnikov and I discussed the OSCE's work on crime and drugs, \nand he urged us to act. The General stressed that this affects all of \ncivilized society and all countries must do everything they can to \nreduce drug trafficking and crime.\n  After committee consideration and adoption of my amendments, I was \napproached by Senator Jerry Grafstein from Canada who indicated how \nimportant it was to elevate the issues of\n\n[[Page S8625]]\n\ncrime and corruption in the OSCE framework. I look forward to working \nwith Senator Grafstein and other parliamentarians on these important \nissues at future multi-lateral meetings.\n\n\n                    cultural linkages with colorado\n\n  St. Petersburg is rich in culture and educational resources. This \ngrand city is home to 1,270 public, private and educational libraries; \n181 museums of art, nature, history and culture; 106 theaters; 52 \npalaces; and 417 cultural organizations. Our delegation visit provided \nan excellent opportunity to explore linkages between some of these \nresources with the many museums and performing arts centers in \nColorado.\n  On Thursday, July 8, I met with Tatyana Kuzmina, the Executive \nDirector for the St. Petersburg Association for International \nCooperation, and Natalia Koltomova, Senior Development Officer for the \nState Museum of the History of St. Petersburg. We learned that museums \nand the orchestras have exchanges in New York, Michigan and California. \nMs. Kuzmina was enthusiastic about exploring cultural exchanges with \nDenver and other communities in Colorado. I look toward to following up \nwith her, the U.S. Consulate in St. Petersburg, and leaders in the \nColorado fine arts community to help make such cultural exchanges a \nreality.\n  As proof that the world is getting smaller all the time, I was \npleasantly surprised to encounter a group of 20 Coloradans on tour. In \nfact, there were so many from Grand Junction alone, we could have held \na Town Meeting right there in St. Petersburg! In our conversations, it \nwas clear we shared the same impressions of the significant potential \nthat that city has to offer in future linkages with Colorado. I ask \nunanimous consent that a list of the Coloradans whom I met be printed \nin the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n\n\n                      helping american businesses\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. In the last Congress, I introduced the International \nAnti-Corruption Act of 1997 (S. 1200) which would tie U.S. foreign aid \nto how conducive foreign countries are to American businesses and \ninvestment. As I prepare to reintroduce this bill in the 106th Congress \nand to work on combating crime and corruption within the OSCE \nframework, I participated in a meeting of U.S. business representatives \non Friday, July 9, convened by the Russian-American Chamber of \nCommerce, headquartered in Denver. We were joined by my colleagues, \nSenator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Senator George Voinovich and my fellow \nColoradan, Congressman Tom Tancredo.\n  We heard first-hand about the challenges of doing business in Russia \nfrom representatives of U.S. companies, including Lockheed Martin \nAstronautics, PepsiCo, the Gillette Company, Coudert Brothers, and \nColliers HIB St. Petersburg. Some issues, such as export licensing, \ncounterfeiting and corruption are being addressed in the Senate. But, \nmany issues these companies face are integral to the Russian business \nculture, such as taxation, the devaluation of the rouble, and lack of \ninfrastructure. My colleagues and I will be following up on ways to \nassist U.S. businesses and investment abroad.\n  In addition, on Wednesday, July 7, I participated in a meeting at the \nSt. Petersburg Investment Center. The main focus of the meeting was the \npresentation of a replica of Fort Ross in California, the first Russian \noutpost in the United States, to the Acting U.S. Consul General on \nbehalf of the Governor of California. We heard from Anatoly Razdoglin \nand Valentin Makarov of the St. Petersburg Administration; Slava \nBychkov, American Chamber of Commerce in Russia, St. Petersburg \nChapter; Valentin Mishanov, Russian State Marine Archive; and Vitaly \nDozenko, Marine Academy. The discussion ranged from U.S. investment in \nSt. Petersburg and the many redevelopment projects which are planned or \nunderway in the city.\n\n\n                            Crime and Drugs\n\n  As I mentioned, on Wednesday, July 7, I toured the Russia Police \nTraining Academy at St. Petersburg University and met with General \nVictor Salnikov, the Chief of the University. This facility is the \nlargest organization in Russia which prepares law enforcement officers \nand is the largest law institute in the country. The University has \n35,000 students and 5,000 instructors. Among the law enforcement \ncandidates, approximately 30 percent are women.\n  The Police Training Academy has close contacts with a number of \ncountries, including the U.S., France, Germany, the United Kingdom, \nFinland, Israel and others. Areas of cooperation include police \ntraining, counterfeiting, computer crimes, and programs to combat drug \ntrafficking.\n  I was informed that the Academy did not have a formal working \nrelationship with the National Institute of Justice, the research and \ndevelopment arm of the U.S. Department of Justice which operates an \nextensive international information-sharing program. I intend to call \nfor this bilateral linkage to facilitate collaboration and the exchange \nof information, research and publications which will benefit law \nenforcement in both countries fight crime and drugs.\n\n\n                         U.S.-Russia Relations\n\n  In addition to the discussions in the plenary sessions of the OSCE \nParliamentary Assembly, we had the opportunity to raise issues of \nimportance in a special bilateral meeting between the U.S. and Russia \ndelegations on Thursday morning, July 8. Members of our delegation \nraised issues including anti-Semitism in the Duma, developments in \nKosovo, the case of environmental activist Aleksandr Nikitin, the \nassassination of Russian Parliamentarian Galina Starovoitova, and the \ntrafficking of women and children.\n  As the author of the Senate Resolution condemning anti-Semitism in \nthe Duma (S. Con. Res. 19), I took the opportunity of this bilateral \nsession to let the Russian delegation, including the Speaker of the \nState Duma, know how seriously we in the United States feel about the \nimportance of having a governmental policy against anti-Semitism. We \nalso stressed that anti-Semitic remarks by their Duma members are \nintolerable. I look forward to working with Senator Helms to move S. \nCon. Res. 19 through the Foreign Relations Committee to underscore the \nstrong message we delivered to the Russians in St. Petersburg.\n\n  We had the opportunity to discuss the prevalence of anti-Semitism and \nthe difficulties which minority religious organizations face in Russia \nat a gathering of approximately 100 non-governmental organizations \n(NGOs), religious leaders and business representatives, hosted by the \nU.S. Delegation on Friday, July 9. We heard about the restrictions \nplaced on religious freedoms and how helpful many American non-profit \norganizations are in supporting the NGO's efforts.\n  I am pleased to report that the U.S. Delegation had a significant and \npositive impact in advancing U.S. interests during the Eighth OSCE \nParliamentary Assembly Session in St. Petersburg. To provide my \ncolleagues with additional information, I ask unanimous consent that my \nformal report to Majority Leader Lott be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, United States Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: I am pleased to report to you on the \n     work of the bipartisan congressional delegation which I co-\n     chaired that participated in the Eighth Annual Session of the \n     Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), hosted by the Russian \n     Parliament, the Federation Council and the\n\n[[Page S8626]]\n\n     State Duma, in St. Petersburg, July 6-10, 1999. Other \n     participants from the United States Senate were Senator \n     Hutchison of Texas and Senator Voinovich. We were joined by \n     14 Members of the House: Rep. Smith, Rep. Hoyer, Rep. Sabo, \n     Rep. Kaptur, Rep. Cardin, Rep. Sawyer, Rep. Slaughter, Rep. \n     Stearns, Rep. Tanner, Rep. Danner, Rep. Hastings of Florida, \n     Rep. Salmon, Rep. Cooksey, and Rep. Tancredo. The combined \n     U.S. delegation of 17, the largest representation by any \n     country in St. Petersburg was welcomed by others as a \n     demonstration of the continued commitment of the United \n     States, and the U.S. Congress, to Europe.\n       This year's Assembly brought together nearly 300 \n     parliamentarians from 52 OSCE participating States. Seven \n     countries, including the Russian Federation, were represented \n     at the level of Speaker of Parliament or President of the \n     Senate. The Assembly continued to recognize the \n     democratically elected parliament of Belarus which President \n     Lukashenka dissolved following his illegal power grab in \n     1996.\n       The inaugural ceremony included a welcoming addresses by \n     the Speaker of the State Duma, Gennady Seleznev, and the \n     Governor of St. Petersburg, Vladimir Yakovlev. The President \n     of the Assembly, Ms. Helle Degn of Denmark, presided. The \n     theme for the St. Petersburg Assembly was ``Common Security \n     and Democracy in the Twenty-First Century.''\n       Foreign Minister Knut Vollenback of Norway addressed the \n     Assembly in his capacity of OSCE Chairman-in-Office to report \n     on the organization's activities, particularly those relating \n     to post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction in Kosovo. \n     Vollenbaek urged the Parliamentary Assembly and its members \n     to play an active role in promoting human rights, democracy, \n     and the rule of law in Kosovo. Considerable attention was \n     given to the Stability Pact for Southeastern Europe \n     throughout the discussions on Kosovo.\n       Members of the U.S. delegation actively participated in a \n     special plenary session on Kosovo and contributed to a draft \n     resolution concerning the situation in Kosovo. The delegation \n     was successful in securing adoption of several amendments; \n     underscoring the legal obligation of State to cooperate with \n     the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia; \n     granting access to all prisoners by the International \n     Committee on the Red Cross; extending humanitarian assistance \n     to other parts of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia; and \n     supporting democracy in Serbia and Montenegro. Senator \n     Voinovich introduced a separate resolution stressing the \n     urgent need to support infrastructure projects which would \n     benefit neighboring countries in the Balkans region. This \n     resolution was widely supported and adopted unanimously.\n       Work in the Assembly's three General Committee--Political \n     Affairs and Security; Economic Affairs, Science, Technology \n     and Environment; and Democracy, Human Rights and Humanitarian \n     Questions--focused on the central theme: ``Common Security \n     and Democracy in the Twenty-First Century.''\n       During discussion in the General Committee on Political \n     Affairs and Security, the U.S. pressed for greater \n     transparency with respect to OSCE activities in Vienna, \n     urging that meetings of the Permanent Council be open to the \n     public and media. Considerable discussion focused on the \n     Assembly's long-standing recommendation to modify the \n     consensus rule that governs all decisions taken by the OSCE. \n     During the closing session Rep. Hastings was unanimously \n     elected committee Vice Chairman.\n       Members offered several amendment to the draft resolution \n     considered by the General Committee on Economic Affairs, \n     Science, Technology and Environment. Two amendments that I \n     sponsored focused on the importance of combating corruption \n     and organized crime, offering concrete proposals for the \n     establishment of high-level inter-agency corruption-fighting \n     mechanisms in each of the OSCE participating States as well \n     as the convening of a ministerial meeting to promote \n     cooperation among these States to combat corruption and \n     organized crime. Other amendments offered by the delegation, \n     and adopted, highlighted the importance of reform of the \n     agricultural sector, bolstering food security in the context \n     of sustainable development, and regulation of capital and \n     labor markets by multilateral organizations.\n       The Rapporteur's report for the General Committee on \n     Democracy, Human Rights and Humanitarian Questions focused on \n     the improvement of the human rights situation in the newly \n     independent states. Amendments proposed by the U.S. \n     delegation, and adopted by the Assembly, stressed the need \n     for participating States to fully implement their commitments \n     to prevent discrimination on the grounds of religion or \n     belief and condemned statements by parliamentarians of OSCE \n     participating States promoting or supporting racial or ethnic \n     hatred, anti-Semitism and xenophobia. Other U.S. amendments \n     that were adopted advocated the establishment of permanent \n     Central Election Commissions in emerging democracies and \n     emphasized the need for the Governments of the OSCE \n     participating States to act to ensure that refugees and \n     displaced persons have the right to return to their homes and \n     to regain their property or receive compensation.\n       Two major U.S. initiatives in St. Petersburg were Chairman \n     Smith's resolution on the trafficking of women and children \n     for the sex trade and Rep. Slaughter's memorial resolution on \n     the assassination of Galina Starovoitova, a Russian \n     parliamentarian and an outspoken advocate of democracy, human \n     rights and the rule of law in Russia who was murdered late \n     last year. The trafficking resolution appeals to \n     participating States to create legal and enforcement \n     mechanisms to punish traffickers while protecting the rights \n     of the trafficking victims. The resolution on the \n     assassination called on the Russian Government to use every \n     appropriate avenue to bring Galina Starovoitova's murders to \n     justice. Both items received overwhelming support and were \n     included in the St. Petersburg Declaration adopted during the \n     closing plenary.\n       An ambitious series of bilateral meetings were held between \n     Members of the U.S. delegation and representatives from the \n     Russian Federation, Ukraine, Turkey, France, Romania, \n     Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Armenian, Canada, and the United \n     Kingdom. While in St. Petersburg, the delegation met with \n     Aleksandr Nikitin, a former Soviet navy captain being \n     prosecuted for his investigative work exposing nuclear \n     storage problems and resulting radioactive contamination in \n     the area around Murmansk. In addition, the delegation hosted \n     a reception for representatives of non-governmental \n     organizations and U.S. businesses active in the Russian \n     Federation.\n       Elections for officers of the Assembly were held during the \n     final plenary. As. Helle Degn of Denmark was re-elected \n     President. Mr. Bill Graham of Canada was elected Treasurer. \n     Four of the Assembly's nine Vice-Presidents were elected: Mr. \n     Claude Estier (France), Mr. Bruce George (U.K.), Mr. Ihor \n     Ostach (Ukraine), and Mr. Tiit Kabin (Estonia). Rep Hoyer's \n     current term as Vice-President runs through 2001.\n       Enclosed is a copy of the St. Petersburg Declaration \n     adopted by participants at the Assembly's closing session.\n       Finally, the Standing Committee agreed that the Ninth \n     Annual Session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly will be \n     held next July in Bucharest, Romania.\n           Sincerely,\n                                  Ben Nighthorse Campbell, U.S.S.,\n     Co-Chairman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/15/senate-section/article/S8626-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8626-S8627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      IMPASSE IN IMPLEMENTING THE NORTHERN IRELAND PEACE AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today the people of Northern Ireland were \ndenied an opportunity to take a major step forward in making the \npromise of peace contained in the Good Friday Peace Accords a daily \nreality. Today, David Trimble, President of the Ulster Unionist Party, \nrefused to lend his party's critical support to the implementation of a \nkey provision of that agreement--the establishment of a Northern \nIreland legislature and the appointment of its twelve member, \nmultiparty executive. Ironically, in refusing to cooperate in the \nformation of the assembly, the Ulster Unionists are further away from \ntheir stated goal of ensuring IRA decommissioning of its weapons at the \nearliest possible date.\n  Regrettably, despite the herculean efforts of British Prime Minister \nTony Blair and Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern to move the process \nforward, the so called d'Hondt mechanism provided for in the agreement \nhas been run and an attempt to form an executive with cross community \nsupport has failed. I am deeply disappointed that the leadership of the \nUlster Unionist Party has been unable to garner the necessary support \nof its membership to honor the obligations that the leadership \ncommitted that party to when it signed the Accords on April 8, 1998. \nMore importantly, the people of Northern Ireland, who turned out in \nlarge numbers to participate in last year's referendum endorsing the \nGood Friday Accords, must also be deeply disappointed that once again \ntheir political leaders have fallen short, let this deadline pass and \njeopardized the peace process.\n  Where do we go from here? Prime Minister Blair and Taoiseach Ahern \nwill meet next week to reassess the situation, including the \npossibility of implementing those provisions of the agreement that fall \nwithin the mandate of the British and Irish Governments. In addition, \nthe parties are required by the terms of the agreement to undertake a \nfundamental review at this juncture. In the meantime, I would hope that \nthe people of Northern Ireland, Protestant and Catholic, who stand the \nmost to lose if this agreement is allowed to wither on the vine, will \nlet their political leaders know how disappointed they are that the \nagreement is not being implemented in good faith. I would also call \nupon those who have resorted to violence in the past to refrain from \ndoing so--violence can never resolve the political and sectarian \nconflicts of Northern Ireland.\n  Mr. President, for more than a quarter of a century Protestants and \nCatholics throughout the North have lived in\n\n[[Page S8627]]\n\nfear that a trip to the movies or the market place could prove to be a \nfatal one because sectarian violence has been a common occurrence in \ntheir daily lives. The Northern Ireland Peace agreement was designed to \nend the cycle of violence that has destroyed so many families in \nNorthern Ireland. It can still accomplish that goal. There is still \ntime for all of the parties to find the political courage to do the \nright thing for the people who they claim to represent.\n  Mr. President, I like to think of myself as a realist, yet despite \nthe events of the last several days I am optimistic that the Good \nFriday Accords remain the key to unlocking the formula for a lasting \npeace throughout Ireland. With the help of the British, Irish and \nAmerican governments, there is still time for Northern Ireland's \npolitical leaders to find within themselves the courage to move forward \nwith the implementation of the Accords. I hope and pray they do so \nbefore that time runs out.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/15/senate-section/article/S8627-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, this week marks the 25th Anniversary of the \nRunaway and Homeless Youth Act. I had hoped as part of celebrating the \nsilver anniversary of the passage of this landmark legislation that the \nCongress would be sending to President Clinton for signature, S. 249, \nthe Missing, Exploited, and Runaway Children Protection Act. This \nlegislation reauthorizes programs under the Runaway and Homeless Youth \nAct as well as authorizes funding for the National Center for Missing \nand Exploited Children. Both programs are critical to our nation's \nyouth and to our nation's well-being.\n  Unfortunately, the bill is still being held up for no good reason. I \nhave been working since 1996 to enact this legislation. Last Congress \nand again this Congress, we have been able to clear the passage of this \nimportant legislation on the Democratic side of the aisle.\n  I had hoped that by the end of this week my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle could be persuaded to let this legislation pass the \nSenate and President Clinton sign it into law. The many grassroots \nsupporters of this legislation and I remain frustrated.\n  If we do not pass this legislation soon, I fear it will again, as it \nwas last Congress, be caught up in a more contentious debate on \njuvenile crime.\n  I had hoped that we had been able to move away from using this \nnoncontroversial legislation to try to pass unreasonable juvenile \njustice legislation. Last Congress, the Majority was roundly criticized \nfor its tactic, which the New York Times labeled a ``stealth assault on \njuvenile justice.'' That procedural gimmick cost us valuable time to \nget this legislation enacted.\n  This year, it appeared that such procedural ambushes had been avoided \nin the Senate and minimized in the House. In late May, the Senate had a \nfull and fair debate on a juvenile justice bill. After significant \nimprovements through amendments, the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill \npassed the Senate on May 20, 1999 by a strong bipartisan vote. The \nHouse finally considered juvenile crime legislation in June, although \nthe Republican leadership has steadfastly blocked a House-Senate \nconference on the Hatch-Leahy bill.\n  Separately, in April of this year the Senate passed S. 249, the \nMissing, Exploited and Runaway Children Protection Act of 1999. In May, \nthe House passed S.249 with an amendment. As I explained in a floor \nstatement on June 30, I was hopeful that the Senate would immediately \ntake up and pass the amended version of S.249 and worked to do that. I \nconsulted with the Department of Health and Human Services about \ncertain concerns I had with the House amendment and was reassured that \nVermont would not be adversely affected by it. I noted my disagreement \nwith other aspects of the House action and ways to deal with those \nwithout holding final passage of S.249 hostage. I regret to report, \nhowever, that this important legislation has been in Senate limbo since \nlate May.\n  The guts of the legislation remain the Leahy-Hatch substitute \nlanguage to S.249 that was reported by the Judiciary Committee and \nwhich passed the Senate in April. We were careful to recognize the \nimportant work of these programs in Vermont, as well as the many other \nprograms and staff across the U.S. that are working effectively with \nrunaway and homeless youth and their families. The House-inserted \namendments do nothing to change the special care we took in the Senate \nto craft the main components of this legislation.\n  The Leahy-Hatch substitute language preserves current law governing \nthe minimum grants available for small States for the Basic Center \ngrants and also preserves the current confidentiality and records \nprotections for runaway and homeless youth.\n  In addition, our substitute amendment reauthorizes the Runaway and \nHomeless Youth Act Rural Demonstration Projects. This program provides \ntargeted assistance to States with rural juvenile populations. Programs \nserving runaway and homeless youth have found that those in rural areas \nare particularly difficult to reach and serve effectively.\n  Under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, every year each State is \nawarded a Basic Center grant for housing and crisis services for \nrunaway and homeless children and their families. The funding is based \non its juvenile population, with a minimum grant of $100,000 currently \nawarded to smaller States, such as Vermont. Effective community-based \nprograms around the country can also apply directly for the funding \navailable for the Transitional Living Program and the Sexual Abuse \nPrevention/Street Outreach grants. The Transitional Living Program \ngrants are used to provide longer term housing to homeless teens age 16 \nto 21, and to help these teenagers become more self-sufficient. The \nSexual Abuse Prevention/Street Outreach Program also targets teens who \nhave engaged in or are at risk of engaging in high risk behaviors while \nliving on the street.\n  The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act does more than shelter these \nchildren in need. As the National Network for Youth has stressed, the \nAct's programs ``provide critical assistance to youth in high-risk \nsituations all over the country.'' This Act also ensures that these \nchildren and their families have access to important services, such as \nindividual, family or group counseling, alcohol and drug counseling and \na myriad of other resources to help these young people and their \nfamilies get back on track.\n  Runaway and Homeless Youth Services in Vermont show positive results. \nFor those who do not think rural areas have significant numbers of \nrunaway youth, I note that in fiscal year 1998, the Vermont Coalition \nof Runaway and Homeless Youth Programs and Spectrum Youth & Family \nServices (``the Coalition''), reported that 81 percent of the 1,067 \nyouths served by the Coalition programs were in a positive living \nsituation at the close of service. They were reunited with their \nfamilies, living with a friend or relative, or in another appropriate \nliving situation. They were not in Department of Corrections or State \nRehabilitative Services (SRS) custody.\n  Since 1992, the Coalition programs have seen a 175 percent increase \nin the numbers of youths served: The Coalition programs served 388 \nrunaway and\n\n[[Page S8628]]\n\nhomeless youths in 1992. This number increased to 1,067 in 1997. In \n1998, 61 percent of the youths served were 15, 16 or 17 years old.\n  The Coalition programs are the ``who you gonna' call'' in cases of \nfamily crisis and runaway incidents. They are a critical part of \nVermont's ability to respond pro-actively when youths and families are \nin crisis, and to prevent the need for later, more costly services.\n\n  The Coalition average cost per client in fiscal year 1998 was $1,471. \nEach client has different needs which could mean a week of service, a \nmonth, or the entire year. The service could include housing, family \ncounseling, or any of the array of services offered the Coalition \nprograms. The average time a case was open in fiscal year 1998 was 54 \ndays.\n  The relative costs of various services available to youths \nexperiencing problems frequently associated with runaway and ``push-\nout'' incidents and other serious family conflict is dramatically \nhigher. For fiscal year 1998, the costs for a bed in Vermont's Juvenile \nDetention system was over $69,000; a bed in a in-patient adolescent \nsubstance abuse treatment facility was over $54,000.\n  The Vermont Coalition programs provide early interventions that are \nmore humane, and more cost effective. When one youth is diverted from \nentering state custody, the state of Vermont saves $19,761. If 102 \nyoung people, or 9 percent of the 1,067 youths served in fiscal year \n1998, were diverted from entering SRS Custody, then Vermont saves over \n$2,000,000--four times the amount of dollars Vermont currently receives \nunder the RHYA for service to runaway and homeless youths.\n  The Vermont Coalition and Spectrum Youth & Family Services should be \napplauded for their important work and I believe the best way to do \nthat is to reauthorize the Runaway and Homeless Act, so programs like \nthese in Vermont have some greater financial security in the future.\n  I want to thank the many advocates who have worked with me over the \nyears to improve the bill and, in particular, the dedicated members of \nthe Vermont Coalition of Runaway and Homeless Youth Programs and the \nNational Network for Youth for their suggestions and assistance. \nWithout these dedicated public-spirited citizens these programs could \nnot be successful.\n  The other important piece of S. 249 is authorizing the nation's \nresource center for child protection, the National Center for Missing \nand Exploited Children (NCMEC). This center spearheads national efforts \nto locate and recover missing children and raises public awareness \nabout ways to prevent child abduction, molestation, and sexual \nexploitation.\n  Since 1984, when the center was established, it has handled more than \n1.3 million calls through its national Hotline 1-800-THE-LOST; trained \nmore than 151,755 police and other professionals; and published more \nthan 17 million publications that are distributed free of charge. The \ncenter has worked with law enforcement on more than 65,173 missing \nchild cases, resulting in the recovery of 46,031 children.\n  Since its creation, the center has helped 83 Vermont missing child \ncases and has helped resolve 82 of them. Nationwide, prior to 1990, the \nchild recovery rate of the center was 62 percent. From 1990 through \n1998, even with increasing caseloads, the recovery of children that are \nreported to the center has reached 91.8 percent.\n  Last year, the center launched a new CyberTipline. It allows Internet \nusers to report such things as suspicious or illegal activity, \nincluding child pornography and online enticement of children for \nsexual exploitation.\n  Each month NCMEC brings chiefs and sheriffs together for special \ntraining. To date, the center has trained 728 of these law enforcement \nofficials from all fifty states, including chiefs from Dover, Hartford, \nBrattleboro, and Winooski, Vermont and representatives from our State \nPolice force.\n  The center also trains state and local police on crimes against \nchildren in cyberspace. Although this program has just begun, already \n103 Unit Commanders from 34 states, including Vermont have been \ntrained. In February of this year, Captain David Rich of the Hartford, \nVermont Police Department attended this course.\n  The NCMEC trainers conducted a statewide infant abduction prevention \nseminar for the Vermont Chapter of the Association of the Women's \nHealth, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses, attended by 252 nurses and \nsecurity staff, and conducted site audits at two Vermont hospitals.\n  I applaud the ongoing work of the Center and hope that the Senate \nwill promptly pass this bill so that they can proceed with their \nimportant activities with fewer funding concerns.\n  Mr. President, S. 249, the Missing, Exploited, and Runaway Children \nProtection Act, should be passed without further delay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/15/senate-section/article/S8628-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8628-S8629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRATULATIONS TO THE U.S. AIR FORCE\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues in the Senate and \nto those listening everywhere, I rise to congratulate the U.S. Air \nForce on their gallantry and their bravery in risking their lives to \ntake much-needed medicine to a woman who is now a scientist working in \nAntarctica on a National Science Foundation expedition.\n  This woman recently discovered a lump in her breast and needs medical \ntreatment. She cannot leave Antarctica until the middle of October \nbecause of the horrendous weather conditions. She can't get out and \nnobody can get to her. But God bless the U.S. Air Force. They were \nwilling to step forward at great risk to themselves to take the much-\nneeded medicine, and at a very specific moment, drop the six packages \nthat will be able to provide her with treatment, through the genius of \ntelemedicine.\n  Imagine the terror of a woman who discovers a lump in her breast. \nImagine if this lump is discovered while you are serving at a remote \nresearch station on the South Pole, which is completely inaccessible \nduring many months of the year. A plane has never landed on the South \nPole during the winter. So how could she hope to get the medical \nsupplies she needed for treatment?\n  This is the situation faced by a woman serving at the National \nScience Foundation's Amundsen-Scott research station at the South Pole. \nShe could neither leave the station nor expect outside help until \nOctober. We all know when a lump is discovered, immediate treatment is \nessential. That is part of what we have been arguing about.\n  But guess what. This is when our U.S. Air Force became involved. We \nare all so proud of what they do to protect America's values and \ninterests around the world. Most recently, they were successful in \nending genocide and ethnic cleansing in Kosovo.\n  But on this mission to the South Pole, they were called on to act as \nhumanitarians. Flying from New Zealand, the 23-person crew had to fly \ntheir aircraft for nearly a 7,000-mile round trip. They had limited \nvisibility. They had to make their drop with great precision--since the \nmedicine and equipment could not be exposed to the harsh conditions for \nmore than a few minutes. Personnel on the ground also showed great \nskill and courage. They came outside in 70-below degree weather to plot \nthe drop site with a great big letter ``C'' so the supplies could be \ndropped in the right spot, and they could be there at the right time to \nget it.\n  All Americans were awed by their skill and bravery. It was led by \nMajor Greg Pike and his crew. They made their drop successfully, \nreturned safely, and the supplies are now being used.\n  For those of us who saw the news, we know the U.S. Air Force risked \nthemselves because if that plane ran into difficulty, they were at a \npoint of no return. When they opened up the plane to be able to drop \nthis much-needed medicine, they had to put special gear on because they \nthemselves were facing temperatures at 150 degrees below zero. But they \ndid it because they had the ``right stuff'' to make sure she had the \nright medicine. I tell you, it was quite a moment to see. Those great \nguys also sent her a bouquet of flowers and pictures of themselves and \ntheir families.\n  Mr. President, this also reminds us of the bravery of our National \nScience Foundation staff who have also worked in very difficult \nconditions to conduct the important scientific research.\n  We say to her, to the lady in the Antarctic, if she can watch us on \nC-SPAN: God bless you. We are pulling for you,\n\n[[Page S8629]]\n\nand we say here in the Senate, God bless the U.S. Air Force.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/15/senate-section/article/S8629-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8629-S8630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-4206.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce legislation that will help the United States achieve \nimportant non-proliferation and counter-proliferation goals by \nimproving the process through which export data on shipments of \nproliferation concern is collected and analyzed. By requiring that \nexport data related to shipments of proliferation concern be filed \nelectronically, this legislation will make it possible for agencies \nwith export control responsibilities to do their job more efficiently \nand effectively.\n  To minimize the administrative burden on exporters, my legislation \nphases in the electronic filing requirement 180 days after the \nSecretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Treasury certify that a \nsecure, Internet-based filing system is up and running. There is \nalready an electronic filing system available, but the existing system \nis being replaced with an Internet-based system that will be easier to \naccess and use. When the new Internet-based system is in place, and \nthat is expected to happen by early next year, my legislation will \nrequire that shipments of proliferation concern be reported \nelectronically. The net result of enacting this legislation will be \nenhanced export control monitoring and enforcement, with minimal burden \nto shippers and exporters.\n  Let me take a moment to provide some background information for my \ncolleagues, to make it clear what my legislation does and why. Current \nlaw requires shippers, forwarders and exporters to file what is known \nas a Shipper's Export Declaration, or SED. The SED indicates what is \nbeing shipped, where it is going, who it is being shipped to. Most of \nthese are now filed on paper, and it is a time consuming and difficult \nprocess to sort through all these paper SEDs to identify shipments of \nproliferation concern, to track them down and check them out. In 1995, \nthe Customs Service and the Census Bureau created the Automated Export \nSystem, or AES, which makes it possible to submit SEDs electronically. \nWith the SED information in electronic form, it is much easier to sort \nthrough the data and identify shipments of concern.\n  About ten percent of SEDs are currently filed in electronic form \nthrough AES, and almost ninety percent of the forms are filed on paper. \nThe data from the ninety percent of SEDs that are filed on paper is not \nas easy to review as it could be, and it is not possible to do the type \nof cross-checking and analysis that is necessary to zero in on the \nshipments that export officials need to monitor closely, and in some \ncases, prevent from being shipped. For example, before the 1991 Persian \nGulf War, the Iraqis had a very sophisticated procurement strategy for \nacquiring weapons of mass destruction. They broke down their purchase \nrequests and instead of asking for everything they wanted from one or \ntwo companies, asked for a few items from a large number of suppliers. \nIf the Iraqis had grouped their requests, their orders would have \nraised eyebrows. Someone would have become suspicious, either the \nsuppliers or export enforcement officers who reviewed the export data. \nAs it was, the Iraqis ordered relatively small quantities of dual use \ncommodities, items that can be used to create weapons of mass \ndestruction but also have perfectly ordinary commercial uses, and \ncombined them with shipments from other suppliers, sometimes from other \ncountries, to make weapons of mass destruction. If all SEDs on items of \nproliferation concern had been filed electronically, as they will be \nwhen my legislation is enacted, it would have been much easier to \ndetect what the Iraqis were up to and take preventive action.\n  Not all of the shipments that are being reported on paper rather than \nelectronically are of proliferation concern. Shippers in the United \nStates export literally hundreds of thousands of items each month that \ndo not raise proliferation concerns; agricultural products, toasters, \nautomobiles, and all sorts of completely harmless goods. But there are \nother items that we have to watch more carefully; items that are on the \nDepartment of State's Munitions List or the Commerce Control List. My \nlegislation will make it easier to track shipments of these items by \nrequiring that SEDs be filed electronically for any item that is on the \nUnited\n\n[[Page S8632]]\n\nStates Munitions List or the Commerce Control List. With this \ninformation available in electronic format, agencies with export \ncontrol responsibilities will be able to enforce our export control \nlaws more effectively and prevent proliferation of WMD. By limiting \nmandatory electronic filing to items that raise genuine concerns about \nproliferation, my legislation will maximize the benefit to our national \nsecurity without unduly burdening shippers and exporters.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1372\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

VOLUNTARY USE OF THE AUTOMATED EXPORT SYSTEM.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that exporters (or their \n     agents) who are required to file Shippers' Export \n     Declarations under chapter 9 of title 13, United States Code, \n     but who are not required under section 2(b) to file such \n     Declarations using the Automated Export System, should do so.\n\n     SEC. 4. REPORT TO CONGRESS.\n\n       Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Commerce, in coordination with the \n     Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary \n     of the Treasury, the Secretary of Energy, and the Director of \n     Central Intelligence, shall submit a report to Congress \n     setting forth--\n       (1) the advisability and feasibility of mandating \n     electronic filing through the Automated Export System for all \n     Shippers' Export Declarations;\n       (2) the manner in which data gathered through the Automated \n     Export System can most effectively be used by other automated \n     licensing systems administered by Federal agencies, \n     including--\n       (A) the Defense Trade Application System of the Department \n     of State;\n       (B) the Export Control Automated Support System of the \n     Department of Commerce;\n       (C) the Foreign Disclosure and Technology Information \n     System of the Department of Defense;\n       (D) the Proliferation Information Network System of the \n     Department of Energy;\n       (E) the Enforcement Communication System of the Department \n     of the Treasury; and\n       (F) the Export Control System of the Central Intelligence \n     Agency; and\n       (3) a proposed timetable for any expansion of information \n     required to be filed through the Automated Export System.\n\n     SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Automated export system.--The term ``Automated Export \n     System'' means the automated and electronic system for filing \n     export information established under chapter 9 of title 13, \n     United States Code, on June 19, 1995 (60 Federal Register \n     32040).\n       (2) Commerce control list.--The term ``Commerce Control \n     List'' has the meaning given the term in section 774.1 of \n     title 15, Code of Federal Regulations.\n       (3) Shippers' export declaration.--The term ``Shippers' \n     Export Declaration'' means the export information filed under \n     chapter 9 of title 13, United States Code, as described in \n     part 30 of title 15, Code of Federal Regulations.\n       (4) United states munitions list.--The term ``United States \n     Munitions List'' means the list of items controlled under \n     section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778).\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, there is no greater threat to our country \nthan that posed by weapons of mass destruction. Nuclear, chemical or \nbiological weapons--perhaps delivered by long-range guided missiles--\ncould cause more destruction in a week or even a day than we suffered \nin all of the Vietnam war.\n  The United States has many nonproliferation and counterproliferation \nprograms, but there are cracks in our organization for combating this \nterrible scourge.\n  The Commission to Assess the Organization of the Federal Government \nto Combat the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction, also know \nas the ``Deutch Commission,'' has found those cracks.\n  Yesterday the Commission gave America a blueprint for repairing them. \nWe dare not ignore its analysis, any more than we would ignore termites \nin our homes.\n  My colleague and friend from Pennsylvania, Senator Arlen Specter, \nalso deserves special recognition today. The Commission was his idea; \nhe secured its establishment and later ensured its continued existence. \nAs Vice Chairman of the Commission, he worked to ensure that its \nrecommendations would be practical and politically feasible.\n  Today Senator Specter is introducing legislation to implement one of \nthe Deutch Commission recommendations: that we require electronic \nfiling of Shippers' Export Declarations on a secure, Internet-based \nsystem.\n  This legislation will provide more timely and usable data for non-\nproliferation analysis by executive branch agencies, without causing \nany significant burden for exporters or endangering the traditional \nconfidentiality of Shippers' Export Declarations.\n  I am pleased to be an initial cosponsor of this legislation and I am \nconfident that it will be enacted.\n  Shippers' Export Declarations are already required under chapter 9 of \ntitle 13, United States Code. The content of those Declarations is \nprescribed in part 30 of title 15, Code of Federal Regulations. This \nlegislation will not require any reporting by industry that is not \nalready mandated under those regulations.\n  There is also an existing Automated Export System, but its use is \nvoluntary and it has not gained much acceptance. This bill will require \nthat shippers use an Internet-based Automated Export System, once it is \ncertified as being secure and capable of handling the expected volume \nof information that would be filed.\n  I want to assure U.S. companies, as I have been assured, that this \nlegislation will not cause difficulties for them. Exporters will have \non-line assistance in filing their Declarations and will be able to \ndouble-check their Declarations for accuracy after filing them.\n  In addition, the Director of the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology, which maintains the security of unclassified Federal \nGovernment communications, must join in certifying that the Internet-\nbased Automated Export System is ready for use and has been \nsuccessfully tested.\n  That will ensure the continued confidentiality of these Declarations.\n  This is hardly a revolutionary bill. Rather, it is one discrete, \nrational measure that is needed to improve our defense against the \nspread of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons to countries or \ngroups that could otherwise rain chaos and destruction upon our country \nand the whole world.\n  We simply must take this step, along with others recommended by the\n\n[[Page S8633]]\n\nDeutch Commission. For our own sake and for our children's sake as \nwell, we absolutely must respond to the challenge of proliferation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 1373. A bill to increase monitoring of the use of offsets in \ninternational defense trade; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                 defense offsets disclosure act of 1999\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwill help clarify the difficult subject of the use of offsets in \ninternational defense trade. This little known practice has a \npotentially tremendous impact on our domestic industry, international \ntrade, and national security, yet is barely understood by either the \npublic or private sectors. My bill, the ``Defense Offsets Disclosure \nAct of 1999'' seeks to expand the monitoring and reporting of offsets \nuse so that policy makers and the public can better understand the \nimpact on our economy.\n  Mr. President, what are offsets? Offsets are the entire range of \nindustrial and commercial benefits that are provided to foreign \ngovernments as inducements, or conditions, for the purchase of military \ngoods and services. Among techniques used to meet offset requirements \nare co-production, subcontracting, technology transfers, in-country \nprocurement, marketing and financial assistance, and joint ventures. In \nother words, they are largely non-cash ``sweeteners'' attached to \nexport sales of large military [and occasionally civilian] products, \ntypically set forth in side agreements and provided to the purchasing \ncountry over a period of time.\n  My legislation would offer several measures to get a handle on the \nwhole range of issues involved in the use of offsets:\n  First, my bill declares that it is the policy of the United States to \npursue better monitoring of offsets, to promote fairness in \ninternational trade; and to ensure an appropriate level of foreign \nparticipation in the production of United States weapons systems. To \nfully understand the implications of offsets and the extent of their \nimpact, we must have more information on offset agreements, \nparticularly the indirect offset obligations that are otherwise \ninvisible. While many of my colleagues can cite anecdotal evidence of \ncompanies harmed or jobs lost, we must develop a more effective \nmechanism to accurately quantify the impact of offsets.\n  Second, my bill expresses the sense of Congress that the Executive \nBranch should seek trade fairness through transparency and \nstandardization of the use of offsets in international defense trade. \nIn particular, the Secretaries of State and Commerce and the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative should raise the issues of transparency and \nstandardization bilaterally at all suitable venues, and our government \nshould initiate discussions on standards for use of offsets through \nappropriate multilateral fora. While some believe that offsets are a \nbusiness practice best left to business to handle, the nature of the \nproblem calls out for government-to-government discussion to ensure \nthat an even playing field exists for all stakeholders in the \ninternational defense trade.\n  Third, the bill establishes a new requirement for more detailed \ninformation on offsets in Congressional notifications of government-to-\ngovernment and commercial sales. Current law only requires notification \nof the existence of an offset agreement, with no details or follow up \ndescription of the measures used to fulfill the offset obligation. My \nbill will require a description of the offset agreement and its dollar \nvalue. It also calls for an additional report upon completion of an \noffset obligation which would identify all measures taken to fulfill \nthe offset agreement identified earlier in its pre-sale Congressional \nnotification. At least one defense contractor already has been willing \nto provide this information as part of its regular license application \nand has provided the size of the offset, its direct and indirect \ncomponents, and a rough estimate of the likely measures it would use to \nfulfill its offset obligations. My bill should elicit similar useful \ninformation on all offset agreements.\n  Fourth, the bill expands a prohibition on incentive payments that I \nauthored in 1993. That earlier provision prohibited the use of third \nparty incentive payments to secure offset agreements in any sale \nsubject to the Arms Export Control Act. My new bill expands the \nprohibition to include items ``exported'' or ``licensed''. The previous \nlanguage addressed only ``sales''. The incentive payments provision in \nmy bill should close any loopholes and clarify that incentive payments \nare not an acceptable component of any type of offset transaction.\n  Fifth, the bill requires the Administration to initiate a review to \ndetermine the feasibility, and the most effective means, of negotiating \nmultilateral agreements on standards for the use of offsets. It also \nmandates a report on the Administration's activities in the area. \nThrough international dialogue and coordination we can arrive at \nmultilateral standards for the use of offsets in defense trade \nagreements. Whether you believe that offsets are merely an annoying, \nbut ordinary, business practice, or hold the view that they pose a \nmajor long term threat to our labor force, our industries, and our \nnational security, I believe it is both possible and necessary to \ndevelop some common ground for business practices worldwide.\n  Sixth, the bill requires the President to establish a high-level, \nnonpartisan commission to review the full range of current practices; \nthe impact of the use of offsets; and the role of offsets in domestic \nindustry, trade competitiveness, national security, and the \nglobalization of the weapons industry. There needs to be broader public \nawareness and national debate by a range of concerned parties on the \nimplications of offsets. A June 29 hearing on offsets in the House \nSubcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy, and Human Resources, at \nwhich I testified, was a good start, but more still must be done.\n  Mr. President, I first discovered the murky world of offsets in 1993 \nwhen I learned that the Wisconsin-based Beloit Corporation, a \nsubsidiary of Harnischfeger Industries Inc., had been negatively \naffected by an apparent indirect offset arrangement between the \nNorthrop Corporation and the government of Finland. Beloit was one of \nonly three companies in the world that produced a particular type of \nlarge paper-making machine. In its efforts to sell one of these \nmachines to the International Paper Company, Beloit became aware that \nNorthrop had offered International Paper an incentive payment to select \ninstead the machine offered by a Finnish company, Valmet. Northrop was \npromoting the purchase of the Valmet machinery as part of an agreement \nthat would provide dollar-for-dollar offset credit on a deal with \nFinland to purchase sixty-four F-18 aircraft. This type of payment had \nthe flavor of a kickback, distorted the practice of free enterprise, \nand threatened U.S. jobs. By lowering its bid--barely breaking even on \nthe contract--to take into account the incentive payment offered by \nNorthrop, Beloit did succeed in winning the contract. Nevertheless, the \nincident demonstrated to me the potential for offset obligations to \nhave an impact on apparently unrelated domestic U.S. industries.\n  To address some of the immediate concerns raised by Beloit's \nexperience, as I mentioned earlier, in 1993 I offered an amendment \n(which passed into law in 1994), to the Arms Export Control Act to \nprohibit incentive payments in the provision of offset credit. I wanted \nto clarify the Congress' disapproval of an activity that appeared to \nfall through the cracks of various existing acts. Neither the Anti-\nKickback Act nor the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act seemed clearly to \naddress issues raised by the payment being offered to International \nPaper in the Beloit case. The measure also expanded the requirements \nfor Congressional notification of the existence, and to the extent \npossible, information on any offset agreement at the time of \nCongressional notification of a pending arms sale under the Arms Export \nControl Act. Last year, I offered additional language to expand further \nthe prohibition on incentive payments and enhance the reporting \nrequirement on offsets to include a description of the offset with \ndollar amounts. While my provisions were incorporated in the Security \nAssistance Act of 1998 as passed by the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, the legislation never made it to the floor.\n\n[[Page S8634]]\n\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, while Congress has tried to address \nspecific problems encountered by companies in our states and districts, \nefforts to date have barely scratched the surface of the difficult \nsubject of offsets. In fact, neither the legislative nor the executive \nbranches has a full grasp of the breadth and complexity of the issue, \nalthough I know many are concerned about the potential impact of the \nuse of offsets. From what we do know, it appears that there are several \nkey areas affected by the practice of using offsets:\n  The domestic labor force and defense industrial base, particularly in \nthe aerospace industry, impacted by the increasing role of overseas \nproduction in the defense industry;\n  The non-defense industrial sectors unintentionally harmed, as in the \nBeloit case, when defense contractors engage in indirect offset \nobligations;\n  The breadth of the U.S. economy potentially influenced by the growing \nglobalization of the defense industry; and\n  The national security possibly threatened by joint ventures and \ngrowing reliance on foreign defense contractors, a concern recently \nhighlighted in the Cox report on China's technology acquisition.\n  Mr. President, I believe my bill will allow us to collect better \ninformation on the use of offsets, to engage in an informed discussion \non both the problem and viable policy options, and to encourage \nmultilateral efforts to find common standards and solutions that will \nbenefit us all. Only through these efforts can we hope to get a clear \npicture of the complex offset issue and ensure that their use does not \nproduce negative consequences for the American labor force, the \ndomestic industrial base, or our national security.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                S. 1373\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Defense Offsets Disclosure \n     Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A fair business environment is necessary to advance \n     international trade, economic stability, and development \n     worldwide, is beneficial for American workers and businesses, \n     and is in the United States national interest.\n       (2) Mandated offset requirements can cause economic \n     distortions in international defense trade and sabotage \n     fairness and competitiveness, and may cause particular harm \n     to small- and medium-sized businesses.\n       (3) The stated goal of supporting the national security \n     needs of allied countries by assisting their defense \n     industries through the use of offsets may no longer be \n     sufficient justification for the practice.\n       (4) The use of offsets may lead to increasing dependence on \n     foreign suppliers for the production of United States weapons \n     systems.\n       (5) The offset demands required by some purchasing \n     countries, including some of the United States closest \n     allies, equal or exceed the value of the base contract they \n     are intended to offset, mitigating much of the potential \n     economic benefit of the exports.\n       (6) Offset demands often unduly inflate the prices of \n     defense contracts.\n       (7) In some cases, United States contractors are required \n     to provide indirect offsets which can negatively impact \n     nondefense industrial sectors.\n       (8) Unilateral efforts by the United States to prohibit \n     offsets may be impractical in the current era of \n     globalization and would severely hinder the competitiveness \n     of the United States defense industry in the global market.\n       (9) The development of global standards to manage and \n     restrict demands for offsets would enhance United States \n     efforts to mitigate the negative impact of offsets.\n       (b) Declaration of Policy.--Congress declares that the \n     United States policy is to develop a workable system to \n     monitor the use of offsets in the defense industry, to \n     promote fairness in international trade, and to ensure an \n     appropriate level of foreign participation in production of \n     United States weapons systems.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the executive branch should pursue efforts to address \n     trade fairness by making transparent and establishing \n     standards for the use of offsets in international business \n     transactions among United States trading partners and \n     competitors;\n       (2) the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, and \n     the United States Trade Representative, or their designees, \n     should raise the need for transparency and other standards \n     bilaterally with other industrialized nations at every \n     suitable venue; and\n       (3) the United States Government should enter into \n     discussions regarding the establishment of multilateral \n     standards for the control of the use of offsets in \n     international defense trade through the appropriate \n     multilateral fora, including such organizations as the \n     Transatlantic Economic Partnership, the Wassenaar \n     Arrangement, the G-8, and the World Trade Organization.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to authorize the development and maintenance of a \nmultiagency campus project in the town of Jackson, Wyoming; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n            multi-agency visitor campus in jackson, wyoming\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill today to \nauthorize the development and maintenance of a multi-agency campus in \nthe town of Jackson, Wyoming.\n  The management of our public lands and natural resources is often \ncomplicated and requires the coordination of many individuals to \naccomplish desired objectives. When western folks discuss federal land \nissues, we do not often have an opportunity to identify proposals that \ncapture this type of consensus and enjoy the support from a wide array \nof interests; however, the multi-agency campus offers just such a \nunique prospect. As local, state and federal officials attempt to \nprovide services to the public, they have identified a need to develop \na campus in Jackson, Wyoming that offers visitors ``one stop shopping'' \nservice for wildlife, tourism and resource issues.\n  The multi-agency campus includes a wildlife interpretive center, \nfacilities for public programs, walkways, bike paths, museum space, and \noffice locations for Wyoming Game and Fish, U.S. Forest Service and the \nlocal chamber of commerce. There are several entities involved with \nthis effort--U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Forest Service, \nWyoming Game and Fish, National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife, \nU.S. Department of Interior, Teton County, Town of Jackson, Jackson \nChamber of Commerce and the Jackson Hole Historical Society. Project \ncoordinators and involved parties have spent a great deal of time \nincorporating the concerns of various individuals through public \nmeetings and by presenting their plans to agency and congressional \nrepresentatives.\n  This legislation is needed to improve communication between the \nfederal agencies and related entities, and reduce costs to federal, \nstate and local governments as they attempt to address public needs. \nSpecifically, the bill would allow the U.S. Forest Service to transfer \na small parcel of their land within the proposed campus boundaries to \nthe Town of Jackson in exchange for the Town constructing a new \nadministrative facility for the agency.\n  Mr. President, this bill enjoys the support of many different groups \nincluding federal agencies, state organizations and officials, as well \nas the local community. It is my hope that the Senate will seize this \nopportunity to improve upon efforts to provide services to the American \npublic.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1374\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Jackson Multi-Agency Campus \n     Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nprovide that aliens who commit act of torture abroad are inadmissible \nand removable and to establish within the Criminal Division of the \nDepartment of Justice an Office of Special Investigations having \nresponsibilities under that Act with respect to all alien participants \nin act of genocide and torture abroad; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                the anti-atrocity alien deportation act\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the recent events in Kosovo have been a \ngraphic reminder that crimes against humanity did not end with the \nSecond World War. Our treatment of those persecuted by the Nazis has \nlong been regarded as a travesty. Blatant American anti-Semitism led to \npost-war immigration quotas that virtually shut out Jews coming from \nconcentration camps while embracing German sympathizers.\n  In contrast to this country's dismal record in accepting Jewish \nrefugees following the last world war, the United States has tried \nharder and done better in recent years to provide refuge to those \npersons fleeing homelands that have been ravaged by violence. For \nexample, over the past five years, approximately 83,247 Bosnian \nrefugees have been admitted to this country. During the latest \nhostilities in Kosovo, the Clinton Administration provided leadership \nto other nations by pledging\n\n[[Page S8637]]\n\nto take in as many as 20,000 Kosovar refugees.\n  Unfortunately, criminals who wielded machetes and guns against \ninnocent civilians in countries like Haiti, Yugoslavia and Rwanda have \nbeen able to gain entry to the United States through the same doors \nthat we have opened to deserving refugees. We need to lock that door to \nthose war criminals who seek a safe haven in the United States. And to \nthose war criminals who are already here, we should promptly show them \nthe door out.\n  Our country has long provided the template and moral leadership for \ndealing with Nazi war criminals. The Justice Department has a \nspecialized unit, the Offfice of Special Investigations (OSI), which \nwas created to hunt down, prosecute and remove Nazi war criminals who \nhad slipped into the United States among their victims under the \nDisplaced Persons Act. Since the OSI's inception in 1979, 61 Nazi \npersecutors have been stripped of U.S. citizenship, 49 such individuals \nhave been removed from the United States, and more than 150 have been \ndenied entry.\n  OSI was created almost 35 years after the end of World War II and it \nremains authorized only to track Nazi war criminals. Little is being \ndone about the new generation of international war criminals living \namong us, and these delays are costly. As any prosecutor--or, in my \ncase, former prosecutor--knows instinctively, such delays make \ndocumentary and testimonial evidence more difficult to obtain. Stale \ncases are the hardest to make.\n  We should not repeat the mistake of waiting decades before tracking \ndown war criminals and human rights abusers who have settled in this \ncountry. War criminals should find no sanctuary in loopholes in our \ncurrent immigration policies and enforcement. No war criminal should \never come to believe that he is going to find safe harbor in the United \nStates.\n\n  Too often, once war criminals slip through the immigration nets, they \nremain in the United States, unpunished for their crimes. In Vermont, \nnews reports indicate that a Bosnian-Muslim man suspected of \nparticipating in ethnic cleansing during the Serbian war now is in \nBurlington. He has been identified by many people, including his own \nrelatives, as a member of a Serbian paramilitary group responsible for \nthe torture, rape, and murder of countless innocent people. We see the \npossibility that refugees now may encounter their persecutors thousands \nof miles away from their homeland, walking the streets of America.\n  This is not an isolated occurrence. The center for Justice and \nAccountability, a San Francisco human rights group, has identified \napproximately sixty suspected human rights violators now living in the \nUnited States. We have unwittingly sheltered the oppressors along with \nthe oppressed for too long. We should not let this situation continue. \nWe waited too long after the last world war to focus prosecutorial \nresources and attention on Nazi war criminals who entered this country \non false pretenses. We should not repeat that mistake for other aliens \nwho engaged in human rights abuses before coming to the United States. \nWe need to focus the attention of our law enforcement investigators to \nprosecute and deport those who have committed atrocities abroad and who \nnow enjoy safe harbor in the United States.\n  Despite U.S. ratification of the United Nations' ``Convention Against \nTorture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \nPunishment,'' current immigration law provides that those who \nparticipated in Nazi war crimes and genocide are inadmissible to and \nare removable from the United States, yet those who have committed the \ncriminal act of torture are not. This leads to cases like that of \nKelbessa Negewo, a member of the military dictatorship ruling Ethiopia \nin the 1970s, who has been found guilty of torture in a private civil \naction by an American court but who remains in the United States \nnonetheless because the Immigration and Naturalization Act does not \nprovide explicit authority to investigate, denaturalize or remove him. \nThe Leahy ``Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act'' would close this \nloophole and make those who commit torture abroad inadmissible to and \ndeportable from our country.\n  The ``Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act,'' which I introduce today \nwith Senator Kohl, would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nexpand the grounds for inadmissibility and deportation to cover aliens \nwho have engaged in acts of torture abroad. ``Torture'' is already \ndefined in the Federal criminal code, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2340, in a law \npassed as part of the implementing legislation for the ``Convention \nAgainst Torture.'' Under this Convention, the United States has an \naffirmative duty to prosecute torturers within its boundaries \nregardless of their respective nationalities. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2340A \n(1994).\n  This legislation would also provide statutory authorization for OSI, \nwhich currently owes its existence to an Attorney General order, and \nwould expand its jurisdiction to authorize investigations, \nprosecutions, and removal of any alien who participated in torture and \ngenocide abroad--not just Nazis. The success of OSI is hunting Nazi war \ncriminals demonstrates the effectiveness of centralized resources and \nexpertise in these cases. OSI has worked, and it is time to update its \nmission.\n  The knowledge of the people, politics and pathologies of particular \nregimes engaged in genocide and human rights abuses is often necessary \nfor effective prosecutions of these cases and may best be accomplished \nby the concentrated efforts of a single office, rather than in \npiecemeal litigation around the country or in offices that have more \ndiverse missions.\n  Unquestionably, the need to bring Nazi war criminals to justice \nremains a matter of great importance. Funds would not be derived from \nthe OSI's current mission. Additional resources are authorized in the \nbill for OSI's expanded duties.\n  I have for many years sought to advance the search for war criminals \nwho have clandestinely immigrated to our country. In 1996, the moving \ntestimony of esteemed individuals like Rabbi Marvin Hier (the dean and \nfounder of the Simon Wisenthal Center) led me to work closely on the \ndrafting of the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act. More recently, I helped \nto ensure that the OSI would be able to further its efforts in \ninvestigating and denaturalizing Nazi war criminals with a budget \nincrease of two million dollars for 1999, and I am attempting to do the \nsame for the Year 2000.\n  I have also supported a strong and effective War Crimes Tribunal--\nwith the necessary funds and authority to fully apprehend and prosecute \nwar criminals. Expanding the mission of OSI, combined with a vigorous \nWar Crimes Tribunal, represents a full-scale, two-prong assault on war \ncriminals, wherever they may hide.\n  We must honor and respect the unique experiences of those who were \nvictims in the darkest moment in world history. The Anti-Defamation \nLeague has expressed its support for my bill. We may help honor the \nmemories of the victims of the Holocaust by pursuing all war criminals \nwho enter our country. By so doing, the United States can provide moral \nleadership and show that we will not tolerate perpetrators of genocide \nand torture, least of all here.\n  In sum, the Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act would:\n  Bar admission into the United States and authorize the deportation of \naliens who have engaged in acts of torture abroad.\n  Provide statutory authorization for and expand the jurisdiction of \nthe Office of Special Investigations (so-called ``Nazi war criminal \nhunters'') with the Department of Justice to investigate, prosecute and \nremove any alien who participated in torture and genocide abroad--not \njust Nazis; and\n  Authorize additional funding to ensure that OSI has adequate \nresources to fulfill its current mission of hunting Nazi war criminals.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a sectional \nanalysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1375\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Anti-Atrocity Alien \n     Deportation Act''.\n\n[[Page S8638]]\n\n     SEC. 2. INADMISSIBILITY AND REMOVABILITY OF ALIENS WHO HAVE \n                   COMMITTED ACTS OF TORTURE ABROAD.\n\n       (a) Inadmissibility.--Section 212(a)(3)(E) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(E)) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(iii) Commission of acts of torture.--Any alien who, \n     outside the United States, has committed any act of torture, \n     as defined in section 2340 of title 18, United States Code, \n     is inadmissible.''.\n       (b) Removability.--Section 237(a)(4)(D) of that Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1227(a)(4)(D)) is amended by striking ``clause (i) or \n     (ii)'' and inserting ``clause (i), (ii), or (iii)''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to offenses committed before, on, or after the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE OFFICE OF SPECIAL \n                   INVESTIGATIONS.\n\n       (a) Amendment of the Immigration and Nationality Act.--\n     Section 103 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1103) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(g) The Attorney General shall establish within the \n     Criminal Division of the Department of Justice an Office of \n     Special Investigations with the authority of investigating, \n     and, where appropriate, taking legal action to remove, \n     denaturalize, or prosecute any alien found to be in violation \n     of clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of section 212(a)(3)(E).''.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--\n       (1) In general.--There are authorized to be appropriated to \n     the Department of Justice for the fiscal year 2000 such sums \n     as may be necessary to carry out the additional duties \n     established under section 103(g) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (as added by this Act) in order to ensure \n     that the Office of Special Investigations fulfills its \n     continuing obligations regarding Nazi war criminals.\n       (2) Availability of funds.--Amounts appropriated pursuant \n     to paragraph (1) are authorized to remain available until \n     expended.\n                                  ____\n\n\n    Sectional Analysis of Leahy Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act\n\n       Summary: This bill would make two significant changes in \n     our country's enforcement capability against those who have \n     committed atrocities abroad and then entered the United \n     States. First, the bill would amend the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act to expand the grounds for inadmissibility and \n     deportation to cover aliens who have engaged in acts of \n     torture, as defined in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2340, abroad. Second, \n     the bill would direct the Attorney General to establish the \n     Office of Special Investigations (OSI) within the Criminal \n     Division and expand the current OSI's authority to \n     investigate, prosecute, and remove any alien who participated \n     in torture and genocide abroad, not just Nazi war criminals.\n       Sec. 1. Short Title. The Act may be cited as the ``Anti-\n     Atrocity Alien Deportation Act.''\n       Sec. 2. Admissibility and Removability of Aliens Who Have \n     Committed Acts of Torture Abroad. Currently, the Immigration \n     and Nationality Act provides that (i) participants in Nazi \n     persecutions during the time period from March 23, 1933 to \n     May 8, 1945, and (ii) aliens who engaged in genocide, are \n     inadmissable to the United States and deportable. See 8 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1182(a)(3)(E)(i) and Sec. 1227(a)(4)(D). The bill \n     would amend these sections of the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act by expanding the grounds for inadmissibility and \n     deportation to cover aliens who have engaged in acts of \n     torture abroad. The United Nations' ``Convention Against \n     Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \n     Punishment'' entered into force with respect to the United \n     States on November 20, 1994. This Convention, and the \n     implementing legislation, the Torture Victims Protection Act, \n     18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2340 et seq., includes the definition of \n     ``torture'' incorporated in the bill and imposed an \n     affirmative duty on the United States to prosecute tortures \n     within its jurisdiction.\n       Sec. 3. Establishment of the Office of Special \n     Investigations. Attorney General Civiletti established OSI in \n     1979 within the Criminal Division of the Department of \n     Justice, consolidating within it all ``investigative and \n     litigation activities involving individuals, who prior to and \n     during World War II, under the supervision of or in \n     association with the Nazi government of Germany, its allies, \n     and other affiliatated [sic] governments, are alleged to have \n     ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the \n     persecution of any person because of race, religion, national \n     origin, or political opinion.'' (Att'y Gen. Order No. 851-\n     79). The OSI's mission continues to be limited by that \n     Attorney General Order.\n       This section would amend the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act, 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1103, by directing the Attorney General to \n     establish an Office of Special Investigations within the \n     Department of Justice with authorization to investigate, \n     remove, denaturalize, or prosecute any alien who has \n     participated in torture or genocide abroad. This would expand \n     OSI's current authorized mission. Additional funds are \n     authorized for these expanded duties to ensure that OSI \n     fulfills its continuing obligations regarding Nazi war \n     criminals.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS:\n  S. 1376. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to impose \na value added tax and to use the receipts from the tax to reduce \nFederal debt and to ensure the solvency of the Social Security System; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n  deficit and debt reduction and social security solvency act of 1999\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this charade has gone far enough. \nThe economy gives indications of overheating causing the Federal \nReserve to increase interest rates, and now both the President and the \nCongress are in a foot race to cut taxes to make sure the economy \ncatches fire. Rather than a surplus, the President's OMB Mid-Session \nReview on page 42 projects an increase in the debt each year for five \nyears, and on page 43, by computation, an increase in the debt of \n$1.883.4 trillion over fifteen years. Some suggest cutting spending; \nothers downsizing the government. The Democrats did both in 1993 and \nlost the Congress in 1994. Now, neither Republicans nor Democrats will \nvote to make substantial cuts and what's really needed is a tax \nincrease. When Lyndon Johnson last balanced the budget the national \ndebt was less than $1 trillion and interest costs of $16 billion. Now, \nCBO projects a deficit this year of $5.6 trillion with interest costs \nof $356 billion. We have increased spending since President Johnson's \ntime $340 billion each year for nothing. A fiscal cancer. To excise \nthis fiscal cancer, to put government on a pay-as-you-go basis, \nspending cuts and a tax increase will be necessary. A value added tax \nof 5 percent dedicated to eliminating the debt and stabilizing Social \nSecurity is in order. It would promote a very much needed paradigm of \nsaving. More than that, it would eliminate a substantial disadvantage \nin international trade. The deficit in the balance of trade nears $300 \nbillion this year. Every industrial country except the United States \nhas a VAT which is rebated at the port of departure. Articles produced \nin Europe enter the United States market with a 15 percent rebated \nadvantage, and from Korea 25 percent. All this talk of surpluses and \ntax cuts misleads the American public. What we really should be doing \nin good times is paying down the National Debt. This bill that I am \nintroducing today will do the trick.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                            By Mr. BENNETT:\n\n  S. 1377. A bill to amend the Central Utah Project Completion Act \nregarding the use of funds for water development for the Bonneville \nUnit, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n           central utah project completion amendment of 1999\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \nwhich amends the Central Utah Project Completion Act. This is a simple \nbill and I hope my colleagues will support it.\n  My father was elected to the Senate in 1950 and it was during that \ntime that legislation was passed that created the Central Utah Project. \nDuring his 24 years in the Senate, my father fought to win the initial \nauthorizations as well as provide the annual appropriations for the \nvarious projects. Were it not for the foresight of planners in the \n1950s, Utah would be grappling with severe water shortages for both \nagricultural and municipal purposes today.\n  In 1992, the Central Utah Project was reauthorized with the passage \nof the Central Utah Project Completion Act of 1992 (CUPCA). As part of \nthe 1992 Act, CUPCA provided strict authorization levels for each \nproject and program. Seven years after the passage of the \nreauthorization bill, planning has neared completion on these projects. \nDuring that time, we have learned several things. First, we are pleased \nthat the District and the Bureau have saved money on other projects \nauthorized under CUPCA. At the same time, many of us were surprised how \nsuccessful the water conservation activities have been. They have been \nso successful that it appears we are on track to reach the authorized \nfunding in the near future. We have also learned that the acquisition \nof water rights and instream flows are inadequate in other areas.\n  Recognizing that there are shortfalls in some areas and significant \nsavings achieved in other areas, this legislation simply amends the \ncurrent law to permit the use of savings achieved in certain areas to \nbe spent on other projects and programs where needed. By doing so, we \ncan ensure that the projects can be completed in a timely and cost-\neffective manner.\n\n[[Page S8639]]\n\n  By passing this legislation we can continue the progress made in \ncompleting the Central Utah Project. I hope my colleagues will support \nthis bill and I look forward to working with the members of the Energy \nCommittee to bring it to the floor for consideration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH (for himself and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 1378. A bill to amend chapter 35 of title 44, United States Code, \nfor the purposes of facilitating compliance by small businesses with \ncertain Federal paperwork requirements, to establish a task force to \nexamine the feasibility of streamlining paperwork requirements \napplicable to small businesses, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n               THE SMALL BUSINESS PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small \nBusiness Paperwork Reduction Act, legislation that will give small \nbusinesses across the nation the time they need to correct first-time \npaperwork violations before federal fines are assessed When enacted, \nthe provisions of this law would apply as long as the violations do not \ncause serious harm or threaten public health or safety. I am pleased to \nbe joined in this effort by my colleague from Arkansas, Senator Blanche \nLambert-Lincoln.\n  To own one's business is, for many, the epitome of the American \ndream, knowing that you are your own boss and that you alone are \nresponsible for the success of your business. It's what motivates \nthousands of individuals each week to take that initial leap of faith \nand it is their effort and their perseverance to succeed that \nconstitute the economic and entrepreneurial backbone of this country.\n  Small business owners are reponsible for the employment of millions \nof individuals, providing the roots for families to settle in small \ntowns and large cities all across America. Through their payroll \ncontributions and their tax base, small businesses--whether it's a shoe \nstore in Cleveland, Ohio or a diner in Arkadelphia, Arkansas--make up \nthe final nucleus of many a community.\n  However, even with their many contributions, small business owners \nface a number of obstacles to success. One of the larger obstacles they \nface is the daunting task of meeting federal paperwork requirements. \nSmall business owners spend an inordinate amount of their time filling \nout various forms to comply with a myriad of government requirements. \nIn fact, small business owners spend about $229 billion per year on \ncompliance costs and some 6.7 billion hours are used annually to fill \nout the expected paperwork.\n  In addition, according to the National Federation of Independent \nBusiness (NFIB), small business owners are subjected to 63% of the \nnation's regulatory burden, and the paperwork regulations they are \nsubjected to cost more than $2,000 per employee.\n  I believe whatever we can do to relieve the burden on the small \nbusiness men and women of our nation will help increase productivity, \nsave money and create more jobs. Obviously, to obtain these benefits \nnecessitates a review of our paperwork requirements on our nation's \nsmall businesses.\n  When Congress passed the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, many small \nbusiness owners believed they would finally obtain relief from the \nblizzard of paper to which they are subjected. Unfortunately, it has \ndone too little to stem the tide of Federal paperwork requirements. In \n1996, the Act was supposed to reduce the amount of paper by 10%. \nInstead, it was only a 2.6% * * * .\n  When Congress passed the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, many small \nbusiness owners believed they would finally obtain relief from the \nblizzard of paper to which they are subjected. Unfortunately, it has \ndone too little to stem the tide of federal paperwork requirements. In \n1996, the Act was supposed to reduce the amount of paper by 10%. \nInstead, it was only 2.6% reduction. In 1997, the Act was supposed to \nprovide another 10% reduction in the amount of paper. Instead, there \nwas a 2.3% increase. In 1998, the Act was supposed to provide another \n5% reduction in the amount of paper. Instead, there was another 1% \nincrease.\n  In addition, under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness \nAct (SBREFA) of 1996, federal agencies were required to submit plans to \nCongress by March of 1998 for waiving and/or reducing fines as deemed \nappropriate for small business. However, a large majority of federal \nagencies, including at least half-a-dozen cabinet departments, did not \neven submit their plans by the March 1998 deadline. In addition, of the \nplans submitted, most are settlement policies, which force small \nbusinesses into negotiations to reduce or eliminate penalties rather \nthan to help small businesses comply with paperwork reductions.\n  Mr. President, even with all the forms that they are required to fill \nout, and all the time it takes to complete them, small business owners \nwant to comply with the laws of our nation. Their biggest concern, \nthough, is the Sword of Damocles that hangs over them should they send \nin an incorrect form, or worse, not send one in at all. In the latter \ninstance, it is almost always because they didn't know that they were \nsupposed to fill out any paperwork, and unfortunately, it is such \nsituations that generally bring about hefty fines for small business \nowners.\n  Clearly, we have an opportunity to help these business owners, and, \nin turn, help continue the growth of our strong U.S. economy, maintain \nstable and productive jobs and create new jobs and opportunities.\n  The legislation that Senator Lincoln and I are introducing, the Small \nBusiness Paperwork Reduction Act, is a companion bill to H.R. 391, \nwhich passed the House on February 11, 1999 by a vote of 274-151. Like \nthe House-passed bill, our legislation will give small business owners \na ``grace period'' to make amends for first-time paperwork violations \nbefore fines are assessed. The only exceptions would be for violations \nthat cause harm, affect internal revenue laws or involve criminal \nactivity. If a violation threatens public health or safety, each \naffected agency of jurisdiction would have the discretion to levy a \nfine as usual, or provide a 24-hour window to correct the infraction.\n  In addition, our bill would establish a multi-agency task force to \nstudy how to streamline reporting requirements for small business; \nestablish a point of contact at each federal agency that small \nbusinesses could contact regarding paperwork requirements; and require \nan annual comprehensive list of all federal paperwork requirements for \nsmall business to be placed on the Internet.\n  So there is no confusion--our bill does not give small business \nowners carte blanch to skip their record keeping and reporting \nrequirements. Thus, firefighters will not be threatened with injury on \nthe job because a business doesn't have records of the toxic substances \nit has on its premises, or an elderly patient in a nursing home will be \nsecure in the knowledge that their medical records will be maintained.\n  As I stated earlier, the men and women of America who own small \nbusinesses do not embark on a course of flagrantly violating the laws \nof our nation. If they did, they would soon be out of business and \nprobably in jail. They just want an opportunity to make up what they \ndidn't do or correct what they've done wrong.\n  Mr. President, compliance through cooperation should be the way our \nfederal agencies do business, however, in many instances, federal \nagencies are all too eager to ``fine first, ask questions later.'' This \nlegislation will give our nation's small business owners the time they \nneed to correct small, non-threatening paperwork mistakes without \nhaving to pay a penalty that could jeopardize their very business.\n  Our legislation is a sensible approach that has the support of the \nNational Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), the voice of small \nbusiness owners across the country, who have written to me in support \nof this legislation. I urge my colleagues to co-sponsor our bill and I \nencourage the Senate to act expeditiously.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the NFIB in support of \nthis legislation be inserted into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S8640]]\n\n\n                                            National federation of\n\n\n                                         Independent Business,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 15, 1999.\n     Hon. George Voinovich,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Voinovich: On behalf of the 600,000 members of \n     the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), I \n     want to thank you and Senator Lincoln for your leadership in \n     introducing the Small Business Paperwork Reduction Act \n     Amendments of 1999.\n       The federal paperwork burden consistently ranks among the \n     top small business concerns in the NFIB ``Small Business \n     Problems and Priorities'' survey. In fact, the burden of \n     regulatory compliance is as much as 50 percent more for small \n     businesses than their larger counterparts. In addition, it is \n     estimated that paperwork alone accounts for one-third of \n     regulatory compliance costs. Small businesses spent \n     approximately 7 billion hours filling out federal paperwork \n     in 1998, with the total paperwork burden estimated at $229 \n     billion. It is clear that the burden of government paperwork \n     hinders the ability of small businesses to grow and create \n     new jobs.\n       The Voinovich-Lincoln bill will provide small businesses \n     with a penalty waiver for a first-time paperwork violation, \n     provided that it does not threaten public health, safety or \n     the environment. This waiver is only applicable if the \n     business owner corrects the violation in a reasonable time \n     period. The bill would also establish a task force of agency \n     representatives to study streamlining reporting requirements \n     for small businesses.\n       We believe that this incremental and responsible bill can \n     be signed into law this year. A similar bill was passed by a \n     bipartisan majority in the House, laying the groundwork for \n     Senate action. We look forward to working with you for Senate \n     passage and enactment of this bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Dan Danner,\n                            Vice President, Federal Public Policy.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Would my colleague from Ohio kindly answer a few \nquestions regarding this bill?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I would be happy to discuss the bill with my \ndistinguished colleague.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Thank you. I have heard some concerns voiced about this \nbill, namely how it could impact nursing homes and fire fighters. I \nhope you can clarify for me how regulations applicable to these groups \nwould be impacted by the Small Business Paperwork Reduction Act, if at \nall.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Certainly, I would be happy to clear up the \nmisconceptions that this bill might endanger firefighters and nursing \nhome patients.\n  Some have claimed that this bill would encourage fraud or abuse of \nelderly nursing home patients by allowing a penalty waiver for those \nwho violate rules regulating their care. Still others have claimed that \nthe bill would threaten the lives of firefighters by allowing a waiver \nfor businesses that violate rules regulating hazardous substances in \nthe workplace. Neither of these claims is substantiated.\n  Like the Senator from Arkansas, I care very much about the health and \nsafety of all Americans and would not dream of putting seniors or \nfirefighters in obvious jeopardy. Clearly, this is not the kind of \nnegligent misbehavior this bill aims to reward with a civil penalty \nwaiver for a first-time paperwork violation. And this is not the kind \nof violation covered by this bill.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. How can my colleague be certain that this kind of \ntragedy is not protected from civil penalty under this bill?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Allow me to explain. Nursing homes that do not keep \nproper medical and treatment records for their patients are clearly \nendangering human health and safety. Small businesses that do not keep \nthe required records of hazardous chemicals are also endangering human \nhealth and safety. As such, neither is covered by this bill.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. So what my colleague is saying is that any violation \nthat causes actual danger to human health and safety is exempted from \ncoverage by this bill.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. This bill goes even further than that. The language \nstates that any violation that has ``the potential to cause serious \nharm to the public interest'' is exempt from this bill and cannot \nreceive a penalty waiver. Where there is a potential to cause serious \nharm to the public, the agencies will be able to impose, in addition to \nall of their other remedies, an appropriate civil fine.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. As the Senator from Ohio knows, he and I are working \ntogether on another piece of legislation that would protect the powers \nof states and impose accountability for Federal preemption of state and \nlocal laws. Does this bill preempt state laws?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. My colleague raises a good point. This bill does not \npreempt state laws regarding collection of information. What it does \nsay is that states my not impose a civil penalty on small businesses \nfor a first-time violation under Federal laws that the State may \nadminister.\n  Again--I want to make clear--this bill does not preempt state laws. \nInstead it provides consistency that a small business will not be fined \nunder Federal laws whether the laws are being carried out by Federal or \nState government.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank my colleague for these clarifications. I am \npleased to hear that this bill will help reduce the paperwork burden \nfrom our nation's small businesses while protecting the health and \nsafety of our nursing home and firefighter communities, and I look \nforward to working with him to pass this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 1379.

It \nuses up the $780 billion over 10 years. I am introducing it tonight, \nand tomorrow I will speak on it. I hope some Senators will look at it \nfrom the standpoint of a balanced approach to moving toward some \nsimplification and, at the same time, doing some of the things that \nwill be fair, equitable, and good for our economy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1379\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am very pleased to join Senators Snowe \nand Reid as a cosponsor of the resolution congratulating the U.S. \nWomen's Soccer Team on their wonderful performance in the 1999 World \nCup tournament. Through hard work and dedication, they have achieved \nthe ultimate goal and placed first in the world. This is truly a feat \nthat will inspire women throughout our country to strive to their \nhighest aspirations.\n  The U.S. Women's Soccer Team will surely have an impact on America's \nalready rising numbers of young women and girls playing sports. They \nhave created a wave of excitement and pride throughout the country, in \nmen and women, boys and girls. All of the women who participated in the \nWorld Cup tournament are inspirations throughout the world, to women in \ntheir own countries and to women worldwide. Many young women share the \ndreams the women on the U.S. Women's Soccer Team had. The fact that \nthey were able to accomplish their dreams is an inspiration to all of \nus. Their win shows that if girls truly believe in themselves and their \nabilities, their dreams too can come true.\n  This U.S. Women's Soccer Team also embodies the success of Title IX, \na law enacted in 1972 to eliminate sexual discrimination in American \neducation and expand sports participation by girls and women. Without \nTitle IX, it is possible that such a success would never have occurred. \nIt is possible that these women would never have had the chance to play \nsoccer. It is possible that their talent would never have been \nrealized. Title IX gave them a chance. The success of Title IX was made \nespecially vivid in our team's victory.\n  Young women need positive role models as they are growing up. The \nU.S. Women's Soccer Team embodies such positive role models. They are \nwomen who do not work just for themselves but rather for each other and \nfor their team. Their success shows that women can achieve anything \nthey sincerely put their hearts and minds into. The U.S. Women's Soccer \nTeam has proven to young women that they can prevail not only in \nathletics, but in anything and everything through hard work and \ndedication. Such role models are invaluable.\n  So, yes, the 1999 U.S. Women's Soccer Team joins the ranks of the \nlandmark role models. They will go down in history as the first U.S. \nwomen's soccer team to win the World Cup. They will be remembered in \nthe same light as other women who have had a tremendous impact on our \nsociety.

Res. 153\n\n       Whereas, His Highness, Sheikh Jaber al-Sabah, the Amir of \n     Kuwait, issued a decree in May granting Kuwaiti women the \n     right to vote and to hold office in 2003;\n       Whereas, Amiri decrees in Kuwait must be approved by the \n     fifty member Kuwaiti national Parliament;\n       Whereas, the Kuwaiti people elected a new Parliament on \n     July 3;\n       Whereas, the new Parliament will convene on July 17 and \n     consider legislation to grant women the right to hold office \n     and the right to vote;\n       Whereas, the United States of America embraces democratic \n     principles and the importance of women's rights;\n       Whereas, the United States is strongly committed to \n     advancing the political rights of women, and democratic \n     principles throughout the Middle East; Now therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, that the Congress--\n       (1) comments His Highness, Sheikh Jaber al-Sabah, for \n     issuing his decree granting suffrage and the right to hold \n     office to Kuwaiti women,\n       (2) commends the women of Kuwait for their great strides \n     and continuing struggle toward political equality; and\n       (3) calls on the Kuwaiti Parliament to affirm women's \n     suffrage and the right to hold office of women in Kuwait.\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to submit a resolution \nthat urges the Parliament of Kuwait, sometime during its upcoming \nsession, to grant women the right to hold office and the right to vote. \nReal progress has been made in support of the democratic ideal of \nfuller participation for women in the political process there. The \nwomen of Kuwait enjoy many social and economic benefits, but have \nhistorically lacked one fundamental right: the right of political \nparticipation in their own country's emerging democracy.\n  I am proud to commend the Amir of Kuwait, His Highness, Sheikh Jaber \nal-Sabah, for his historic decision to issue a decree on May 16 to \ngrant Kuwait women the right to vote and to hold office starting in \n2003. Today in Kuwait, women lack the right to vote and to hold public \noffice. All of this could change in the coming weeks when a newly-\nelected Parliament will vote to confirm or reject the Amir's decision.\n  Mr. President, the decision of the Amir, though it will be granted \ngreat weight by the Parliament, is not final. Such royal decrees must \nbe confirmed by a parliamentary vote. Recently, the Amir dismissed \nParliament in Kuwait for inactivity and on July 3 Kuwait voted for new \nleaders. Now the men Parliament will vote on whether to confirm the \nright to vote and to hold office for Kuwaiti women in the coming weeks.\n  I am also proud to say that a woman named Fatima al-Abdali, a \ncourageous and passionate champion for women's rights in Kuwait, \nrecently became one of the first women to announce that she is running \nfor office in 2003. She is now one of at least seven women there who \nhave announced that they will run for office for the first time. She \nhas spent the last decade of her life fighting for the right to hold \noffice and to vote. Her efforts have finally paid off with the Amir's \nrecognition, as he has remarked, of ``the role played by Kuwaiti women \nin building and developing Kuwait society.''\n  This is a truly historic moment in the Middle East.\n  It is only fitting, Mr. President, that Americans should be moved by \nthe struggle of Kuwaiti women. The United States has been defined by \ngreat struggles for basic political rights: for the freedoms embodied \nin the Declaration of Independence and the Emancipation Proclamation; \nthe freedom central to the major civil rights legislation of this \ncentury, and to the struggle of women in our own country to achieve the \nright to vote and the right to hold public office. Sojourner Truth and \nSusan B. Anthony were great heroines of this nation. They fought the \nfight in this country that is currently being waged in Kuwait. In \nmemory of these crusaders for justice, I stand in strong support of \nKuwaiti women. I know I speak for my home state of Minnesota and the \nentire country when I support the struggle being waged by the women of \nKuwait.\n  Some people in the region are arguing that under Islamic tradition \nwomen should not have such political rights. Contrary to this opinion, \nmany experts believe that Islam does not prohibit the right for women \nto vote and to hold public office. In fact, Islamic history is filled \nwith prominent female figures.\n  Women in Kuwait are making great strides in business, government, \neducation, and the media. A woman is the Rector of Kuwait University. \nThe Under Secretary for Higher Education is a woman. A woman is the \nhead of the Kuwait news agency.\n  Now we are seeing women move forward and make significant political \nstrides as well. Armed with this Amiri decree, the women in Kuwait are \nbecoming prepared to seize the opportunity they have fought for. They \nare announcing campaigns for office in 2003. I ask that the members of \nthe new Parliament not turn their backs on history and vote against the \nAmiri decree allowing voting rights and the right to hold office.\n  I join the with leaders from across the world, including Egypt, Iran, \nPakistan, and Indonesia in my admiration and respect for the importance \nof this development. I hope Kuwait's new Parliament will have the \ncourage to take the historic step of affirming this decree.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/15/senate-section/article/S8653-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8653-S8654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 154--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY THE COMMITTEE ON \n                          GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON, from the Committee on Governmental Affairs, reported \nthe following original resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Rules and Administration:\n\n                              S.

PROTECTING PATIENTS AND ACCELERATING THEIR TREATMENT \n                   AND CARE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings with \n     respect to the expansion of medical malpractice liability \n     lawsuits in Senate bill 6 (106th Congress):\n       (1) The expansion of liability in S. 6 (106th Congress) \n     would not benefit patients and will not improve health care \n     quality.\n       (2) Expanding the scope of medical malpractice liability to \n     health plans and employers will force higher costs on \n     American families and their employers as a result of \n     increased litigation, attorneys' fees, administrative costs, \n     the costs of defensive coverage determinations, liability \n     insurance premium increases, and unlimited jury verdicts.\n       (3) Legal liability for health plans and employers is the \n     largest expansion of medical malpractice in history and the \n     most expensive provision of S. 6 (106th Congress), and would \n     increase costs ``on average, about 1.4 percent of the \n     premiums of all employer-sponsored plans,'' according to the \n     Congressional Budget Office.\n       (4) The expansion of medical malpractice lawsuits would \n     force employers to drop health coverage altogether, rather \n     than take the risk of jeopardizing the solvency of their \n     companies over lawsuits involving health claims.\n       (5) Seven out of 10 employers in the United States have \n     less than 10 employees, and only 26 percent of employees in \n     these small businesses have health insurance. Such businesses \n     already struggle to provide this coverage, and would be \n     devastated by one lawsuit, and thus, would be discouraged \n     from offering health insurance altogether.\n       (6) According to a Chamber of Commerce survey in July of \n     1998, 57 percent of small employers would be likely to drop \n     coverage if exposed to increased lawsuits. Other studies have \n     indicated that for every 1 percent real increase in premiums, \n     small business sponsorship of health insurance drops by 2.6 \n     percent.\n       (7) There are currently 43,000,000 Americans who are \n     uninsured, and the expansion of medical malpractice lawsuits \n     for health plans and employers would result in millions of \n     additional Americans losing their health insurance coverage \n     and being unable to provide health insurance for their \n     families.\n       (8) Exposing health plans and employers to greater \n     liability would increase defensive medicine and the delivery \n     of unnecessary services that do not benefit patients, and \n     result in decisions being based not on best practice \n     protocols but on the latest jury verdicts and court \n     decisions.\n       (9) In order to minimize their liability risk and the \n     liability risk for the actions of providers, health plans and \n     employers would constrict their provider networks, and micro \n     manage hospitals and doctors. This result is the opposite of \n     the very goal sought by S. 6 (106th Congress).\n       (10) The expansion of medical malpractice liability also \n     would reduce consumer choice because it would drive from the \n     marketplace many of the innovative and hybrid care delivery \n     systems that are popular today with American families.\n       (11) The provisions of S. 6 (106th Congress) that greatly \n     increase medical malpractice lawsuits against private health \n     programs and employers are an ineffective means of \n     compensating for injury or loss given that patients \n     ultimately receive less than one-half of the total award and \n     the rest goes to trial lawyers and court costs.\n       (12) Medical malpractice claims will not help patients get \n     timely access to the care that they need because such claims \n     take years to resolve and the payout is usually made over \n     multiple years. Trial lawyers usually receive their fees up \n     front and which can be between one-third and one-half of any \n     total award.\n       (13) Expanding liability lawsuits is inconsistent with the \n     recommendations of President Clinton's Advisory Commission on \n     Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry, \n     which specifically rejected expanded lawsuits for health \n     plans and employers because they believed it would have \n     serious consequences on the entire health industry.\n       (14) At the State level, legislatures in 24 States have \n     rejected the expansion of medical malpractice lawsuits \n     against health plans and employers, and instead 26 States \n     have adopted external grievance and appeals laws to protect \n     patients.\n       (15) At a time when the tort system of the United States \n     has been criticized as inefficient, expensive and of little \n     benefit to the injured, S. 6 (106th Congress) would be bad \n     medicine for American families, workers and employers, \n     driving up premiums and rewarding more lawyers than patients.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) Americans families want and deserve quality health \n     care;\n       (2) patients need health care before they are harmed rather \n     than compensation provided long after an injury has occurred;\n       (3) the expansion of medical malpractice liability lawsuits \n     would divert precious resources away from patient care and \n     into the pockets of trial lawyers;\n       (4) health care reform should not result in higher costs \n     for health insurance and fewer insured Americans; and\n       (5) providing a fast, fair, efficient, and independent \n     grievances and appeals process will improve quality of care, \n     patient access to care, and is the key to an efficient and \n     innovative health care system in the 21st Century.\n       (c) Nullification of Provision.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act, Section 302 of this Act shall be null, \n     void, and have no effect.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 WYDEN (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 1251\n\n  Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Reed, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. \nBingaman) proposed an amendment to amendment No. 1232 proposed by Mr. \nDaschle to the bill, S. 1344, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, I rise to address the importance \nof the high-tech industry for working families in America, and in my \nstate in particular, and to set out what I believe should be the high-\ntech agenda for this body in the coming months.\n  Employment in our high-technology sector is vast and growing. \nAccording to the American Electronics Association, about 4,825,000 \nAmericans were employed in the high-tech sector during 1998. That \nreflects a net increase of 852,000 jobs since 1990. And these jobs pay \nvery well. The average high-tech worker in 1997 made over $53,000 per \nyear--a 19% increase over the levels of 1990.\n  My state of Michigan is playing an important part in the expansion of \nhigh-tech industry in America. Ann Arbor has among the largest \nconcentrations of high-technology firms and employees in the nation. \nThe University of Michigan is a leader in this field, and we have \nintegrated cutting edge technology throughout our manufacturing and \nservices sectors.\n  As of 1997, 96,000 Michiganians were employed in high-tech jobs. The \ntotal payroll for these Michigan workers reaches $4.5 billion annually, \nand the average employee makes an impressive $46,761 per year.\n  High-tech is of critical importance to my state. In addition to those \nwho are directly employed in this sector, thousands of others depend on \nthe health of our high-tech industry for their livelihood. Just as an \nexample, 21 percent of Michigan's total exports consist of high-tech \ngoods. Clearly, whether in international trade, automobile \nmanufacturing, mining, financial services, or communications, \nMichigan's workers depend on a healthy high-tech industry in our state.\n  And the same goes for America, Mr. President. The internet is \ntransforming the way we do business. Electronic or ``E'' commerce \nbetween businesses has grown to an estimated $64.8 billion for 1999. 10 \nmillion customers shopped for some product using the internet in 1998 \nalone. International Data Corporation estimates that $31 billion in \nproducts will be sold over the Internet in 1999. And 5.3 million \nhouseholds will have access to financial transactions like banking and \nstock trading by the end of 1999.\n  All this means that our economy, and its ability to provide high \npaying jobs for American workers, is increasingly wrapped up in high-\ntech. Indeed, our nation's competitive edge in the global marketplace \nrests squarely on our expertise in the high-tech sector. We must \nmaintain a healthy high-tech sector if we are to maintain a healthy, \ngrowing economy.\n  This is not special pleading for one industry, Mr. President. It is a \nsimple recognition of the fact that computer technology is an integral \npart of numerous industries important to the workers of this country. \nThat being the case, it is in my view critical that we secure the \nhealth and vitality of the high-tech sector through policies that \nencourage investment and competition. In my view it also is critical \nthat we empower more Americans to take part in the economic \nimprovements made possible by high-tech through proper training and \neducation.\n  Entrepreneurs and workers have made our high-tech sector a success \nalready. That means that Washington's first duty is to do no harm. The \nfederal government must maintain a hands-off policy, refusing to lay \nextra taxes and regulations on the people creating jobs and wealth \nthrough technology.\n  But in one area in particular decisive action is required. We have \nall heard, Mr. President, about the impending year 2000 or ``Y2K'' \ncomputer problem. Because most computers have been programmed to \nrecognize only the last two digits of a given year, for example \nassuming the number 69 to refer to 1969, the year 2000 will bring with \nit many potential problems. Computers that have not been re-programmed \nto register the new century may assume, come next January 1, that we \nhave entered the year 1900. The results may be minor, or they may \ninclude computer malfunctions affecting manufacturing, transportation, \nwater supplies and even medical care.\n  Clearly such a result would be in no one's interest. Whether large or \nsmall, and whether producers or users of computer systems, all \nbusinesses have a stake in making the computer transition to the 21st \ncentury as smooth as possible. But, as in so many other areas of our \nlives, progress in dealing with the Y2K problem is being slowed because \ncompanies are afraid that acting at this time will simply expose them \nto big-budget lawsuits. After all, why get involved in a situation that \nmight expose you to expensive litigation?\n  It was to help prevent these problems that I joined a number of my \ncolleagues to sponsor legislation providing incentives for solving \ntechnical issues before failures occur, and by encouraging effective \nresolution of Y2K problems when they do occur.\n  This legislation, which the administration has finally signed into \nlaw, contains several provisions that would encourage parties to avoid \nlitigation in dealing with the Y2K problem. In addition, Mr. President, \nthis legislation contains provisions to prevent unwarranted, profit-\nseeking lawsuits from exacerbating any Y2K problem, provisions making \nsure that only real damages are compensated and only truly responsible \nparties are made defendants in any Y2K lawsuit.\n  Quick action is needed, in my view, to prevent the Y2K problem from \nbecoming a disaster. It is a matter of simple common sense that we \nestablish rational legal rules to encourage cooperation and repair \nrather than conflict and lawsuits in dealing with Y2K. Indeed, for my \npart, Mr. President, I have made no secret of my desire to apply common \nsense rules, encouraging cooperation rather than conflict, to our legal \nsystem as a whole. I would view our response to the Y2K problem as \nreally an extension of the idea of common sense legal reform to the \nhigh-tech arena.\n  High-technology related commerce, and commerce over the internet in \nparticular, is subject to the same dangers as other forms of commerce. \nAnd that means government must make certain that the basic protections \nneeded to make commerce possible are applied to the high-tech sector. \nIn particular, we should keep in mind that commerce is possible only if \nall parties can be assured that their property will be respected and \nprotected from theft.\n  I have introduced the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act to \ncombat a new form of fraud that is increasing dangers and costs for \npeople doing business on the internet. The culprit is \n``cybersquatting,'' a practice whereby individuals reserve internet \ndomain names similar or identical to companies' trademark names. Some \nof these sites broadcast pornographic images. Others advertise \nmerchandise and services unrelated to the trademarked name. Still \nothers have been purchased solely for the purpose of forcing the \ntrademark owners to purchase them at highly inflated prices. All of \nthem pollute the internet, undermine consumer confidence and dilute the \nvalue of valid trademarks.\n  Trademark law is based on the recognition that companies and \nindividuals build a property right in brand names because of the \nreasonable expectations they raise among consumers. If you order a \nCompaq or a DEC computer, that should mean that you get a computer made \nby Compaq or DEC, not one built by a fly-by-night company pirating the \nname. The same goes for trademarks on the Internet. And if it doesn't, \nif anyone can just come along and take over a brand name, then commerce \nwill suffer. If anyone who wants to steal your product can do so with \nimpunity, then you won't be in business for long. If anyone who wants \nto steal company trademarks for use on the internet can do so with \nimpunity, then the internet itself will lose its value as a marketplace \nand people will stop using it for e-commerce. It's really as simple as \nthat.\n  We must, in my view, extend the basic property rights protections so \ncentral to the purpose of government, to the realm of e-commerce.\n  I have argued, Mr. President, that we must extend the basic, \nstructural rules and protections of commerce to the high-tech arena. To \nbe successful this\n\n[[Page S8694]]\n\neffort requires recognition of the need for reasoned innovation. If \nthey are to continue fulfilling their vital function of protecting \ncommerce, pre-existing rules must be modified at times to meet the \nchallenges of new technologies. Nowhere is this more true than in the \ninstance of electronic signatures.\n\n  Secure electronic authentication methods, or electronic signatures,'' \ncan allow organizations to enter into contracts without having to drive \nacross town or fly thousands of miles for personal meetings--or wait \nfor papers to make several trips through the mail. They can allow \nindividuals to positively identify the person with whom they are \ntransacting business and to ensure that shared information has not been \ntampered with.\n  Electronic signatures are highly controlled and are far more secure \nthan manual signatures. They cannot be forged in the same, relatively \neasy way as manual signatures. Electronic signatures are verifiable and \nbecome invalid if any of the data in the electronic document is altered \nor deleted. They can make e-commerce the safest as well as the most \nconvenient commerce available.\n  We made great strides in this Congress toward expanding the use of \nelectronic signatures with the Abraham Government Paperwork Elimination \nAct. That legislation requires federal agencies to make versions of \ntheir forms available online and to allow people to submit those forms \nwith electronic signatures instead of handwritten ones. It also set up \na process by which commercially developed electronic signatures can be \nused in submitting forms to the government, and federal documents could \nbe stored electronically.\n  By providing individuals and companies with the option of electronic \nfiling and storage, this legislation will reduce the paperwork burden \nimposed by government on the American people and the American economy. \nIt also will spur electronic innovation. But more must be done, \nparticularly in the area of electronic signatures, to establish a \nuniform framework within which innovation can be pursued.\n  More than 40 states have adopted rules governing the use of \nelectronic signatures. But no two states have adopted the same \napproach. This means that, at present, the greatest barrier to the use \nof electronic signatures is the lack of a consistent and predictable \nnational framework of rules. Individuals and organizations are not \nwilling to rely on electronic signatures when they cannot be sure that \nthey will be held valid.\n  I have joined with my colleagues, Senators McCain and Wyden, to \nauthor the Millennium Digital Commerce Act. This legislation, which was \nrecently passed out of the Senate Commerce Committee, will ensure that \nindividuals and organizations in different states are held to their \nagreements and obligations even if their respective states have \ndifferent rules concerning electronically signed documents. It provides \nthat electronic records produced in executing a digital contract shall \nnot be denied legal effect solely because they were entered into over \nthe Internet or any other computer network. This will provide uniform \ntreatment of electronic signatures in all the states until such time as \nthey enact uniform legislation on their own.\n  Our bill also lets the parties who enter into a contract determine, \nthrough that contract, what technologies and business methods they will \nuse to execute it. This will give those involved in the transaction the \npower to decide for themselves how to allocate liability and fees as \nwell as registration and certification requirements. In essence, this \nlegislation empowers individuals and companies involved in e-commerce \nto decide for themselves whether and how to use the new technology of \nelectronic signatures. It will encourage further growth in this area by \nextending the power of the contracting parties to define the terms of \ntheir own agreements.\n  And another piece of legislation, the Electronic Securities \nTransaction Act will remove a specific barrier in the law that is \nslowing the growth of online commerce in the area of securities \ntrading. As the law now stands, Mr. President, anyone wishing to do \nbusiness with an online trading company must request or download \napplication materials and physically sign them, then wait for some form \nof surface mail system to deliver the forms before conducting any \ntrading. Such rules cause unneeded delays and will be eliminated by \nthis legislation.\n  Control over their agreements is crucial to allowing companies and \nindividuals to conduct commerce in and through the means of high-\ntechnology. But we must do more to ensure the continued growth of high-\ntech commerce. Perhaps most important, we must make certain that \ncompanies involved in high-tech can find properly trained people to \nwork for them.\n  During the last session of Congress I sponsored the American \nCompetitiveness Act. This legislation, since signed into law, provides \nfor a limited increase in the number of highly skilled foreign-born \nworkers who can come to this country on temporary worker visas. It also \nprovides for scholarships to students who elect to study in areas \nimportant for the high-tech industry, including computers, math and \nscience.\n  In my view we should build on the American Competitiveness Act by \nextending training and educational assistance to the millions of \nelementary and secondary school children who can and should become the \nhigh-tech workers of tomorrow.\n  It is projected that 60 percent of all jobs will require high-tech \ncomputer skills by the year 2000. But 32 percent of our public schools \nhave only one classroom with access to the Internet. The Educational \nTesting Service reports that, on average, in 1997 there was only one \nmulti-media computer for every 24 students in America. That makes the \nline to use a school computer five times longer than the Education \nDepartment says it should be.\n  Not only do our classrooms have too few computers, the few computers \nthey do have are so old and outdated that they cannot run the most \nbasic of today's software programs and cannot even access the Internet. \nOne of the more common computers in our schools today is the Apple IIc, \na model so archaic it is now on display at the Smithsonian.\n  The federal government recently attempted to rectify this situation, \nwith little success. The 21st Century Classrooms Act of 1997 allows \nbusinesses to take a deduction for donating computer technology, \nequipment and software. Unfortunately, that deduction was small and \nbusinesses had difficulty qualifying for it. Thus the Detwiler \nFoundation, a leading clearinghouse for computer-to-school donations, \nreports that they have not witnessed the anticipated increase in \ndonation activity'' since its enactment.\n  I strongly believe that we must change that. That is why I have \njoined with Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) to offer the New Millennium \nClassrooms Act. This legislation will increase the amount of computer \ntechnology donated to schools, helping our kids prepare for the high-\ntech jobs of the future.\n  The earlier tax deduction failed to produce donations because it was \ntoo narrowly drawn. It allowed only a limited deduction (one half the \nfair market value of the computer). It also applied this deduction only \nto computers less than two years old. And only the original user of the \ncomputer could donate it to the school.\n  Under the New Millennium Classrooms Act, however, businesses will be \nable to choose either the old deduction or a tax credit of up to 30 \npercent of the computer's fair market value, whichever reduces their \ntaxes most. Businesses donating computers to schools located in \nempowerment zones, enterprise communities and Indian reservations would \nbe eligible for a 50 percent tax credit because they are bringing \ncomputers to those who need them most.\n  In addition, the New Millennium Classrooms Act would eliminate the \ntwo year age limit. After all, many computers more than two years old \ntoday have Pentium-chip technology and can run programs advanced enough \nto be extremely useful in the classroom. Finally, the new legislation \nwould let companies that lease computers to other users donate those \ncomputers once they are handed in.\n  These provisions will expand the availability of useful computers to \nour schools. They will allow our classrooms to become real places of \nhigh-tech learning, preparing our children for the\n\n[[Page S8695]]\n\nchallenges of the future and providing our economy with the skilled \nworkers we need to keep us prosperous and moving ahead. They are an \nimportant part of an overall high-tech agenda that emphasizes expanding \nopportunities for all Americans.\n  Of course we must do more. We must extend the Research and \nDevelopment tax credit so important to high-tech innovation. We must \nextend the 3 year moratorium on any taxing of the internet. We must \nupdate our encryption laws so that American companies can compete \noverseas and provide consumers with state-of-the-art protection for \ntheir e-commerce. We must increase high-speed internet access. I will \nwork to support each and every one of these reforms.\n  Mr. President, these are some of the legislative initiatives a number \nof my colleagues and I are working on to ensure the future of high-tech \ngrowth in this country. It is an important agenda because high-tech is \nan important sector of our economy. I hope members of both houses of \nCongress and the Administration will recognize the need to support this \nagenda so that American workers can continue to prosper.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/15/senate-section/article/S8695-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO COACH GLENN DANIEL\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nCoach Glenn Daniel, a dedicated man and an inspirational leader to the \nmany football teams which he has led. The state of Alabama has been \nblessed with a very rich football heritage. The thought of the sport \nconjures images of Bear Bryant leading his famed University of Alabama \nteams to glory on the gridiron. Between interstate colleges and high \nschool rivalries, there is no argument that the State's roots are \nfirmly entrenched in the game of football.\n  It is from these roots that I pay tribute to the most successful \ncoach in the history of Alabama high school football, Coach Glenn \nDaniel. With a lifetime record of 302 wins, 167 loses and 16 ties, \nCoach Daniel has stood the test of time and climbed countless obstacles \nin his relentless assault on the record books. Coach Daniel's 50-year \ncareer, spanning six decades, serves as a inspiration to the young \npeople he coaches and as an example of the internal fortitude and a \nstrength of character which few possess. He is truly the standard \nbearer for a high school coaching legend and the definition of a man \ndedicated to the sport of football.\n  Born on December 2, 1925, in Montgomery, Coach Daniel attended Albert \nG. Parrish High School in rustic Selma, Alabama. He earned a Bachelor's \nDegree in Education at Livingston University (now the University of \nWest Alabama) and a Master's Degree from the University of Alabama in \n1956. It was in 1947 that Glenn Daniel began his coaching career at the \nrural Alabama school of Pine Hill High. He was able to successfully \nresuscitate a football program which had been discontinued for several \nyears due to World War II. Within 5 years of beginning his tenure at \nPine Hill, he had established a perennial football powerhouse at the \nschool. During this time, Coach Daniel lead his team to an undefeated \nseason, while outscoring opponents 232-32 and receiving a Birmingham \nNews regional championship.\n  Following his tenure at Pine Hill, Coach Daniel moved on to coach at \nLuverne High School in Luverne, Alabama. While coaching at the school \nfor 38 years, Coach Daniel's teams finished with an astonishing 34 \nwinning seasons. In 11 of his last 12 years, his team earned a spot in \nthe state playoffs, including three semi-finals appearances. His \nremarkable 1991 team reached the ultimate promise land, winning the \nstate 3A championship, the first in Luverne High School's history. \nCoach Daniel retired in 1993 and did not coach during the 1993 and 1994 \nseasons. However, he returned as an assistant coach for the 1995 season \nas Defensive Coordinator and helped his team earn a state championship \nin 1997.\n  Coach Daniel was named Alabama's Coach of the Year in 1981, 1987, and \n1991 by various major newspapers in the state. In a coach's poll \nconducted in 1985, he was ranked by his peers as one of the ten best \ncoaches in the state. In addition to these accolades, Coach Daniel \nserved as head coach of the Alabama team in the annual Alabama/\nMississippi All-Star Football Classic in 1992, and was named as Alumni \nCoach of the Year in 1992 by the University of West Alabama. In a \nfitting honor to cap his distinguished career, Coach Daniel was chosen \nas a member of the inaugural class of inductees into the Alabama High \nSchool Sports Hall of Fame in 1991. Mr. President, if a coaching career \nhas ever proven deserving of these many distinctions, it is Coach Glenn \nDaniel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/15/senate-section/article/S8695-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.
