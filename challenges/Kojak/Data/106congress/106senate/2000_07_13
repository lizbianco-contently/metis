MONSIGNOR VAGHI\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as those who were present will \nrecognize, Monsignor Peter Vaghi is a member of the Senate family. He \nserved here some years ago as the assistant to our esteemed and beloved \nbrother, Pete Domenici. He is now the pastor of old St. Patrick's, or \nSt. Patrick's Church on 10th Street, in the city, which is the oldest \ndenominational church in the Federal city. It was founded in 1794 to \nprovide for the religious needs, in the main, of Irish construction \nworkers building the White House and the Capitol. Then came the \nItalians who were recruited for Jefferson's Marine Band, which was the \nprincipal source of culture and enthusiasm in the city in those days.\n  When the British arrived with their horrendous purposes--\ncorresponding exactly, I have to say, as a New Yorker, to the New York \nforces, which rode across Lake Ontario and burned the city of York, \nthen their capital, what we now know as Toronto--in the manner of the \nmilitary of those days, they responded.\n  There were a sufficient number of British troops in town for a period \nthat they, too, went to St. Patrick's. It has been a long relationship \nwith the Nation's Government, as well as the parish--in no sense to \nmake an issue of the matter, but simply to record a certain amount of \npatience. Monsignor Vaghi is, of course, a Roman Catholic. The Roman \nCatholic ministers are descendents of the one Roman Catholic Chaplain \nwe have ever had in the Senate, Rev. Charles C. Pise, who served a \nyear, as was the practice, from 1831 to 1832.\n  There descended on the Nation a spell of religious fanaticism--if you \nlike that term, if you accept that term--which we associate with the \n``know-nothings.'' When they were asked what they were doing about \nthese matters, they would respond, ``I know nothing.'' And for a period \nof about 40 years--up to and including the Presidency, one regrets to \nsay, of Ulysses S. Grant--the anti-Catholic forces in this country were \nquite alarmed and, if not ubiquitous, to be found in most places.\n  We have a curious debt to those people, which is the Washington \nMonument, as designed by Mills. It was to be the great obelisk, but it \nalso was to be surrounded at the base with prancing stallions, such \nthat we would never see the pristine statement that we now have. It was \nbuilt with voluntary contributions by the Washington Monument \nAssociation. You can see them if you walk up; there are bas-reliefs \ninside saying who contributed.\n  In 1854, Pope Pius IX contributed a block of marble from the Temple \nof Concord in Rome, and a group of alert citizens learned that the \ninstallation of this block of marble was to be the signal for the \nCatholic uprising, and they broke into the stoneyard and dumped the \nblock of marble somewhere in the Potomac. There was a measure of \nscandal, and the stump just stayed there indefinitely--until 1880. The \nCongress got nervous about the matter as the Centennial was coming, and \nthe Corps of Engineers was dispatched to finish the job, which they \ndid.\n  You can see a change in the color about a quarter of the way up. But \nalso we were spared the prancing stallions, so there is some good that \ncomes of all these things.\n  It is just such an honor to have the Monsignor with us. I speak as \none of his parishioners. His family, Mr. and Mrs. Vaghi, are in the \ngallery today, as\n\n[[Page S6586]]\n\nis Father Murphy and another parishioner. We welcome them. Although we \nare formally not supposed to acknowledge that anybody is up there, I \nthink no one will mind on this occasion.\n  It is very fortunate for us to have him today. We thank him. We will \nspare him the debate that now commences with my dear friend, Senator \nRoth, one long day of the death tax.\n  With that I thank him, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/13/senate-section/article/S6586-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DEATH TAX ELIMINATION ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING SAVINGS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the reduced cost to the \n     Federal Treasury resulting from the amendments made by this \n     Act as compared to the cost to the Federal Treasury of H.R. 8 \n     as received by the Senate from the House of Representatives \n     on June 12, 2000, should be used exclusively to reduce the \n     Federal debt held by the public.\n       Amend the title so as to read: ``An Act to amend the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the unified credit \n     exemption and the qualified family-owned business interest \n     deduction, and for other purposes.''\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, a little background. In 1906, President \nTheodore Roosevelt sent a proposal to Congress to impose an estate tax. \nHe justified the measure as follows. He said:\n\n       A heavy progressive tax upon a very large fortune is in no \n     way a tax upon thrift or industry as a like tax would be on a \n     small fortune. No advantage comes either to the country as a \n     whole or to the individuals inheriting the money by \n     permitting the transmission in their entirety of the enormous\n\n[[Page S6587]]\n\n     fortunes which would be affected by such a tax; and as an \n     incident to its function of revenue raising, such a tax would \n     help preserve a measurable equality of opportunity for the \n     people of the generations growing to manhood.\n\n  That is why we have an estate tax today. Congress had imposed such \ntaxes in the 1800s, generally to fund wars, and indeed we had an income \ntax during the Civil War. When the need for such revenues eased, why \nthese taxes, including the estate tax, were put aside. Theodore \nRoosevelt championed the enactment, on a number of times, of the \nmeasure that is in the code today. Over the years, the number of \ntaxable estates, estate returns as a percentage of total deaths, has \nfluctuated, but not very much, from under 1 percent in 1935--which is \nthe very depths of the depression of that decade--to a high of almost 8 \npercent in 1977, when we changed the tax to bring it back down. And the \nnumber of taxable estates today ranges between 1 percent and 2 percent, \na level not that different from that of the depths of the depression.\n  If we make no changes to the tax rules in 2006, the percentage of \ntaxable estates is projected to be lower than today because we raised \nthe limit. The Joint Tax Committee projects that 1.82 percent of \nestates will be subject to tax. We are still within that very low \nhistoric level, that was run up after World War II, and which we \nbrought back down in 1977. It is not a principal source of Federal \nrevenue. I think it generated $24 billion in 1998, which was 1.4 \npercent of Federal revenues. Absent change, it might rise to $42 \nbillion in 2008--not even a doubling in 10 years.\n  The bill before the Senate, H.R. 8, the Death Tax Elimination Act, \nwould repeal the tax in the year 2010. It moves about during the next \n10 years, but then it stops altogether, at which point we deal with a \nrevenue loss of $50 billion a year. Mr. President, $50 billion, even in \nthis momentary glow of surpluses, is a large amount of money. That is \nhalf a trillion dollars in a decade. It is much more than we should \never give away before we see whether the surplus we are projecting will \nactually occur, and indeed for the social reasons that Theodore \nRoosevelt spoke about at the beginning of the century.\n  The Federal Government is not the only government that would be \nimpacted by the legislation that has been sent us from the House. The \nestate tax provides revenue for our State governments as well. Under \nour Federal estate tax laws, States may enact an estate tax without \nincreasing taxes on decedents' estates or their heirs. This is because \nthe Internal Revenue Code provides a dollar-for-dollar reduction in \nFederal estate tax liability for each dollar collected by the State, up \nto certain limits. Almost every State has enacted such legislation, and \nStates collect about one-quarter of all estate taxes. The Treasury \nDepartment reports that in 1997, the States collected $4.3 billion in \nestate taxes while the Federal Government collected $16.6 billion.\n  Repeal of the estate tax would eliminate this source of revenue for \nState governments. They have not been consulted in the matter, but I \ncannot imagine they would be enthusiastic.\n  Finally, we on the Senate Democratic side are concerned about the \nadverse effect the repeal could have on charitable contributions. We \ncannot be sure of it, but the Joint Tax Committee estimates that \nestates are expected to contribute $330 billion to charities over the \nnext 10 years, a third of a trillion dollars.\n  The question of how much of these contributions would continue or \nwhat portion would disappear if we abolish this tax altogether cannot \nbe stated with any confidence, but it is the large estates that \ncontributed the bulk of the $330 billion; $190 billion comes from \nestates with values over $10 million. We know this as we look around us \nat the great foundations, some of which date from earlier in the \ncentury but others of which reflect the accumulation of wealth in new \neconomic activities in our age, and the estate tax surely has an \ninfluence. It should not be the principal concern for us, but it is a \nfact of our society.\n  Accordingly, we propose a modification of the existing program whilst \nretaining the essential legislative measure. We can describe it in two \nnumbers: $2 million and $4 million. Under our amendment, no estate with \nassets under $2 million would be subject to estate tax. No estate with \na family-owned business or farm valued at less than $4 million would be \nsubject to estate tax.\n  There are very few farms that could be described with even a measure \nof exaggeration as a family farm worth more than $4 million. New York \nState is a farming State. It always has been. Ray Christensen, the \nSpecial Assistant with the Department of Agriculture and Markets, \nestimates that our farms sell in the range of about $257,000. I cannot \nimagine those in Pennsylvania, just over our border, would be very \ndifferent. They are nowhere near $4 million. I cannot imagine there is \nsuch a place, save a nominal farm kept for recreational purposes on the \neastern end of Long Island or in the Hudson Valley.\n  Our proposal would increase the general exemption, which is \napplicable to all estates, to $1 million immediately--it is $675,000 \ntoday--and to $2 million by the year 2009. This would eliminate two-\nthirds of the approximately 50,000 estates currently subject to tax. In \naddition, our proposal would increase the exemption for family farms \nand family-owned businesses from $1.3 million to $2 million immediately \nand to $4 million by 2009. Our increase would eliminate the estate tax \non virtually all family farms and 75 percent of the family-owned \nbusinesses.\n  The measure is costly but not extravagantly so. It costs $65 billion \nover 10 years, compared to $105 billion under the House proposal, which \nwe have before us. This bill, as I said earlier this week--and I repeat \nto my esteemed friend, our chairman--should have been referred to the \nFinance Committee. It was not. The Senate will learn to its cost one \nday that the Finance Committee has jurisdiction over these matters \nbecause we have some competence in them, and not for nothing, for \nexample, did we bring about the 1977 measures--I was then a member of \nthe committee--to lower the estate tax which had commenced to reach \nalmost 8 percent of estates, which is much higher than the historic \naverage. We are back down to where we have been through the century.\n\n  I suggest, once again, that we ought to stay with a tax that has \nserved us well. Nearly 100 years ago, Theodore Roosevelt urged adoption \nof a tax that would ``be aimed merely at the inheritance or \ntransmission in their entirety of those fortunes swollen beyond all \nhealthy limits.''\n  To conclude, I will ask permission to have printed in the Record the \nlead story in the New York Times business section, Business Day: \n``Despite benefits, Democrats' Estate Tax Plan Gets Little Notice.'' It \ngoes on, in a manner one is not accustomed to read in business \nsections, that:\n\n       Small-business owners and farmers whose Washington \n     lobbyists are ardent backers of a Republican-backed plan to \n     repeal the estate tax seem largely unaware that--\n\n  The Democratic proposal--\n\n     would exempt nearly all of them from the tax starting next \n     year.\n\n  As against the measure we have from the House.\n  I will read one paragraph and then conclude:\n\n       Two prominent experts on estate taxes said yesterday that \n     the Democrats were offering a much better deal to small-\n     business owners and farmers, because the relief under their \n     bill would be immediate and the estate tax would be \n     eliminated for nearly all of them.\n\n  That is a matter we might keep in mind. I ask unanimous consent that \nthis article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 13, 2000]\n\n    Despite Benefits, Democrats' Estate Tax Plan Gets Little Notice\n\n                         (By David Cay Johnson)\n\n       Small-business owners and farmers whose Washington \n     lobbyists are ardent backers of a Republican-backed plan to \n     repeal the estate tax seem largely unaware what President \n     Clinton--who has vowed to veto the Republican proposal--has \n     said he would sign legislation that would exempt nearly all \n     of them from the tax starting next year.\n       Business owners and farmers would be allowed to leave $2 \n     million--$4 million for a couple--to their heirs without \n     paying estate taxes under the plan favored by the President \n     and the Democratic leadership in Congress. The Republican \n     proposal, which passed the House last month with some \n     Democrats' support and is being debated in the Senate\n\n[[Page S6588]]\n\n     this week, would be phased in slowly, with the tax eliminated \n     in 2009.\n       Supporters of the Republican plan say the tax is so \n     complicated that eliminating it is the only effective reform; \n     they argue that the nation's growing wealth means more \n     estates will steadily fall under the tax if it remains law on \n     the Democratic proposal's terms.\n       Still, had the Democratic plan been law in 1997, the last \n     year for which estate tax return data is available from the \n     Internal Revenue Service, the estates of fewer than 1,300 \n     owners of closely held businesses and 300 farmers would have \n     owed the tax.\n       According to the data, 95 percent of the roughly 6,000 \n     farmers who paid estate tax that year would have been \n     exempted under terms of the Democrats' plan, as would 88 \n     percent of the roughly 10,000 small-business owners who paid \n     the tax.\n       Had the estate tax been repealed in 1997, as the \n     Republicans now propose, more than half of the tax savings \n     would have gone to the slightly more than 400 individuals who \n     died that year leaving individual estates worth more than $20 \n     million each.\n       Two prominent experts on estate taxes said yesterday that \n     the Democrats were offering a much better deal to small-\n     business owners and farmers, because the relief under their \n     bill would be immediate and the estate tax would be \n     eliminated for nearly all of them.\n       ``The fact is that the Democrats are making the better \n     offer--and I'm a Republican saying that,'' said Sanford J. \n     Schlesinger of the law firm of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & \n     Handler in New York. With routine estate planning, he said, \n     the $4 million exemption could effectively be raised to as \n     much as $10 million in wealth that could be passed untaxed to \n     heirs. Only 1,221 of the 2.3 million people who died in 1997 \n     left a taxable estate of $10 million or more, I.R.S. data \n     shows.\n       Neil Harl, an Iowa State University economist who is a \n     leading estate tax adviser to Midwest farmers, said that only \n     a handful of working family farms had a net worth of $4 \n     million. ``Above that, with a very few exceptions, you are \n     talking about the Ted Turners who own huge ranches and are \n     not working farmers,'' he said.\n       Mr. Harl said he was surprised that farmers were not \n     calling lawmakers to demand that they take the president up \n     on his promise to sign the Democratic bill.\n       One reason for that may be that in leading the call for \n     repeal of the tax, two organizations representing merchants \n     and farmers--the National Federation of Independent Business \n     and the American Farm Bureau Federation--have done little to \n     tell members about the Democratic plan. Interviews this week \n     with half a dozen people whom the two organizations offered \n     as spokesmen on the estate tax showed that only one of them \n     had any awareness of the Democratic proposal.\n       Officials of the business federation and the farm bureau \n     said that in the event full repeal failed, they might push \n     for approval of the Democratic plan. But both groups say \n     outright repeal makes more sense.\n       ``My concern is not over the Bill Gateses of the world,'' \n     said Jim Hirni, a Senate lobbyist for the business \n     federation. ``But we have to eliminate this tax, because it \n     is too complicated to comply with the rules. Instead of \n     further complicating the system, the best way is to eliminate \n     the tax, period.''\n       A farm bureau spokesman, Christopher Noun, said that the \n     Democrats' plan appeared to grant benefits that would erode \n     over time. ``Farmers are not cash wealthy, they are asset \n     wealthy,'' he said. ``And those assets are only going to \n     continue to gain value over the years. So while some \n     farmers may not be taxed now under the other plan--10 or \n     15 years out they will.''\n       Whether the proposal to repeal the tax dies in the Senate \n     or is passed and then vetoed by the President, it will become \n     a powerful tool for both parties in the fall elections. The \n     Republicans will be able to paint themselves as tax cutters \n     who would carry out their plans if they could just win the \n     White House and more seats in Congress. The Democrats could \n     try to paint the Republicans as the party that abandoned Main \n     Street merchants and family farmers to serve the interests of \n     billionaires.\n       A vote in the Senate could come as early as this evening.\n       At the grass roots, however, those who would benefit from \n     any reduction in the scope of the estate tax take a much more \n     pragmatic view of the matter.\n       ``The whole reason I took up this cause is I do not want to \n     see another small family business get into the situation we \n     are in,'' said Mark Sincavage, a land developer in the Pocono \n     Mountains of Pennsylvania whose family expects to sell some \n     raw land soon to pay a $600,000 estate tax bill to the \n     federal and state governments.\n       The independent business federation cited Mr. Sincavage's \n     situation as an especially good example of problems the \n     estate tax causes its members who are asset rich but short on \n     cash. Facing similar circumstances is John H. Kearney, a Ford \n     and Lincoln dealer in Ravena, N.Y., who said he ``got slammed \n     pretty hard'' when his father died last year. Most of his \n     father's $1.6 million estate was in land and the car \n     dealership, said Mr. Kearney, who added that he dipped into \n     savings intended for his children's education to pay the \n     estate tax bill.\n       Neither Mr. Sincavage nor Mr. Kearney said he was aware of \n     the Democrats' plan to roll back the tax.\n       But Mr. Kearney said his interest was in reasonable tax \n     relief so that merchants and farmers could continue to \n     nurture their businesses, not in helping billionaires.\n       ``No part of me has any sympathy for people with more than \n     $5 million,'' he said. ``Would I feel terrible if all they \n     did was raise the exemption to $4 million or $5 million? I \n     would say from my selfish standpoint that we have covered the \n     small family farm and small business and thus we achieved \n     what we wanted to achieve.\n       ``But I would still be asking: Is it really a moral tax to \n     begin with? And that's a point you can argue a hundred \n     different ways.''\n       Carl Loop, 72, who owns a whole-sale decorative-plant \n     nursery in Jacksonville, Fla., said he favored repeal, partly \n     because estate tax planning was fraught with uncertainty.\n       ``The complexity of it keeps a lot of people from doing \n     estate planning because they don't understand it,'' Mr. Loop \n     said. ``And they don't like the fact that they have to give \n     up ownership of property while they are alive.''\n       Professor Harl, the Iowa State University estate tax \n     expert, said that he had heard many horror stories about \n     people having to sell farms to pay estate taxes. But in 35 \n     years of conducting estate tax seminars for farmers, he \n     added, ``I have pushed and pushed and hunted and probed and I \n     have not been able to find a single cause where estate taxes \n     caused the sale of a family farm; it's a myth.''\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I see that my esteemed chairman has \nrisen. Accordingly, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the Senate Democrats have proposed an \namendment as an alternative proposal to H.R. 8 known as the Death Tax \nElimination Act of 2000.\n  In their alternative, my colleagues across the aisle continue to rely \nupon the concept of a ``unified credit'' against the death tax. Their \n$1 million unified credit does not equal H.R. 8's $1 million exemption. \nThe math behind the Democratic alternative forces the families of the \ndeceased to continue to pay the very high tax rate of 41 percent for \neven one dollar over their $1 million unified credit.\n  Now compare that to the reasonable 18 percent tax rate for the first \ndollar over our proposed $1 million exemption. H.R. 8's use of an \nexemption versus the Democratic alternative's use of a credit literally \ncuts the remaining tax rate in half or modest estates. In short, the \nDemocratic alternative still has a ``cliff effect.'' If the total fair \nmarket value, based on the Internal Revenue's opinion as to the \nestate's highest and best use, happens to exceed the Democratic credit, \nthen the family is immediately exposed to death tax rates 41 to 60 \npercent.\n  The Democratic alternative fails to take advantage of the lower \nestate tax rates currently provided in the tax code. Their increase in \nthe unified credit to $1 million forces American families to still pay \ndeath taxes ranging from 41 to 60 percent.\n  While H.R. 8's use of the exemption would allow American families the \nbenefit of the lower tax rates beginning at 18 percent until such time \nas all of the death taxes are eliminated.\n  I think through all of the debates, most if not all of my colleagues \nin the Senate would agree that the influences of a strong economy have \ncreated $1 million estates in American families who have never had to \nface these types of overwhelming tax burdens. Dozens of American cities \ncontinue to report that the average sales price for a single family \nhome has climbed to more than $250,000. Their average homes are worth a \nquarter of a million dollars, by the time you add life insurance for \nhusband and wife, 401(k)s and IRAs to the fair market value of their \nhomes many American families could be facing the previously unknown \nburden of death tax.\n  Even though the Democratic alternative goes on to eventually increase \nthe unified credit to $2 million by the year 2009, American families' \nlife insurance, 401(k)s, IRAs, and other lifetime savings are exposed \nto death taxes beginning at 49 to 60 percent for every dollar above the \ncredit.\n  In vast contrast, those same families would be shielded from all \ndeath taxes after 2009, under our proposed Death Tax Elimination Act, \nH.R. 8.\n  Additionally, the Democratic alternative attempts to target its \nproposed relief to family farms and small businesses by raising the \nfamily farm and small business deduction from $1.3 million per \ndecedent to $2 million per decedent in the year 2001. Beginning in 2006 \nthrough 2009 the deduction would\n\n[[Page S6589]]\n\nthen be increased through a series of steps to $4 million per decedent.\n\n  First of all, I am concerned that under the Democratic alternative, \nonly those estates with over 50 percent of the estate in small \nbusinesses would qualify for relief. Upon the detailed review of the 50 \npercent requirement it becomes obvious that their alternative has \nseveral complicated adjustments, which includes all gifts made to the \nspouse within 10 years of death. This fact alone makes this approach \nvery limited.\n  In addition to the 50 percent requirement, the Democratic alternative \nrequires that for ten years beyond the date of death, small business \nfamilies shall have an additional estate tax imposed if the family must \ndispose of any portion of the family owned business interest for such \nreasons as bankruptcy or foreclosure. The additional tax is a portion \nof what would have been owed without the small business exemption and \nthe accrued interest from the date of death.\n  Second, I am also concerned about the complexity of this approach. \nThe Democratic alternative would require the use of business appraisals \nand also the preparing and filing of extensive paperwork for up to 10 \nyears beyond death.\n  After a couple of years of this targeted modest relief having been in \neffect, I have heard about how it is working. Based on what family \nfarmers and small business folks are telling me in Delaware, I have \nsome misgivings about whether this approach is taking care of most or \nall of the cases.\n  Since this complex provision was originally passed in the Taxpayer \nRelief Act of 1997, 902 estates have elected the current $1.3 million \ndeduction available under the code. Our experience in the area of \nestate tax provisions leads us to believe that if the Internal Revenue \nService challenges as many of the estate valuations as they do under \nsimilar provision then only about one-third of the estates that could \nelect under this provision would benefit under the Democratic \nalternative.\n  There are other significant differences between H.R. 8 and the \nDemocratic alternative. H.R. 8 has painstakingly attempted to address \nmultiple concerns in the rules under the generation skipping transfer \ntax provisions, in a sincere effort to make those rules less burdensome \nand less complex. Those technical rules, if violated by accident or \notherwise generate an additional tax for violating the restriction \nagainst generation skipping transfers, by levying 55 percent tax over \nand above the 41 to 60 percent death tax already due and owing on the \ntotal value of the estate. The Democratic alternative does not address \nthe much needed technical changes to general skipping transfer taxes.\n  Additionally, H.R. 8 has expanded the geographical limitations to \nqualified conservation easements. This is in recognition of the \nopportunity to further ease existing pressures to develop or sell \nenvironmentally significant land when families must raise funds to pay \ndeath taxes.\n  The Democratic alternative has not even considered this important \nissue nor has it attempted to advance the preservation of such land.\n  Now the Democratic leadership has repeatedly complained as to the \nexpense associated with the Death Tax Elimination Act of 2000. But \ntheir own alternative is expecting a revenue loss of $64 billion over \n10 years, roughly 60 percent of the revenue loss of H.R. 8. This is a \n$64 billion revenue loss that does not even protect those American \nfamilies with simple homes, savings, insurance, qualified plans, and \ninvestments that do not include a farm or a business.\n\n  H.R. 8 repeals the whole estate and gift tax regime in 2010. But, \nbecause there are billions of dollars of assets previously untaxed, if \nthe heirs sell any portion of the estate, capital gains taxes are then \ndue and owing. Taxes are then paid at the right time, when the heirs \nconvert the asset to cash. The tax is not collected on an arbitrary and \ntraumatic event such as death. Nor is tax collected on an arbitrary \nvaluation based on paper equity that has never been realized.\n  Moderately sized estates would be safeguarded from this capital gains \ntax exposure. The step up in basis is retained for all estates in an \namount of up to $1.3 million per estate. In addition, transfers to a \nsurviving spouse would receive an additional step up in the amount of \n$3 million. So a family could cumulatively receive a step up in basis \nof $5.6 million at the death of both husband and wife. This effectively \nprotects moderately sized estates from both death tax and capital gain \ntax exposure.\n  The House passed the bill on a bipartisan basis with 65 Democrats \nvoting in favor of repeal of the estate and gift taxes. Now is the \nSenate's opportunity to pass this bill on a bipartisan basis and send \nit to the President. It is my understanding this will be the only \nchance this year that we will have to pass this bill and repeal estate \nand gift taxes. If we fail, the bill dies. If we come together and vote \nin favor of the House bill--estate tax repeal that the Congress passed \nlast year--it will go directly to the President for his signature.\n  This should not be a partisan issue.\n  Unfortunately, the White House has indicated its opposition to repeal \nof estate and gift taxes and has promised to veto this bill. With \nroughly $2 trillion of estimated non-Social Security surpluses over the \nnext 10 years, I believe the approximately $105 billion cost of \nrepealing estate and gift taxes to be well within reason--it is only \nabout 5 percent of the projected non-Social Security surplus.\n  Taxpayers are taxed on their earnings during their lives at least \nonce. Our Nation has been built on the notion that anyone who works \nhard has the opportunity to succeed and create wealth. The estate and \ngift taxes are a disincentive to succeed and should be eliminated. It \nis the right thing to do.\n  It has been said that there are only two certainties: death and \ntaxes. The two are bad enough, but leave it to the Federal Government \nto find a way to make them worse by adding them together. This is \nprobably the worst example of adding insult to injury ever devised. Yet \nWashington perpetuates over and over again on hard working families who \nhave already paid taxes every day they have worked.\n  The Democratic alternative fails to address the needs of the American \npeople. Therefore I urge my colleagues to support the majority leader \nand vote for H.R. 8.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield to Senator Baucus whatever time he \nmay consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will start by complimenting the two \nleaders. Yesterday at this time, we were facing a likely cloture \npetition which would have severely limited debate on different \namendments. We finally reached agreement on a certain number of \namendments. It is good we have crossed that bridge and are now on the \nbill.\n  Some of the amendments that are going to be offered today may be \nadopted--some may not--but at least they will all improve the bill. We \nwill have an open debate on them, and that allows the American people \nto have a better opportunity to determine what makes sense and what \ndoes not. Again, I congratulate the leaders.\n  The House bill still raises many serious questions that deserve \ncareful consideration. I will name a few.\n  One is the impact of the House bill across various income levels, \nsomething that has really not been discussed. How does it affect one \nincome level versus another income level versus the highest income \nlevels in America?\n  Another is the new rules that maintain the carryover basis of certain \ninherited assets. What is all that about? It is kind of technical. The \nfact is, under the House bill--remember, the House bill doesn't repeal \nthe estate tax until 10 years after enactment--there is not much relief \nin the first 10 years. But after 10 years, after the estate tax is \nrepealed, many assets will no longer have a stepped up basis but \ninstead have a carryover basis.\n  What does someone who inherits an asset and wants to then dispose of \nthat asset have to do? He or she cannot just figure out how much tax is \nowed by using the ordinary market value when it was inherited, which \npresumably is quite a bit higher than when it was\n\n[[Page S6590]]\n\nbought. Rather, he or she has to use the carryover basis from when the \nasset was first acquired with whatever adjustments were made in the \nmeantime. This is usually much lower. And it is awfully technical.\n  The net effect is twofold: One is that people who receive an \ninheritance, under the House bill, are going to suddenly face a much \nhigher capital gains tax if and when they want to dispose of it than \nthey would under current law. Under current law, again, it is called a \nstepped-up basis. The net effect is a much lower capital gains tax when \nthe asset might otherwise be sold.\n  All you folks who think, boy, this House bill is going to repeal the \nestate tax, beware. It does not really repeal the estate tax. What it \ndoes is say that 10 years later, when you get that asset, if you want \nto do anything with it, if you want to sell it, want to realize the \nvalue of it, you will pay a whopping capital gains tax, much higher \nthan you would otherwise pay under current law.\n  The second problem with that is the complexity of the paperwork. \nLet's assume the House bill passes. After 10 years --you are a person \nwho receives inheritance from an estate. If you have to go back and \nfigure out what the basis of all the assets are, some assets may have \nbeen acquired by the decedent 5 years earlier, 10 years earlier, maybe \n20 years earlier, maybe 30 years earlier. The basis may have to be \ncarried over for generations. If you have to stop and find the \npaperwork, find the data which determines what the cost was of that \nasset from who knows how many years ago, that is a huge change from \ncurrent law. It will cause undue complexity.\n  A lot of people in this body correctly complain about the complexity \nof the Tax Code. That is a valid complaint. If the House bill passes, \nthe additional complexity that this body will impose on taxpayers is \ngoing to be beyond imagination. When this Congress did the same thing \nabout 24 years ago, in 1976, guess what happened. Our own constituents \nraised a huge outcry. What did we do in the Congress? We agreed with \nour folks.\n  We ended up repealing carryover basis before it even took effect. I \ndon't think many people have focused on it, but that same provision is \nin the House bill right now, the bill we have before us.\n  Then there is the effect of the House bill on charitable giving, when \nthe estate tax is totally repealed on down the road after 10 years. I \nhave talked to a lot of estate tax attorneys--reasonable people, good, \nsolid estate tax attorneys. They say: Max, if you pass a total repeal, \nI guarantee you there will be a huge drop in charitable contributions \nin America--huge. It stands to reason.\n  Think of some taxpayers who have been in the news a lot, some \nAmericans who have huge estates. We see in the news that they are \ngiving a lot to charity. I am sure a lot of those folks are giving to \ncharity out of the goodness of their hearts, for good, solid altruistic \nreasons. I am also confident that a lot of people with wealth give to \ncharity because under current law, it benefits them; those charitable \ncontributions are deductible. They would far rather give to a charity \nthan to Uncle Sam. They would rather give to their children first, but \nthey would rather give to a charity than Uncle Sam.\n  I think you are going to see a huge drop in charitable contributions \nif this House-passed bill the majority party is pushing is enacted into \nlaw. At the very least, we never had hearings on this. We really don't \nknow what effect it will have on charitable contributions. We really \ndon't know what real effect repeal of the stepped-up basis and moving \nover to the carryover basis can have either. We can surmise. I don't \nhear the majority talking about those issues much, which leads me to \nthe conclusion that there is probably more of a problem with these \nissues than they want people to believe. What our best guess of the \neffect? We could determine it best if we had hearings, but there have \nbeen no hearings on Federal estate taxes in this Congress--none in the \nSenate.\n  I won't belabor the point. I think it is just basic things we should \nbe thinking about before we rush to passage of the House-passed bill. \nLet's move on to the substance. Remember, under current law, the estate \ntax applies to estates worth more than $675,000. That is the law. That \namount is scheduled to rise to $1 million in the year 2006. In \naddition, we have special rules that increase the exemption for family-\nheld businesses to $1.3 million. That is current law.\n  To put this in perspective, next year it is expected that about 2.5 \nmillion Americans will die. Of those 2.5 million, roughly 50,000 will \nhave estates that will pay an estate tax under current law. That is 2 \npercent. I will repeat that because it is worth remembering. Of the \nnumber of people who will die this year, about 2 percent of those \npeople will have estates subject to estate tax. So 98 percent of \nAmericans who die will not have estates that are subject to the estate \ntax. That is current law.\n  With this basic picture in mind, today's debate presents two separate \nalternatives, two ways to reform the estate tax. There is the House-\npassed bill and there is the Democratic alternative.\n  Let's look at the House bill. What does it do? It works in two steps. \nOver the first 9 years, it gradually reduces estate tax rates down to a \ntop rate of about 40 percent. How does it do it? Really, it doesn't \nreduce taxes very quickly during that 9 years because the first year \nthe only things that are actually repealed are the top rate, which is \n55 percent, and the surtax. During that time other modest cuts are \nmade. Then the next year, the 53 percent rate is repealed, and then on \ndown. Then in the final year, you get total repeal. The bill waits a \nfull 10 years after enactment before it completely repeals the estate \ntax. That is when the real effect of the House bill is felt. It is not \nin the first 10 years but after total repeal, after 10 years.\n  At the same time, the House bill imposes a new requirement. When full \nrepeal goes into effect, people who inherit estates worth more than \ncertain amounts must maintain what tax lawyers call the ``carryover \nbasis'' of inherited assets. I discussed that a few minutes ago. That, \nin a nutshell, is the House bill.\n  The Democratic alternative takes a different approach. It does two \nthings--very simple but effective. First, we dramatically increase the \namount that is exempt from estate tax. Currently, as I mentioned, it is \n$675,000. We increase the per person exemption to $1 million per spouse \nright away. A few years later, we begin to increase it again, until it \nreaches $2 million. For a couple, that is a $4 million exemption right \nacross the board.\n  Second, we increase the family-owned business exclusion to $4 million \nper spouse. For a couple, it is $8 million.\n  Those are the two alternatives.\n  When you compare them, it should be pretty clear the Democratic \nalternative has two important virtues. First, the Democratic \nalternative provides dramatic relief, while the Republican bill does \nnot. And it provides dramatic relief where it is needed the most--small \nbusinesses, family-held farms and ranches.\n  In the first year, we would exempt over 40 percent of the estates \nthat are currently subject to an estate tax. Not the House bill, the \nmajority proposed bill; it actually would affect very few people in the \nfirst year and it wouldn't exempt anyone from the tax. The Democratic \nalternative would exempt 40 percent. In fact, ours contains much more \nrelief for estates in this range than the House bill would begin to \nprovide.\n  Over the longer term, when the provisions take full effect, the \nDemocratic alternative exempts more than two-thirds of all estates. \nRemember, of all the people who die in America, only 2 percent are \nsubject to estate tax in the first place. The Democratic alternative \nexempts two-thirds of all those; that is, two-thirds of the 2 percent. \nIt would also exempt three-quarters of all small businesses that might \notherwise be paying tax, and 95 percent of all farms and ranches that \nwould have to pay the estate tax under current law.\n  In contrast, the House-passed bill doesn't go nearly that far. It \nprovides very little relief to these estates for the first 10 years. \nGranted, eventually it provides total relief, but that is 10 years from \nnow, not in the interim. In 2010 the Republican bill repeals the tax \ncompletely, including estates worth not only $2 million or $3 million, \nor family businesses up to $8 million, but\n\n[[Page S6591]]\n\nit also repeals the estate tax for huge estates--$100 million estates, \n$1 billion estates, $5 billion estates. It totally repeals any tax \nwhatsoever on estates of that size.\n  Yesterday, I spoke in opposition to the House bill, and Senators \nThomas and Inhofe expressed a little surprise. They said when they talk \nto ordinary folks in their home States, they hear a lot about the \nestate tax, and people want reform. They wondered whether I was hearing \nthe same in my State of Montana. I sure am, all the time--in coffee \nshops, in grocery stores, lots of people talk to me. They think it hits \ntoo hard on farms, ranches, and small businesses. That is precisely the \npoint. The House bill responds to these with an abstraction--repeal, 10 \nyears from now.\n  The Democratic alternative says, no, we are not going to wait 10 \nyears; we are going to do it now. We respond with honest-to-goodness \nrelief. I am sure there is somebody in Montana with an estate worth \nmore than $8 million who will still have to pay some estate tax under \nthe Democratic alternative. But there sure aren't many of them.\n  Remember, the vast majority of the estates are either not affected by \nthe tax now or, if they are, would be completely exempt under the \nDemocratic alternative. One other virtue of the Democratic alternative \nis it costs much less than the House bill, $40 billion less over 10 \nyears. After that, the savings are even greater.\n  As a result, the Democratic alternative allows us not only to reform \nthe estate tax in a way that helps where it is needed the most, but it \nalso allows us to address other priorities that, frankly, are more \nimportant than total repeal of the estate tax, particularly for huge \nestates.\n  For example, what about the national debt? The Democratic alternative \nleaves an additional $40 billion available to pay down the national \ndebt. Or we could use the savings to provide tax cuts to meet other \nimportant needs; help average families save for retirement or their \nkids' college education, or help people meet long-term medical care \ncosts; protect Social Security and Medicare.\n  Believe me, these are good things that we hear about at home all the \ntime. I believe that more people are more concerned about these matters \nthan they are about total repeal of the estate tax, particularly for \nlarge estates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/13/senate-section/article/S6591-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6591-S6593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2001--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Second, to the vote on the amendment of the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois.\n  At this time, I believe we have 2 minutes for those in opposition. \nBut in deference to the proponents, we are willing to hear from the \nproponents first.\n  They are not going to use it.\n  Then I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Strategic Forces.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, under the previous order, we will now \nproceed to the amendment by the Senator from Illinois. At such time as \nhe concludes his portion of the 2 minutes, I yield my time to the \nsenior Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Illinois. The \ntime is 2 minutes, equally divided.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, can I have order in the Chamber?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this amendment which we offer is one that \nwas debated last night on the floor of the Senate. It is very \nstraightforward. If we are to go forward with a national missile \ndefense system, we should have honest, realistic testing, including \ntesting for countermeasures so we can say to the American people: Your \nmoney is being well spent; so we can say to them: If this is a source \nof security and defense for America, it is one that will work and \nfunction.\n  Some have looked at my amendment and said it must be critical of the \nsystem because Durbin has questioned the system in the past. I \npresented, during the course of the debate last night, a letter from \nthe Director of Testing and Evaluation in the Department of Defense, \nMr. Philip Coyle, in which he writes to me and says:\n\n\n[[Page S6592]]\n\n\n       This letter is to support your effort to reinforce the need \n     for realistic testing of the National Missile Defense System.\n\n  It is very clear to the Pentagon, as it is to those who listened to \nthe debate last night, that this is not a friendly amendment nor an \namendment that sets out to end the national missile defense system. \nThis is an amendment which asks for the facts and asks for the reality. \nI hope Senators will support it.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to voice \nmy support for perhaps the most important amendment--on one of the most \nimportant bills--the Senate will consider this year.\n  National missile defense is one of the most critical defense issue \nfacing this nation.\n  It is probably one of the more politically charged issues as well.\n  Despite political sensitivity and, frankly, political risk, Senator \nDurbin has looked carefully at the facts, and at the arguments on all \nsides of this issue. His amendment reflects a balanced measured \napproach that I believe should be endorsed by both supporters and \nopponents of a missile defense system.\n  The Senate should adopt the Durbin amendment for two reasons: What it \ndoesn't say. And what it does say.\n  What the amendment doesn't say is whether a missile defense system is \na good idea, or a bad idea.\n  Frankly, I believe we do not have enough information yet to make that \ncall. The Durbin amendment actually presumes a NMD system will be \ndeployed. But it does not address the issue of whether it should be \ndeployed.\n  What the Durbin amendment does say, it says well. Simply put, this \namendment says that before we commit $60 billion--or more--to deploy a \nnational missile defense system, we must be confident the system will \nwork. Nothing more, nothing less. Americans have a right to know that \ntheir tax dollars aren't being wasted on a system that cannot work. And \nwe have a responsibility to provide them with that assurance.\n  The Durbin amendment says that before a national missile defense \nsystem can be declared operational, the system must be tested against \nmeasures our enemies can be expected to take to defeat it, and the \nSecretary of Defense must prepare a report for Congress on the ability \nof the NMD system to defeat these countermeasures.\n  The amendment also reconvenes the Welch panel, an independent review \npanel chaired by General Welch, to assess countermeasure issues and \ndeliver a report on findings to both the Defense Department and the \nCongress.\n  Why are such assurances needed?\n  Deployment of a national missile defense system would signal a \ndramatic change in the deterrent strategy this Nation has followed \nsuccessfully for over 40 years. Moving to new strategy dependent on \ndefenses is not without risks.\n  Missle defense deployment requires enormous public commitment--not \nunlike our effort to put a man on the Moon.\n  While success can never be guaranteed, American people have a right \nto know that success is possible--before we commit $60 billion, or \nmore, to it.\n  The President must have confidence the system will work. Also, \ncritically important, our adversaries must know a national defense \nsystem will work.\n  A deterrent is not effective if enemies can be confident it may not, \nor will not, work. If tests demonstrate for the world that the United \nStates has a strong missile defense system, our adversaries are much \nless likely to want to test our defenses.\n  Another reason assurances are needed: Increasing number of studies \nthat raise questions about whether current missile defense testing \nprogram can provide future leaders with adequate level of confidence.\n  Philip Coyle III, the Pentagon's Director of Operational Testing and \nEvaluation, issued a report to Congress earlier this year. The report \nconcluded the pre-deployment tests will not be conducted ``in a \nrealistic enough manner to support acquisition decisions.''\n  A recent report by MIT found that relatively simple countermeasures \ncould defeat the planned NMD system--and that current testing is not \ncapable of evaluating the operational effectiveness of the system \nagainst likely countermeasures. This is a critical deficiency.\n  Technical experts warn that any emerging ``missile state'' that is \ncapable of deploying a long-range ballistic missile is also capable of \nbuilding countermeasures that could defeat a NMD system.\n  The intelligence community released a report last year on ``Foreign \nMissile Development and the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United \nStates through 2015.'' The report warned that emerging ``missile \nstates'' could develop countermeasures such as decoy balloons by the \ntime they flight test their first long-range missiles.\n  They could also acquire countermeasure technologies from Russia and \nChina--both of whom possess such technologies, and both of whom \nstrongly oppose a U.S. NMD system.\n  Reasons to oppose amendment? I can think of only one reason to oppose \nthis amendment: Belief that we should deploy an NMD system at any cost. \nRegardless of whether the system can work. Regardless of the cost to \nAmerican taxpayers. Regardless of the effects deployment could have on \nour relationships with our allies. Regardless of how it might escalate \nan international nuclear arms race. Regardless of everything.\n  I understand that there are some who feel this way. Frankly, I cannot \nunderstand this sort of thinking. They wouldn't buy a car before test-\ndriving it. Why in the world would they buy a $60 billion defense \nsystem before knowing that it can work?\n  A missile defense system that undermines our Nation politically, \neconomically, and strategically--without strengthening our defense--is \nno defense at all.\n  The American people have a right to know that--if we deploy a \nnational missile defense system--it will work. The Durban amendment \nwill take a big step toward providing them with that assurance. We \nshould adopt it.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, 50 Nobel laureates signed an open letter \nto President Clinton on July 6, 2000, urging him to reject a proposed \n$60 billion missile defense system. I ask that the letter may be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                     July 6, 2000.\n     President William Jefferson Clinton,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We urge you not to make the decision to \n     deploy an anti-ballistic missile system during the remaining \n     months of your administration. The system would offer little \n     protection and would do grave harm to this nation's core \n     security interests.\n       We and other independent scientists have long argued that \n     anti-ballistic missile systems, particularly those attempting \n     to intercept reentry vehicles in space, will inevitably lose \n     in an arms race of improvements to offensive missiles.\n       North Korea has taken dramatic steps toward reconciliation \n     with South Korea. Other dangerous states will arise. But what \n     would such a state gain by attacking the United States except \n     its own destruction?\n       While the benefits of the proposed anti-ballistic missile \n     system are dubious, the dangers created by a decision to \n     deploy are clear. It would be difficult to persuade Russia or \n     China that the United States is wasting tens of billions of \n     dollars on an ineffective missile system against small states \n     that are unlikely to launch a missile attack on the U.S. The \n     Russians and Chinese must therefore conclude that the \n     presently planned system is a stage in developing a bigger \n     system directed against them. They may respond by restarting \n     an arms race in ballistic missiles and having missiles in a \n     dangerous ``launch-on-warning'' mode.\n       Even if the next planned test of the proposed anti-\n     ballistic missile system works as planned, any movement \n     toward deployment would be premature, wasteful and dangerous.\n       Respectfully,\n       Sidney Altman, Yale University, 1989 Nobel Prize in \n     chemistry.\n       Philip W.

The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Durbin amendment is unnecessary. It \npurports to direct the manner and details of a missile testing program \nthat the Secretary of Defense is committed to conduct already.\n  This amendment is an unprecedented effort by the Senate to \nmicromanage a weapons system testing program. In no other program has \nthe Senate tried to legislate in this way to dictate to DOD how a \nclassified national security testing program should be conducted.\n  The directions to DOD in this amendment are vague. They would \ninevitably lead to confusion and unnecessary delays in the development \nof this complex, but very important, capability to defend our Nation \nagainst a serious threat. I urge the Senate to reject this amendment.\n  I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The text of S. 2549 is \nsubstituted therefore, and the bill is considered read a third time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/13/senate-section/article/S6593-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6593-S6598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3753\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has \ntaken an important step toward protecting the lives and property of all \nAmericans with the passage of the Firefighter Investment and Response \nEnhancement Act. I am proud today to join with Senators Dodd and DeWine \nas a cosponsor of this legislation. I wish to thank Senator Dodd and \nSenator DeWine for the leadership and effort they have shown on behalf \nof the men and women serving as firefighters across the nation. I would \nalso like to commend the many other Senators who already have signed on \nas cosponsors of this important legislation.\n  The Firefighter Investment and Response Enhancement Act seeks to \naddress the enormous amount of fiscal need faced by our nation's fire \ndepartments, both paid and volunteer, and does so with an eye to the \nhuman costs incurred by both firefighters and the general public these \nbrave men and women protect every day. Every year, more than 4,000 \npeople are killed and 24,000 are injured by fire in the United States. \nSadly, about 660 of those killed each year are children. One hundred of \nthe individuals who lose their lives to fire each year are \nfirefighters, the very men and women who are fighting to protect \nothers. Many of these deaths and injuries could be avoided by simply \nusing the technology and equipment that while currently available, is \noften so expensive that fire departments are unable to purchase it. \nSimilarly, many of the deaths and injuries could be avoided with \nincreased efforts at fire prevention and training. Fire departments in \nmany of our towns and cities spend the bulk of their entire budgets on \nadministrative costs and compliance with existing safety regulations, \nand can simply not afford the available safety equipment and training. \nAs a consequence, far too many volunteer firefighters and EMTs are \nforced to pay for their own training because their departments simply \ndo not have enough money to have them trained.\n  West Virginia fire departments share in this enormous need for \nadditional funding. There are about 16,000 firefighters in West \nVirginia serving in 437 fire departments. Virtually every one of those \ndepartments are underfunded. West Virginians were forced to cope with \nalmost $73 million of property damage due to fires in 1999. More \nimportantly, 45 civilians were killed and two firefighters were killed \nin the line of duty. Much of the loss of life and property, and many of \nthese injuries could have been avoided if fire departments had the \nfunds to deal with emergencies as effectively as possible and to \nestablish prevention programs.\n  Over the past few months, my state has grieved the tragic loss of two \nfirefighters whose deaths may well have been prevented if their \ndepartments had access to grants available under S. 1941. Angelo \n``Wayne'' Shrader, a firefighter with the East River Volunteer\n\n[[Page S6594]]\n\nFire Department, in Princeton, WV, who also worked as a Communicator \nwith the Mercer County ``911'' service, died as a result of injuries \nincurred fighting a fire as part of an understaffed local fire \ndepartment. Similarly, Fire Lieutenant Robbie Brannon, of the City of \nBluefield Fire Department, died as the result of injuries, including a \nheart attack, he suffered fighting a residential fire with a crew \nshort two firefighters because of budget constraints. I humbly join \nwith colleagues on both sides of the aisle today in honor of the \nbravery and sacrifice of Wayne Shrader and Robbie Brannon, and the many \nfirefighters in West Virginia and across the nation who continue to \nprotect us each day.\n\n  Like fire departments all across the country, West Virginia fire \ndepartments do receive support from State and local governments. \nUnfortunately, it is simply not enough. Indeed, fire departments in \nWest Virginia are just like those in every other state, with equipment \nand personnel needs requiring substantial additional funding. Equipment \nsuch as thermal imaging cameras would be a tremendous aid to \nfirefighters and could result in lives being saved, but such equipment \nis very expensive. Similarly, new and technologically advanced fire \nengines would be an enormous help to fire departments and the towns and \ncities they serve. Unfortunately, with current funding levels, most \nfire departments cannot upgrade their equipment and many must raise \nfunds themselves just to fuel the antiquated vehicles many must still \nkeep in service.\n  However, the greatest need fire departments in West Virginia have is \nthe need for increased training. Additional training would be an \ninvaluable resource to fire departments across the state. There simply \nis not enough money available. Three years ago, the projected five-year \nneed for the fire departments in Raleigh County, West Virginia, alone \nwas $14 million. While the Firefighter Investment and Response \nEnhancement Act would not cover that entire need, it would be a \ntremendous aid to fire departments as they attempt to meet their \nvarious needs.\n  For many years, fire departments and firefighters across the nation \nhave simply dealt with funding shortfalls, and yet have managed to \nprotect our communities despite the limited resources available to \nthem. However, we cannot expect these miracles to be performed any \nlonger. Bake sales and bingo can only pay for so much. It is vital that \nthe federal government become involved. The men and women serving as \nfirefighters play an important role in the quality of life in our \ncommunities, and it is high time Congress recognizes their \ncontribution. It is our responsibility to provide adequate funding \nsources to keep firefighters from facing dangers that could be \nmitigated or eliminated though better training, the availability of \nstate-of-the-art equipment, and the implementation of fire prevention \nprograms.\n  The Firefighter Investment and Response Enhancement Act provides a \nportion of this much-needed relief. The legislation authorizes $1 \nbillion to be distributed by FEMA to fire departments across the nation \non a competitive basis. No more than ten percent of this money is to be \nused for administrative costs. This assures that the money is really \ngetting to the fire departments that so desperately need help. Further, \nat least ten percent of the funds are to be used to establish vital \nfire prevention programs to stop fires before they start. The remaining \nappropriations will be available on a competitive basis to address a \nwide variety of needs faced by fire departments across the nation. This \nallows money to be used for the most desperate needs of individual \ndepartments.\n  It is past time that we provide some relief to our nation's brave \nfirefighters who have managed to get by on far too little for far too \nlong. Once again, I commend the Senate for taking this action on behalf \nof our nation's firefighters. I also wish to thank Senator Dodd and \nSenator DeWine for sponsoring this legislation to supply a portion of \nthat much-needed aid. Little that we do may be as immediately important \nas the help we should act quickly to provide our fire departments. By \nhelping our nation's fire departments, we are truly helping everyone.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise as an original co-sponsor of the \nDomenici Nuclear Cities amendment and to note that this important \namendment was unanimously agreed to by the Senate.\n  The Russia nuclear weapons complex is a vast collection of highly \nsecret closed cities. This complex is far larger and has significantly \nmore capability to produce nuclear weapons than the US nuclear weapons \ncomplex. Just over two years ago, the Department of Energy was \npresented with a unique opportunity to help Russia significantly reduce \nthis complex, including the opportunity to close 2 of the three Russian \nnuclear weapons assembly facilities.\n  The DOE through its nuclear cities initiative has been working \nclosely with its Russian counterpart, the Russian Ministry of Atomic \nEnergy, known as MinAtom, to reduce the size of the Russian nuclear \ncomplex by 50 percent. DOE started this effort just over two years ago, \nand while it took a while to get off the ground, the Nuclear Cities \nProgram has begun to demonstrate real progress.\n  This amendment would direct the Secretary of Energy to expand and \naccelerate the activities under the Nuclear Cities Program and further \nassist Russia in downsizing its nuclear weapons complex. To help with \nthis effort the amendment will provide an additional $12.5 million over \nthe current $17 million authorized in the bill. Compared to the overall \ndefense budget this is a small amount but an amount that can help \nreduce the Russian nuclear weapons complex.\n  This amendment directs the U.S. DOE and MinAtom, to enter into an \nagreement to establish a plan, with milestones, to consolidate the \nRussian nuclear weapons complex. In addition, MinAtom must agree, in \nwriting, to close some of its nuclear weapons facilities, before the \nadditional $12.5 million can be spent.\n  We have a unique opportunity to further U.S. national security \ninterests by closing some of the Russian nuclear weapons facilities. \nWhile the full burden to downsize the Russian complex remains a Russian \nobligation we can and should help. It is important to improve and \nfurther our relationship with Russian at all levels. The Nuclear Cities \nprogram provides many benefits to the U.S. and to Russia. The U.S. \nshould grab this opportunity. In the future, Mr. President, I would \nlike to see the program expanded further; this amendment is a good \nfirst step.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 2549, the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for FY2001. Included in the bill \nthat passed today are several amendments that will significantly \nimprove the lives of active duty members, reservists, military \nretirees, veterans, and their families.\n  These amendments greatly improved the version of the bill that came \nout of the Armed Services Committee. I had voted against reporting the \nbill out of the Committee because it did not include important measures \nfor military personnel and neglected the issue of defense reform.\n  The critical amendments that were included in the legislation that \npassed today will: remove servicemembers from food stamps; increase pay \nfor mid-grade Petty Officers and Non-Commissioned Officers; assist \ndisabled veterans in claims processing; restore retirement pay for \ndisabled military retirees; provide survivor benefit plan enhancements; \nauthorize a low-cost life insurance plan for spouses and their \nchildren; enhance benefits and retirement pay for Reservists and \nNational Guardsmen; authorize back-pay for certain WWII Navy and Marine \nCorps Prisoners of War; and provide for significant acquisition reform \nby eliminating domestic source restrictions on the procurement of \nshipyard cranes.\n  One of the areas of greatest concern among military retirees and \ntheir families is the ``broken promise'' of lifetime medical care, \nespecially for those over-age 65. While the Committee had included some \nkey health care provisions, it failed to meet the most important \nrequirement, the restoration of this broken promise.\n  With severe recruitment and retention problems still looming, we must \nbetter compensate our mid-grade enlisted servicemembers who are \ncritical to leading the junior enlisted force. We have significantly \nunderpaid enlisted\n\n[[Page S6595]]\n\nservicemembers since the beginning of the All-Volunteer Force. The \nvalue of the mid-grade NCO pay, compared to that of the most junior \nenlisted, has dropped 50 percent since the All-Volunteer Force was \nenacted by Congress in 1973. This pay provision for the mid-grade \nenlisted ranks, up to $700 per year, plus the food stamp pay provision \nof an additional $180 per month for junior enlisted servicemembers, \nprovides a significant increase in pay for enlisted servicemembers.\n  The National Guard and Reserves have become a larger percentage of \nthe Total Force and are essential partners in a wide range of military \noperations. Due to the higher deployment rates of the active duty \nforces, the Reserve Components are being called upon more frequently \nand for longer periods of time than ever before. We must stop treating \nthem like a ``second-class'' force.\n  I would like to emphasize the importance of enacting meaningful \nimprovements for our servicemembers, their families and their \nsurvivors. They risk their lives to protect our freedom and preserve \ndemocracy. We should compensate them adequately, improve the benefits \nto their families and survivors, and enhance the quality of life for \nthe Reserves and National Guard in a similar manner as the active \nforces.\n  Each year the number of disabled veterans appealing their health care \ncases continues to increase. It is Congress' duty to ensure that the \ndisability claims process is less complex, less burdensome, and more \nefficient. Likewise, we should restore retirement pay for disabled \nmilitary retirees.\n  I would also like to point out that this year's defense authorization \nbill contained over $1.9 Billion in pork-- unrequested add-ons to the \ndefense budget that robs our military of vital funding on priority \nissues. While this year's total is less than previous years' it is \nstill $1.9 Billion too much. We need to, and can do better. I ask that \nthe detailed list of Pork on this bill be included in the Congressional \nRecord following my remarks.\n  In conclusion, I would like to emphasize the importance of enacting \nmeaningful improvements for active duty and Reserve members. They \nrisked their lives to defend our shores and preserve democracy and we \ncan not thank them enough for their service. But we can pay them more, \nimprove the benefits for their families, and support the Reserve \nComponents in a similar manner as the active forces.\n  We must ensure that the critical amendments that I have outlined \nsurvive the Conference process and are enacted into law. Our \nservicemembers past, present, and future need these improvements, and \nthe bill that we passed today is just one step on the road to reform.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\nDefense Authorization Act (S. 2549) for FY 2001 add-ons, increases and \n                                earmarks\n\n\n

Forest System Land Review Committee.......................1\n      Total:..............................................1,981,522,000\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to offer strong support of \nthe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001. This \nlegislation contains many positive things for the state of New Mexico \nand the United\n\n[[Page S6597]]\n\nStates--both in the programs funded and the changes made to enhance \nresearch and development efforts. Chairman Warner should take pride in \nhis committee's efforts to appropriately allocate defense funding.\n  For the second year in a row the committee was able to recommend a \nreal increase in defense spending by adding $4.5 billion above the \nPresident's fiscal year 2001 request. The recommendation of $309.8 \nbillion is not only consistent with the budget resolution it also \nallows for a 4.4-percent increase in real growth for defense from last \nyear's appropriated level of funding.\n  The committee authorized $63.28 billion in procurement funding, a \n$3.0 billion increase over the President's budget. Operations and \nmaintenance was funded at $109.2 billion with $1.5 billion added to the \nprimary readiness accounts. Research, development, test and evaluation \nwas budgeted at $39.31 billion, a $1.45 billion increase over the \nPresident's budget. These impressive funding levels mark the beginning \nof a challenging march toward a stronger, better, national defense.\n  Quality of life receives needed attention. I applaud the 3.7-percent \npay raise for military personnel, the comprehensive retail and national \nmail order pharmacy benefit, the extension of the TRICARE Prime benefit \nto families of service members assigned to remote locations and the \nelimination of copayment for services received under TRICARE Prime.\n  Military construction is increased by $430 million. I am delighted \nthat projects critical to the productivity and well being of the \nservice members and their families residing in New Mexico have been \nincluded in this bill. These are not glamorous projects, they are \nprojects that will replace critical crumbling infrastructure, such as \nthe replacement of the Bonito pipeline between La Luz and Holloman Air \nForce Base.\n  Five additional Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Teams were \nincluded at a cost of $25 million. This will provide us with a total of \n32 Civil Support Teams by the end of fiscal year 2001. These teams are \ncomprised of full-time National Guard personnel trained and equipped to \ndeploy and assess suspected nuclear, biological, chemical, or \nradiological events in support of local first responders. One such team \nis currently being trained and fielded in New Mexico, ensuring that my \nconstituents have better protection against such attacks.\n  Over $1.0 billion, an increase of $363 million over fiscal year 2000 \nfunding, is authorized for Defense and Energy nonproliferation and \nthreat reduction programs. These programs continue to make great \nstrides in the critical process of securing weapons of mass destruction \nand retaining scientific expertise in the former Soviet Union. To \nfurther ensure that these threat reduction programs achieve their \ngoals, the committee has also included several initiatives to obtain \ngreater commitment and necessary access from Russia. I also will offer \nan amendment to increase funding and expedite our efforts in \nrestructuring the Russian nuclear weapons complex.\n\n  Finally, $446.3 million is provided for the defense science and \ntechnology program--a 9 percent increase over the President's budget. \nThis funding will focus on the revolutionary technologies to meet \nchallenging emerging threats.\n  Several projects critical to New Mexico's contributions to our \nnational defense are supported by this legislation. The Armed Services \nCommittee approved an authorization of $60 million for the Warfighter \nInformation Network program. Laguna Industries plays a key role in \nmanufacturing and assembling these mobile command and control units \nneeded by active and Guard units across the nation.\n  The committee also authorized $94.2 million to fully restore the \nAirborne Laser, ABL, program funding. The Air Force's ABL program is \nthe only missile defense system currently contemplated that would \nstrike and kill missiles in their boost phase.\n  The Tactical Higher Energy Laser, THEL, was authorized at $15 million \nfor FY2001. THEL represents one of the first weapons systems being \ntested that utilizes high energy lasers for the purposes of missile \ndefense. The THEL program has been funded through a cost-share \narrangement between Israel and the United States, with TRW having also \nmade substantial investments in the program.\n  I strongly believe that lasers will transform both our offensive and \ndefensive military means in the years to come. We should fully support \nthese programs and address shortfalls in the science and technology \nfunding in these technologies to ensure more rapid development and \nfielding of high energy laser weapons.\n  The committee also authorized $49 million in additional funding for \nactivities of the Air Force Research Laboratories at Kirtland Air Force \nBase, including $5 million for the Scorpius Low-Cost Launch program, \n$15 million for Military Space Plane, and $5 million for the Solar \nOrbit Transfer Vehicle Space Experiment.\n  The Big Crow Program Office was authorized at $7 million by the \nSenate Armed Services Committee. Big Crow represents a unique \nelectronic warfare test and evaluation capability used by all of the \nservices to ensure their weapons can perform as needed in realistic \nwarfighting scenarios.\n  An authorization of an additional $3 million will ensure continuation \nof the important blast mitigation research at New Mexico's Institute of \nMining and Technology. New Mexico Tech houses our Nation's experts in \nterrorist explosives and is developing innovative ways to protect \nagainst this threat.\n  While I appreciate the committee's attention to these and other \nimportant programs, I believe that more must be done to ensure the \ndirected energy science and technology is better coordinated and \nsufficiently funded. These technologies can assist in our defense \nefforts against some of the most prevalent threats confronting us. I \nwill also be offering an amendment to this legislation that I believe \nwill go a long way in achieving these goals.\n  In 1998 I spoke before this body and stated the need to start the new \nmillennium by stopping the ebbing tide and ending the lengthy decline \nin defense spending. This year I am grateful to see the chairman and \nhis committee have made the crucial step of maintaining, and improving \non, the FY 2000 increase in defense spending. We must not flag in our \nefforts to support a strong national defense. The committee has \nrecognized, as do most of us concerned about our national defense, that \ncombat readiness of our Armed Forces must not be at risk. Our soldiers, \nand our country, deserve a national defense budget that is in keeping \nwith international uncertainty and growing threats. Our soldiers and \nU.S. citizens are counting on us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the passage of H.R. 4205, \nas amended.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Virginia and the Senator from Michigan be able to proceed for not \nto exceed 5 minutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair hears, no objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, since 1961, the Senate has passed an \nauthorization bill for our military. We are about to pass another. I \nfirst thank the leadership of the Senate, and my distinguished ranking \nmember, Mr. Levin, for hanging in as we had to move this bill under \nsome difficult circumstances in the last 30 days.\n  I wish to pay a special respect to all members of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. We conduct our affairs as best we can in the spirit \nof what is in the best interest of our Nation. The bill reflects those \ndecisions.\n  I wish to thank our respective staffs, both majority and minority.\n  I yield to my distinguished colleague who has been with me some 22 \nyears in the Senate on this committee. We have worked together as a \nteam in the best interests of our country.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, I thank our chairman for his \nextraordinary leadership. Since Congress, in 1959, said that we were \nrequired to pass an annual authorization bill for the Defense \nDepartment, we have never failed. We have succeeded again this year, \ndespite some real odds. We passed a record number of amendments. We did \nit because of the work of all the members of the Armed Services \nCommittee, our staffs, and our leadership on both sides.\n  If I can just single out one person, I want to single out, in the \nleadership, if\n\n[[Page S6598]]\n\nI may, Senator Reid, for just sort of being here constantly to help us \nmove the process forward.\n  Senator Lott, Senator Daschle, all the leadership, our subcommittee \nchairmen, ranking members, our staffs really deserve credit for this. \nIt is an extraordinary accomplishment, and it is a real feather in our \nchairman's cap.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I congratulate the chairman and ranking \nmember for the fine job they have done.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the \nremarks on Mr. Reid. He was very helpful to get some time agreements \nand other matters resolved.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. S. 2549 is returned to the calendar.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their work on \nthis bill and for their overwhelming support. It sends the strongest of \nsignals, first and foremost, to the men and women in the Armed Forces. \nThis bill provides increased benefits, which they have so richly \ndeserved and long been denied. This bill also initially starts the \nfirst balanced program to provide for more health care for the retirees \nwho gave so much, together with their families, over the years. This \nbill sends a strong message throughout the world that America is \ncommitted to remain strong and lead in the cause of freedom and human \nrights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I move that the Senate insist on its \namendment, request a conference with the House, and the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint the conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  The motion was agreed to, and the Presiding Officer (Mr. Bunning) \nappointed Mr. Warner, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. McCain, Mr. Smith of New \nHampshire, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Santorum, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Roberts, Mr. \nAllard, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Levin, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \nBingaman, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Robb, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Cleland, Ms. Landrieu, \nand Mr. Reed conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. S. 2550, S. 2551, and S. 2552 are now \nconsidered en bloc. Division A of S. 2549 is substituted for S. 2550; \ndivision B for S. 2551, and division C for S. 2552. The bills are \nconsidered read the third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider \nis laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Byrd \nand I might address the Senate for not to exceed 5 minutes each to \ndiscuss the status of appropriations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/13/senate-section/article/S6598-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6598-S6600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE STATUS OF APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today, we believe the President will sign \nthe first of the 13 appropriations bills we must pass, the military \nconstruction bill. I can report to the Senate that we are in conference \nnow on Defense, and we expect to report that bill this evening from \nconference, or no later than Monday. That could be easily taken up next \nweek sometime.\n  The legislative appropriations bill is waiting for third reading now. \nIt is held up by one amendment, and we are trying to work out an \narrangement where we might be able to have that voted on. We are \nwaiting for the House to appoint conferees on the foreign operations \nbill; the Labor, Health and Human Services Committee; and the \nTransportation Committee. Those are all the subject of negotiations \nwith the various Departments and the President's advisers, to see if we \nmight find a way to accommodate the desires of the administration \nregarding those matters.\n  The Interior bill is still on the floor and has a great many \namendments. I believe, however, that can be finished easily next week. \nWe have reported to the floor the Agriculture bill, which is a very \nimportant bill for us to consider, I believe, before we have the August \nrecess. We have scheduled meetings now with the Appropriations \nCommittee here in the Senate on Tuesday, July 18, for the Commerce-\nState-Justice bill and the energy and water bill. We believe those \nbills will be reported to the floor on that day, Tuesday, and could be \nscheduled sometime before the August recess. We believe we will be able \nto make the same statement regarding the Treasury and general \ngovernment bill sometime next week. Hopefully, we will be able to get \nto that by at least Thursday.\n  What we are saying is that these bills can be acted upon if the \nSenate decides and commits to getting these bills to conference and, if \npossible, to the President, before the August recess. I have been \nspeaking out now about the PNTR. I am a firm supporter of the goal \nthere. Maybe there are some amendments that should be considered. But I \nbelieve we should get these bills done so that when we come back in \nSeptember, we can take them from conference and pass them.\n  I call to the attention of the Senate the fact that we will finish \nour work for September on September 28. September 29 is a holiday, and \nSeptember 30 comes on the weekend. We have a very short time when we \ncome back to deal with appropriations bills and get them all to the \nPresident before the end of the fiscal year. It is my hope that, in the \nlast year of this Presidency, we will avoid the kind of conflicts we \nhave had in the past and try to work together with the President to \nfinish up this term in the spirit of comity, particularly on \nappropriations bills. That is possible if we can get them up in August. \nIt is not going to be possible if we have to wait until September and \ntry to jam them all in for 2\\1/2\\ weeks in September.\n\n  I am taking the floor now with great respect for our leader and for \nour minority leader. I hope they will help us find the time on the \nfloor between now and the August recess to consider these bills and ask \nfor the commitment of the Senators to help us work to get this job \ndone.\n  I think there is a way that we can wind up this period of 8 years of \nthe Clinton administration without the rancor that we have had in the \npast, but it can only be done if we make up our minds now that we are \ngoing to work--and work some long nights, in fact--to get these bills \nconsidered and properly reported. I believe we are making progress.\n  It is my hope that at least the Defense bill and the Labor-Health and\n\n[[Page S6599]]\n\nHuman Services bill will be sent to the President for signature prior \nto the August recess.\n  I am happy to yield to my good friend from West Virginia. Our \ncommittee works on a totally bipartisan basis. I have not done anything \nwithout consulting my good friend from West Virginia, the former \nchairman. I want the Senate to know he has given me good advice all \nalong.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this is my 42nd year on the Appropriations \nCommittee. I think I have served longer than any Member, past or \npresent. The Appropriations Committee was first created in 1867. I \ndon't have any doubt that I have served with the greatest chairmen who \nhave served on that committee since its inception in 1867. That was 133 \nyears ago. I have served with Senators such as Carl Hayden of Arizona, \nDick Russell, John Stennis, John McClellan, Allen Ellender, and Senator \nHatfield. These were great chairmen. They had long service in the \nSenate. I served with all of them. But I have never served with a \nbetter chairman on the Appropriations Committee than the current \nchairman, Ted Stevens. I think he is a better chairman than I was. I \ndon't say that idly. He works at the job all the time. He works hard. I \nsupport him in this request to the leaders.\n  I don't happen to be a great fan of the treaty with China. I will \nhave more to say about that later. But I am a great fan of getting \nthese appropriations bills down to the President on time. When I was \nchairman, we were able to get all the appropriations bills passed \nbefore the beginning of the new fiscal year.\n  I join my chairman in pleading with the leadership--and the \nleadership has been most cooperative on both sides--to help get these \nbills moved and into conference and down to the President.\n  The chairman, Mr. Stevens, hit the nail right on the head when he \nsaid we don't need to have another wrangle with the President over \nappropriations bills right at the end of the session. That plays into \nthe President's hands. I think all Senators are aware of the fact that \nI believe the legislative branch is the predominant branch, and was \nmeant to be the predominant branch among the three equal and coordinate \nbranches. I think it has the upper hand, if Members of the Congress \nwill but will stand up for the Senate and its constitutional powers.\n  I think it is important that we finish these bills because, when we \nwait until the end of the session, and we are left with an omnibus \nbill, the President wins every time. You may think you can beat the \nPresident in that deal. You can't do it. The President wins because he \nthen has the upper hand. He has your back to the wall. Senators and \nHouse Members want to get out of here and go home. They have schedules \nto fill back in their districts and in their States. It plays into his \nhands if appropriation bills only reach him at the last minute. I don't \nlike to play into any President's hands.\n  I think most Members are very aware that we need to work with the \nPresident. But it is highly important we get these bills passed. Let \nthe PNTR wait. Why be in such a hurry on that treaty? Why be in such a \nhurry? It would be better if we were to take a little more time and \nexamine that treaty more carefully and consider what the ramifications \nof its approval may be.\n  Last night we were able to get legislation adopted to create a \nnational security commission. It will be a congressional commission. We \nwill not have to depend upon the administration to tell us what impact \nthat trade with China may have on our national security. We will have \nour own commission. It will be appointed by the joint leadership of \nboth Houses. That commission will report to the Congress.\n  I have a somewhat jaundiced eye when it comes to moving in such a big \nhurry to take up the China treaty. As far as I am concerned, it ought \nto go over until next year. Let's take another look at it. That is just \none Senator's opinion.\n  I plead with the leader--I say to this also to my own leader--to help \nus get these appropriations bills passed, to get them to conference, \nand then downtown. We can talk and wrangle and debate about the China \ntreaty afterwards.\n  I thank my chairman.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator from Alaska will yield \nbriefly, first of all, I listened carefully to the comments of the two \ndistinguished Senators who are the ranking member and the chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee. The service of these two Members \nsurpasses all the rest of us, with the possible exception of the \nPresident pro tempore, Senator Thurmond. But beyond that, the wisdom \nand the sage advice they give all of us is greatly appreciated.\n  I certainly believe and will continue to believe that we should give \nthe highest possible priority to these appropriations bills. We have an \nagreement now that will lead us to the conclusion of the Interior \nappropriations bill, I believe next Monday. I believe the votes could \npossibly be on Tuesday morning. I hope before we go out for the August \nrecess that we do at least four more or all five of the remaining \nbills. I know clearly we could do four of the remaining bills: \nAgriculture, Energy and Water, Treasury-Postal Service, and Commerce-\nState-Justice. There may be some difficulty with HUD-VA that would \ncause it to go over until September.\n  But I appreciate their comments and their good advice. I will \ncertainly weigh that very carefully. I appreciate the fact that they \nare willing to take to the floor and ask for this help in getting their \nwork done. In fact, it is our work. It is the people's business.\n  I appreciate their comments.\n  I commend and thank the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and \nalso the ranking member, Senator Levin, for the work they did on the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill. We got it finished. \nHallelujah. The Senate has produced the final vote on one of the most \nimportant bills we will do all year, the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill. There is a lot of important language in there. It \nis not only about the ships, the planes, and housing; It is also about \nhealth care. It is a big, important bill. Without the patience and the \ntenacity of the chairman, the Senator from Virginia, and the help he \nreceived from the Senator from Michigan, we wouldn't have it done.\n  I commend them; and, again, the senior leadership of the two Senators \non the Appropriations Committee who spoke is admirable. I appreciate it \nvery much. As a leader, you have to rely on the senior leaders, and the \nmanagers, the chairmen. In this case, I did, and they did it.\n  I thank Senator Stevens for his comments and for yielding me this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I could have 1 minute to thank the \ndistinguished leader.\n  I wish to acknowledge my deep appreciation to our distinguished \nmajority leader, and, indeed, to Senator Daschle, Senator Harry Reid, \nSenator Nickles, and all. Yes, chairmen work hard and this posed some \nproblems, but never once did I have any feeling that leadership was not \ndetermined on behalf of the whole Senate and this country to see that \nthis bill was passed. There was never a flicker of doubt in my mind \nfrom the date we started some 3\\1/2\\ weeks ago. I thank this body for \nthe leadership that we have to get these difficult tasks performed.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask the majority leader, I heard him \nspeak about the desire to get the appropriations bills passed, which I \nam in favor of, but did I hear the majority leader say not only is it \nhis intention to bring up appropriations bills this month, but did I \nhear him include PNTR?\n  I think in the same spirit of compromise which we just passed the \nDefense authorization bill, as it has been referred to, we can work to \nget PNTR up this month and passed, along with the appropriations \nbills--as many as we can.\n  I say to the majority leader, I will do my part in helping with the \nestate tax reform bill to try to limit the amount of time on that bill \nand also work on other appropriations bills. I think it is necessary \nthat PNTR also be included in the list of measures that we will bring \nup and pass this month.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have the floor and I am happy to have \nthat\n\n[[Page S6600]]\n\nconversation somewhere else, but I understand what the Senator is \nsaying.\n  Mr. President, I want to finish my comments. I think we have almost \nused our 10 minutes. I thank my good friend for his comments. I could \nnever claim to be the chairman that Senator Byrd was, but in any event, \nI do hope the Members are listening to what we are saying. We have had \nover 100 amendments on the last two appropriations bills. If that \ncontinues, we will be on appropriations bills until the day we go off \non recess for the conventions. There will be no time for PNTR. Let's \nget the bills up. I urge the Members to be considerate of what we are \ndoing. If we can finish them, then we take up PNTR. I think we can't \nkeep breaking up the concept of these bills. The synergy of getting a \nbill working and getting it to pass in the appropriations process is \nnecessary to get these done by the time we go off on August recess.\n  I have every confidence we will get to the PNTR. The Senator from \nWest Virginia is right; despite my support of PNTR, it is not our \nconstitutional duty to finish it by the end of the fiscal year. The \nappropriations bills are. That is our point. We want to do our job on \ntime. We urge the Senate to work with us to get that done.\n  I think our time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask consent to speak for 2 minutes so I \ncan ask the majority leader a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Essentially, I am trying to move this ball along. It is a \npretty large bill and includes lots of different items. Not only is it \nPNTR but appropriations bills.\n  I wonder if I could ask the majority leader if PNTR is included in \nthe list of ``must-pass'' measures for July? We are all working \ntogether, particularly with the good meeting we had last evening in the \nmajority leader's office with Senator Thompson and others, working out \nprovisions of the Thompson amendment. There is a good chance we can \nmove things along.\n\n  I ask the Senator his views on the subject.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I certainly want to move this along. I want \nto have a vote on the Moynihan substitute on the death tax, and then \nhave a vote on our alternative. That would be the best way to proceed. \nWe would have two votes and Senators could cast their votes \naccordingly, and we would move on.\n  Instead, we have an agreement that will take all day and into the \nnight. Instead of taking 2 or 3 hours, it will wind up taking probably \n10 or 12 hours. I hope on the marriage penalty tax we could vote on the \nalternative. Senator Moynihan has a reasonable alternative. We could \nvote on that, vote on our alternative, and be through with the marriage \npenalty tax and move on to the appropriations bills.\n  We do have a matter we are working through on both sides to try to \ndeal with the question of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, the \nlanguage suggested by Senator Thompson. We are trying to find a way to \nget an agreement on the language and a way to consider that.\n  We must do the people's business. We have to do these appropriations \nbills. We have to do at least four appropriations bills beyond the \nInterior appropriations bill. When we get that done, I don't see any \nproblem then in moving to China PNTR. I can't make days out of whole \ncloth, and I can't make commitments until we get our work done. But we \nare all working on that, I think, in good faith.\n  Senator Reid worked assiduously on these appropriations bills. Energy \nand water we may be able to do in a day or two. Agriculture, I will be \nsurprised if we don't have 80 or 100 amendments pop up. That bill could \ntake a week. It is very important to our country. We all want the \nAgriculture appropriations bill completed. Commerce, State, and \nJustice--no matter what Members might think about Commerce or State or \nJustice, we need to get that bill done very badly. That bill quite \noften is like fly paper, it draws a lot of amendments. If we made a \ncommitment, if we made up our minds on both sides of the aisle we will \ncomplete Interior and do three more appropriations or four more \nappropriations bills next week, we could do it. But it would take an \nextraordinary amount of heavy lifting to get that done.\n  I will work with Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd. It is rare for \nthese two Senators to take the floor and say what they have said today. \nI have to weigh that carefully.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Thirty seconds. I very much appreciate the situation we \nare in, with very few days left and lots of business to conduct. As far \nas I am concerned, I will do my part. I know others on this side will \ntry to help maintain that schedule. For example, on the estate tax \nbill, I think there are a couple of amendments on your side that will \nbe accepted by voice vote or agreed to by voice vote to help move this \nalong. In that spirit, I remind the leader it is critical that PNTR \ncome up and be disposed of this month.\n  I thank the leader for his hard work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could bring everyone back to reality, \nthe problem of the day--not next week or the week after--is that we \nhave about 12\\1/2\\ hours of debate time, excluding voting, and the \nleader indicated he wants to do that today. So that means about 2:30 or \n3 o'clock this morning unless something is done carrying this matter \nover or shortening the time.\n\n  I think it is great to talk about the future. That is important. But \nmy concern is what we have here today and it is a tremendous burden. As \nI indicated, I think we have over 12 hours of debate time in the \nunanimous consent request alone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/13/senate-section/article/S6600-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6600-S6669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              DEATH TAX ELIMINATION ACT OF 2000--Continued\n\n  Mr. ROTH. What is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Moynihan amendment.\n  Mr. ROTH. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 45 minutes and \nthe Senator from New York has 30 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator from Delaware wish to use some of his time \nnow?\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes, I do.\n  I yield 15 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I rise in opposition to the Democratic alternative \nand in strong support of H.R. 8. I listened with interest to the debate \ntaking place earlier this morning on this bill. I have the utmost \nrespect and admiration for Senator Moynihan. However, I wrote down one \nphrase he used. He said: We should stay with a tax that has served us \nwell.\n  I think that is the fundamental difference between the parties and \nthose who differ on this issue. I don't believe the death tax has \nserved our country well. I don't believe it has served the American \ndream well. I don't believe it serves the American people well.\n  The death tax basically says to the American people: Be successful \nbut don't be too successful. The death tax says: Work hard but don't \nwork too hard and make too much. The death tax says: Save your money \nbut don't save too much. The death tax puts a ceiling on what the \nAmerican dream can be. I think that is fundamentally wrong, and therein \nis the basic difference between the two philosophies, the two parties, \nthe two approaches on the death tax.\n  There are those who say you can make too much and at that point the \nGovernment is going to step in and we are going to take what we think \nyou have excessively made and earned and saved and invested, and we are \ngoing to redistribute that; we know better how to use that estate than \nyour heirs, your family, your loved ones.\n  We believe that is wrong. The whole approach behind the death tax is \nfundamentally wrong and un-American. The amendments that are being \noffered, including the Democratic alternative basically say, let's \ntweak it a little bit; let's finesse the death tax a little bit; let's \nexpand the exemption a little bit, let's tinker with it.\n  But that is not enough. This is a tax that is past its time --if it \nwas ever justified, and it was not. It should be removed, eliminated, \nand that is why this alternative is insufficient.\n\n[[Page S6601]]\n\n  It is no accident that the American Farm Bureau endorses H.R. 8. \nAmerican farmers already have enough challenges growing crops, bringing \nthem to market, making a living. Yet still our farmers see their land \nwhittled away generation by generation, and not just by floods or \nstorms or infestation but by the Federal Government and its tax \npolicies. Death taxes can destroy family-owned farms and ranches when, \nafter taxes, farmers do not have enough to keep their land, their \nbuildings, or their equipment.\n  I want you to listen to the words of H. Jay Platt of the Arizona Farm \nBureau Federation as he testified before the House Small Business \nCommittee. This is what he said:\n\n       My grandfather started our ranch around the turn of the \n     century with a couple of cows on a few acres of grazing land. \n     For 100 years my family has worked hard to build our \n     operation into a modern ranch that is the core of the \n     financial base for three families. We paid taxes on \n     everything we've earned and we don't understand why we have \n     to pay again when we die. We can't comprehend why the \n     government wants to penalize us for being successful by \n     taking our ranch at death. We believe that our family, our \n     community and the environment will all be better off if our \n     ranch continues.\n\n  That is a powerful statement. That is farmers. But small businesses \nare in a similar trap. According to the NFIB, more than 70 percent of \nfamily businesses do not survive to even the second generation, and \nmore than 87 percent of these small family-owned businesses never make \nit to the third generation. One in three small business families today \nhave to sell their businesses outright or liquidate business assets \njust to pay the death tax.\n  The American dream can become an American nightmare because of the \ndeath tax. Democrats talk about the estate tax bill we are considering, \nthe elimination bill, as being a tax break for the richest people in \nAmerica. Let me tell you about some of the people who are really \naffected by the death tax.\n  One of my own staffer's husband and his siblings just experienced the \ndeaths of both parents. Their mother died only 2 weeks ago. In addition \nto the intense emotion and grieving this family is currently going \nthrough, they are now faced with selling family farmland and other \nassets in order to pay estate inheritance taxes in an attempt to save \nthe family home and the family business.\n\n  This is farmland that their parents and they have tilled and planted, \nfarmland which paid for all four of the children's college education. \nTheir small lumber and hardware store is located in a town of 1,400 \npeople and has been in existence nearly 50 years. Not only will they \nhave to pay estate taxes totaling almost half of the estate; they will \nhave to pay capital gains taxes on the assets they sell in order to pay \nfor the death tax. Talk about adding insult to injury. That surely \ndoes.\n  This is not about the wealthiest Americans. This is about a family \nwho has put countless hours into rebuilding their family lumber \nbusiness which burned to the ground a decade ago. This is about all \n1,400 people who live in that small town, who are served by that family \nbusiness, as well as the employees whose livelihoods depend upon that \nbusiness. This is about handing down a legacy to their children who \nwant to maintain the business which has served this rural community for \nfive decades.\n  The Federal estate tax, the death tax, punishes families for the \ndeaths of their loved ones. The Federal estate tax takes its toll \nirrespective of the fact that any sale of inherited assets is subject \nto capital gains taxes. It is clear and, to me, it is simple: This is \ndouble taxation. It runs contrary to this country's work ethic and to \nfamily values.\n  I have a stack of letters that have come in in the last month from \npeople in the State of Arkansas who are not wealthy Americans but who \nsee the deadly impact of the death tax. Let me share with you one \nletter from Haskell Dickinson:\n\n       Dear Senator Hutchinson: My father has grown gray worrying \n     about his estate. He and his family members have paid \n     exorbitant life insurance fees. He has been under intense \n     pressure from large corporations who, he knows will \n     consolidate his company and destroy local business \n     relationships. He has been disillusioned that having to sell \n     will mean a valuable Arkansas asset will be owned by an out-\n     of-state firm. Arkansas stands to lose a lot from such a sale \n     because of lost ``local'' business relations and community \n     support and leadership.\n       The estate tax is a cruel, grinding tax on people like my \n     dad, and his family, and it's terrible for communities to \n     lose good businesses and relationships to bigger, ``out of \n     town,'' corporations.\n\n  Or this letter from Jack Kinnaman of Kinco, Incorporated.\n\n       Dear Senator Hutchinson: Since I've been in business, my \n     company and I have paid in income tax ranging from 25-75%. I \n     have worked hard all my life and worked those 60-100 hr. \n     weeks building a company. I am 66 yrs. old and still work 50-\n     60 hrs. a week. When I die, in all probability, the family \n     will not be able to afford to keep the business going because \n     of the Death Tax (opponents call it estate tax). Some relief \n     was given because so many family farms were being lost. Small \n     businesses like mine should not be lost because of a ``wealth \n     distribution mandate''. We should have some feeling of \n     comfort and pride that we can leave a successful business to \n     our children.\n       I urge you to support the Death Tax Repeal Proposal \n     approved by the House.\n\n  Mr. Kinnaman, I agree with you. I agree with you.\n  Richard Posner put it this way:\n\n       Since the accumulation of a substantial estate is one of \n     the motivations that drive people to work hard, a death tax \n     on saving is indirectly a tax on work.\n\n  It is a fundamental difference. Do you think you ought to tax the \nproducts and the fruits of somebody's labor or do you believe you \nshould not? It is a basic difference of philosophy. You can tweak it. \nYou can finesse it. You can expand the exemption. But you are still \nsaying, if you make too much, we are going to penalize you because we \nare going to tax you at 55 percent. We are going to take half of \neverything you earned, worked a lifetime to make. That is wrong. You \ncan make all the rationalization and justifications, we should not \npenalize success in America. We should not say: you worked too hard; \nyou did too well; you succeeded too much. That ought to be exactly the \nkind of thing we reward in this country.\n  These hard-working--not wealthy but hard-working--and successful \nAmericans are right when they say this tax should be repealed. It takes \nfrom Americans an incentive to save, a will to work. The National \nFederation of Independent Business, the American Farm Bureau, the Black \nChamber of Commerce, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the National \nIndian Business Association, the Pan-American Chamber of Commerce, and \non and on, all support H.R. 8, and so should my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle.\n  The death tax has been repealed in 20 States since 1980, including \nthat of Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts, Oregon, Vermont. The nation \nof Canada repealed it, Israel repealed it, Australia abolished it, and \nso should we. It is past time. It is time to make friends of logic and \ntaxation by repealing the death tax. Let's clear the way for parents to \nbequeath to their children, not bequeath to the Federal Government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. The minority yields 15 minutes to the Senator from North \nDakota, Mr. Conrad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, perhaps it is useful to this debate and \ndiscussion to put in perspective what we are talking about in budget \nterms, and then to go to the specifics of the proposals that are before \nus. I think it is useful, first, to review where we are in terms of the \nprojected surplus over the next 10 years because those numbers have \njust changed. We are now told we will have a total surplus, a \nprojection of a surplus, of $4.2 trillion over that 10-year period.\n  I think it is also important to remember that two-thirds of that \nmoney is from Social Security and Medicare; $2.3 trillion represents \nsurpluses from Social Security, $400 billion represents surpluses from \nMedicare.\n  Between those two, over $2.7 trillion of the $4.2 trillion projected \nsurplus is from Social Security and Medicare. That leaves us over the \nnext 10 years $1.470 trillion of non-Social Security, non-Medicare \nsurplus. This is money that I argue is available for tax relief, is \navailable for additional debt paydown, and is available for high \npriority domestic needs such as education, prescription drug coverage, \nadditional expenditures on defense, and\n\n[[Page S6602]]\n\nother high priorities that we might have in this country. I also argue \nthat Agriculture ought to be given additional resources to confront the \nEuropeans, our major competitors, who are outspending us dramatically \nas they attempt to buy markets that were once ours. That is the money \nwe have available over the next 10 years\n  The other day in the Washington Post, Secretary Summers, the \nSecretary of the Treasury, warned us that the proposal that has come \nout of the House, which is before us now as the Republican proposal, \nexplodes in cost in the second 10 years.\n  I just reviewed our budget circumstance in the next 10 years \naccording to the latest estimates. In the second 10 years, the \nRepublican tax proposal on estate tax explodes in cost. It goes from \n$105 billion to $750 billion. Here is the Secretary of the Treasury \nalerting us that the tax cut will cost too much. He points out that the \nestate tax repeal measure passed by the House and now before the Senate \nwould cost about $750 billion in the second 10 years, more than 7 times \nits cost in the first 10 years. He points out:\n\n       If it were to be enacted, it might be the most backloaded \n     piece of tax legislation ever.\n\n  That is the Secretary of the Treasury.\n  The respected columnist, David Broder, wrote in the Washington Post \nthe day before the Summers' column, Sunday, July 9, a recommendation to \nthe President that he veto the Republican estate tax proposal. He \npoints out that 98 percent of the inheritors in 1998 paid nothing in \nestate tax--nothing. The $28 billion in inheritance taxes came from 2 \npercent of very large estates.\n  He goes on to point out that under a 1997 law, a couple with a farm \nor business worth up to $2.6 million can give it to their heirs tax \nfree. The Democrats raise that to $4 million for a couple, which means \nthat only 1 of every 100 estates would face any inheritance tax. In \nfact, our proposal is to raise it to $4 million for a couple, and $8 \nmillion for those who own small businesses or farms. We are talking \nabout a fraction of 1 percent that would have any liability under the \nplan we are offering.\n  These charts tell the story. The Republican plan explodes in cost in \nthe second 10 years. It goes from $105 billion over that period in the \nfirst 10 years to $750 billion in the second 10 years.\n  There is also something very interesting about the estate tax \nproposal of our Republican colleagues. They talk a lot about \neliminating estate taxes, but really what they do in the first 10 years \nis not eliminate the estate tax at all. In the first 10 years, they \nreduce the rates at the top end so the people they are helping are the \npeople who are the very wealthiest in the country. Those are the people \nto whom they are providing the first relief.\n  It is, frankly, very odd. I have to ask my Republican colleagues why \nthey would choose to provide estate tax relief in this way. Why don't \nthey begin by helping the small business owners and the farmers and the \ncouples who just qualify for paying estate tax? Why not?\n\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. If I can continue.\n  Mr. KYL. For a question.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield for that purpose after I have \ngone a little further. I then will be happy to engage my colleague. Why \ndo they have an estate tax plan that gives the first relief to the very \nwealthiest among us? Why not provide the first help to those who really \nneed it: small business owners, the farmers who we think ought to be \nexempted from the estate tax because the estate tax structure, as it \nis, is out of date.\n  That is not what the Republican plan does. The blue line on this \nchart shows current law. The red line shows the GOP estate tax \nproposal. They reduce the rate starting at the top rate first. They \nreduce that and then create this incredible cliff effect when it goes \ninto full effect supposedly 10 years from now. Frankly, because of the \nexploding cost, I doubt their plan would ever go into full effect. We \nwould have the worst of all worlds. We would have the top rates \nreduced, nobody relieved from estate tax liability for the first 10 \nyears, and then I believe because of the exploding costs, this cliff \neffect would never occur, and we would have the worst of all worlds. We \nwould have lost the ability to plan, to manage estates; we would have \nlost the opportunity to take people off the rolls who really ought to \nbe off the rolls, and we would have, as I say, the worst of all worlds.\n  If we look at the underlying facts, 98 percent of estates currently \nare exempt; 98 percent of estates pay no estate tax because of current \nlaw which provides substantial credits to exempt the vast majority of \nestates. Only 2 percent have some requirement to pay under current law. \nThe Democratic proposal in the first year relieves 42 percent of those \n2 percent of any liability. That is the Democratic plan. The Republican \nplan relieves 0 percent of estates from taxation in the first year. \nLet's go back and review what I have said.\n  Under current law, 98 percent of estates are exempt. Only 2 percent \npay any estate tax. Under the Democratic plan, of those 2 percent who \nhave some estate tax liability, in the first year we take 42 percent of \nthem off the rolls completely, entirely. The Republicans take none of \nthem off the rolls--none.\n  At the end of the 10-year period, the Democratic plan takes 67 \npercent of those 2 percent of estates that have a liability now off the \nrolls. We take two-thirds of them off the rolls entirely. The \nRepublicans, by the year 2009, takes none of them off the rolls of \nliability.\n  There is an enormous difference between these plans, and the \nDemocratic plan is far superior in the next 10 years to the Republican \nplan--far superior for couples, far superior for small business, far \nsuperior for farmers.\n  In this morning's New York Times on the front page of the business \nsection, it says:\n\n       Two prominent experts on estate taxes said yesterday that \n     the Democrats were offering a much better deal to small-\n     business owners and farmers, because the relief under their \n     bill would be immediate and the estate tax would be \n     eliminated on nearly all of them. ``The fact is that the \n     Democrats are making the better offer--and I'm a Republican \n     saying that,'' said Sanford J. Schlesinger of the law firm of \n     Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler in New York. With \n     routine estate planning, he said, the $4 million exemption \n     could effectively be raised to as much as $10 million in \n     wealth that could be passed untaxed to heirs. Only 1,221 \n     of the 2.3 million people who died in 1997 left a taxable \n     estate of $10 million or more, I.R.S. data shows.\n       Neil Harl, an Iowa State University economist who is a \n     leading estate tax adviser to Midwest farmers, said that only \n     a handful of working family farms had a net worth of $4 \n     million.\n\n  Of course, we would permit $8 million by a couple to be passed \nuntaxed to heirs.\n\n       Above that--\n\n  Above the $4 million he is referencing--\n\n     with very few exceptions, you are talking about the Ted \n     Turners who own huge ranches and are not working farmers,'' \n     he said.\n       Mr. Harl said he was surprised that farmers were not \n     calling lawmakers to demand that they take the president up \n     on his promise to sign the Democratic bill.\n\n  The Democratic plan, even according to Republican tax analysts, is \nfar superior to the Republican plan in providing relief to taxpayers.\n  It is also true our proposal costs less--$64 billion over the next 10 \nyears, instead of the $105 billion of the Republican plan. That means \nwe could use that other money for other priorities.\n  We could use it for an additional paydown of the debt. That happens \nto be my favorite priority. I would like to have an even more rapid \npaydown of the debt because of the enormous benefits that flow from \nthat policy.\n  But there are other things we could do. We could provide tax \nincentives for health care with the additional money. We could provide \nfor college tuition deductibility, which would help millions of \nAmerican families who are sending their kids to college. We could have \nretirement savings proposals. Those cost in the range of $30 to $40 \nbillion. We could have a long-term care tax credit. That costs $32 \nbillion.\n  As I say, we could have additional debt reduction of $40 billion \nunder the Democratic plan, in addition to dramatic estate tax relief \nthat would immediately remove people from the rolls of having to pay \nestate tax. We could have a paydown on a prescription drug benefit.\n  This is a question of priorities. Our priority has been to give real \nrelief, immediate relief, to those estates that\n\n[[Page S6603]]\n\nought not be taxed, in our judgment, to give real relief to thousands \nof families who would pay no estate tax under our plan and have that \nrelief immediate, starting this coming year, allowing 40 percent of the \nsmall number of estates that are currently taxable --only 2 percent of \nthe estates are currently taxable, and we take 40 percent of them off \nthe first year. They owe nothing. The Republican plan takes none of \nthem off the rolls. It gives their relief at the top end, top down, \nrather than bottom up. That is the fundamental difference between our \nplan and their plan.\n  We have, as I say, in the New York Times this morning prominent tax \nexperts saying the Democratic plan is better for small business owners. \nIt is better for farmers. There is really no question about it.\n  In the first 10 years, people are much better off under the plan we \nhave offered. I go back to the point I made earlier. Under the \nRepublican plan, you get to the second 10 years and the cost explodes, \nright at the time the baby boomers start to retire, and put additional \npressure on the budget of the United States.\n\n  I believe the Republican plan will never go into effect. They will \nfind some other way to circle back and impose a tax on those assets \nbecause the cost of their plan explodes in the second 10 years to $750 \nbillion right at the time the baby boomers start to retire.\n  I tell you, this is the time to have estate tax relief that is real, \nnot to wait 10 years but to start now, taking people who should not be \nthere off the rolls, giving relief to small business owners and \nfarmers. That is what the Democratic plan does.\n  Mr. President, I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Arizona \nwho had an answer to a question. I yield on his time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from North Dakota has \nexpired.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Arizona, how much \ntime does the Senator wish to have?\n  Mr. KYL. If I could have 15 minutes, I think that would do it.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield the Senator 15 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank Senator Roth for yielding me the time.\n  I appreciate the Senator from North Dakota at least attempting to \nyield for an answer to his question. Here is, I think, the simplest \nexplanation. I will give two. If the Democratic plan is better for \nsmall businesses and farms, then why is it that every small business \norganization and every farm organization support the Republican plan?\n  I am responding to the Senator's question. We have politicians on \nboth sides of aisle saying: Our plan is better. No, our plan is better.\n  Why is it that all of the organizations that we are concerned about--\nthe farmers and the small business folks--all support the Republican \nplan?\n  Let me read into the Record a few of these organizations. The \nAmerican Farm Bureau supports the Republican plan. There are a whole \nnumber of organizations such as the Soybean Association, the Sheep \nAssociation, and others. Let me list a few of them: the National \nAssociation of Wheat Growers, the National Association of State \nDepartments of Agriculture, the National Cattleman's Beef Association, \nthe National Corn Growers Association, the National Cotton Council of \nAmerica, the National Milk Producers Federation, and with regard to \nsmall business, the umbrella organization, the National Federation of \nIndependent Business.\n  And back to the farm groups: the Pork Producers Council, the Small \nBusiness Legislative Council, the United Fresh Fruits and Vegetables \nAssociation.\n  I could go on and on reading from this list. This is a three-paged, \nsingle-spaced list of small business organizations and farm \norganizations, and every one of them support the Republican plan, not \nthe Democratic alternative.\n  So I think that is the answer to the question: Which one of these \nplans is better for small businesses and farms? It is the Republican \nplan. Why is that? There is actually a fairly simple answer, and then \nan answer that takes a little more explanation.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. Not right now. Let me finish my point.\n  The reason why the Democratic alternative is not supported by any of \nthese organizations is because no one can qualify for the benefit it \npurports to grant. It does not matter whether you raise the exemption \nfrom $600,000 to $1 million or $2 million if people can't qualify for \nit. The fact is, it is very difficult, if not impossible, for most \nsmall businesses and farms to qualify.\n  I will cite some experts who make that point, but, first of all, the \nstatistics: Only 3 to 5 percent of affected estates qualify under these \nsections. In today's Wall Street Journal, there is a reference to this \nfact. The lead editorial ``Death Tax Revolt,'' reads:\n\n       But Senate Democrats also offer to expand a small-business \n     and farm exception that is a tax-lawyer's dream. The \n     loophole, known as IRS Code section 2057, is so complicated \n     and onerous that few estates qualify. That's why even House \n     Democrats offered the cleaner alternative of a 20 percent cut \n     in estate-tax rates.\n\n  It then goes on to note that Senate Democrats have offered this \ninstead.\n  Let me quote from a couple of memos from tax experts that make this \npoint:\n\n       The requirements to qualify for the new exclusion provided \n     by 2057--\n\n  Which is the section we are talking about here--\n\n     are virtually identical to the requirements to qualify for \n     special use valuation for farms under section 2032A. . . . \n     The 2032A nexus is very important since most estate tax \n     analysts agree that section 2032A is a flawed section of the \n     Code that is virtually unworkable.\n\n  Let me just go on here:\n\n       The frustration of farmers with 2032A and its enforcement \n     has resulted in virtually no farm families structuring their \n     estates to take advantage of this so-called relief in the \n     Code. . . . Quite simply, these provisions, while well-\n     intentioned, are flawed and represent ``broken'' sections of \n     the Code. Tinkering with the Code--\n\n  I will just interject: As the Democratic alternative purports to do--\n\n     and trying to engineer and mandate the circumstances for \n     running a business or farm 10 years into the future is a \n     gross violation of a family's right for self-determination \n     for the business or farm and against the spirit of allowing \n     an individual's hard-earned, after-tax life's work to be \n     shared and enjoyed by his/her loved ones.\n\n  Here is what one of the experts in estate tax has noted:\n\n       The current Qualified Family-Owned Business Interest is 4 \n     pages of statute as Code Section 2057. Its predecessor 2033A \n     was condemned by the Real Property and Probate Section of the \n     American Bar Association which urged its repeal.\n\n  Why? Because it is malpractice waiting to happen. All of the lawyers \ngetting together can't figure out how to make this code work for small \nbusinesses and farms. They can't qualify.\n  Reading on:\n\n       The reason for this condemnation by this respected \n     organization and others was extreme complexity and limited \n     application, plus little practical help in preserving family \n     farms and businesses from forced sale or liquidation to pay \n     the 55 percent estate tax.\n       Although 2057 is only 4 pages of law, it incorporates by \n     reference 14 sections from 2032A--valuation of certain farms, \n     etc., real property.\n\n  Section 2032A, which is itself 11 pages, ``was considered the most \ndangerous section of the estate tax law because of the risk of \nmalpractice claims against estate planning lawyers and accountants. \nCurrently, there are 149 tax cases which have been decided and reported \ninvolving 2032A issues.'' The IRS has challenged the validity of the \nestate planning under this section and has won approximately 67 percent \nof the cases.\n  So what kind of great relief do we have in the Democratic package? \nRelief which is based upon attempting to qualify under a section that \nonly 3 to 5 percent of the eligible estates can qualify under, where \nlawyers are frequently committing malpractice if they try to gain this \nqualification, and where the IRS is succeeding in over two-thirds of \nthe challenges which they are making to attempts to qualify under this \nsection.\n  The point is, you can make this exemption as high as you want to, but \nit is unworkable. That is the fatal flaw in the Democratic plan. As the \nWall Street Journal editorial noted, House Democrats who sought to have \nan alternative recognized this and went at it in a different way--not \nour colleagues in the Senate.\n\n[[Page S6604]]\n\n  There are additional memoranda from tax experts who make this very \nsame point.\n  I will move on to another point. My colleague, Senator Conrad, quoted \nthe Larry Summers article which is grossly in error. The Secretary of \nthe Treasury forgot two important points when he estimated the cost of \nthe Republican plan.\n  First, remember that the Republican plan is not just a repeal of the \nestate tax. It is essentially a substitution of the capital gains tax \nfor the estate tax. That is an important point. When somebody such as \nSecretary Summers or Senator Conrad says, here is how much the repeal \nof the estate tax is going to cost, and then doesn't take into account \nthe revenue that is brought in by the application of the capital gains \ntax, they are presenting a distorted picture.\n  The first point is that while the capital gains tax rate is lower at \n20 percent, lower than the estate tax rate, it will nevertheless \nproduce revenue when the property of the heirs is sold, at least it is \ntheir decision as to when to sell their property. It does not have to \nbe sold at the time of death of the decedent in order to pay the tax. \nThey can wait and hold it forever if they want to maintain the small \nbusiness or keep on the family farm. If they would like to sell those \nassets sometime, they do so knowing that there is going to be a \ncapital gains tax. Granted, at a rate lower than the estate tax, but it \nis still a tax they are going to have to pay.\n\n  The second thing Secretary Summers did not take into account--and it \nhas not been taken into account by our friends on the other side--is \nthe step up in basis. Under the existing law, the basis is stepped up \nat the time of death. So let's take one of these billionaires they are \nfond of talking about. If the widow of a billionaire sells all of the \nestate the day after the death of the decedent, there is no gain. As a \nresult, the step up in basis results in a payment of zero capital gains \ntax, none whatsoever. They have to pay the estate tax but zero capital \ngains tax. By removing this step up in basis, we take death out of the \nequation. If and when the assets are ever sold, they are sold knowing \nthat the capital gains tax applies and that it is calculated on the \nbasis of the original cost to the owner of the property.\n  So the decedent bought the property 10 years before at $10 a share, \nand it is up to $100 a share now. The basis is the $10. The gain is \ncalculated based upon that. Then you pay the capital gains tax. That is \nwhy all of these wild estimates of how much this is going to cost are \noff the mark. They don't take into account the fact that we substitute \nthe capital gains tax and that we repeal the step up in basis.\n  There is another point I will make. Given the fact that we are \ntalking about a budget surplus of trillions of dollars over a 10-year \nperiod, obviously any ``cost to the Treasury'' is irrelevant. It is, A, \na drop in the bucket and, B, not needed because we are running a huge \nsurplus. Why are they so worried about this loss in revenue to the \nFederal Government? By definition we are running a surplus, and we \ndon't need the revenue.\n  One of the comments the Senator from North Dakota made was that our \nproposal costs less. Yes, it costs less because it provides less \nbenefit. If it is so good for the family farms and small businesses \nthat they seem to care so much about, why would they then want to \nstress the fact that their plan costs less, when in fact that means it \nprovides fewer benefits.\n  The bottom line is, the Republican alternative, which is supported by \nthe agricultural and small business groups, is the better plan for \nthem. It is a better plan because it doesn't rely upon a fatally flawed \nprovision of the Tax Code to make it work. It repeals the estate tax, \nbut it provides an important substitute. That substitute is that the \nestates would be subject to a capital gains tax to the extent that the \nproperty of those estates is ever sold.\n  We believe that is a very fair way to approach this issue. It takes \ndeath out of the equation. It removes that horrible Hobson's choice \nthat a family must make at the worst possible time for them to have to \ndeal with it, at a time when the head of the family has died; he is the \nperson perhaps most responsible for making this farm or small business \na success. They are then faced with the difficult choice of having to \nfigure out how to pay the estate tax and, in many cases, having to sell \nthis business in order to do so.\n  One more important point. There is a recent Gallup poll that points \nout that 60 percent of American people favor outright repeal. Only 35 \npercent oppose that. Yet 43 percent of the people who favor repeal say \nthey know they would never benefit from the repeal. That demonstrates \nto me that they understand this is a very unfair tax. Only 17 percent \nbelieve they will benefit by a repeal of the tax. That may be a fairly \nrepresentative number. But it is an unfair tax.\n  Another one of the reasons why it is so unfair is because a great \ndeal of the expense associated with this is not the payment of the tax, \nbut it is the payment of all of these lawyers and accountants and \nestate planners and the purchase of insurance and other products which \nare designed to avoid the payment of the tax. The very wealthy, these \nbillionaires the other side likes to talk about, can well afford all of \nthe lawyers. They end up shielding the bulk of their income as a result \nof the estate planning they do. It is the smaller estates that end up \nhaving to pay the tax because they haven't been able to afford these \nexpensive products to try to avoid the tax.\n  Besides simply being jobmakers for lawyers, which I don't think we \nare in the business of being, this is a very expensive proposition. It \nis interesting that the bulk of the people who pay the taxes are the \nsmaller estates.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a brief explanation \nfrom an article by Bruce Bartlett of why the larger estates pay only 20 \npercent of the total taxes.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, June 19, 2000]\n\n                    The Real Rap on Death and Taxes\n\n                          (By Bruce Bartlett)\n\n       On June 9, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to \n     abolish the estate and gift tax in the year 2010. \n     Predictably, liberals denounced the action in the strongest \n     possible terms. Bill Clinton called it ``costly, \n     irresponsible and regressive.'' The New York Times said, \n     ``Seldom have so many voted for a gargantuan tax cut for so \n     few.'' Robert McIntyre of the far-left Citizens for Tax \n     Justice told CBS News that supporters of repeal have done \n     nothing but lie about their plan, which he views as nothing \n     but a giveaway to the ultra-wealthy.\n       The truth is that the burden of the estate tax falls \n     primarily on modest estates, not those of the Bill Gates and \n     Warren Buffetts of the world. The latest data from the \n     Internal Revenue Service tell the story. In 1997, more than \n     50 percent of all estate and gift taxes were collected from \n     estates under $5 million. Only 20 percent came from the very \n     wealthy, those with estates of more than $20 million.\n       Furthermore, the effective tax rate (net tax as a share of \n     gross estate) is significantly higher for estates between $5 \n     million and $20 million than on those of more than $20 \n     million. An estate between $2.5 million and $5 million \n     actually pays a higher rate than that paid by estates of more \n     than $20 million--15 percent for the former and 11.8 percent \n     for the latter.\n       How can this be the case when estate tax rates are steeply \n     progressive, taxing estates of more than $3 million at a 55 \n     percent rate? The answer is that estate planning can \n     eliminate the tax if someone wants to spend sufficient time \n     and money setting up trusts and organizing one's affairs for \n     that purpose. Those with great wealth are far more likely to \n     engage in estate planning than a farmer, small businessman or \n     someone with a modest stock portfolio. Hence, the heaviest \n     burden of the estate tax falls not on the very wealthy, but \n     the slightly well-to-do.\n       The government gets more than two-thirds of all estate tax \n     revenue from estates under $10 million. The idea that taxing \n     the stuffing out of such estates does anything to equalize \n     the distribution of wealth in America is ludicrous. All it \n     does is prevent those with modest assets from becoming \n     wealthy. Academic research has shown that estate taxes \n     squeeze vital liquidity out of small businesses, often \n     forcing them to sell out to large competitors. Thus the \n     estate tax makes it more difficult for small firms to grow \n     and become large.\n       Of course, the same people who support high estate taxes \n     also support aggressive use of the antitrust laws to break up \n     big businesses like Microsoft because they lack competition. \n     Yet the estate tax destroys many potential competitors in \n     their cribs, before they are strong enough to challenge \n     entrenched corporate elites.\n       One could, perhaps, make a case for a heavy estate tax if \n     there were evidence a large share of the nation's wealthiest \n     families got that way through inheritances. But this, in \n     fact, is not the case in America and never has been. A 1961 \n     study by the Brookings Institution found that only 6 percent \n     of\n\n[[Page S6605]]\n\n     the wealthy acquired most of their assets through \n     inheritance. Sixty-two percent reported no inheritances \n     whatsoever.\n       A 1995 study by the Rand Corp. got similar results. It \n     found that among the top 5 percent of households, ranked by \n     wealth, inheritances accounted for just 8 percent of assets. \n     A 1998 study by U.S. Trust Corp. found that among the \n     wealthiest 1 percent of Americans, inheritances were a \n     significant source of wealth for just 10 percent of them.\n       The truth is that most of the wealthy in America--even the \n     billionaires--made it themselves. They weren't born with \n     silver spoons in their mouths, living off the industry of \n     their parents or grandparents. Most of the very wealthy got \n     that way because they started businesses and took enormous \n     risks that paid off. According to the latest Forbes 400 list \n     of American's wealthiest people, 251 were self-made.\n       And among the modestly wealthy, with fortunes in the low \n     seven digits, many got that way simply because they saved and \n     invested for retirement the way all financial advisers say \n     people should. The T. Rowe Price website, for example, \n     advises that people need $20 in saving for every $1 they will \n     need in retirement over and above Social Security. This means \n     that to have $50,000 per year in retirement income a couple \n     will need $1 million in assets.\n       It simply defies logic to tell people they need to save for \n     retirement and then punish them for doing so by threatening \n     to confiscate their estates after death. And it is absurd to \n     tell such people they are the unworthy rich, who merely won \n     life's lottery, when every penny they have came from their \n     own hard work and investment. Yet that is what those fighting \n     estate tax repeal are doing.\n       If it were only the very wealthy supporting estate tax \n     repeal, there is no way estate tax repeal would have garnered \n     279 votes, including 65 Democrats. It is precisely because \n     the estate tax is more of a tax on the middle class than the \n     left believes it to be that the repeal effort has gotten so \n     far. It is not Bill Gates and Warren Buffett out there \n     pushing for repeal, but ordinary Americans who just don't \n     want the Internal Revenue Service to be their estate's \n     primary beneficiary.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mr. KYL. A good opportunity to summarize:\n  I support what Senator Roth said earlier this morning. The Democratic \nalternative is no alternative at all because it relies upon a \ndefinition in the code that virtually no one can meet.\n  Only 3 to 5 percent of the estates qualify. That is why the \nDemocratic alternative is no alternative at all. Is this only me \nspeaking? No. All of the farm and small business organizations agree. \nThey support the Republican alternative, not the Democratic \nalternative. I think the best test of which one of these plans best \nmeets their needs is to ask the people who are most affected. They \nanswer resoundingly that it is the Republican plan that best meets our \nneeds; it is the Republican plan that we support.\n  For that reason, when it comes to choosing between the alternative--\nyou have to make a choice here--the Republican alternative, which \npassed the House of Representatives with strong bipartisan support, is \nthe one that should be supported and the Democratic should be rejected.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will the Senator defer to me for just 3 minutes?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it is with some potential embarrassment \nthat I stand here and say I may be the only person in the Senate who \nlives on a farm and has done so for 36 years. It is a dairy farm, with \ncows in the pasture and in the barn. The neighbors are all dairy \nfarmers--not all, but most.\n  Meaning no disrespect, if anyone presumes to think that the American \nFarm Bureau speaks for the farmers of Delaware County, they have not \nbeen in Delaware County. An insurance firm looks after a very small \nnumber of very well-to-do people. In New York State, according to Ray \nChristensen, who was the Delaware County Republican supervisor before \nhe became assistant commissioner of the Department of Agriculture and \nMarkets, the average sale price of a farm is about $257,000.\n  Here--quite unexpected, but very welcome--in this morning's New York \nTimes, the lead article of the business section talks about the \nDemocratic estate tax plan. It cites Neil Harl, an Iowa State \nUniversity economist who is a leading estate tax adviser to Midwestern \nfarmers. He says that only a handful of working family farms have a net \nworth of $4 million.\n\n       Above that, with very few exceptions, you are talking about \n     the Ted Turners who own huge ranches and are not working \n     farmers.\n\n  Mr. Harl said he was surprised that farmers were not calling \nlawmakers to demand that they take the President up on his promise--\nwhich the President has promised--to sign the Democratic bill. The \narticle concludes:\n\n       Professor Harl, the Iowa State University estate tax \n     expert, said that he had heard many horror stories about \n     people having to sell farms to pay estate taxes. But in 35 \n     years of conducting estate tax seminars for farmers, he \n     added, ``I have pushed and pushed and hunted and probed and \n     have not been able to find a single case where estate taxes \n     caused the sale of a family farm; it is a myth.''\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I sat here in wonder at the description \njust offered by a couple of Senators about this proposal to repeal the \nestate tax. It is a proposal that is dressed with language saying that \nthis is to help family farmers and small businesses. Yet when you \nremove the disguise, what you have are people pulling uphill a bag of \ngoodies for the largest estates and the wealthiest people in this \ncountry. Clarence Darrow, at the end of his life and long career in \nlaw, once said, ``I have long suffered from being misunderstood.'' Then \nhe said, ``I may have suffered more had I been understood.'' This \nproposal by the Republicans is going to suffer by being understood in \nthis debate and by the American people. Let's understand what it is. \nFirst of all, we all agree that we ought to essentially repeal the \nestate tax for small businesses and family farms. We all agree on that. \nIn fact, as the Senator from New York said, the New York Times article \ntoday says:\n\n       Two prominent experts in estate taxes said yesterday that \n     the Democrats were offering a much better deal to small \n     business owners and farmers, because the relief under their \n     bill would be immediate and the estate tax would be \n     eliminated for nearly all of them.\n       ``The fact is that the Democrats are making the better \n     offer''--and I am a Republican saying that--``said Sanford \n     Schlesinger of the law firm of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays, \n     and Handler of New York.''\n\n  What the Democrats offer is a much better deal. It repeals the estate \ntax for all family farms and small businesses. Put that offer on the \ntable. We repeal it more quickly. What is left is that the Republicans \nhave decided they insist on repealing the estate tax for the wealthiest \nfamilies in this country--$300 billion to $400 billion for additional \ntax relief for the wealthiest estates here in America. That is what \nthey insist upon.\n  What else could we do with this? They insist that money be used to \ngive tax relief to the wealthiest in this country. Well, we could \nprobably reduce the Federal debt. Would that be better than giving tax \nrelief to somebody who dies and leaves a $1 billion estate? The heirs \nwill only get $700 million or $800 million, and there will be money \npaid on an estate tax on the estate. Perhaps that money could be used \nto reduce the Federal debt. Would that be a gift to America's children? \nI think so.\n  Perhaps it can go to the prescription drug benefit in the Medicare \nprogram. How about using the money for that? Would that be more \nimportant than easing the tax burdens on the largest estates in the \ncountry? I believe so.\n  A series of things that would be a better use of those funds ought to \nbe debated today. A USA Today editorial says:\n\n       But behind the caterwauling about the death tax, the truth \n     is quite different. Most people will never be affected by \n     inheritance taxes: 98 percent of all estates aren't big \n     enough to be liable. Even among the elite 2 percent, very few \n     are farmers and small business folks. But there are better \n     ways to spend $50 million a year than handing it to the heirs \n     of the wealthiest people in the country. Take your pick: \n     Middle class tax cut, improved health benefits for seniors, \n     or paying down the national debt, for starters.\n\n  Those are the choices. The Republican side of the aisle says, no, \nlet's not just repeal the estate tax on small business and family \nfarms, let's repeal it on the wealthiest estates in America and claim \nthat what we are trying to do is protect farmers and small business \npeople.\n  Well, I don't think they appreciate being used that way. Farmers and \nsmall business people don't appreciate being used by someone who wants \nto take the $300 billion or $400 billion in tax relief that will accrue \nto the wealthiest American families and be\n\n[[Page S6606]]\n\ntold that somehow this is really for farmers and small businesses.\n\n  The New York Times article today says something else:\n\n       There is one reason that the American Farm Bureau \n     Federation and the NFIB, National Federation of Independent \n     Business, are not supporting the Democratic plan. Despite the \n     fact that it is better for family farmers and small business, \n     one reason may be that leading the call for the repeal of the \n     tax, the two organizations representing merchants and farmers \n     have done little to tell their members about the Democratic \n     plan. Interviews this week with a half dozen people whom the \n     two organizations offered as spokespeople on the estate tax \n     showed that only one of them had any awareness or \n     understanding of the Democratic plan.\n\n  Here you have two organizations--the American Farm Bureau Federation \nand the NFIB--running around Washington saying they represent farmers \nand family businesses, and they are supporting the wrong program. They \nare supporting a repeal proposal that is less advantageous for family \nfarmers and small businesses. And they tell their folks back home that \nthey are doing their business. Nonsense. You have two competing plans. \nBoth of them would repeal the estate tax for family farms and small \nbusinesses. But the Republican plan says we must go further and we must \ngive $300 billion to $400 billion in additional tax cuts in the next 10 \nyears and make sure those tax cuts go to the wealthiest estates in \nAmerica.\n  We say that is not the right set of priorities for this country. I \nhave heard this out-of-breath discussion. The folks who talk about \ndisguising public policy and debate around here are absolutely correct. \nYou can't disguise what you are doing here in terms of a large tax cut \nfor the wealthiest American estates by saying this goes to family \nfarmers and small business. It doesn't.\n  The proposal we offer is the one that will exempt family farms and \nsmall business.\n  The proposal they offer is the one that will give hundreds of \nbillions of dollars to the largest estates in America--$250 billion in \ntax benefits to the 400 wealthiest families in America.\n  Is that the priority? It is for them. It is not for us.\n  There are other needs and interests: prescription drugs for Medicare; \nas I have mentioned, paying down the Federal debt; tax relief for \nmiddle-income families. There are so many things that are so important \nthat we could do in public policy here today. Instead, we are debating \na plan that says, let us at this time and in this place provide the \nlargest tax cut in history to the wealthiest estates in America.\n  That doesn't make sense, no matter how you debate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes from leader \ntime.\n  Mr. President, I wish to make a few comments concerning the proposal, \nbut also on the issue. I, for one, am disappointed that we had to file \ncloture on a motion to proceed to take up this bill. That took a long \ntime. I am disappointed to see that now we may have a list of 10 \namendments on each side, most of which have very little, if anything, \nto do with the underlying issue of estate tax repeal or reduction.\n  In other words, it is unfortunate, but a lot of people want to play \npolitics, or they want to have a lot of different amendments that have \nnothing to do with this issue.\n  The American people want tax relief. They want to eliminate one of \nthe most unfair taxes in America. Some people ask: Why are you doing \nthis? Doesn't it only apply to 2 percent of the American people? The \ntax applies to a lot more than 2 percent of the American people. A lot \nof people aren't aware of the fact that they may well have to pay the \ntax. It is a very punitive tax.\n  Again, I have heard my Democrat colleagues say they are willing to \nincrease the exemptions so we can increase the number of people who pay \nzero and, therefore, make the problem go away. The tax doesn't go away.\n  We are dealing with this tax on death. The Federal Government is \nsaying, if you die and you happen to have an estate right now above the \nexemption amount, the Federal Government is going to come in and take \nat least 37 percent of what you have left if you have a taxable estate. \nIf you have a taxable estate of $1 million, the Government wants 39 \npercent; if it is $3 million, 55 percent. That is pretty high. If you \nhave a taxable estate of between $10 million and $17 million, the rate \nis 60 percent.\n  What is fair about that, whether it is 1 percent or 10 percent of the \nAmerican people paying it? What is fair about the Government taking 60 \npercent of somebody's business or their property, for which they worked \ntheir entire life. For the Government to come in and say, ``We want \nover half of it''? Absolutely nothing is right about that. Where is the \njustice in society, even if it is only one person? Shouldn't we have a \nTax Code that is fair for all? Is it fair to say 1 percent or 2 percent \nor 5 percent, we are going to take half of your property? Is that \njustified?\n  I thought Government was supposed to protect our property not \nconfiscate it. An individual should not be subject to extra burden \nbecause they have been successful. Maybe you start a small business and \nit grows, and you have no interest in taking the money out of the \nbusiness. You want it to grow. You want your kids to take over or maybe \nyour grandkids to take it over.\n  There are millions of businesses in America today where the second or \nthird generations want to grow, build, and expand. They are not trying \nto sell it so they can hand their kids a lot of wealth. They want their \nkids to have a business where they can continue to grow it, employ more \npeople, and provide a product and a service. Then Uncle Sam comes in \nand says: Sorry you are too successful. We want 50 percent or 60 \npercent of what you have.\n  That is currently the law. If we adopt the Democrats' substitute, it \nwill stay that way.\n  Last year, only 902 out of 47,000 estates, as pointed out by Chairman \nRoth, qualified as small businesses or as family farms. A whole lot of \nfarms and a whole lot of businesses that think they would qualify for \nthe exemption will find out that the IRS has written these regulations \npretty tight, and they don't qualify. All of a sudden, their business \nis hit with a very high tax. Let's say a restaurant business is bigger \nthan $5 million. Say you have a couple of restaurants in Denver or \nmaybe in Delaware and you build a nice restaurant worth a couple \nmillion dollars. You work hard every night. Maybe you have two \nrestaurants, and the net value of the estate is $6 million. Uncle Sam \nis going to come in and say, under the Democrats' proposal, maybe we \nwill give you a $2 million exemption, but for $4 million of it, you are \ngoing to be taxed.\n\n  Do you start the tax rate at 18 percent? No. Under the Democrats' \nproposal, you start at the taxable rate of 37 percent. By the third \nmillion dollars, you are at 55 percent. The tax that you are going to \nowe is $1.5 million. The restaurant doesn't have it. How do you pay? \nYou have to sell it. Instead of somebody being able to keep that \nrestaurant and pass it on to the third generation, you have to sell it \nbecause you do not have the $1.5 million you owe in taxes. It may be \nworth $3 million, but you do not have $1.5 million in cash. Now you \nhave to sell it, and the Government is responsible for destroying a \nbusiness. Maybe someone else will pick it up; maybe not. Maybe the \nperson who picks it up doesn't have the same interest in the employees \nor the same real interest in the business. Who knows?\n  My point is that Government shouldn't be confiscating property \nbecause somebody dies.\n  The proposal that passed with overwhelming bipartisanship in the \nHouse, by a two-thirds majority, two to one, said eliminates the death \ntax. Let's make it taxable when the property is sold. When someone \ndies, his or her children should be able to inherit the restaurant. If \ntheir kids want to keep operating the restaurant, they should not be \ntaxed. The tax should be incurred when the restaurant is sold. It \nshould be taxed at a capital gains rate of 20 percent instead of 55 or \n60 percent.\n  That makes more sense. When they sell it, guess what? They have the \ncash. They can pay the tax. The tax rate is reasonable. It makes sense. \nIt is 20 percent, not 55.\n  So the idea that we are going to exempt this greater percentage of \nthe estate doesn't eliminate the unfairness of the tax. It doesn't even \ndo what President Clinton said that he may be willing to do. The \nPresident, spoke to the\n\n[[Page S6607]]\n\nGovernors on July 10, just a couple of days ago, and said: ``We \nprovided some estate tax relief in 1997. I really didn't think it was \nenough. I think there should be more.''\n  I was involved in the conference in 1997. I will tell you that \nSecretary Rubin totally opposed this measure in estate tax relief \nthroughout the entire process. Assistant Secretary Summers was also \ncompletely opposed to it. For the President to say he really wanted to \ndo more is factually incorrect, or maybe his Treasury Secretary was not \nrepresenting his interests. Maybe his Assistant Secretary of Treasury, \nLarry Summers, who at that time in 1997 said, ``In terms of substantive \narguments, the evidence is about as bad as it gets. When it comes to \nthe estate tax, there is no case other than selfishness.''\n  That was Larry Summers position in 1997. That was when we were \nnegotiating the tax bill in 1997, on which the President now says he \nwanted to do more. I find that to be very interesting.\n  The President also said to the Governors--``I mean, you could argue \nthe rates are too high because they are higher than the maximum income \nrates now, and that is something that didn't used to be the case.''\n  That is right. The maximum estate tax rates that I just mentioned go \nup to 55 percent and 60 percent for the biggest estates, because we \nphased out the gradual phasing in of the rates. For a taxable estate \nbetween $10 million and $17 million, the rate is 55 percent; above $17 \nmillion, it is 60 percent.\n  The maximum personal income tax rate is 39.6 percent--actually it is \nhigher than that because the President eliminates other deductions and \nexemptions and has no limit on Medicare tax--he is implying he would be \nwilling to reduce the maximum estate tax from 55 to 39.6. That is a \nstep in the right direction, because rates are the problem.\n  The Democratic proposal does not effect the rates. It only increases \nexemption. If we have an estate beyond that exemption--and there are \nmillions of farms and ranches and businesses above it; they are $2 \nmillion, $4 million, $6 million--they are hit with the rate. Because of \nthe unified credit, you are taxed at 37 percent.\n  What we did in the Republican proposal that passed the House, was \nchange the unified credit to an exemption. Once a person is above the \nexemption amount, they begin paying estate taxes at 18 percent, not 37 \npercent. The bipartisan proposal that passed the House, that we will \nvote on, that Chairman Roth has been pushing, gives tax relief for \npeople who pay estate taxes; they start paying at 18 percent instead of \n37 percent. We changed the credit to an exemption and that benefits the \nlower value of estates that are taxable.\n  This rhetoric that we are exempting the big estates is hogwash. Big \nestates pay capital gains when those properties are sold. They will pay \nwhen that property is sold--not when someone dies. That rate will be 20 \npercent. That makes sense. The tax is paid when the property is sold, \nnot when someone dies.\n  Too many people are faced with the very unfortunate circumstance \nwhich I faced when my dad died. I was young. My father passed away, and \nwe had a manufacturing company. The book value of that manufacturing \ncompany was zero. The Government claimed it was worth a lot. We fought \nthe IRS for 7 years over the value of the company. We ended up writing \na big check and settling with the IRS. The Government wanted a big \nchunk of the Nickles Machine Corporation. They said it was worth much \nmore than we did. How do we know what the value is unless we sell it? \nThe Government was trying to force us to sell the company.\n  I am afraid this is happening today in millions of cases all across \nthe country. People are aware that this may happen, so they start \nplanning: What shall I do? Maybe I will start giving stock to my kids. \nMaybe the kids want to be in the business, maybe they don't want to be \nin the business. There are schemes. People who have big estates create \nfoundations. They do all kinds of things to avoid the tax.\n  There are millions of Americans who don't know the tax is coming. If \nthey do, they are worried about it, or they contain their plans, or \nthey don't grow their businesses. That is yet another negative \nconsequence of the death tax. They say: Why should I grow this \nbusiness? I will pass away, and the Government will get over half. Why \nshould we ``grow it'' if the Government is going to take half of it?\n  As a result many new jobs are not created. Many economic transactions \ndo not take place because of the Government's heavy hand coming in. \nThat is in addition to the fact that they taxed the property when it \nwas originally received or as it earned income year by year.\n  This is one of the most unfair taxes on the books--maybe the most \nunfair tax we have on the books today. It needs to be repealed. An \nexemption will not cure the problem. It may garner support from some \ngroups, but it is not adequate. Anybody who reads the definition of \n``farm'' and ``business'' will realize they do not qualify for the \nexemption.\n  The Democrat substitute is not feasible and it should not pass. I \nurge my colleagues to vote against the Democrat substitute and vote in \nfavor of the Roth amendment.\n  I hope we will be voting on both before too long and I hope those are \nthe only two votes we have on this bill. I understand we may be voting \non twenty amendments regarding taxes in general. I think we should be \nconsidering amendments relevant to estate taxes only. These extraneous \namendments do not help the process, they just slow it down.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  Mr. President, with all due respect to the Senator from Oklahoma, I \nthink the two Senators from North Dakota spelled out very clearly and \nconvincingly the differences between the position taken by the \nRepublican majority, and the alternative proposed by Democrats. The \nDemocratic proposal basically and fairly addresses legitimate concerns \nin the estate tax by essentially removing the estate tax from small \nfarms and businesses. That presentation has been made effectively by \nthe Democrats. I don't think anything that has been said in the recent \nmoments undermines the credibility of the Democratic position. I think \nthe Democratic alternative proposal reflects the views of the \noverwhelming majority of the Democrats on this issue.\n  I am somewhat amazed as we come into the final days of this period of \nthe Congress that we are talking about how we are going to reduce the \ntaxes for the wealthiest 2,400 Americans. These people pay half of all \ncurrent estate taxes. In the outer years, the second decade after a \nrepeal, the 400 wealthiest families in this country would save $250 \nbillion in taxes under the Republican plan. That explains why some of \nour colleagues on the other side insist that we spend the Senate's \nlimited time addressing only the concerns of the wealthy.\n  The fact is, we have 10 million Americans today who would benefit \nfrom an increase in the minimum wage. We know the minimum wage has \nfallen substantially behind in its purchasing power. Why isn't the \nSenate of the United States debating what we will do for the 10 million \nhard-working Americans, working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, \nin some of the most challenging jobs in our society? What is it about \nthe priorities of the Republicans trying to protect the interests of \nthe very wealthiest individuals in our society, rather than trying to \ndeal with the hard-working Americans who are at lower levels of the \neconomic ladder--in this case, hard-working Americans making minimum \nwage? Many of these workers are women, including women who have \nchildren; and a significant number are men and women of color. This is \na family issue. It is a children's issue. It is basically a fairness \nissue.\n  No, the Republicans with this issue want to reduce taxes on the \nwealthiest individuals, $250 billion additional for the 400 wealthiest \nfamilies in this country. Should that surprise Members? No. I look back \nto the debate from the mid-1990s. Perhaps some Members remember the \nfamous tax\n\n[[Page S6608]]\n\nloophole called the Benedict Arnold tax loophole that permits Americans \nto accumulate billions and billions of dollars in this great land. And \nthen what does a citizen do? He basically renounces his citizenship and \ntakes those billions of dollars out of the country, tax free. It is the \nBenedict Arnold tax loophole.\n  I went over the various votes we had to end this deplorable practice. \nWe voted at least seven times on that. Every time we had a sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution that was non-binding, our Republican friends \nvoted with us to eliminate this Billionaire tax loophole, but when had \nsubstantive votes to actually do something about it, they voted against \nus.\n  Just about a month ago, in May the Wall Street Journal reported that \nthe loopholes enabling the super-rich to renounce their citizenship and \navoid tax remain. The loopholes in the expatriate tax law are so big \nthat you could fly a jumbo jet through them. The basic Benedict Arnold \nloophole remains alive and well--costing the Treasury billions and \nbillions of dollars.\n  President Clinton has joined Democrats in repeatedly proposing to end \nall of the loopholes. His February 2000 budget includes repeal. But we \nsee no action from the Republicans. We only see them wanting to add \nmore escape hatches for the super-rich.\n  Why is it that the Republicans are so prepared to protect the \nfinancial interests of the wealthiest individuals? We ought to be \ntaking these resources and investing them in our schools. We need \nsignificant investments in education so that our children can attend \nmodern schools, schools that are worthwhile for their attendance, \nschools with small class sizes, and schools with trained teachers. Many \nRepublicans talk about these needs, but when it comes to action, they \nwant to focus on adding to the riches of the rich. The nation deserves \nmuch better than this estate tax repeal plan.\n  We ought to be debating here this afternoon the interest in a \nprescription drug program that will look after 40 million Americans, \ninstead of 2,400.\n  It is very clear what the priorities are. The other side, the \nRepublicans, are looking after the financial interests of the \nwealthiest individuals in this country, and many of us believe that we, \nat this time, ought to be debating what we are going to do to protect \nthe hard-working Americans who are making the minimum wage, those \nsenior citizens who need a prescription drug coverage, or the children \nof this country who need new, modern schools. That is what the issue \nought to be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from \nMassachusetts on his remarks. They were precise. They were telling. It \nis a baffling matter. Forty million Americans need a minimum wage \nincrease and we are here on the floor talking about 2,400, who wish to \navoid all the estate taxes which Theodore Roosevelt began in this \nNation. At the end of the century in which he started it, we want to \nget rid of it. It is baffling.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Montana would like to \nspeak for, I believe, 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Montana is yielded--there \nis 1 minute left on the bill, and 4 minutes from the 90 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, a lot has been said about this issue on \nboth sides, the bill offered by the majority and the Democratic \nalternative, how best to deal with estate taxes. As often is the case, \nthere is a lot of rhetoric flying around here, a lot of claims, a lot \nof words. It is, I am sure, difficult for the American public who may \nbe listening to this debate to try to ascertain the facts. Most people \nwould like to know which bill does make more sense, after hearing all \nthe debate and all the rhetoric. I would like to do what I can to give \nsome honest facts and let the people decide for themselves.\n  One is the statement made by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, that \nthe Treasury Department, in estimating the cost of their bill, did not \nlook at the capital gains effect. That is just not true. The fact is \nthe Treasury Department did look at the capital gains effect in the \nsecond 10 years of the bill. That figure, $750 billion in cost, is an \naccurate figure. That is a fact.\n  Second, the point was made--and by other Senators--that the small \nbusiness exemption in the Democratic bill is too complicated; farmers, \nranchers, and small businesses just cannot qualify. The fact is, No. 1, \nthere has to be some provision in the code which indicates who does and \nwho does not qualify for an exemption. There has to be some set of \nguidelines. There are guidelines which were modified in 1997 on a \nbipartisan basis by both Republicans and Democrats. That is in the law \ntoday.\n\n  I might say, too, we, in our bill, by raising the small business \nexemption for small businesses and family farms--and also, I might add, \nunified credit--do give great relief to farmers and ranchers, not only \nin the first year but the second year and all the years that are \ncontained in this bill; whereas, in the House-passed bill, even though \nthey might complain about the provision of the law which gives \nexemption, there is nothing advocated by the majority side which deals \nwith anything that would help farmers and ranchers in the family-held \nexemption.\n  Basically, the fact is, if you are a farmer or rancher or if you are \na small business person and you are trying to decide which of these two \nbills is going to help you the most, it is clear; it is black and \nwhite. The Democratic alternative is going to help farmers and \nranchers, small business people--family-held businesses--dramatically \nmore in the first year, the second year, the third year, the fourth \nyear, and forever; whereas, in the House-passed bill, there is \nvirtually no help to farmers and ranchers and business people until the \n10th year, when it is automatically repealed.\n  I might also add, the cost is a matter of concern. Here we are in \nCongress, trying to give estimates as to what the budget surplus will \nbe in the next 10 years, the next 20 years. That is a hard thing to do, \nbut we do our best. Ironically, because we did not want the measures to \nbe backloaded too much the second 5 years, we have now asked for 10-\nyear estimates instead of 5-year estimates. The net effect of that is \nit blows up the surpluses so they look so large.\n  The difficulty is those are only projections. That is all they are; \nthey are just projections. At the same time, we are here today talking \nabout law. We are discussing what a new law should be and how much \ntaxes should be reduced. On the one hand, it is projections; on the \nother hand, it is the cold reality of law.\n  I do not know if this is going to happen; nobody knows, but it could \nwell be that 5 years from now, 10 years from now, the economy might not \nbe doing so well; the projections might be off. I do not know if it is \nwise--I am only talking about wisdom here--to pass a tax reduction bill \nwhich does not take effect, in a sense, for another 10 years, which is \nso dramatic in its reduction of taxes at a time when we really do not \nknow what the economic picture of the country will be.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I would love to yield, yes.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Does he not recall that in 1980 the Office of \nManagement and Budget projected a large surplus for the Federal budget \nin the coming 5 years?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I recall it very well.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Just as we were plunging into the deepest deficits?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is vivid in my mind.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 4 minutes of the Senator have expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I think I had 1 minute more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The additional minute has also expired.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is yielded another 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank my friend from Nevada.\n  I will sum up because these are the facts. We have a choice: It is \nthe House-passed bill or the Democratic alternative. The House-passed \nbill gives no relief, no estate is exempted under the House-passed \nbill, none, for 10 years--none. On the Democratic alternative, the vast \nmajority of farmers\n\n[[Page S6609]]\n\nand ranchers and small business people--family held--are exempt from \npaying estate taxes. That is a fact.\n  Fact No. 2: The Democratic alternative is less expensive. Why? \nBecause it does not totally repeal the estate tax, the effect being for \nthe very wealthy taxpayers. That is a fact.\n  Do we want to repeal the estate tax for the most wealthy taxpayers? I \nsubmit, because we are dealing with budget estimates, we do not know \nwhat the outyears are going to be. Because the House bill does not take \neffect for 10 years anyway, it makes sense to pass measures which do \nnot repeal for the most wealthy, but, rather, save some of that for \ndebt reduction, for education tax credits, or for other matters that, \nreally, more American people really care more about than total tax \nrelief for the most wealthy. That is really the question here.\n  I think most Americans, when they look at the facts of the bill and \nask themselves which of those two choices makes the more sense, would \nthink discretion is the better part of valor here. We cannot have \neverything. There is moderation in everything. The most moderate, \nbalanced way is to say: OK, let's address the problem we are most \nconcerned with--small businesses, farmers, and ranchers--because that \nis what is most important; but let's not do everything because we live \nin a society where we have to work things out on a fair, balanced basis \nand take things a step at a time.\n  Most Americans are very balanced, have common sense and lots of \nwisdom. That is the way we should go.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Well said.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senators has expired.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use.\n  Too often in our debates on the Senate floor, we lose touch with what \nreally is at issue. What we do here, the decisions we make, affect real \npeople. For that reason I want to take a moment and read a letter I \nrecently received.\n\n       Dear Senator Roth: I am a 14 year old boy, living in New \n     York, and though my knowledge of the law is very minuscule, I \n     know one thing, the Estate Tax is wrong. I have considered \n     myself a Democrat for all of my life, volunteering for Bill \n     Bradley for President and my local Congresswoman from New \n     York's 14th District, Carolyn Maloney, but on this issue I \n     must side with the opposition.\n       I shall explain to you why I am so opposed. My Grandfather \n     on my mother's side bought his house in 1945 in Winnetka, \n     Illinois for $10,000. He was a doctor. Back then, Winnetka \n     was a ``dry'' town, alcohol was prohibited. Today, Winnetka \n     is one of the rich suburbs of Chicago and my Grandmother, 86 \n     years old, lives alone in the same home without my \n     Grandfather who passed away in 1982. The house today, not a \n     thing changed since 1945, is worth around $2 to 3 million. It \n     pains me to say this, but my Grandmother could pass any day \n     and her house, her belongings, everything my Grandfather \n     worked for 50 years as Doctor, helping others, could be gone. \n     She is not rich, in fact, she has nothing except for her \n     house and her furniture.\n       I hope that you understand my staunch opposition to the \n     Estate Tax and I hope that you will vote to repeal the Estate \n     Tax. Thank you for reading this, could you please respond to \n     my inquiry:\n           Thank you.\n                                              Alexander Leventhal.\n\n  I hope young Mr. Leventhal, and his grandmother, do not mind that I \nread his letter before the Senate. I hope that they will accept a \nverbal response to his letter, and I hope that this Senate will vote to \ngive them the response they and millions others deserve: repeal of the \ndeath tax.\n  This family, separated by hundreds of miles and generations, should \nnot have to worry about the fate of their grandfather's house. No \nfamily, no farmer, and no small business person should have to worry \nabout this sort of thing. It is bad enough that they have to lose sleep \nover the worry, but the loss, as young Mr. Leventhal so accurately \npoints out, can be so much greater. It is a house, it is a farm, it is \na business, it is savings, that a family has worked for throughout a \nlifetime. One lifetime comes to an end, and suddenly the entire \nfamily's memories of the past and dreams for the future can come to an \nend as well.\n  As we all know, no one individual creates a farm or a business by \nthemselves. The whole family sacrifices to it. They sacrifice by having \na parent, or both parents, away when they could have been home. They \ncontribute by seeing money that could have been taken out of the farm \nor business and spent, instead reinvested into growing the farm or \nbusiness for the family, and, of course, the family contributes their \nwork. Family members do not punch a time card when they work on their \nfamily's farm or in their family's business. Their work is part of \nbeing a member of the family. They do not see all they worked for just \nin earnings--they see much of it in a growing family enterprise.\n  Yet when one member of that family dies, they see a tax bill for \nincome they never received. For income they never wanted--at least not \nas much as they wanted to grow their family's farm or business. But \nbecause the tax bill is so big and their earnings went back into the \nfamily's enterprise, they have to sell the family's farm or small \nbusiness. Not because they need the money, or even because they want \nthe money, but because the Federal Government in Washington does, and \nthe Federal Government demands they sell it in order to pay those who \nnever worked a day on their farm or a minute in their business or, as \nin the case of Alexander Leventhal, never lived a day in his \ngrandfather's house in Winnetka.\n  Where is the justice in this? I am sure Mr. Leventhal would like to \nhear it.\n  I have heard some say that taxing at death is the only way some \nincome will ever be taxed. Of course, this is not true. It will be \ntaxed when it is realized--when a farm, a business, a house is sold--\nwhen it actually exists for a family. These are not people who dodge \ntaxes, as the apologists for a confiscatory death tax try to make them. \nIt is nothing less than a desperate attempt to defend the indefensible.\n  These are people who never saw the income because it never existed \nfor them. It was in their farms and businesses. They should not be \ntaxed on some make-believe basis at a time to be decided by the \nGovernment. When they sell their farms and businesses, they will pay \ntax on it. Until the family decides to, when it is right for the \nfamily, what place is it for the Government to come in and tell them \nthat they have to sell what often is the very purpose for which that \nfamily worked and wants to continue to work?\n  I see no justice in that. I cannot believe anyone on this Senate \nfloor could see any justice in that. But most important, no one outside \nthis Chamber--certainly not Alexander Leventhal, his grandmother or any \none of millions upon millions of hardworking Americans--see any justice \nin that.\n  It is time to repeal the death tax. It has always been unfair. Today, \nin a time of growing surpluses, it is no longer even necessary. I hope \nmy colleagues will take to heart not my admonition, but that of my \nletter writer: ``I hope that you understand my staunch opposition to \nthe Estate Tax and I hope that you will vote to repeal the Estate \nTax.''\n  Alexander, I will and I hope my colleagues will as well.\n  I believe time has run out. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder \nof my time.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I believe our time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3821. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I believe it is the majority's \nopportunity to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3823\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3823.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a \n permanent extension of the credit for increasing research activities)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n            TITLE VI--PERMANENT EXTENSION OF RESEARCH CREDIT\n\n     SEC. 601. PERMANENT EXTENSION OF RESEARCH CREDIT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 41 (relating to credit for \n     increasing research activities) is amended by striking \n     subsection (h).\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Paragraph (1) of section 45C(b) \n     is amended by striking subparagraph (D).\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this amendment is a simple one. It would \npermanently extend the research and experimentation tax credit--a tax \nprovision that has been instrumental in helping to keep our economic \ngrowth robust over the past decade.\n  Let me explain why this amendment is necessary.\n  Last July, this body voted to extend the research credit permanently. \nUnfortunately, the House version of last year's tax bill included only \na five-year extension of the credit. The five-year extension prevailed \nin conference. Of course, last summer's tax bill was vetoed by the \nPresident.\n  Fortunately, however, last November, Congress passed and the \nPresident signed the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement \nAct, which included the five-year extension of the research credit. \nTherefore, the credit has been extended to June 30, 2004.\n  And, in 2004, corporate America will have to go through this \nrigmarole again. This tax credit has been on and off, extended and \nexpired, a legislative certainty or a legislative football almost more \ntimes than anyone can count.\n  Anyone in this body who has been in business for more than 10 minutes \nknows that planning and budgeting--unlike what we do here in Congress--\nis a multiyear process. And, anyone who has been involved in research \nknows that the scientific enterprise does not fit neatly into calendar \nor fiscal year.\n  Our treatment of the R tax credit--that is, allowing it to run to \nthe brink of expiration and reviving it at the 11th hour--is a \ndisservice to our research entities and, yes, our whole country.\n  It is time to get serious about our commitment to a tax credit that \nis widely believed by economists and business leaders to be one of the \nmost effective provisions in creating economic growth and keeping this \ncountry on the leading edge of high technology in the world.\n  This amendment gives us an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment.\n  A large number of the Members of this body, on both sides of the \naisle, are on record in support of a permanent research credit. Indeed, \nS. 680, the research credit permanence bill that my colleague from \nMontana, Senator Baucus, and I introduced last year, enjoys the support \nof 26 Democrats and 20 Republicans. In addition, a permanent research \ncredit was included in Democratic alternative to last summer's tax \nbill, which was supported by 39 Democrats. Moreover, both Governor Bush \nand Vice President Gore support a permanent research credit.\n  But, while practically everyone says they support a permanent \nresearch credit, it has become too easy for Congress to fall into its \ntwo-decade-long practice of merely extending the credit for a year or \ntwo, or even five years, and then not worrying about it until it is \ntime to extend it again.\n  These short-term extensions have occurred ten times since 1981, Mr. \nPresident. Ten short-term extensions for a tax credit that most members \nof this body strongly support. I am not sure if we realize how the lack \nof permanence of the credit damages the effectiveness of the research \ncredit.\n  Research and development projects typically take a number of years \nand may even last longer than a decade. As our business leaders plan \nthese projects, they need to know whether or not they can count on this \ntax credit.\n  The current uncertainty surrounding the credit has induced businesses \nto allocate significantly less to research than they otherwise would if \nthey knew the tax credit would be available. This uncertainty \nundermines the entire purpose of the credit. For the government and the \nAmerican people to maximize the return on their investment in U.S. \nbased research and development, this credit must be made permanent. And \nnow is the time to do so.\n  During the ten times in the past 19 years that Congress has extended \nthe research credit for a short time, the ostensible reason has been a \nlack of revenue. The excuse we give to constituents is that we didn't \nhave the money to extend the bill permanently. Ironically, it costs at \nleast as much in terms of lost revenue, in the long run, to enact \nshort-term extensions as it does to extend it permanently.\n  With the latest projections of the on-budget surplus, for one year, \nfor five years, and for ten years, this excuse is gone. There is simply \nno valid reason that the research credit should not be extended on a \npermanent basis.\n  Moreover, now is the time to extend the provision permanently. By \nmaking the research credit permanent now, we will send a strong signal \nto the business community that a new era of stronger support for \nresearch has dawned.\n  The timing could not be better because, as I mentioned, many research \nprojects, especially those in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, must \nbe planned and budgeted for months and even years in advance. The more \nuncertain the long-term future of the research credit is, the smaller \nthe potential of the credit to stimulate increased research. Simply \nknowing of the reliability of a permanent research credit will give a \nboost to the amount of research performed, even before the current \ncredit expires in 2004.\n  My home state of Utah is a good example of how state economies \nbenefit from the research tax credit. Utah is home to a large number of \nfirms who invest a high percentage of their revenue on research and \ndevelopment.\n  For example, between Salt Lake City and Provo lies one of the world's \nbiggest stretches of software and computer engineering firms. This \narea, which was named ``Software Valley'' by Business Week, is a \nsignificant example of one of a growing number of thriving high tech \ncommercial regions outside California's Silicon Valley. Newsweek \nmagazine included Utah among the top ten information technology centers \nin the world. The Utah Information Technologies Association estimates \nthat Utah's IT industry consists of 2,427 enterprises, employing 42,328 \nwith revenue of over $7 billion.\n  In addition, Utah is home to about 700 biotechnology and biomedical \nfirms that employ nearly 9,000 workers. Research and development are \nthe reasons these companies exist. Not only do these companies need to \ncontinue conducting a high quality level of research, but this research \nfeeds other industries and, ultimately, consumers.\n\n[[Page S6611]]\n\nJust ask the patients who have benefited from new drugs or therapies.\n  In all, there are more than 80,000 employees working in Utah's \nthousands of technology based companies. Many other states have \nexperienced similar growth in high technology businesses. Research and \ndevelopment is the lifeblood of these firms and hundreds of thousands \nlike them throughout the nation.\n  Findings from a study conducted by Coopers & Lybrand show that \nworkers in every state will benefit from higher wages if the research \ncredit is made permanent. Payroll increases as a result of gains in \nproductivity stemming from the credit have been estimated to exceed $60 \nbillion over the next 12 years. Furthermore, greater productivity from \nadditional research and development will increase overall economic \ngrowth in every state in the Union.\n  Research and development is essential for long-term economic growth. \nInnovations in science and technology have fueled the massive economic \nexpansion we have witnessed over the course of the 20th century. These \nadvancements have improved the standard of living for nearly every \nAmerican. Simply put, the research tax credit is an investment in \neconomic growth, new jobs, and important new products and processes.\n  In conclusion, if we decide not to make the research credit \npermanent, we are not limiting the potential growth of our economy? How \ncan we expect the American economy to hold the lead in the global \neconomic race if we allow other countries, which provide huge \ngovernment direct subsidies, to offer faster tracks than we do?\n  Making the credit permanent will keep American business ahead of the \npack. It will speed economic growth. Innovations resulting from \nAmerican research and development will continue to improve the standard \nof living for every person in the U.S. and also worldwide.\n  Simply put, the costs of not making the research credit permanent are \nfar greater than the costs of making it permanent. As we enter the new \nmillennium, we cannot afford to let the American economy slow down. Now \nis the time to send a strong message to the world that America intends \nto retain its position as the world's foremost innovator.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I would simply like to say that there is \nnot a word in the remarks of my close friend from Utah with which I \nwould disagree. I have now served 24 years on the Finance Committee, \nand the last 20 years has been a continued frustration in our \ndisinclination and refusal to make the research and development credit \npermanent.\n  It is elemental that research projects go beyond 2, 4, or 20 years. \nIt is elemental and in the interest of society that these projects \nshould take place. We allow the credit to be taken but only in 2-year \nintervals, as it were, such that there will obviously be some decisions \nmade that it is too risky and maybe they won't do it next time. We \nalways renew it, but at a cost. There is an efficiency cost which is \nclear.\n  I, for one, will happily vote in support of the Senator's proposal.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, who together with \nSenator Abraham and Senator Robb, is a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my very good friend from Utah for \noffering this amendment. It is high time that we make the R tax \ncredit permanent. It is almost impossible to come up with a reason why \nit is not permanent. It is like a yo-yo--on for a year and off. Then \nthey have to make it retroactive. It is nuts.\n  Business abhors uncertainty. If we can make this permanent, that is \none uncertainty that can be dispensed with.\n  Obviously, the United States is going to remain the powerful economic \nengine in research and development, and the tax credit should be made \npermanent. It is a key part of that.\n  I thank my good friend. I am proud to be a cosponsor of his \namendment. I hope it passes. Unfortunately, it is on a bill that the \nPresident says he will veto. I hope some time between now and then we \ncan find a vehicle and some way to pass this measure.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am prepared to yield back the balance of our time.\n  Mr. ROTH. I congratulate the Senator from Utah for raising this very \nimportant piece of legislation. As Senator Moynihan said, the two of us \nhave been working continually to try to make this permanent. It is long \noverdue. I am grateful for initiative on the Senator's part.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Massachusetts desires 3 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join in commending my friend from Utah \non this proposal. We are moving into the life science century with \nabsolutely extraordinary breakthroughs in so many areas.\n  We want to see a continuation of the R from the private sector, \nwith an element of the public sector, as well. I think this Congress \nhas wisely doubled the NIH budget, for example, and also seen an \nexpanded research in other areas of the agencies that we have witnessed \nin recent times. That has not always been the case in recent times \nwhere we have a combination of the opportunity for creativity and \nexpansion in terms of our economy in many fields, particularly the \nareas of health, are virtually unlimited.\n  This will make an enormous difference. I congratulate the Senator \nfrom Utah. Seeing my friend and colleague, the ranking minority member, \nI am mindful of the fact during the height of the Japanese recession, \nwhen they were hard pressed in terms of their economic future, what did \nthe Japanese Government do? They tripled the R budget. We have seen \nsimilar examples in Europe. As a result of these incentives in trying \nto bring more research and development, we have seen the restoration of \nimportant economies of the world.\n  We have a strong economy and we want to keep it this way. Having this \npermanent will be a very important contribution in ensuring that. I \ncongratulate the Senator. I ask unanimous consent to be a cosponsor of \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hatch). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I ask consent to use my 10 minutes to \nspeak on the underlying bill, the estate tax measure.\n  I think there are a couple of issues that need greater attention in \nthis debate over the Federal estate tax. We have an underlying bill \nsponsored by Senator Kyl that will gradually abolish the tax over the \nnext 10 years. The Democrats offered a substitute that was just \ndefeated. The Democrat substitute purported to raise an exemption that \nis now available in the code for family businesses and for family \nfarms.\n  There are two points I want to make. One goes to the issue of exactly \nhow much revenue would be lost by abolishing the Federal death tax, or \nthe inheritance tax as it is sometimes called. Last year, the Federal \nGovernment took in $24.8 billion in death taxes. If we were to abolish \nthat amount, if we were to abolish that estate tax altogether, we would \nlose that $24.8 billion. What this debate has been ignoring is that \nright now when an estate is taxed, the assets passed to the next \ngeneration are given, for capital gains purposes, what tax lawyers call \n``a stepped-up basis.'' That means any assets your heirs take after the \nestate tax has been assessed, if they were to sell those assets, they \nwould pay zero in capital gains taxes. When the Federal Government \ntakes in $24.8 billion in estate taxes, it is actually giving up a \nwhole lot in Federal capital gains taxes.\n  Senator Kyl's proposal abolishes the Federal inheritance tax, or the \nestate tax, over 10 years, but after the estate tax is gone, heirs who \ntake assets inherited from a previous generation will still have to pay \ncapital gains taxes. They will no longer get that so-called stepped-up \nbasis for capital gains purposes. In other words, if you have a \ngrandfather or a father or mother who bought a farm in 1960 for \n$100,000 and that farm is passed along to the next generation and the \nheirs take that farm and after their parents have died they decide to \nsell that farm, they will have to pay capital gains taxes on the\n\n[[Page S6612]]\n\ndifference between the sale price and the original purchase price of \ntheir parents. If in the year 2000 they sell that farm that cost \n$100,000 in 1960 for $1 million, they pay $180,000 in capital gains \ntaxes--20 percent of their capital gain of $900,000.\n  If they inherited that farm today and, say, their parents' estate had \npaid the estate tax, without Senator Kyl's bill, if they sold that farm \nfor $1 million, they would pay zero in capital gains taxes. Senator \nKyl's bill is switching from an estate tax rate to a capital gains tax \nrate. There isn't all this loss of revenue that the other side is \ntalking about.\n  Somebody on the other side of the aisle brought up the example of the \nForbes 400 list and said this would be a $250 billion windfall for \nthem. That ignores that once Senator Kyl's bill passes, heirs of the \nForbes 400 would all have to pay gigantic capital gains taxes.\n  I think actually when all is said and done, considering the jobs we \nwill save, the family farms that will be allowed to stay in the \nfamilies once we have abolished the death tax, family farmers are six \ntimes as likely as ordinary Americans to incur the Federal estate tax. \nThat is because they have the classic ill-liquid estate. They may have \nhuge assets in the value of that farmland. They worked all their lives, \nsweating and paying taxes on every year's income, and buying that farm \nwith aftertax dollars. It may have taken their entire career in farming \nto finally pay off the mortgage on their farm and then when they die, \nthe Federal Government is going to take 55 percent of that farm, taking \naway the fruits of their life labor. They cannot hand it down to the \nnext generation; or the next generation, if they want to keep it, has \nto incur a huge amount of debt to pay off those Federal estate taxes.\n  What Senator Kyl's bill does is change it so what activates the tax \nis no longer death. What will activate the tax is when somebody decides \nto sell a capital asset, such as a family farm or a family business. \nThen they will pay capital gains taxes. As in ordinary circumstances, \nwhen you sell a capital asset, you pay capital gains taxes. Selling \nwould activate the tax. Death would no longer be a taxable event. \nWouldn't that be better for everyone if that was the case?\n  Now, the Democrats made very much of their counterproposal to expand \nthe exemption available under 2057 of the Tax Code. There is a larger \nexemption for family farms and small businesses that is already in the \nTax Code. The Democrats' proposal was to expand that to $4 million for \na husband and $4 million for a wife so that potentially a couple could \nhand down an $8 million farm or $8 million family business. That sounds \nlike a great idea. The only problem is, you have to look at section \n2057. When you look at 2057, you realize it is 6 pages long. To be a \nqualifying family farm or a qualifying small business under section \n2057, you have to go through 13 pages worth of hoops. There are \ninnumerable cross-references to other sections in the code, some 64 \ncross-references just to section 2032A. That is why, as Senator Kyl \npointed out, only 3 percent to 4 percent of family farms and small \nbusinesses in this country can actually qualify for this section 2057 \nexemption. It is very hard to qualify for it.\n\n  In fact, recently, the tax section of the American Bar Association \nurged Congress to repeal section 2057 because it leaves too great a \npotential for lawyer malpractice. It is a very complicated provision of \nthe code. It really only offers false hope. It is a mirage. The \ncounterproposal on the other side of the aisle was really a sham. It \noffered no relief, no safe harbor. No small business, no family farm \ncould have staked much hope on their counterproposal.\n  Finally, I think it is important that we adopt Senator Kyl's measure \nbecause it would get rid of the Federal death tax. If you identify \ncancer in somebody's body, you don't go in and only take out part of \nit. You have to get it all so it does not grow back again. If we do not \nget it all, if we do not get this cancer in our Tax Code, there is \nalways the possibility that a future Congress or administration will \ncome back and try to grow it again. In fact, it was only a few years \nago that President Clinton was talking about lowering the estate tax \nthreshold so families who had over $200,000 would start incurring the \nestate tax.\n  I compliment my colleague, Senator Kyl, and others who have worked so \nhard on this provision. For the State of Illinois, which is a major \nagricultural producer, the third largest ag State in the country, with \nsome of the highest yielding land in the country, we have thousands of \nfamily farms and businesses that revolve around farms--all of rural \nIllinois outside the Chicago area. Nothing has contributed more to the \nsale of family farms than the estate tax. When the estate tax went in, \nback in 1916, keep in mind, we were just developing an income tax in \nthis country. We were just developing a corporate system of taxation in \nthis country. It was all different. The exemption in 1916, to keep pace \nwith inflation, would have to be a $9 million exemption today.\n  I think it is high time Congress act on this matter. We are simply \nswitching, trading estate tax rates for less onerous capital gains tax \nrates, and giving the American people, the small businesses and the \nfamily farmers, the options to keep their family farms and their \nbusinesses within their families for another generation, to continue \nemploying people and keeping our economy productive.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support this amendment to permanently \nextend the R tax credit. I presented a similar amendment last year, \nand I commend Senator Hatch's leadership on this important issue.\n  Many have called this the century of life sciences. We are witnessing \nextraordinary breakthroughs which are both transforming our quality of \nlife and fueling our economy. The R tax credit is a proven effective \nmeans to generate increased research and development in the life \nsciences, and it is a key ingredient in the continued success and \ngrowth of the nation's economy.\n  Much of America's technological leadership today and in the past has \nbeen stimulated by federal support for private investment in R The \nCongress has wisely decided to double the NIH budget. We need to \ncontinue to strengthen these investments as a top national priority.\n  A main virtue of the credit is that it encourages investments in the \nkind of research that ensures long-term competitiveness. Often, private \nsector research focuses on closer horizons, and the credit is important \nin encouraging a longer-term focus as well.\n  Research and development now generate about 5,000 new jobs a year, \nand significant amounts in taxes for the federal treasury. Federal \nReserve Chairman Greenspan has cited increased productivity as the \nsource of our current record breaking economy. It accounts for 70% of \nour economic growth.\n  This record-breaking economy provides an unprecedented opportunity \nfor increased creativity and expansion. Particularly in the health \nfield, our ability to increase our R investment will make an enormous \ndifference in our fight against disease and in our efforts to improve \nthe quality of life for so many.\n  Making the R tax credit permanent is essential for encouraging \ncontinued investment by private industry. Without a permanent credit, \nindustry lacks the certainty needed to make decisions about continuing \ninvestments.\n  A permanent R credit will do more to encourage investment in the \nlong-term research projects needed to keep our companies--and our \nnation--at the cutting edge of competition in the world economy. In the \nlast session of Congress we were able to extend the credit temporarily \nagain. I am hopeful that this year, with bipartisan support, we can \nmake the credit permanent.\n  The credit has been extended 10 times since 1981. But this on-again \noff-again pattern makes the credit less reliable, and diminishes the \nimportant incentives that the credit can provide.\n  I am mindful that at the height of the Japanese recession, Japan has \nmanaged to triple its R budget. European countries are increasing \ntheir budgets as well.\n  Congress should do all it can to give R the top priority it \ndeserves. Stable and substantial federal funding is essential for \nfundamental scientific research. We must also support private \ninvestment in fundamental research across a wide spectrum of \ndisciplines.\n\n[[Page S6613]]\n\nIn failing to do so, we run the risk of slowing the nation's economic \nengines.\n  I am proud of the leadership of Massachusetts on these issues. \nAccording to a study by the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative, the \nstate received $3.45 billion in federal research and development funds \nin 1997, amounting to 37% of total research and development spending in \nthe state and received the sixth-largest share of federal R funding \nin the nation.\n  A large number of Massachusetts firms have joined in a letter \nemphasizing the importance of the R credit and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the letter may be printed in the record at the conclusion \nof my remarks.\n  The Joint Economic Committee, in two sets of Congressional hearings \nthis year and last year, focused on the important role of science and \ntechnology in our society and our economy. Witness after witness \ntestified about the importance of making this credit permanent.\n  I look forward to continuing work with all of my colleagues to see \nthat R receives the top priority it deserves. The current partnership \nbetween the government, the academic world, and the private sector is \naffected, and it deserves to be strengthened.\n  I congratulate my colleague on this important amendment, I urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it. Our economic \nfuture deserves no less.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         R Credit Coalition,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 18, 1999.\n     Hon. William Jefferson Clinton,\n     The President of the United States, The White House, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: While legislators continue the national \n     debate on tax relief, one of the few issues upon which \n     legislators across the political spectrum agree is the \n     importance of a long-term seamless extension of the research \n     and experimentation tax credit (the ``R credit''). The \n     Senate version of the tax bill, and the Democratic \n     alternatives in the House and the Senate all would have made \n     the R tax credit permanent, while the House bill and the \n     House/Senate Conference Report provided for a seamless five \n     year extension of the R credit. In testimony before the \n     Joint Economic Committee in June, Federal Reserve Chairman \n     Alan Greenspan stated that if Congress were going to have a \n     research tax credit, it shouldn't be intermittent because \n     companies ``can't operate in an efficient manner with \n     government policies incapable of being understood or \n     projected.''\n       the R Credit Coalition, representing 87 professional and \n     trade associations and more than 1,000 U.S. companies, \n     applauds this unanimity of purpose and urges you to approve \n     legislation seamlessly extending the R credit and \n     increasing the alternative incremental research credit rates \n     by a modest one percentage point, before the end of the first \n     session of the 106th Congress. Expiration of the R tax \n     credit on June 30th has caused uncertainty for domestic \n     businesses for purposes of short and long-term planning as \n     well as preparation of financial statements and other reports \n     to shareholders. For these reasons, we believe the seamless \n     extension of the R tax credit is critical.\n       The R credit has benefited from broad, bipartisan and \n     bicameral support (including nine legislative extensions) \n     since its inception in 1981. The credit provides U.S. \n     companies with a proven incentive to increase their \n     investment in U.S.-based research and development creating \n     thousands of high wage, high skilled jobs for U.S. workers. A \n     January 1998 study of the economic benefits of the R credit \n     by the independent accounting firm of Coopers and Lybrand, \n     LLP (now PricewaterhouseCoopers), shows the credit's \n     significant positive stimulus to U.S. investment, innovation, \n     wage growth, consumption, and exports, all contributing to a \n     stronger domestic economy and a higher standard of living for \n     all Americans. The failure to enact a seamless extension of \n     the R credit prior to Congressional adjournment will \n     continue to disrupt R planning, and the resulting \n     uncertainty in the business community can only reduce the \n     economic benefits all U.S. businesses and workers receive as \n     a result of the credit.\n       We thank you for your support of the R tax credit, and \n     respectfully request you to make every possible effort to \n     permanently extend the R tax credit, and increase the \n     alternative incremental research credit rates, as soon as \n     possible.\n           Sincerely,\n       (Signed by 146 Massachusetts companies.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished manager of this \nlegislation, the Senator from Delaware, what we, the minority, would \nlike to do. Everybody over here thinks the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Utah is well taken for a lot of different reasons. This \nlegislation was developed in 1981 to spur the economy. It certainly has \ndone that. It has expanded for 5 years. Since then, Congress has \nextended the tax credit every year or so, leaving terrible uncertainty \nin the community. This is important. It is good legislation. It is too \nbad it is not made permanent.\n  But I do say we will be willing to take this amendment and move on to \nthe amendment of the Senator from New York. If a vote is required on \nthat, we could vote around 2 o'clock. It is my understanding, though, \nthe majority wants a vote on this amendment.\n  The uncertainty of whether or not this tax will be extended disrupts \nthe marketplace and decreases the amount of revenue spent on research \nand development. Some companies with long-term research budgets have \nbeen forced to delay studies. The research and development credit \nbenefits the entire community, the entire economy. Gains in \nproductivity are not limited to sectors where investments in R take \nplace. The gains which spill over are to all sectors of the economy--to \nagriculture, to mining, basic manufacturing, and high-tech services. \nTechnological innovations improve productivity in industries that make \ninnovations and in industries that make use of these innovations.\n  This credit would pay for itself and pay for itself very quickly. A \npermanent research and development credit would be an excellent \ninvestment for the Government to make because it would raise taxable \nincomes enough to more than pay for itself. In the long run, the $1.75 \nof additional revenue on a present value basis would be generated for \neach $1 the Government spends on the credit, creating a win-win \nsituation for both taxpayers and the Government.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we would be willing to yield back our time \non this amendment. As I understand it, the Senator from Delaware and \nthe Senator from Utah would. Following that, I ask unanimous consent \nthe vote on this amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from \nUtah occur at 1:45. During the next 15 minutes, the Senator from New \nYork and the Senator from Delaware, who are offering the next \namendment, I ask that they speak for the next 15 minutes, and after the \nvote they would be able to continue the discussion of their amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I assume I have 20 minutes. What I would \nlike to do is yield 10 of those minutes to the Senator from Delaware, \nmy copartner in this, and we will each divide up our 10 minutes as \nother people come to speak.\n  Mr. REID. If I could say to the distinguished Senator, I will control \nthe time. You have 20 minutes and you want 10; the Senator from \nDelaware wants 10?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. And then we will yield to some others who wish to speak.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 10 minutes upon the reporting of the amendment to \nthe Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3822\n\n (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the \n   unified credit exemption and the qualified family-owned business \n   interest deduction, to make higher education more affordable, to \n provide incentives for advanced teacher certification, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer], for himself, Mr. \n     Biden, Mr. Bayh, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Bingaman, and \n     Mr. Kohl, proposes an amendment numbered 3822.\n\n\n[[Page S6614]]\n\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will then take 5 minutes. I would like \nto take 5 minutes of my time and save the rest for yielding to others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this amendment, the Schumer-Biden \namendment, cosponsored by Senators Bayh and Landrieu, boils down to a \nsimple question.\n  The simple question is this: Would you rather give tax relief to \nthose whose incomes is above $8 million as they pass down their estates \nor would you like to give tax relief to people who make $40,000, \n$50,000, $60,000, $70,000 a year and are struggling to send their \nchildren to college? That is the amendment. It is plain and simple. It \nwill determine which side people are on.\n  This estate tax debate is not in a vacuum. There are very simple \nchoices, and this choice is a simple one.\n  Tuition costs, as this chart shows, have gone up more than any other \ncost--more than health care and certainly more than double the Consumer \nPrice Index. Average families who are very poor get help, as they \nshould, to send their kids to college. Families who are wealthy do not \nneed it. But the middle class struggles. They know that a college \neducation these days is a necessity, but they also know that it is \nharder and harder to afford.\n  The Schumer-Biden amendment is simple. It says if a family is \nstruggling to send their child to college, the Federal Government ought \nnot take its cut on top of that struggle. The amendment is simple. It \nsays it is more important for America to educate its young people in \nthe best institution available than it is to give tax relief to people \nwho are multimillionaires as they pass on their estates.\n  The Schumer-Biden amendment is simple. It says every time a young man \nor a young woman does not go to college because they cannot afford it \nor goes to a college that is not up to their intellectual capabilities \nsimply because they do not have the money to afford tuition, not only \ndoes that child lose, not only does that family lose, but America loses \nas well.\n  This is a crucial amendment. It is about middle-class tax relief. It \nis about targeted tax cuts for the middle class in what is perhaps \ntheir greatest struggle: affording tuition.\n  I make a good salary as a Senator. My wife works as well. We have two \nbeautiful daughters, the rocks of our life, age 15 and 11. We are up \nlate at night trying to figure out how we are going to afford our \ndaughters' college education. Imagine those millions of middle-class \nAmericans who are in a worse predicament. If you make, say, $60,000 \nbecause husband and wife work, and you have $20,000 or $25,000 in \ntuition bills, you are, in effect, poor because after you pay your \ntaxes and your mortgage and all the other expenses, you just cannot \nafford that college tuition.\n  This amendment is simple. It says which side you are on because we do \nnot have unlimited money. Are you on the side of those \nmultimillionaires who make over $8 million a year as they pass their \nestates down, or are you on the side of middle-class Americans who are \ndoing what we tell them to do, struggling to send their children to \ncollege?\n  From one end of my State to the other, the public is asking us to do \nsomething to help them. We know that tax relief should be targeted to \nthe big financial nuts that middle-class people face because they are \nthe ones who struggle the most. The Schumer-Biden amendment does just \nthat. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it, \nand I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, as I understand it, the Senator from New \nYork has yielded me 10 minutes. I will not use the 10 minutes because \nthere will be others who wish to speak. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, the headlines in today's papers say that we are here \ntoday discussing estate tax relief, an issue that affects a little less \nthan 2 percent of Americans.\n  The issue before us is much bigger than that. We are debating the \nfundamental principles that should guide us in the new era of budget \nsurpluses.\n  We cannot, we must not, lose sight of that larger picture. If we \nfocus on the narrow picture of a tax cut here, a spending program \nthere, we run the risk of wasting all the hard work and sacrifice that \nhas brought us to the best economic and budget era in our history.\n  The real task before us today is to set the priorities for this era. \nThis debate over the estate tax is just one part of that debate, but it \nis an important part.\n  Let's be clear about this--the amendment I am offering right now, \nwith my friends from New York and Indiana and Louisiana, would repeal \nthe estate tax for all families with estates up to $4 million, and for \nall family farms and businesses up to $8 million. And, it would leave \nroom for a tuition tax credit to help middle class Americans pay for \nthe rising cost of a college education.\n  Our proposal, the Democratic alternative proposal that Senator \nMoynihan introduced earlier today, would eliminate those taxes sooner \nthan the Republican plan, and would remove virtually all of the cases \nfrom the estate tax roles that have been employed as examples by the \nmajority in this debate.\n  The majority would rather send their plan to the certain fate of a \nPresidential veto than cut the taxes of the family farmers and family \nbusinesses they claim to care about.\n  They would rather have an issue than a tax cut. Their proposal would \ncut the top tax rates for the richest of the rich first, and delay for \n10 years the tax relief for family farms and businesses.\n  By the time any tax relief gets to those farmers and small \nbusinessmen, the Republican plan will cost at least $50 billion a \nyear--half a trillion over 10 years--effectively squeezing out any hope \nfor deficit reduction, strengthening Social Security, other tax cuts, \nor any other priorities we will face.\n  The plan I am offering with my colleagues today offers relief for \nfamily farms and businesses up front--and leaves room for other \npriorities.\n  The priority I want to stress is the need to help with the spiraling \ncost of college tuition.\n  Mr. President, I am glad to join the Senator from New York in \noffering this amendment to make higher education more affordable for \nAmerica's families.\n  As a college degree becomes increasingly vital in today's global \neconomy, the costs associated with obtaining this degree continue to \nskyrocket. At the same time, the annual income of the average American \nfamily is not keeping pace with these soaring costs. Since 1980, \ncollege costs have been rising at an average of 2 to 3 times the \nConsumer Price Index.\n  Now, in the most prosperous time in our history, it is simply \nunacceptable that the key to our children's future success has become a \ncrippling burden for middle-class families.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Education National Center for \nEducation Statistics, the average annual costs associated with \nattending a public 4-year college during the 1998-1999 school year, \nincluding tuition, fees, room, and board were $8,018. For a private 4-\nyear school these costs rose to an astonishing $19,970.\n  And these are only the average costs, Mr. President. The price tag \nfor just one year at the nation's most prestigious universities is fast \napproaching the $35,000 range.\n  In 1996, and again in 1997, I introduced the ``GET AHEAD'' Act, \nGrowing the Economy for Tomorrow: Assuring Higher Education is \nAffordable and Dependable. My main goal in introducing this legislation \nwas to help the average American family afford to send their children \nto college.\n  Although this legislation never came before the full Senate for a \nvote, I was extremely pleased that a number of the provisions of the \nGET AHEAD Act--including the student loan interest deduction and the \nestablishment of education savings accounts--were included as part of \nthe 1997 tax bill.\n  Additionally, two other provisions of that bill--the Hope Scholarship \nand the\n\n[[Page S6615]]\n\nLifetime Learning Credit--were based upon the core proposal of my GET \nAHEAD Act--a $10,000 tuition deduction.\n  I have been advocating tuition deduction since I first announced my \ncandidacy for the Senate 28 years ago. Earlier this year, I was pleased \nthat the President made a proposal in his State of the Union Address \nwhich would finally fully enact this proposal.\n  The amendment Senators Schumer, Bayh, Landrieu, and I are offering \ntoday will provide America's middle class families with a tax deduction \nof up to $12,000 for the costs of college tuition and fees.\n  Middle-class families who struggle to send their kids to college \nshould get some tax relief. We should not be giving tax cuts to those \nwho need them least.\n  The proposal Senator Schumer and I are offering is a tax cut that \nmakes sense. It is a tax cut that benefits the middle class, and it is \na tax cut that is an investment in America's future.\n  Mr. President, the dream of every American is to provide for their \nchild a better life than they themselves had. A key component in \nattaining that dream is ensuring that their children have the education \nnecessary to successfully compete in the expanding global economy.\n  It is my hope that the proposal we are offering today will help many \nAmerican families move a step closer in achieving this dream and be \nable to better afford to send their children to college.\n  I am proud to join Senator Schumer. He and I, together and \nseparately, have been pushing for this relief for middle-class \ntaxpayers to send their kids to college for a long time. I apologize to \nmy colleague, Bill Roth, for whom I have great respect. He has heard me \non this hobby horse about tuition tax credit longer than he cares. I am \nnot suggesting he does not share the same concern, but I apologize. He \nhas heard me make this speech since 1973 when I was a freshman Senator.\n  As one of the folks in Delaware said to me: Biden, when are you going \nto get off that hobby horse? I am not going to get off the hobby horse \nbecause, as the Senator from New York indicated, as a matter of public \npolicy, we should be making it easier, not harder, for children to go \nto college. We should not make these false distinctions between you are \nable, maybe, to get to a community college or to a junior college or \nmaybe your State college, but you are not going to be able to get to a \nprivate institution.\n  If a child has the intellectual capacity, interest, and drive and \nthey are able to go to Harvard or the University of Chicago or one of \nthe great institutions in America where we all know you get a little \nleg up--I had one son graduate from Syracuse Law School and did just as \nwell as the son who graduated from Yale Law School, but the marks of \nthe kid who went to Yale Law School were no different than the one who \nwent to Syracuse Law School. He got his ticket punched, a ticket to \nride. We all know it makes a difference to what school you have access.\n  We have essentially priced middle-class kids out of the finer \ninstitutions. They may not learn any more coming out of those \ninstitutions, but they get a heck of a lot more opportunities, which I \ncan say as a graduate of my State university, of which I am proud.\n  Since 1980, college costs have been rising on average two to three \ntimes the Consumer Price Index. Now in the most prosperous time in our \nhistory, people still have trouble. Let me give my colleagues a little \nidea.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for \nEducation Statistics, the average annual costs with attending a public \n4-year college during the 1998-1999 school year, including tuition, \nfees, room, and board were $8,018. For a private university, that \naverage cost was $19,000. If you decide to send your child or your \nchild decides they wish to go to a private university--I had one go to \nGeorgetown, one go to Penn, and one go to Tulane. That is a total of \nover $100,000 a year in tuition, which is the reason I have the dubious \ndistinction of being rated as one of the poorest men in the U.S. \nCongress. I am not poor. I live in a beautiful home in a beautiful \nneighborhood. I do not think I am poor, but I have $125,000 in debts \nfor college tuition.\n  The good news is, as the Senator said, I was able to borrow it \nbecause I had a nice enough house to borrow against on a second \nmortgage. What happens to the average American who has a good income, \nthey have a decent income--the wife is making $30,000 or $40,000, and \nthe husband is making $30,000 or $40,000. That is 70,000, 80,000, \n90,000 bucks a year. After taxes, what do they have? Maybe somewhere \nbetween $40,000 and $50,000. After they write that first semester \ntuition check for 15 grand, like I am about to do for Tulane \nUniversity, they are in pretty deep trouble. Every middle-class \nAmerican knows that. What I am a little concerned about is we are \npaying very little attention to this. This is about priorities.\n\n  I had a different bill than my friend from New York. Mine was $10,000 \nup to $120,000. His is $12,000. His has some better features than mine, \nbut we joined forces to make the case. My dad always said to me: Champ, \nI tell you what, if everything is equally important to you, nothing is \nimportant to you, unless you have priorities.\n  This is about priorities. If the Senator from New York and I had our \nway and we could make this country as great as it is now without any \ntaxes, we, like everybody else here, would vote against any tax for \nanything. I am all for no taxes, but what are our choices? Our choices \nare we cannot cut all taxes. So the question comes: What are we going \nto do in cutting taxes? Are we going to spend $134 billion over the \nnext 10 years to deal with the ``death tax'' and $750 billion over the \nnext 10 after that, or are we going to spend $40 billion over 10 years, \nas the Senator from New York----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield myself 30 more seconds. Are we going to spend $40 \nbillion to provide for the opportunity for this to truly be an \negalitarian system, a meritocracy?\n  When we graduated from school in the early 1960s and late 1960s, and \nwhen our parents did in the 1930s, you needed a high school education \nto make it, and a college education was nice. Now you need a college \neducation just to make it.\n  So I think people should be able to deduct at least this $12,000 and \nget a tax credit. This is a matter of priorities. The priorities should \nbe to take care of the middle class first.\n  I reserve the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to one of the \ncosponsors of the amendment and the author of the provision on teacher \ncertification, the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleagues, \nthe Senator from Delaware and the Senator from New York, in \ncosponsoring this amendment. The part I particularly want to speak \nabout for the 2 minutes that I have is the teacher tax credit.\n  We have spent much time talking this year about the ways we could \nimprove education in this Nation. We have talked about the important \ncomponents of improving education, which is a State and local \npartnership with the Federal Government. But we all agree, even across \nparty lines, that one of the key components of improving education in \nthe Nation is to provide quality teacher training, incentives for \nteachers to be the very best they can be.\n  Many studies have shown that the single most important factor in a \nchild learning, in terms of at school in the classroom--families have a \ngreat input into that, obviously, but the single most important factor \nin a child learning at school in the classroom is the quality of the \nteacher.\n  This amendment will provide a tax credit for teachers who get a \nnational certification, as we work with our Governors and with our \nmayors and with our local school boards to help bring excellence in \neducation across this Nation.\n  So I am pleased to have authored the part of this amendment which \nwould provide this tax credit because if we are going to give tax \nrelief to America, and if we are going to give back a share of the \nsurplus in this way, let's give a tax credit that will help not only \nteachers but education and our children.\n\n[[Page S6616]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I suggest that the Senator from New York \ncontrol the time from here on out and distribute it among those who \nwish to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. President, I now yield 2 minutes to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Indiana, a cosponsor of this amendment, who has worked long and \nhard on seeing that college tuition be made deductible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. BAYH. I thank Senator Schumer.\n  Mr. President, I express my profound appreciation to the Senator from \nNew York, Mr. Schumer, for his leadership on this critical issue. It is \nimportant to the families and the children of this country that we \nadopt this important amendment to make college tuition more affordable \nfor all families across my State and the other States that constitute \nour great country.\n  A college education today is no longer a luxury, it is a necessity. \nHelping to make college tuition more affordable, by providing for the \ndeduction of the first $10,000 of college tuition, will help ease the \nburdens on many middle-class families across Indiana and elsewhere in \nour country. It will open up the doors of economic opportunity to the \nmiddle class and help to make our Nation a more decent, just, and \nhonorable place as well.\n  As we move to adopt this important amendment today, we will not only \ndo what is right for our economy but we will also do what is right for \nour families and for our children. This is an example of cutting taxes \nin ways that help middle-class families deal with the challenges they \nface in their daily lives. It is an important issue, one that surely we \ncan accomplish within the context of also moving to ease the burdens of \nestate taxes upon businessmen, farmers, and others across our State.\n  I say to my colleague from New York, I again thank him for his \nleadership. This is a critically important issue. It is one whose time \nhas come. I say to Senator Schumer, I cannot think of anything that \nwould be more popular across the State of Indiana than acting today to \nhelp make the costs of college more affordable for middle-class \nfamilies, for students and children across our State, by passing this \nimportant amendment. It has been my honor and privilege to work with \nthe Senator on this important issue.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 3823\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 1:45 \np.m. having arrived, the Senate will proceed to vote on the Hatch \namendment.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to Hatch amendment No. 3823. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield two minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this amendment by Senator Schumer, and \nothers, is a test as to whether this Senate is in touch with the \nreality of life for American families. The Schumer amendment will allow \nfamilies across America, worried about paying their kids' college \neducation expenses, a tax deduction of $12,000 a year. It will say to \nthose paying off students loans that we will give you a tax credit of \nup to $1,500 a year on the interest on your student loan, and if you \nare a teacher who wants to go for extra training to be certified, we \nwill give you a $5,000 tax credit so you can be the very best in the \nclassroom. Families across America understand the Schumer amendment.\n  What they don't understand is the alternative on the Republican side, \nwhich says we don't need it, that our highest priority is helping the \nwealthiest people in America be absolved from paying any kind of estate \ntax.\n  When we start forming a line to come in the Senate for help, the \nRepublicans put the wealthiest people in America first. The Schumer \namendment puts American families first.\n  Watch for this vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the amendment before us has a fundamental \ndeficiency. It is built on the Democratic alternative to the House tax \nrepeal bill. In other words, this amendment strikes the House death tax \nrepeal and replaces it with the Democratic alternative which was just \nrejected by a rollcall vote a few minutes ago.\n  Let me reemphasize once again that the Democratic alternative fails \nto correct the fatal flaws of the family-owned business deduction. \nAccording to well-known members of the American Bar Association, those \nfatal flaws make it virtually impossible to qualify for the tax \ndeduction.\n  What I am saying is that those of you who voted against the \nDemocratic alternative should vote against this amendment because this \namendment, once again, seeks to substitute the Democratic alternative.\n  The amendment also contains some interesting ideas on education. But \nthey should be looked at in the context of our other education \nincentives. One proposal, for instance, is that we allow a tax \ndeduction for higher education costs. If a taxpayer takes that \ndeduction, then he or she will not be allowed to take the lifetime \nlearning credit at the same time. Families are already confused and \ntroubled by the complexity of these educational incentives. So adding a \nnew one with a different tax would further confuse the situation.\n  Again, we are anxious to move on to a vote. I emphasize to those on \nmy side that this amendment would substitute the Democratic alternative \nfor the repeal of death taxes in substitution of the House repeal.\n  I urge everyone to vote against this amendment.\n  I yield my time, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will sum up. I believe I still have 3 \nminutes left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I beg to differ with my friend from Delaware.\n  This amendment is a simple one. He said the flaw in this amendment is \nthat\n\n[[Page S6617]]\n\nthe estate tax relief doesn't go up high enough.\n  This amendment is an amendment of choice: Very simply, do you prefer \nto give the very few wealthy in our society even more tax relief or \nwith those same dollars do you want to help middle-class families pay \nfor the ever-increasing costs of tuition? It is that simple. Does \nsomeone making $40,000 or $50,000 a year, who is struggling to send \ntheir son and daughter to college, deserve relief first or does someone \nwho has an estate over $8 million deserve relief first? It is that \nsimple.\n  We are in an idea society. We are in a place where a college \neducation is a key to the future. Yet millions and millions of American \nfamilies cannot afford to send their children to college or they have \nto send their child to a college that is not up to that child's \nintellectual ability because the cost is so expensive. The Schumer-\nBiden amendment says that is the group that needs relief more than \nthose whose estates are over $8 million.\n  The choice is stark and clear. Which side are you on? We don't have \nunlimited money. Do you support middle-class families sending their \nkids to college or do you support the wealthy in tax relief?\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, this amendment, which I described briefly \nyesterday, embodies the principles of our legislation, S. 2808, which \nhas been introduced by the Senators I mentioned and myself, to \ntemporarily suspend the Federal gasoline tax for 150 days, while \nholding harmless the highway trust fund and protecting the Social \nSecurity trust fund.\n  America is facing a crisis, and we have to take action now. Yesterday \nI spoke before the Senate about how, during my travels over the Fourth \nof July recess, I was struck that people in my State had one thing on \ntheir minds, and that was the price of gasoline. It was the most \nimportant issue on virtually everybody's mind. It was the second most \nimportant issue, and it was the third most important issue.\n  As I talked with the citizens in my State, I asked them to join me in \nmaking sure this issue to suspend the Federal gasoline tax received \nmore attention in the Congress. I am proud of how they have already \nresponded.\n  Over the last 10 days, we have had a web site through which people \ncould sign a petition online urging Congress to suspend the gas tax. \nLiterally over 100,000 people have logged on to the site and thousands \nhave already joined this petition drive.\n  On behalf of these thousands of Michigan citizens--and I know there \nare millions more across the country who are feeling the pinch at the \npump--I am here today to fight for relief on behalf of our consumers, \nour minivan parents, our farmers, and others for a bill that would \nsuspend the Federal gasoline tax for 150 days.\n  Yesterday I told this body how citizens throughout Michigan were \ndemanding quick relief from these high gas prices. People from all \nwalks of life have talked with me about this:\n\n  Farmers who, according to our Farm Bureau, are likely to see their \nnet family farm income decrease by 35 percent;\n  A minivan mom with seven kids who now has to give up her minivan \nbecause it costs her $70 to fill up the tank;\n  Every day men and women who banged on gas cans during a parade in \nTraverse City, MI, demanding immediate relief from high gas prices;\n  A Southfield, MI, Amoco dealer who lowered prices by 18 cents a \ngallon for 2 hours in support of this proposal and found himself \nsurrounded by a quarter mile of cars in every direction waiting to buy \nhis cheaper gas.\n  This crisis is very real. If we do not take action now to provide \nsome relief for the economy, we will face some very serious economic \nconsequences soon because so many of the important sectors of our \neconomy are being hurt by these high prices.\n  According to Lundberg Survey, a nationwide survey of gas prices, the \ncity of Detroit suffers under the highest gas prices in the country. \nThese prices are 40 cents a gallon higher than they were at the end of \nMay. That is a 27-percent increase in only 2 months; 63 percent higher \nthan in June of last year. These are unconscionably high gas prices.\n  Yesterday I discussed several factors that contributed to the rising \ncosts of gasoline in the past months: OPEC's decision to lower \nproduction levels; lack of a sustainable and long-term energy policy to \nlower our dependency on foreign oil; regulations which have required \nthe development of reformulated fuels; and a variety of other things, \nsuch as pipeline breakdowns.\n  Solving those problems will take a lot of time. The solutions to \nthese issues will not bring down the price overnight or in the short \nterm. People across Michigan want to see gas prices lowered. They want \nthem lowered sooner, not later, and that is what this amendment will \ndo. It is the one thing we can do in the Congress to bring down the \nprice of gasoline and to bring it down immediately. So it is my hope \nthat we will support this amendment today.\n\n[[Page S6618]]\n\n  Let me quickly cover some of its key ingredients, and then I know \nthere are others who want to speak to this issue.\n  First, as I said, it will provide suspension of the Federal gas tax \nfor 150 days. We estimate this will provide real relief for motorists \nand consumers, averaging over $150 of savings for a typical one-car or \none-minivan family.\n  Let me make one thing very clear about what this legislation also \nwill do. It will not threaten the highway trust fund. Yesterday we \nrevised this language again to strengthen even further the elements \nthat will hold the highway trust fund and the roadbuilding money \ndistributed to the States absolutely harmless. I urge my colleagues to \nexamine the legislation to satisfy themselves that that will happen.\n  First, every penny of the gas tax revenue that would have come into \nthe highway trust fund from the collection of gas taxes will be made up \nwith deposits of non-Social Security surplus funds. This will allow us \nto ensure that the building projects, the road repair projects, in the \nStates will continue unabated and unharmed by this suspension.\n  To make sure everyone understands that this is an ironclad guarantee \nthat the States will not lose one penny of highway funds, we have \nstrengthened the hold harmless provisions even more from that which I \ndetailed yesterday by adding additional language which I will enter \ninto the Record at the end of my comments.\n  In short, this accomplishes two things. It keeps the highway trust \nfund intact by supplementing any lost revenue with surplus dollars, and \nit simultaneously gives the average working men and women, the \nconsumers of this country, who are paying too much for gasoline today, \na 5-month break in paying the Federal gas tax. That will be 18 cents a \ngallon in every service station in America. It will make a difference \nfor our consumers. It will make a difference for our farmers. It will \nmake a difference for people in the tourism industry. It will be, I \nthink, a timely action on our part.\n  Back in April of this year, gas prices were 40 to 50 cents a gallon \nless than they are now. At that time, when we last considered this \nlegislation, we could not pass a proposal that would have lowered the \ngas taxes. But things have changed. We have seen that that was not a \nshort-lived crisis. We have also seen that OPEC has not responded in a \nfashion to bring prices more into line with what the American public \ndeserves. For those reasons, I hope our colleagues who voted \ndifferently the last go-around will reconsider their vote and join us \non this vote today.\n  Let me close by saying that this legislation is a serious attempt to \nprovide relief to the millions of Americans forced to dig deeper into \nthe family budget for gas to take their kids to school or to get to \nwork at any automobile plant in Michigan--in Flint or Sterling Heights. \nMichigan consumers are rightfully outraged by the high price of \ngasoline. They need relief and they need it now.\n  If any of my colleagues have any ideas how the highway trust fund \nhold harmless provisions can be improved and strengthened, I would be \nmore than happy to entertain them and, if necessary, modify this \namendment. But the time has come for us to take action and to take \nit now. In my judgment, this is the only way we can do something that \nwill have an immediate impact on the lives of the working citizens of \nthis country. I hope we will join together to adopt the amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our \ntime. We have several other speakers who are prepared to address the \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I join the efforts of my colleague \nfrom Michigan, Senator Abraham. I am a cosponsor of this amendment \nwhich would temporarily roll back or suspend the 18.3-cent-per-gallon \nFederal gas tax.\n  When I was back home during the Fourth of July recess and was \nmarching in all those parades, I had the exact same experience that \nSenator Abraham had. I was hearing from my constituents about the high \nprice of gasoline.\n  After returning to the Nation's Capitol, where we talk about so many \nother issues, from foreign policy to domestic concerns, we have heard \nvery little discussion about what Washington can do to bring down the \nprice of gasoline at the pumps. That is the issue on the minds of most \nAmerican citizens.\n  In the Midwest, in particular--in my State of Illinois, Senator \nAbraham's State of Michigan, other Midwestern States such as Ohio--the \nprice has been much higher than the national average. Fortunately, in \nthe last few weeks, in Illinois, it has begun to come down. But part of \nthe reason it has begun to come down in the State of Illinois is \nbecause the Illinois Legislature took action.\n  At the end of last month, the Illinois Legislature went into a \nspecial session and rolled back their approximately 10-cent-per-gallon, \nor 5-percent, sales tax on gasoline. They suspended it until the end of \nthe year. That immediately brought a price reduction of 10 cents per \ngallon at the pump.\n  But prices are still too high in Illinois. The average price in the \ncity of Chicago is around $1.80 per gallon. That is, thankfully, down \nfrom the $2.13 a gallon that it was a few weeks back.\n\n  But if Senators take the time to go back and look at their \nlegislative correspondence to see what kind of mail they are receiving \non this issue from their constituents from around their States, and \ntalk to their constituents, they will see the amount and the type of \nsuffering that people are enduring.\n  When we introduced this amendment earlier as a freestanding bill, I \nread several letters from constituents in Illinois that explained the \nproblems they are confronting now with the high cost of gasoline.\n  We have letters from small business owners. I remember one business \nowner in particular from McHenry County, IL, who had 10 to 20 \nemployees, depending on the time of the year. His small business was \nvery dependent on transportation, and he was going broke with this high \ncost of gasoline.\n  I had a community college student from Shelbyville, down in southern \nIllinois, write to me and say he was regretting the fact he had turned \ndown offers from several of our State's 4-year universities because he \nthought that tuition was too high. Instead, he had decided to go to a \ncommunity college. He thought he would save money and do 2 years at the \ncommunity college.\n  But now, because he had a long commute to his community college, it \nwas making that community college unaffordable; he wished he had \ninstead decided to go to one of the 4-year universities. He thinks it \nmight have been cheaper for him.\n  I read a letter from a family outside the Peoria area where the wife \ncommuted 100 miles a day, round trip, to work, and the husband 55 \nmiles. They estimated they had to drive the kids another 15 miles a day \nto their soccer games, their baseball games, their band events, and \nother school extracurricular activities. They were suffering greatly as \na result of the high cost of gasoline.\n  We have talked much in this Senate this past year about the high \nprice of prescription drugs. We are trying to do something about that. \nI had a senior citizen write me and say: Because of the high cost of \ngasoline, I now can't afford to drive to the pharmacy to buy the \nprescription drugs I already can't afford.\n  There is a lot of real suffering going on out there. We can sit \naround and wait and do nothing. I do believe eventually those prices \nwill come down. They may not go back down to where they were a year and \na half or 2 years ago, but they will come down because production is \ngetting ramped up domestically.\n  I visited an oil well in southern Illinois last week--in fact, \nseveral oil wells. All of a sudden some of these small stripper wells \nin southern Illinois, many of which were dormant 2 years ago when the \nprice for a barrel of oil was between $8 and $10 a barrel; and they \ncould not make money so many of those wells shut down--in fact, there \nare 32,000 oil wells in Illinois and 9,000 of them were shut down 2 \nyears ago. And now, of those 9,000 wells, 7,000 have come back into \nproduction.\n  That suggests to me, with that kind of activity, eventually that \nsupply is going to be felt across the country, and it will lower prices \nat the pump. But it is going to take some time. In fact, it is going to \ntake months.\n\n[[Page S6619]]\n\n  We do need to have a long-term policy to ensure an adequate national \nsupply of oil and of gasoline. In the meantime, we need to provide some \ntemporary relief. Senator Abraham and I and others, Senator Hutchison \nof Texas, have crafted this bill to provide temporary relief for the \npeople who need it most: the small business owners who are going broke, \nthe people who have long commutes to work, the senior citizens who \ncannot afford to drive to the pharmacy, the community college students \nwho cannot afford the commute to their community college.\n  There may be some arguments against this bill. I know there are some \non the other side of the aisle who get up and vote against any tax \nrelief. On the current measure, on the death tax, many have argued that \nwe should not be giving that relief to higher income individuals, \npeople with large estates. At least there is a colorable claim; that \nargument has some merit to it. I think it is rebuttable. But that same \nargument cannot be made with respect to the Federal gas tax. Of all the \ntaxes in our enormous Tax Code, this tax is one of the most regressive \nand one of the most onerous for low- and middle-income people. They can \nleast afford the high cost of gasoline.\n  There are not a lot of other things the Federal Government can do to \nbring down the price of gasoline at the pump. In fact, the only direct \ninstrument we have to affect prices at the pump is to lower or reduce \nthat Federal gas tax. There are no other instruments. We don't have \nprice controls in this country. We had them for a while in the 1970s. \nThat created shortages and rationing, and Ronald Reagan ended the oil \ncrisis by eliminating those price controls. We have a free market \nsystem.\n  What happened is, the price of a barrel of oil got down to $8 to $10 \na barrel. Production was cut back. Ultimately, we are now suffering \nfrom lack of an oil supply. It will come back in this country, but we \nneed to provide relief for people. The argument cannot be made that \nthis most benefits high-income individuals.\n  I strongly emphasize that Senator Abraham has written this bill so \nthat there is not one cent of revenue lost to the highway trust fund. \nThat is a very important point. We should not hear objections that this \nis going to hurt road funding in this country. It will have no effect \non it. The amount will be charged to the general fund.\n  I thank my colleague from Michigan, Mr. Abraham, and I yield the \nfloor so other of my colleagues may address this matter.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, the cosponsors of this amendment and I \nare not alone in our support for the suspension of the gas tax. A \nnumber of taxpayer groups also believe suspending the tax is good \npolicy, and have endorsed such a suspension. Among these groups are the \nNational Federation of Independent Business, the National Taxpayers \nUnion, Americans for Tax Reform, and Citizens Against Government Waste.\n  Let me read from the NFIB letter that states:\n\n       For a small company that consumes 50,000 gallons of diesel \n     fuel in a month, the increase in prices in the past year will \n     cost that company an additional $40,000 per month.\n\n  By suspending the gas tax for 150 days, we could save that small \nbusiness over $60,000! I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record \nthe letters of support from each of these organizations to highlight \nthe board based support for this suspension.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     Americans for Tax Reform,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 13, 2000.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: Americans for Tax Reform would like \n     to thank you for your efforts to suspend the Federal fuels \n     tax. At a time of rising gas prices and increasing concern at \n     all levels of government, your approach represents a reasoned \n     common sense solution.\n       Unlike the Clinton-Gore investigations into anti-trust \n     violations by gas companies and other big government efforts, \n     your approach guarantees that all Americans will see lower \n     prices at the gas pumps.\n       We can certainly investigate all these other concerns, but \n     working families across the country need lower gas prices \n     today. Suspending federal gas taxes is the quickest and \n     surest way to bring down rising gasoline prices. At Americans \n     for Tax Reform we commend your common sense approach to this \n     very serious problem and look forward to working with you to \n     reduce Al Gore's tax burden on working Americans.\n           Onward,\n     Grover G. Norquist.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                         NFIB,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 12, 2000.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: On behalf of the 600,000 members of \n     the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), I \n     want to express our support for the Abraham gas tax \n     suspension amendment to H.R. 8, the Death Tax Elimination \n     Act. The Abraham proposal would temporarily repeal the 18.3-\n     cent federal fuels tax, providing small business owners \n     quick, short-term relief from soaring fuel prices.\n       Gas prices have been soaring. According to the U.S. \n     Department of Energy, gas prices, which have increased by as \n     much as 50 percent in the past year, are likely to continue \n     to remain high in many areas of the country.\n       These high fuel prices are hitting many Americans, \n     especially small businesses, extremely hard. For a small \n     company that consumes 50,000 gallons of diesel fuel in a \n     month, the increase in prices in the past year will cost that \n     company an additional $40,000 per month. If fuel prices \n     remain high, these costs could eventually be passed on to \n     consumers in the form of higher prices for many goods and \n     services. A 18.3-cent reduction in the cost of fuel would \n     save the company thousands per month.\n       Your proposal goes a long way towards providing America's \n     small business owners valuable relief from rising fuel costs. \n     We applaud your proactive efforts to reduce this tax burden \n     on small business while at the same time providing a hold \n     harmless provision for the Highway Trust Fund. This will \n     guarantee that full funding will continue to flow to states \n     and local communities for planned infrastructure projects.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Dan Danner,\n     Sr. Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Council for Citizens\n\n\n                                     Against Government Waste,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 12, 2000.\n     United States Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the 600,000 members of the \n     Council for Citizens Against Government (CCAGW), I urge you \n     to support Abraham-Fitzgerald federal gas tax suspension \n     amendment to H.R. 8, the Death Tax Elimination Act. The \n     amendment will suspend the gas tax for 150 days.\n       Americans today are struggling with the dramatically high \n     price of fuel. These prices are a result of several factors, \n     many of which have been created by Washington. The federal \n     government imposes 18.4 cents in tax for every gallon of gas \n     and 24.4 cents for every gallon of diesel fuel. In addition \n     to acting as a drag on our entire economy and raising the \n     cost of everything that is shipped by truck, it is especially \n     burdensome on the poor, who pay a larger percentage of their \n     income for fuel.\n       Several other shortsighted policies have contributed to the \n     current high price of fuel throughout the country. Burdensome \n     regulations on the production and distribution of oil \n     products have driven gas, diesel, home heating oil, and other \n     prices to artificially high levels. These policies have made \n     America more dependent on foreign oil and more vulnerable to \n     price-fixing by the international oil cartel. Imports of \n     foreign petroleum climbed to a record high of $7.87 billion \n     in January, more than double the level of January, 1999.\n       One solution to this crisis is to increase domestic \n     production. Since 1992, 36 refineries have closed and there \n     have been no new refineries built since 1976. Despite a 14 \n     percent increase in consumption, U.S. oil production is down \n     17 percent since 1992. The oil is there, but the policies of \n     our own government have forced us to rely on foreign nations.\n       Regarding U.S. planning to deal with the high cost of oil, \n     Energy Secretary Bill Richardson stated, ``It is obvious that \n     the federal government was not prepared. We were caught \n     napping. We got complacent.'' Vice President Gore has \n     advocated even higher taxes on fossil fuels.\n       Please provide temporary relief from the administration's \n     misguided policies. We urge you to take immediate action to \n     reduce this burden on American families and businesses by \n     supporting the Abraham-Fitzgerald gas tax suspension \n     amendment. This vote will be among those considered for \n     CCAGW's 2000 Congressional Ratings.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Thomas Schatz,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      National Taxpayer Union,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, July 13, 2000.\n     Cesar Condra Senator Abraham.\n\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the 300,000-member National \n     Taxpayers Union, America's largest and oldest taxpayer \n     organization, we urge you to support Senator Abraham's \n     amendment to H.R. 8, the Death Tax Elimination Act, that \n     would repeal the 18.4 cent federal fuels tax for 150 days. \n     This vote will be heavily weighted in our annual Rating of \n     Congress.\n\n[[Page S6620]]\n\n       As you know, the recent rise in fuel prices has concerned \n     many, from citizens who commute every day to truck drivers \n     and small business people whose livelihoods depend upon \n     stable transportation costs. Although some say that OPEC \n     policies are solely to blame for this problem, an equally if \n     not more responsible culprit has actually been tax hikes. \n     Pre-tax fuel prices often fluctuate up or down during a given \n     period, but historically, post-tax prices have been moving \n     steadily upward for at least two decades.\n       Consider:\n       From 1990 through 1999, the pre-tax pump price of gasoline \n     barely changed--from 88 cents per gallon in 1990 to 86 cents \n     as of last November. Over that same period, state and federal \n     gasoline taxes rose by more than half, from 27 cents per \n     gallon to 43 cents.\n       The 1993 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act created a new \n     4.3-cent-per-gallon fuel surtax for ``deficit reduction.'' \n     This tax has continued, despite the fact that the federal \n     budget is now in surplus.\n       The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the FY 2000 \n     ``on-budget'' surplus (not counting the so-called ``Social \n     Security surplus'') will total $23 billion. With $34.3 \n     billion in fuel taxes allocated to the Highway Trust Fund \n     this year, suspending the 18.4-cent tax won't imperil any \n     current programs and won't consume any funds set aside for \n     Social Security reform.\n       A recent study by the Tax Foundation showed that excise \n     taxes are five times more burdensome for lower-income \n     households than they are for wealthy households. Cutting fuel \n     taxes will allow you to deliver on your longstanding promise \n     to enact policies that particularly help beleaguered low- and \n     middle-income Americans.\n       While we believe the repeal should be permanent, the \n     Abraham amendment is a badly needed step in the right \n     direction. In doing so, you can also demonstrate to the \n     entire world that our leaders need not rely on the whims of a \n     distant pricing cartel to protect their citizens from \n     economic harm.\n           Sincerely\n                                                 Eric V. Schlecht,\n                                Director, Congressional Relations.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Who yields time?\n  Mr. CRAIG. May I inquire how much time remains on this side of the \nissue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. CRAIG. This side will retain its time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment offered \nby my colleague, Senator Abraham. This amendment would repeal the \nentire 18.4-cent Federal excise tax on gasoline for a five-month \nperiod. In my view, this amendment represents bad transportation \npolicy, bad energy policy, and bad tax policy. The amendment would play \npolitical games with the American driving public by eliminating the \nFederal gasoline tax and reinstating it five months later, after the \npeople have gone to the polls in November. The amendment would violate \nthe trust that we restored to the Highway Trust Fund when we enacted \nthe Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. It would, over the \nlong run, put at risk billions of dollars of necessary investment in \nour Nation's highway infrastructure, while providing absolutely no \nguarantee that the consumer will see even one penny of this tax \nreduction at the gas pump.\n  This will be the third time in four months that the Senate will vote \non repealing some, or all, of the Federal excise tax on gasoline. Back \non April 6th, the Senate adopted my amendment expressing the Sense of \nthe Senate that the Federal excise tax on gasoline should not be \nrepealed on either a permanent or temporary basis. That amendment was \nadopted by a broad bipartisan vote of 65-35. That amendment stated \nexplicitly that ``. . . any effort to reduce the federal gasoline tax \nor de-link the relationship between highway user fees and highway \nspending poses a great danger to the integrity of the Highway Trust \nFund and the ability of the states to invest adequately in our \ntransportation infrastructure.'' Just five days later, the Senate voted \nagainst the Motion to Invoke Cloture on S. 2285, again on a bipartisan \nbasis, by a vote of 43-56. That bill would have repealed 4.3 cents of \nthe 18.4-cent gasoline excise tax.\n  The Senate did the right thing back in April, when it rejected these \ndangerous proposals to take 4.3 cents of gas tax revenue out of the \nHighway Trust Fund. This amendment by Senator Abraham, however, is far \nmore dangerous. Indeed, it is four times more dangerous than those \nproposals because this amendment would repeal the entire 18.4-cent \ngasoline tax for a five-month period and would deprive the Highway \nTrust Fund of more than $10 billion.\n  I have heard it said that this amendment would in no way endanger the \nlevel of spending for our nation's highways. Indeed, some very odd \nlanguage is included in this amendment. It is basically the same \nlanguage that was included in S. 2285, which the Senate rejected back \nin April. That language sought to mandate that spending from the \nHighway Trust Fund be maintained at the level authorized in TEA-21, \neven though the revenue is not there to support those funding levels. \nThis is a very neat sleight of hand indeed. But, does anyone truly \nbelieve that this is a workable approach over the long term? The \nchairman of the Surface Transportation Subcommittee, Senator Voinovich, \nclearly does not, I don't believe. My colleague, Senator Warner, who \nchaired the Surface Transportation Subcommittee during the debate on \nTEA-21, certainly does not. Together, Senator Warner, Senator Gramm, \nSenator Baucus, and I fought tirelessly for many months to restore the \n``trust'' to the Highway Trust Fund. So, I implore all Members on both \nsides of the aisle to reject this plan that will compromise that trust.\n  Mr. President, I believe this amendment is not just reckless \ntransportation policy, it is reckless energy policy as well. These \nshort-term, feel-good tax cuts cannot substitute for a comprehensive \nenergy policy that decreases our dependence on foreign oil. The \nAmerican people are not naive. They will see right through any proposal \nto eliminate a tax temporarily until after Election Day, the effect of \nwhich they may not even see, only to be followed by reimposition of the \n18.4-cent gas tax a few months hence.\n  Even the ``triple A''-- the association that represents no one but \nthe people who pay the gas tax at the pump--opposes this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Susan Pikrallidas, vice \npresident for public affairs of the American Automobile Association, in \nopposition to the Abraham amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                          AAA,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 12, 2000.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: When the Senate considers H.R. 8, the \n     Death Tax Elimination Act, an amendment will be offered by \n     Senator Abraham to repeal for 150 days the 18.4 cents federal \n     gasoline tax. AAA encourages you to oppose this amendment.\n       While attractive at first glance, this course of action \n     will do little to address the root cause of our gasoline \n     price problem today, which is a complex combination of many \n     factors. AAA recognizes that many motorists are suffering \n     because of high gas prices. However, any benefits to \n     motorists from reducing the gas tax are offset by the \n     substantial risk that general fund revenues will not cover \n     all losses to the Highway Trust Fund.\n       Reducing the federal gasoline tax will do nothing to \n     increase fuel supply.That is where Congress and the \n     Administration should focus their attention. To focus \n     legislative efforts on the federal gas tax, rather than the \n     real problem--supply--is a shortsighted, expedient response \n     to the problem.\n       Despite assurances that revenues lost to the Highway Trust \n     Fund will be replaced with revenues from the budget surplus, \n     suspending the federal gasoline tax fundamentally alters the \n     basic principal governing surface transportation funding. The \n     federal excise tax is a user fee. Motorists are paying for \n     road and bridge repairs and safety programs through the fees \n     paid at the pump.\n       The Senate has already gone on record in opposition to \n     repealing the federal gas tax. AAA encourages the Senate to \n     do so again by voting no on the Abraham amendment.\n       Thank you for your consideration of AAA's views.\n                                             Susan G. Pikrallidas,\n                                   Vice President, Public Affairs.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. In closing, the Senate has already rejected this policy \ntwice this year. I ask Members to join in driving a stake right through \nthe heart of this ill-conceived, politically motivated vampire of an \namendment that would suck the lifeblood out of the highway trust fund.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n\n[[Page S6621]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend, Senator Byrd, for \ngetting to the heart of the matter and explaining how devastating this \namendment would be.\n  I yield to my good friend from Ohio for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I also thank the Senator from West \nVirginia. He has done a good job of explaining why this amendment is \nnot well taken and not good public policy. As Governor of the State of \nOhio, I worked to increase our share of highway funding from 79 cents \nto 87 cents in ISTEA to 90.5 cents in TEA-21. As Chairman of the \nNational Governors' Association, I helped negotiate TEA-21, which \nprovides some substantial support for highway construction and \nmaintenance in this country. It gave us a predictable, reliable source \nof revenue to get the job done. That's why this proposal really doesn't \nmake sense: it jeopardizes that funding.\n  If this Senate rejected the proposal earlier this year to reduce the \ngas tax by 4.3 cents, certainly we should reject any proposal that \nwould reduce it by 18.4 cents.\n  One point I would like to make is that the real problem we have in \nthis country is that we do not, as Senator Byrd pointed out, have an \nenergy policy. That is the problem. Reducing this gas tax by 18.4 cents \nreally is not going to do anything to correct that problem in the long-\nterm, and it would take the attention of the Senate away from the real \nissue here, which is, this country does not have an energy policy.\n  I want to point out one other thing. Under this amendment, we would \nreduce the gas tax and make it up by using the general revenue fund, \nthe surplus. If I am not mistaken, some of my colleagues would like to \nuse that surplus for proposed tax reductions and some would like to \nincrease spending on various programs. It has been the tradition in \nthis country that people who use the highways pay for them through the \ngas tax and not with the general fund of the United States of America. \nIt seems to me that those of my colleagues who propose to use the on-\nbudget surplus for health care or for other things, including tax \nrelief, would be offended by that. I think this amendment is bad public \npolicy and I hope it will be defeated overwhelmingly. I thank the \nChair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to Senator Lautenberg. I \nurge him to be brief.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank my friend from Montana. Five minutes, or \nfewer, will be OK. If we talk about it long enough right now, we won't \nhave any time left to talk.\n  Mr. President, I hope the American public is looking at this because \nthis is kind of ``inside baseball.'' This is what helps people get from \nplace to place, get to work on time, get to the hospital on time, get \nto church on time. We are terribly short of funds altogether for \nhighway repair and development. Everybody knows that. We have about a \n$30 billion highway bill. This 5-month hiatus will take $10 billion \naway. The worst part of it is that the benefits are not going to go to \nthe public because all of us need to remember that the taxes are \nremitted by the oil companies--by the companies that, in many cases, \nare gouging the public this very day. So they can hold on to that and \nthat will make the year-end profit statement look even better. Stock \nprices will be higher.\n  The public will not get what they thought they were getting. They are \ngoing to get stuck; that is what will happen. They will be stuck in \ntraffic because we won't be able to continue the highway work. Once you \nstop it, it is very hard to get it started again. Is that what we are \ngoing to say to the public? People in this country who want to go \nsomeplace may see a nice yellow barrier saying ``work halted'' on the \nhighway, or an interchange, or at access to factories, their jobs, or \nother places where the community gathers, including schools, clinics--\nyou name it. Sorry, the work has stopped. We have run out of money. We \nare certainly not going to take it from the General Treasury, since we \nare all so fully committed to paying down the debt and keeping this \ncountry out of debt. If we are going to give targeted tax cuts, then we \nought to talk about those specifically. But to suggest that we want to \ngive the oil companies, the oil producers, an 18-cent-a-gallon tax cut, \nI think, is really unfair to the public at large. They ought to see \nthrough the fog and the smog being created by this.\n\n  It is not going to happen, Mr. and Mrs. America. You may feel that \nyou are getting a bargain now, and the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan--who is my friend--talked about people who responded to a \nprice cut at a gas station. But sometimes you put away money for a \nlater day to pay off a mortgage, or to try to accumulate money for a \ncollege education for your child, or to assure there is enough there to \npay doctor bills that may fall your way. It may feel good at this \nmoment, but when that highway is all backed up, and smog envelopes the \nplace, and the air quality turns sour, then people will be saying: Now \nwhat happens? We didn't get what we paid that money for.\n  I know this amendment is offered with all good intentions, but if the \npublic is listening, hear what is being said. You get an 18 cent cut in \nthe gas tax so you can give it to the gasoline company. That is hardly \nthe way we want to see things done. America has to pull together and we \nhave to stand against those on the outside of our borders who are \ndrilling oil, and just enough to keep the prices up. When they dial \n911, they want America there immediately. That is why we sent over \n400,000 of our best to the Persian Gulf. That is why we did it. So we \nneed help there. I hope they hear the alarm go off here. That will get \nprices down. I thank the Chair. I thank my friend from Montana for \ngiving me this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 6 minutes 2 \nseconds. The Senator from Michigan has 4 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, for all the reasons \nindicated, I very strongly oppose this amendment. I point out that the \nopposition to this amendment is very strongly bipartisan. Senator \nVoinovich from Ohio spoke against the amendment and, in a few minutes, \nSenator Warner from Virginia, one of the key Senators in writing the \nTEA-21 program, will strongly oppose this amendment. There is very \nstrong bipartisan opposition.\n  The second point I want to make is that this is really, in some \nsense, kind of a disingenuous amendment. It would make Tammany Hall \nblush. This is an amendment that would lower taxes just before an \nelection, to the effect that it would increase taxes right after \nelection. I tell you, is that what the American public likes us to do? \nLower taxes before an election and pop up automatically and increase it \nafter election? Merry Christmas, a new tax. This goes back into effect \nin 150 days. Thank you, but I don't think that is something we want to \ndo.\n  In addition, I have heard it said that there is an ironclad guarantee \nthat nothing comes out of the highway trust fund and the dollars will \ngo for highways. Not true. If Congress meets today, tomorrow, or next \nweek, Congress can always change this provision if it is adopted. There \nis no guarantee that dollars won't go to the States--none whatsoever, \nto be clear.\n  Number 3, I find it ironic that here we are on an estate tax bill \ntrying to help farmers and ranchers, and if this 18-cent Federal \ngasoline tax actually is passed on--I doubt it will be because the oil \nindustry will take advantage--but if it is, what will be the effect? It \nwill hurt farmers and ranchers. Why? It is going to make gasohol \ncomparatively uncompetitive.\n  Corn producers, wheat producers, and those who need current law to \ngive them a competitive break to produce gasohol and ethanol from corn \nand from wheat will be severely disadvantaged if this amendment were to \nhave the effect it purports to have. I don't think it is going to have \nthat effect anyway. If it does, that means there is no help to our \nmotorists. Rather, it all goes into the pockets of the oil companies or \nthe jobbers and marketers. There are tons of reasons why this is a bad \nidea. I haven't the time to go into all of them. But I wanted to give a \nflavor of some of the problems that this causes. I hope Senators \nrealize what the consequences would be.\n\n[[Page S6622]]\n\n  I yield whatever time I have remaining to my good friend from \nVirginia, Senator Warner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, may I inquire of the time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes fifty seconds.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is like the Four Horsemen of the great \nNotre Dame team--Mr. Byrd, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Voinovich, and Mr. Warner--\nthat time and time again comes out on this issue. But it requires the \nstrength of the famous Four Horsemen on the football team because this \ntax is one that probably--I hesitate to say this, but I am going to say \nit anyway--is more acceptable to the public than any that I know of \nbecause they see this tax translated into things they desperately need \nby way of road improvements, by way of other improvements, and safety \nimprovements.\n  How many times do they drive up and down the highways in my State and \nwe see the projects going on. It delays the traffic and they are \nirritated. But when they go by, they say: When that is fixed it will be \nbetter.\n  These are those dollars that go directly from the gas pump to the \nproject to employment in their States.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks a letter from the National League of Cities, \nNational Association of Counties, Council of State Governments, and the \nInternational City/County Management Association dated July 12 of this \nyear. It is addressed to our distinguished leaders, Mr. Lott and Mr. \nDaschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit I.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it says in part the following:\n\n       On behalf of the Nation's elected State and local \n     government officials, we would like to express our strong \n     opposition to this legislation or any other proposals before \n     Congress to repeal or suspend any portion of the Federal \n     gasoline tax.\n\n  Further down in the letter:\n\n       It is our understanding that the amendment being proposed . \n     . . would suspend the 18.4 cents Federal gasoline tax for 150 \n     days. As a result of this loss of revenue, States and \n     localities could face significant reductions in spending for \n     transportation planning, highway and bridge repairs, public \n     transit, bike and pedestrian facilities, clean air programs, \n     and most importantly highway safety. Also, without a \n     predictable flow of Federal highway, transit, and aviation \n     funding, States and localities may face more difficulty in \n     long-term transportation planning which will cause projects \n     to be more costly and result in safety concerns.\n\n  We learned through the many years that I have been associated with \nthis issue on the Environment and Public Works Committee that planning \ngoes forward years in advance. Contracts are let based on a source of \nthese funds guaranteed by Congress and Federal law. These contractors \nare not going to risk their working capital. Employers are not going to \nrisk trying to hire additional people if there remains this constant \nuncertainty around this tax.\n  I hope the Senate stands with the Four Horsemen, and that we will be \nable to protect, once again, the interests of the people with the tax \nwhich probably is the least objectionable of all taxes.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit I\n\n       National League of Cities, National Association of \n     Counties, Council of State Governments, International City/\n     County Management Association\n                                                    July 12, 2000.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Lott and Daschle: It is our understanding \n     that the Senate may consider an amendment this week which \n     would temporarily suspend the 18.4 cents federal excise tax \n     on gasoline. On behalf of the nation's elected state and \n     local government officials, we would like to express our \n     strong opposition to this legislation or any other proposals \n     before Congress to repeal or suspend any portion of the \n     federal gasoline tax.\n       We believe such proposals would jeopardize funding for \n     critical transportation improvements. We also oppose the \n     proposal to hold the highway trust fund harmless by paying \n     for the loss of gasoline tax revenue with projected non-\n     social security budget surplus monies from the general fund \n     of the U.S. Treasury. This type of shift could endanger \n     funding for vital state and local priorities such as \n     education, public safety, and healthcare.\n       We recognize that the rise in gasoline prices is a very \n     important issue facing the nation, but temporarily repealing \n     the 18.4 cents federal gasoline tax will not provide long-\n     term solutions to the problem. It will, however, \n     detrimentally affect our ability to continue vitally needed \n     transportation improvements which will directly benefit our \n     shared constituents.\n       It is our understanding that the amendment being proposed \n     by Senator Abraham would suspend the 18.4 cents federal \n     gasoline tax for 150 days. As a result of this loss of \n     revenue, states and localities could face significant \n     reductions in spending for transportation planning, highway \n     and bridge repairs, public transit, bike and pedestrian \n     facilities, clean air programs, and most importantly highway \n     safety. Also, without a predictable flow of federal highway, \n     transit, and aviation funding, states and localities may face \n     more difficulty in long-term transportation planning which \n     will cause projects to be more costly and result in safety \n     concerns.\n       In 1998, we supported the funding guarantees created in the \n     landmark Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA \n     21). TEA 21 not only established a record level of investment \n     in surface transportation, it also established a direct link \n     between the collection of transportation user fees and \n     transportation spending. Any reduction in the current federal \n     gas tax will put this carefully crafted, bipartisan agreement \n     at risk.\n       Thank your for your consideration in this matter. If you \n     have any questions concerning our views on this issue, please \n     feel free to contact us.\n           Sincerely,\n     Donald J. Borut,\n       Executive Director, National League of Cities.\n     Larry E. Naake,\n       Executive Director, National Association of Counties.\n     Daniel M. Sprague,\n       Executive Director, Council of State Governments.\n     William H. Hansel, Jr.,\n       Executive Director, International City/County Management \n     Association.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia will yield for a question, I am sure he knows as he invokes \nthe image of the Four Horsemen that at this very moment the \nCongressional Gold Medal has been bestowed on Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, \nthe president of the Notre Dame football team, which embodies the \nspirit of the Four Horsemen.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, let's fetch him to the floor if possible. \nPerhaps he can join us and bless this body.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on the time under my control, I have a \nquestion that I would like to ask Senator Baucus, the ranking member of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee.\n  The one thing that we haven't discussed at length regarding this \namendment is that it would cause unemployment in the country.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the rule of thumb is that for every $10 \nbillion in highway funds 42,000 jobs are created. Those are good paying \njobs. These are not service industry jobs. Those are highway jobs.\n  The effect of this amendment would be to cut the funding of the \nhighway trust fund by $13 billion over 150 days--roughly 5 months. That \nis going to mean upwards of at least 50,000 American jobs cut--not \nthere.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Montana is a very large State. It is a huge \nState. It is bigger than Nevada. But in addition to Montana being a \nvery large State, we have States such as Nevada which are growing very \nrapidly. For example, we have one project which is the largest highway \nproject in the history of the State of Nevada costing $100 million. \nThat money came from this fund.\n  Is that not true?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is exactly right.\n  Mr. REID. Had we not been able to complete what we refer to as the \n``spaghetti bowl,'' the highway would be locked down for not only the \npeople who permanently live there, but it is on the freeway carrying \npeople all over this country. I-15 is one of the major freeways in this \ncountry.\n  What the Senator is telling me, if I understand it, is if this \namendment passes, construction projects such as the one I just referred \nto in the State of Nevada and the renovations and repairs which go on \nall of the time on those large segments of highway in the State of \nMontana would basically be shut down.\n\n[[Page S6623]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Not only in Montana, but all across the country because \nthis will cost $13 billion. I know the proponents like to claim that \nthe $13 billion would be spent because we take it from other programs. \nBut I point out that $13 billion translates per 150 days into about $30 \nbillion a year.\n  I ask my good friends rhetorically: Where are we going to cut $30 \nbillion for other programs? I don't think that is going to happen.\n  Second, even though, if this amendment were to pass--I pray that it \ndoes not, but if it were to pass--Congress would probably go into a big \nscramble. I know my good friend on the Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Byrd, and Senator Stevens would say: Where in the world are we \ngoing to find $30 billion in one year? It just isn't there.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield up to 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNew York, the ranking member on the Finance Committee, the manager of \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I would first like to respond to the \nminority leader and my friend from Montana.\n  I once served as chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks. I managed major transportation legislation.\n  I can say to you that absent this revenue from the gasoline tax, \nwhich we imposed under President Eisenhower in 1956, and which built \nthe Interstate Highway System and transformed American society, the \ntransportation programs will just stop. There is no other revenue for \nit. It is a dedicated revenue. They are planned on. This would be the \nfirst time they have been interrupted. A whole industry would be \ninterrupted, not to mention the urban and State planning that goes on; \nnot to mention measures such as the Woodrow Wilson Bridge, which is \nhugely important to Virginia and to the District of Columbia.\n  Another point on the matter of the price of gasoline: Over the past \ntwo decades the price of a gallon of gasoline, adjusted for inflation, \nhas fallen by exactly a third--from $1.49 in 1981 to, in those dollars, \n$1 in June of this year.\n  We are not paying more for gasoline. We are paying less for it.\n  There can be an argument made that the price is too low, but not that \nwe should lower it further and deprive ourselves of the essentials of \nthe transportation infrastructure and construction in this Nation.\n  Our faithful friend, Dr. Podoff, brought along, as he feels he \nshould, Marshall's Principles of Economics.\n  In Marshall's ``Principles of Economics,'' the great text at the end \nof the 19th century, Marshall taught Keynes, who has taught the world, \nmade it very clear, that in situations of shortage such as we are \ntemporarily facing--he was talking about fish, meat; he was not talking \nabout gasoline--the price to the consumer will not be reduced. This is \na proposition that drives from theory and is confirmed now by a century \nof observation in the aftermath of Marshall's principles.\n  Consumers will get nothing, transportation departments will get \nnothing, and the public will get a serious disruption in its basic \ntransportation infrastructure, which is not simply highways, but all \nthe other related modes of transit. This is what we have at issue here. \nI cannot imagine we will do other than continue a program we have had \nin place since 1956, a third of a century, with extraordinary results. \nTo stop it now would be, in my view, irresponsible.\n  Based on what Marshall taught us, repealing the gasoline tax, even \ntemporarily, represents a futile attempt to repeal the laws of supply \nand demand. This is a somewhat curious activity for my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle who often express a strong commitment for \nmarket economies both at home and abroad.\n  Let me add a few other facts about the market for gasoline and other \nfuel products--facts that are obvious even to those with no formal \ntraining in economics.\n  The increase in the price of a gallon of gas from an average of $1.15 \nin June 1999 to a peak of $1.71 in June 2000--a 56 cent increase--has \nnothing to do with a 4.3 cent per gallon tax increase, enacted in 1993, \nor the total federal tax on a gallon of gas of 18.3 cents, neither of \nwhich have increased over the past 12 months.\n  The price of a gallon of gas peaked at about $1.71 in mid-June and \nhas already declined by about 8 cents. The change in the prices has \nnothing to do with tax policy and is mostly related to OPEC's \nproduction decisions.\n  In September, 1993, the month before the 4.3 cent tax increase went \ninto effect, the price of a gallon of gasoline was $1.15. Three months \nlater, after the tax increase, the price was $1.14.\n  In 1996, the cost of gasoline increased rapidly from $1.19 in January \nto $1.39 in May--following roughly the same pattern that we are now \nobserving. The Senate debated repeal of the 4.3 cent tax, but \nfortunately took no action as two attempts at cloture failed. By \nJanuary, 1998 the price of a gallon of gasoline was back to $1.19--and \nin real terms had actually declined a few pennies.\n  And, as I noted earlier, over almost two decades, the price of a \ngallon of gasoline in constant (inflation adjusted) dollars has fallen \nby about a third, from $1.49 in 1981 to about $1.00 in June of this \nyear. The reduction in gasoline prices occurred even as the economy \nexpanded almost continuously--92 months in the 1980s and a record \nsetting 112 months in the current expansion, which shows no signs of \nending. Over the past two decades the economy, in real terms, has \nalmost doubled, while the unemployment rate has been cut by half.\n  True, over the past two decades the price of fuel products has \nfluctuated, often somewhat unpredictably. For example, in 1986 the \nprice of a gallon of gasoline decreased by 36 cents from the beginning \nto the end of the year. The next year the price increased by 11 cents. \nWhile economists often cannot predict, or even explain, energy price \nvolatility, they can tell us the effect, in the short-run, of reducing \nfuel taxes. The price to the consumer will not be reduced. This is \nsomething we know; or it can be said as much as things like this are \nknowable. For a century, it has been the clearest understanding of the \neconomics profession that under short-run supply conditions, a change, \nsuch as a reduction in an excise tax, does not affect the price paid by \nthe consumer.\n\n  During a similar debate on gas tax repeal in May of 1996, I also \nreferred to the theories of Marshall and attempted to summarize his \nwisdom. Here is what I said then:\n  Marshall took the example--to illustrate short-term supply, a \nfascinating thing--he took the example of fish. He said, what happens \nif there is a sudden change in the situation? Weather makes fish more \nor less available--a nice point--or if there is an increased demand for \nfish caused by the scarcity of meat during the year or two following a \ncattle plague. Mad cow disease in the late 19th century. A scarcity of \nfish caused by uncertainties of the weather . . . . These things come. \nWould outside intervention change the price of fish to the consumer in \nthat circumstance, when there was a fixed supply? The answer from \nAlfred Marshall is emphatically ``no.'' Students of economics my age \nwill remember this book. It is a very heavy book, but it is still \naround and it works. What it propounded is very clear.\n  And now let me state the conclusion as simply as possible. Market \nvalues are determined by the relationship between supply and demand.\n  This is something businessmen know. In 1996, Mr. Mike Bowlin, \nChairman of ARCO, had this to say about the matter when he appeared on \nABC's ``Nightline'':\n\n       My concern is that there are other market forces that \n     clearly will overwhelm the relatively small decrease in the \n     price of gasoline, and that alarms me, that people's \n     expectations will be that the minute the tax is removed, they \n     want to see gasoline prices go down . . . and that won't \n     happen.\n\n  At about the same time--May 1996--I noted, on the Floor of the \nSenate, the comments of Dr. Philip Verleger, a well-known energy \neconomist. The author of several books on the subject, including \nAdjusting to Volatile Energy Prices, Dr. Verleger was, at that time, \nquoted in The Washington Post:\n\n       The Republican-sponsored solution to the current fuels \n     problem . . . is nothing more and nothing less than a \n     refiner's benefit bill. . . . It will transfer upwards of $3 \n     billion from the U.S. Treasury to the pockets of refiners and \n     gasoline marketers.\n\n  In March of this year, when the Senate was considering a change in \ngas tax\n\n[[Page S6624]]\n\npolicy, I wrote the following to Dr. Verleger:\n\n       I assume that since the economics of a gas tax reduction \n     has not changed--something we have known since at least \n     Alfred Marshall--neither have your views.\n\n  He replied the very same day:\n\n       In my view, the US petroleum industry is operating at or \n     close to capacity. Thus refiners will be unable to boost \n     gasoline production if the tax [repeal] becomes law. Further, \n     inventories of gasoline are currently very low due to the \n     destabilizing actions taken by OPEC. This means that the \n     supply of gasoline has been essentially determined--totally \n     inelastic in technical terms--through the summer. Under these \n     circumstances, consumers are not likely to see any benefit \n     from suspension or repeal of the gasoline tax.\n\n  Dr. Krugman said much the same thing in a March 15, 2000, New York \nTimes op-ed. For Professor Krugman there simply is no getting around \nthe fact that we face a supply problem:\n\n       Now suppose that we were to cut gasoline taxes. If the \n     price of gas at the pump were to fall, motorists would buy \n     more gas. But there isn't any more gas, so the price at the \n     pump, inclusive of the lowered tax, would quickly be bid \n     right back up to the pre-tax-cut level. And that means that \n     any cut in taxes would show up not in a lower price at the \n     pump, but in a higher price paid to distributors [emphasis \n     added]. In other words, the benefits of the tax cut would \n     flow not to consumers but to other parties, mainly the \n     domestic oil refining industry. (As the textbooks will tell \n     you, reducing the tax on an inelastically supplied good \n     benefits the sellers, not the buyers.)\n\n  It is worth repeating Krugman's conclusion--``benefits of the tax cut \nwould flow not to the consumers but to other parties, mainly the \ndomestic oil refining industry.''\n  We here in Congress know this too, and I suspect that is why the \nlegislation we have before us contains a ``Sense of the Congress'' \nsection that ``consumers immediately receive the benefit of the \nreduction in taxes.'' We surely want the consumer to realize some \nsavings, but doubt that they will. The question for this body is \nwhether we should approve legislation that contains what amounts to a \nconcession of failure within its very text. Discouraging.\n  Finally, I would point out to my colleagues that the Transportation \nEquity Act for the 21st Century was signed into law less than two years \nago. TEA-21 as it is known, is a six-year Federal surface \ntransportation bill that consumed nearly two years of committee action \nand Floor debate. In the end, the bill passed 88-5 based on the \nagreement that Federal motor fuel excise taxes would be collected at \nleast through Fiscal Year 2003--the last year of TEA-21's \nauthorization. During the debate on TEA-21, the Senate was afforded the \nopportunity to repeal 4.3 cents per gallon of the Federal motor fuel \nexcise taxes. By an 80-18 vote, we rejected repeal and instead opted to \ninvest that revenue in our Nation's transportation infrastructure.\n  Just this past April, the Senate went on record again to reject any \ntype of suspension of the motor fuel excise tax by a 56-43 vote on the \nMajority Leader's bill S. 2285, which would have called for a fuel tax \nholiday of the 4.3 cents for a six month period.\n  According to figures from the Federal Department of Transportation, \nif the entire 18.3 cents gas tax were to be suspended for six months, \nthe Federal-aid Highway program could lose an estimated $9.6 billion in \nfuel tax revenues.\n  Mr. President, suspending the Federal taxes on motor fuels will do \nlittle or nothing to lower fuel costs. But it will cause considerable \ndisruption to our Federal transportation program, even with a ``hold \nharmless'' provision. We ought not set precedents of this kind. They \nwill come back to haunt us another day.\n  I would caution my colleagues to exercise caution when they propose \nto undo agreements made by such overwhelming majorities.\n  Mr. President, suspending portions of the Federal excise taxes on \nmotor fuels will do little or nothing to lower fuel costs. To my mind, \nthat is reason enough to reject this measure.\n  OPEC's decision last year to restrict supply was the primary reason \nfuel costs increased. OPEC's future production decisions will be the \nprimary reason gas prices go up or down in the future.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. In light of the time situation, I ask unanimous consent \nto be granted 10 minutes of our leader's time to continue this debate.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield the remaining time to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, how much time remains for Senator \nAbraham?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask to be notified at 2 minutes because Senator \nCraig from Idaho also desires to speak.\n  Mr. President, if the highway trust fund were going to be affected at \nall, I could not be a sponsor of this amendment. But the highway trust \nfund is specifically held harmless.\n  We passed a budget resolution in this Senate that said we would give \n$150 billion in tax relief for this Nation over the next 5 years. We \nare talking about roughly $12 billion of that money that we have \nalready allocated for tax relief for hard-working Americans. That is \nwhat will keep the highway trust fund totally whole.\n  The highway trust fund will not lose one penny. There will be no \nsafety crisis. There will be no stoppage of money going into the flow \nfor the highway trust fund. In fact, this is a tax relief measure \nbecause we have had a crisis that was not expected. We have had a \ncrisis with families going on vacation, consumers, people who have to \ndrive to work every day. What about the independent trucker who is now \npaying $150 to $200 a tank more than they have ever paid before because \nthe price of gas is so high?\n  We must give this temporary relief, as we take longer term measures \nto try to take our dependence on foreign oil down to a level that is \nacceptable. Until we do that, we need to give this immediate relief. We \nhave it in the budget to do it. We will not touch the highway trust \nfund.\n  The leaders in this effort--Senator Abraham, Senator Fitzgerald, \nSenator Grams--come from States that are particularly hard hit. They \nare States where truckers are saying they can't meet their contract \nrequirements. They may even lose their trucks.\n  Mr. President, I urge support for the Abraham amendment.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I seek unanimous consent to be granted 5 \nminutes of leader time to summarize our amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, we need a ruling from the \nChair. I am certainly not going to object, but I want to make sure we \nunderstand this.\n  Under the bill, there is 90 minutes given to each leader. Senator \nDaschle has delegated that time for me to control. When we talk about \nthe ``leader's time,'' that is the time about which we speak; is that \nright?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair understands in this context that \nterm refers to the 90 minutes granted to each leader.\n  Mr. REID. The leader's time would be in addition to that; is that \nright? Each day that we come before the body, there is an agreement \nthat the leader's time is reserved for some future time.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Perhaps I could clarify.\n  Mr. REID. Let's let the Chair rule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Each leader does have 10 minutes under the \nstanding order every day, and that time is referred to also as leader's \ntime.\n  Mr. REID. The question I ask the Chair: Do we therefore have 90 \nminutes, plus 10 minutes, or is it just 90 minutes today?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ninety minutes plus 10.\n  Mr. REID. I make sure that the time my friend from Michigan wishes to \nuse is off the 90 minutes, not the 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. That is what I sought to clarify a moment ago. I \nrecognize that the two separate timeframes can be confused, and I will \nmodify my unanimous consent request to request 5 additional minutes off \nthe 90 minutes accorded to the leader on my side for debate on this \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate the debate we have had \ntoday. The bottom line remains the same: People in America are paying \ntoo much\n\n[[Page S6625]]\n\nfor gasoline. Congress must do something about it. I have heard an \narray of objections raised by people as to why this can't be done.\n  Given the actions this Congress regularly takes on appropriations \nlegislation, on budget legislation, on tax legislation, moving gigantic \npackages in short periods of time when we do our omnibus spending \nbills, the notion that this legislation somehow doesn't accomplish the \nmission of protecting the highway fund from diminution is, to me, an \ninaccurate statement.\n  The road projects will continue. The legislation ensures that the \nmoney will be there. We are aware that we have on-budget surpluses, not \ntouching Social Security, adequate to meet the cost of suspending the \ngas tax. I believe those claims just simply are off the mark.\n  This will be a stake through the heart, if this is defeated, of the \nconsumers of America who are paying way too much right now in gasoline \nprices. They deserve a break. Consumers in my State, for whom I come to \nthe Senate floor and fight every day, deserve that break.\n  We are paying the highest gas prices in America. Whether consumers \ndrive a minivan back and forth to children's activities, or drive a car \nto their job, regardless of their needs, in Michigan and across \nAmerica, I find it hard to believe there is anyplace in America today \nwhere Members of this body are not hearing from constituents that the \nprice of gasoline is too high.\n  We selected 5 months as the duration of this action for a simple \nreason. That is what we have been told by the spokesperson at the \nDepartment of Energy and in this administration is the approximate \nduration of time it will take for the various efforts they are engaged \nin to try to bring down the price of gasoline.\n  I am happy to modify this amendment to a shorter timeframe if we have \nassurances from anybody that would, in fact, be an adequate period of \ntime for the supply issues to be addressed. That is not what we have \nheard. We heard it will take longer. We cannot wait longer in Michigan. \nWe want relief now. The one thing we can do as a body is to suspend the \nFederal gas tax for 150 days.\n  I believe this is a clear-cut choice. We are here to try to help the \nmen and women, the hard-working families of this country. This is \nsomething we can do in a concrete way to help them. It can be done in a \nfashion that does not undermine the road projects going on.\n  I believe this price, as a result of the suspension of the gas tax, \nwill translate into prices at the pump. We saw it in our State the \nother day. As soon as the station brought down prices 18 cents, \neverybody went to that station for gas. In any station, any oil company \nthat does not bring down its prices in accordance with the passage of \nthis legislation will lose business to the stations that do. That is \nthe way of supply and demand. That is the way price will work. It will \ncreate the competitive market in which the people who abide by the \nterms of this legislation quickly benefit because they will be the ones \nwith the customers.\n\n  It will help the farmers in my State who are right now screaming \nbecause of high gasoline prices. It will help the tourism industry in \nmy State which is deeply concerned that the price of gasoline is so \nhigh. It will help the automotive industry which is worried that we \nwill once again see a recession caused by a shift from American-made \nproducts to foreign imports.\n  For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. \nI assure them, look at it yourself; you will see the language is \nexplicit. The highway trust fund moneys will not be diminished if we do \nthis but consumers will gain the benefit with which we sought to \nprotect them in the suspension of this gas tax.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for the closing debate on the minority side, \nI yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, to summarize, obviously motorists do not \nlike paying higher gasoline prices. As has been pointed out, it is a \nproduct, essentially, of supply and demand--in this case, short supply. \nThat is what has happened.\n  I must also point out the price of gasoline is starting to come down \nsignificantly. According to figures as of July 10, the national average \nprice of gasoline has fallen 3 cents since last week, 8 cents since the \nrecent high on July 12. That is not a lot, but it is better. In the \nMidwest, prices have fallen by 28 cents since their high on June 19, \nsettling just below the national average, I might add. And for areas in \nthe Midwest using reformulated gasoline, prices have fallen more than \n34 cents since their high on June 19, settling just 4 cents above the \nnational average. So prices are already coming down.\n  No. 2, in real terms we are paying less, one-third less than we were \nin 1981. That is not an unimportant point. That is very important.\n  In addition, this is an off-again, on-again tax. This is a yo-yo tax. \nOn again, off again, that is no way for the Congress to conduct fiscal \npolicy. It just is not. Pretty soon, if we do this, we will have off-\nagain, on-again taxes on everything under the Sun. What in the world is \ngoing on here? The American people want stability. They don't like the \ncharades, the sleights of hand. Here is a tax that is going to go off \njust before an election, go right back on right after the election. \nCome on, give me a break. Is that what we want to do here?\n  I might add, this is expensive. The Senator says it is not going to \ncome out of the highway trust fund. Let's put it this way: There is \ngoing to be at least $13 billion lost to revenue, and the \nAppropriations Committee has the authority to set the ceilings that are \nspent under the highway program. So it could lower those ceilings. It \ncould come out of the highway trust fund, in effect. When we are out \nhere trying to balance the budgets and figure out how to keep spending \nunderneath the caps, there is a very good chance these dollars will \ncome out of the highway trust fund and not go to the States. It is \ngoing to happen.\n  Finally, this is a program that has the trust of the American people. \nWhen they go to the pump and pay that 18.4 cents, they know it goes to \nthe highway trust fund and they know the dollars come back to their \nStates for highway construction, bridges, urban programs, and so forth.\n  Let's keep a little sanity around here and resoundingly reject this \namendment.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter \ndated July 13, 2000, from Andrew Quinlan of CapitolWatch to Senator \nLott be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 CapitolWatch,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 13, 2000.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Lott: On behalf of CapitolWatch and \n     its 250,000 citizen lobbyists, I urge you to support an \n     amendment sponsored by Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI) to H.R. \n     8--the Death Tax Elimination Act. Sen. Abraham's amendment \n     would suspend the 18.4 cents federal fuels tax for 150 days. \n     With people in our nation's heartland paying over $2 a gallon \n     coupled with a record budget surplus, the need has never been \n     greater to suspend such a burdensome tax nor has the means to \n     pay for it been more readily available.\n       Those who defend the federal gas tax do so on the basis \n     that these taxes go to the Highway Trust Fund and presumably \n     to the safety of our nation's highways. However, Abraham's \n     amendment specifically addresses this concern by stating that \n     it would replenish the Highway Trust Fund with some of the \n     non-Social Security Surplus. The cost of this amendment would \n     be $6.5 million, or only a little over 12 percent of the \n     current budget surplus minus the Social Security and Medicare \n     Trust Funds.\n       With record surpluses, a gas tax suspension would be an \n     excellent way to immediately give part of that surplus back \n     to overtaxed Americans. Sen. Abraham's amendment will \n     accomplish two important goals of CapitolWatch. It would \n     return a tax dividend back to hard-working Americans who \n     created our historic economic growth and would keep \n     Washington from spending the surplus on additional pork \n     barrel projects instead of tax relief or debt reduction.\n       CapitolWatch's 250,000 supporters urge every member of the \n     Senate to support Abraham's gas tax amendment and suspend the \n     gas tax. If you would like more information, please contact \n     CapitolWatch at (202) 544-2600 or visit our Web page at \n     www.CapitolWatch.org.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Andrew F. Quinlan,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n[[Page S6626]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am as upset by the gasoline price \nspikes as anyone else. I believe they are still very high in \nCalifornia, though prices have come down in my State from the highs \nthey reached in March.\n  Having said that, I feel obliged to oppose this amendment despite \nunderstanding the sentiment behind it. The problem with the amendment \nis that there is no way to guarantee that a reduction in the federal \ngasoline tax will be passed on to consumers.\n  At least that's what the chief executive officers of the three major \nCalifornia refiners told me. Collectively, they produce 70 percent of \nCalifornia's gasoline. Earlier in the year, I called them. None could \nguarantee that a decrease in the gasoline tax would cause the same drop \nat the pump. They cited the fundamental problem with supply, and also \npointed out that they have no control over other entities in the supply \nchain.\n  Price is a function of supply and demand, not taxes and right now, \nworld oil markets are extremely tight, so prices are high. The way to \nrelieve the pressure on the market is to boost supply and reduce \ndemand.\n  With regard to supply, 14 nations sell oil to the U.S. under a cartel \nknown as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC. Like \nany monopoly, OPEC controls the price of oil by limiting supply. \nDecreased production in non-OPEC countries like Venezuela, Mexico, and \nNorway has also contributed to the squeeze.\n  Since OPEC is not bound by U.S. law, there are only a few things the \nU.S. can do to encourage the cartel to increase supply. The preferred \nalternative is diplomacy.\n  It takes several weeks for production increases to be felt at the \npump in lower prices, and California has unique problems affecting its \nsupply. No other State requires the kind of reformulated gasoline that \nCalifornia does. So the gasoline has to be refined in California, and \nCalifornia refiners have had problems--including two fires--operating \ntheir plants at full capacity. They are at full capacity now.\n  As I said a moment ago, this amendment does not solve the problem of \nhigh gasoline prices. Under California law, if the federal gasoline tax \ndrops by 9 cents per gallon or more, then the State tax automatically \nrises to off-set the federal decrease. The law is designed to protect \nthe Highway Trust Fund. I have spoken with members of the California \nLegislature about this. They do not seem inclined to change the law.\n  What are our options?\n  The fact is, we have limited control over supply. Too much of the \nworld's oil is produced elsewhere. The one thing we can control is \ndemand.\n  The best way to reduce demand is to require that sports utility \nvehicles, SUVs, and light duty trucks get the same fuel efficiency that \npassenger vehicles do. If SUVs and light duty trucks had the same fuel \nefficiency standards as passenger cars, the U.S. would use one million \nfewer barrels of oil each day.\n  This is roughly equal to the U.S. shortfall before OPEC increased \nproduction.\n  The Department of Transportation is responsible for setting fuel \nefficiency requirements under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, CAFE, \nprogram. About two-thirds of all petroleum used goes to transportation, \nso boosting fuel efficiency is an important way to wean ourselves off \nOPEC oil and reduce the price motorists pay for gasoline. Consider, \ntoo, the significant environmental and health benefits of higher fuel \nefficiency.\n  But CAFE standards have not increased since the mid-1980s. And the \nsituation is made worse by a loophole in the CAFE regulations. SUVs and \nlight duty trucks--which are as much passenger vehicles as station \nwagons and sedans--are only required to average 20.7 miles per gallon \nper fleet versus 27.5 miles per gallon for automobiles.\n  Since half of all new vehicles sold in this country are fuel-thirsty \nSUVs and light duty trucks, this stranglehold on energy efficiency has \nproduced an American fleet with the worst fuel efficiency since 1980. \nWe are going backwards!\n  According to the non-partisan American Council for an Energy \nEfficient Economy, the U.S. saves 3 million barrels of oil a day \nbecause of CAFE standards. Close the SUV loophole, as I said a moment \nago, and save another million barrels each day.\n  Overall, SUV and light duty truck owners spend an extra $25 billion a \nyear at the pump because of the ``SUV loophole.'' Making SUVs and light \nduty trucks get better gas mileage would save their owners some $640 at \nthe pump each year when the price of gasoline averages $2 per gallon.\n  The bottom line is that eliminating some or all of the federal \ngasoline tax will not lower prices at the pump. The best way to do that \nis to reduce our demand. The best way to reduce demand is to increase \nthe gas mileage requirements for SUVs and light duty trucks.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to discuss my \nopposition to this legislation repealing the federal gas tax of 18.4 \ncents.\n  The rising gas prices of this past spring and summer have been a \ngreat concern to many of us across the country, and nowhere has the \nburden been greater than in my State of Wisconsin where gas prices at \nsome locations peaked over $2.00 per gallon. Families and businesses \nhave been hard hit by this unexpected strain on their budgets. Everyday \nactivities of work and recreation and summer travel plans have been \naltered. Fortunately, prices have begun to decline, and we are hopeful \nthat that trend will only continue in the approaching months. This \ndecline is in no small part the result of the bipartisan efforts of our \nCongressional delegation to provide relief to our constituents. With \nmany forces at play, we worked strenuously to get to the root of the \nrising gas price problem.\n  First, we requested an EPA waiver from the reformulated gas \nrequirements, which many considered to be a minor, yet still \ncontributing, factor to the price increases. We also took the oil \ncompanies to task for gouging the consumer at the pump, while enjoying \nhuge increases in profits. We called for a Federal Trade Commission \ninvestigation into the causes of spiking prices in Wisconsin and the \nUpper Midwest and now await the preliminary report. Lastly, we have \nattacked the main cause of the problem--the coordinated underproduction \nof oil on the part of OPEC, the organization of oil-producing nations. \nFortunately, under pressure from Congress and the Administration, the \nOPEC nations have agreed to increase their oil output. All these \nefforts taken together have yielded positive results, with prices \ndropping by 30 to 40 cents, and certainly we will continue to be \nvigilant to ensure this trend continues.\n  Clearly I am very sympathetic to the amendment sponsor's stated goals \nof providing relief at the pump. But I am convinced that repealing the \ngas tax is the wrong way to achieve this important goal. Repealing the \ntax will drastically reduce the funds available for critically needed \nhighway safety and maintenance programs, jeopardizing highway safety \nand putting other local services at risk by creating budget shortfalls. \nMoreover, repealing the tax does not guarantee that prices will go down \nfor consumers. In fact, there is a strong likelihood that repealing the \ngas tax would only deliver more profits to the oil companies without \ndelivering any relief to the consumer.\n  With the TEA-21 highway bill, we worked hard to guarantee that gas \ntax revenues would go to states for infrastructure improvements and to \nmake the distribution of those monies fair for Wisconsin. We went from \na 92 percent to 99 percent return on the dollar for Wisconsin, and \nthose funds are desperately needed for road, bridge and transit \nimprovements. It would be disastrous to lose transportation money just \nas Wisconsin, with our short construction season, is poised to start a \nnumber of road improvement and expansion projects.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I commend my good friend from Michigan on \nhis attempt to address the issue of high gas prices. However, I must \noppose his amendment.\n  The problem with the high gas prices we are experiencing is not the \nresult of the gas taxes, but with the fact that the Clinton/Gore \nAdministration has pursued a long-term consistent energy policy \ndiscouraging domestic production of oil, coal, nuclear, gas, \nhydropower, etc. The result of this cartel\n\n[[Page S6627]]\n\npolicy has been to put us over a barrel--an OPEC barrel of oil with \nresulting high gas prices.\n  My colleagues offering this amendment have stated that this amendment \nwould hold the trust fund harmless. Once again, I applaud their desire \nto help the consumers, but violating the ``trust'' in the highway trust \nfund is not holding the trust fund harmless.\n  We cannot risk the tremendous gains we made to ensure that the gas \ntax was a dedicated tax for a dedicated purpose. This is a true user \nfee. This is a user fee that works. I urge my colleagues to oppose the \nAbraham amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Democrat whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I raise the point of order that the pending \namendment violates section 311(a)(2)(B) of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury \n     not otherwise appropriated, the following amounts:\n       (1) $1,750,000,000 to carry out class size reduction \n     activities in the same manner as such activities are carried \n     out under section 310 of the Department of Education \n     Appropriations Act, 2000.\n       (2) $2,200,000,000 to carry out title II of the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act of 1965 and title II of the \n     Higher Education Act of 1965.\n       (3) $250,000,000 to carry out sections 1116 and 1117 of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.\n       (4) $1,000,000,000 to carry out part I of title X of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.\n       (5) $325,000,000 to carry out chapter 2 of subpart 2 of \n     part A of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965.\n       (6) $1,000,000,000 to carry out part B of the Individuals \n     with Disabilities Education Act.\n       (7) $3,000,000,000 to enable the Secretary of Education to \n     carry out a College Completion Grant Program.\n       (8) $150,000,000 to carry out part D of title I of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.\n       (9) $1,300,000,000 to carry out title XII of the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act of 1965.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this is an amendment I offer on behalf \nof myself, Senators Kennedy, Murray, Dodd, Kerry, Schumer, and Dorgan.\n  It will do a fairly simple thing. It will provide for the relief from \nestate tax that is proposed as the Democratic alternative on which we \nvoted earlier today so that there will be a substantial reduction in \nthe amount of estate tax over a period of time. It would, however, take \nsome of the additional revenue that would not be going to estate tax \nrelief under the Republican plan and would dedicate that instead to \neducation.\n  This is an important issue. This is an amendment, as were several \nothers we voted on already, that relates to our priorities and what we \nwould like to do with revenue over the next several years, how much of \nit should be returned, to which group of taxpayers, how much should be \nspent on needs we have here in the country.\n  Those of us who are proposing this amendment believe it should be a \nhigher priority for us to improve our schools and the future of all of \nthe children in this country--rich and poor, black and white, \nmetropolitan and rural--than it is to assist inordinately a relatively \nsmall group of people beyond the $8 million that is provided for as an \nexemption from the estate tax under the Democratic plan.\n  The amendment makes a commitment to invest some of the savings from \nthe elimination of the Republican estate tax proposal into our public \nschools. The amendment would guarantee that parents and communities \nhave the support they need to provide every child with a good public \neducation, to send every qualified student to college.\n  I was reading the paper yesterday. I noticed that the first day of \nthe Republican National Convention has the theme of ``leave no child \nbehind.'' That is a worthy theme. I commend them for adopting it. I \nbelieve this amendment could be characterized as the ``leave no child \nbehind'' amendment. Instead of dedicating huge resources toward \nproviding very wealthy individuals with a tax break--I think it has \nbeen discussed several times and is agreed to by all, the Republican \nplan does provide over $100 billion of tax relief over the next 10 \nyears, $750 billion over the following 10 years--instead of providing \nthat much in the way of tax relief for the very wealthiest in our \nsociety, the amendment ensures that small businesses and family farms \nreceive a significant tax break. It also provides funds for programs \nthat have been proven to improve student achievement in public schools, \nto assist students seeking postsecondary education.\n  Let me clear up one misconception I have uncovered in my home State \nof New Mexico. I spoke to one of my good friends there this last week. \nHe said: I don't see why you object to repeal of the estate tax. It \ndoes not involve a significant amount of Federal revenue. It is mainly \nan irritant to people to have an estate tax or to pay an estate tax.\n  What we have been talking about with the Republican proposal is $100 \nbillion over the next 10 years, $750 billion over the following 10 \nyears. We are spending in this current fiscal year $14.4 billion total \non elementary and secondary education in this country. That is Federal \nmoney. We are talking about tax cuts in the Republican plan which are \nsubstantially greater than the amount the Federal Government is \nspending on education each year. It is an important item. In my view, \nit is very much a statement about our priorities.\n  One of the critical elements in this amendment is school \nconstruction. We would fund a program to increase safety and decrease \novercrowding in our schools. We would provide $1.3 billion in grants \nand loans for urgent repair of 5,000 public elementary and secondary \nschools in very high-need areas. These programs would provide over $200 \nmillion to my home State of New Mexico where current estimates for \nschool repair and modernization approach $2 billion.\n  Accountability: We would support tough accountability for results by \nsetting aside $250 million for title I accountability grants. That is \nsomething we have been trying to do at several points in this session \nof Congress. We still have not succeeded. That would be accomplished if \nwe adopted this amendment.\n  Dropout prevention: The amendment provides crucial support for \nprograms designed to prevent students from dropping out of school. This \nis a vital issue in my State, particularly for the Hispanic community. \nMany of our Hispanic young people do not complete high school. The \npercentage of people who do complete high school is appallingly low. We \nneed to deal with that. It is a crisis situation.\n  Teacher quality: Senator Kennedy has led the way on trying to improve \nteacher quality in this session of the Congress. This amendment would \nprovide $2.2 billion for teacher quality programs so we can ensure that \nevery child is taught by a qualified instructor.\n  Class size: We would continue progress in achieving smaller classes \nby providing $1.75 billion to fulfill our commitment to hire 1 million \nteachers to reduce class size in the early grades.\n  Afterschool programs: Again, we would try to expand those by adding \n$1 billion to that funding.\n  Meeting our commitments to special education: Again, we would try to \nadd a billion dollars in this amendment for the IDEA funding, which I \nknow many Members of this body, both Democrats and Republicans, \nsupport.\n  Affordable college opportunities: Higher education makes a huge \ndifference in earnings and general mobility, even more in subsequent \ngenerations of a family. This amendment provides $3 billion for college \nopportunity tax credits. It would increase funding for the GEAR UP \nprogram by $325 million.\n  I know some critics say this amendment is not related to the \nunderlying tax reduction. I point out that exactly the opposite is \ntrue. The real issue for us is, what are our national priorities? Are \nwe going to reduce the revenue coming into the Government by enormous \namounts here in order to assist those who are wealthiest in our \nsociety, at the expense of adequately funding these education programs \nthat I believe are desperately needed?\n  The truth of the matter is that Americans want better educational \noutcomes for their children, not more tax cuts for the wealthy. I \nchallenge anyone to pose the option before us to the voters: Should \nCongress exercise its leadership by providing $50 billion in tax cuts \nto the wealthiest 2 percent of the population each year? Or should \nCongress, instead, exercise its leadership by using some of that \nrevenue to improve the educational outcomes in our public schools? I \nbelieve the American public is clear in their answer on that.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I will yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Earlier today, we had an excellent presentation made by the two \nSenators from North Dakota about the Democratic alternative. In those \npresentations, they pointed out that the arguments made on the other \nside about\n\n[[Page S6629]]\n\nthe importance of changing the estate tax so it addressed the needs of \nfamily farms and small businesses would be addressed in the Democratic \nalternative.\n  The basic Republican position is to hold those small family farmers \nhostage until they get what is the ``big apple,'' which will provide \nsome $700 billion to the wealthiest individuals in this country; 2,400 \ntaxpayers will get $300 billion in tax relief. The Forbes 400 families \nwill get, effectively, $250 billion.\n  As the Senator from New Mexico has pointed out, this is an issue of \nour priorities. What his amendment says is that we can address the \nparticular needs of the family farms and small businesses, and rather \nthan use all the other kinds of revenues, out of the difference between \nthe $64 billion and the $104 billion of the Republicans, we can take \n$11 billion of that this year and use those scarce funds in order to \ntry to meet the educational needs of the children of this country. That \nis what this is about.\n  As was pointed out by the Senator from New Mexico, this is really a \nchoice about priorities. Are we interested in providing tax breaks for \nthe wealthiest individuals in our society, or are we interested in \ninvesting in the children of our country? We will have an opportunity \nto address that in just a few moments.\n  What we have seen in the past decade is an explosion in the number of \nchildren who are attending grades K through 12--going from 46.4 million \nin 1990 all the way up to 53.4 million in the year 2000. At the same \ntime, we have seen a rather dramatic reduction in Federal support for \nelementary and secondary education from the 1980s; in 1980, 11.9 \npercent out of every dollar spent came from the Federal Government, and \nthis was down to 7.7 percent in fiscal year 1999. We have also seen \nthis lowering in higher education. We addressed this issue in the \nSchumer amendment earlier--unsuccessfully. But we had a debate on it. \nThis measure addresses this differential in elementary and secondary \neducation.\n\n  It is fair enough to ask whether the substance of this amendment will \nmake very much of a difference to the children in this country. Once \nagain, we have the most recent reports and the most recent studies that \nhave been done by the Congressional Research Service that point out, as \nof the very end of June of this year, their evaluation of what has \nhappened with smaller class sizes in California.\n  California's class size reduction shows that reducing class size \nimproves student achievement. A study of the first 3 years of class \nsize reduction in California shows that smaller classes have boosted \nstudent achievement in communities across the State for the second year \nin a row. It says the evaluation shows that though students in the most \ndisadvantaged schools were more likely to be in larger classes and have \nless qualified teachers, students in smaller classes still outperform \ntheir peers in larger classes, even with less-qualified teachers. These \nstudents could be performing even better if all the children in those \nschools have fully qualified teachers and smaller class sizes.\n  That is exactly what this amendment does. I don't know how often we \nhave to bring in the latest evidence. Here is the latest evidence, \nwhich shows students will perform better with smaller class sizes and \nbetter trained teachers. This amendment also provides afterschool \nprograms with tutorial, tough accountability standards, dropout \nprevention programs, a billion dollars for special needs in IDEA, and a \nmodest program to try to address the $112 billion necessary for school \nconstruction--you make a difference when you invest in the children of \nthis country. We are here to say that we believe one of the priorities \nof American families ought to be in using this money to invest in the \nchildren and not to provide a windfall tax break for 2,400 of the \nwealthiest individuals in this country. That is what this vote is \nabout.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will submit a unanimous consent request, \nand I make the request that the time already used on this amendment \nwould not count against the time we are fixing to ask for in this \nunanimous consent.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time between now and 6:30 p.m. be \nequally divided in the usual form between the two leaders and the \nfollowing amendments be debated for up to 20 minutes, equally divided, \nin the following order:\n  Bingaman, on education; Roth, on phone tax; Graham, on Medicare; \nGrassley, on farmers; Baucus and Kerrey, regarding the KidSave matter; \nGrams, on Social Security.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that at 6:30 the Senate proceed to a \nseries of votes in relation to the above-listed amendments in the order \noffered, with 2 minutes of debate equally divided for each amendment \nprior to each vote.\n  Mr. REID. May we add that after the first vote, each vote be 10 \nminutes?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank my colleagues for their cooperation. This is the \nonly way we are going to be able to get through this list. This is a \ngood way to do it. In light of the agreement, the next votes will be in \na stacked sequence at 6:30. We will try another stacked sequence of six \nat that time. If we can proceed on this basis, we can get this work \ncompleted at a reasonable time tonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes, and I will yield \n10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is limited to a total of 10 \nminutes under the agreement just reached.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I can live with that. The world won't come to an end if I \ndon't speak for 10 minutes. As I understand it, the agreement on the \ntime would not include this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time already used.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Then I will take 5 minutes, and I will yield 5 minutes to \nmy colleague.\n  Mr. President, I could not help but hear Senator Kennedy talking \nabout the need for education. I would like to remind my colleagues that \nwe and a Republican Congress spent more on education last year than the \nPresident asked for.\n  Our colleague from New Mexico talks about priorities. Bill Clinton, \nin his budget, calls for over a trillion dollars of new spending over \nthe next 10 years. Not one Democrat raises any concern about spending \nthe surplus. We propose $100 billion to eliminate the death tax, one-\ntenth the amount Bill Clinton wants to spend on new programs, and they \nare up in arms, outraged.\n  Now, this is about priorities. What are we trying to do? We are \ntrying to eliminate a situation where, every day, working Americans \nbuild up farms and build up businesses with sweat equity. They save and \nsacrifice, and they work long hours. They pay taxes on every dollar \nthey earn. And then, when they die, the Government comes in and forces \ntheir children to sell the business or sell the family farm, and we \nthink it is wrong. We think it is un-American, we think it is immoral, \nand we are going to eliminate it.\n  When you get down to the bottom line, there are two reasons our \nDemocrat colleagues disagree. Number one, our Democrat colleagues \nexactly within the context of this amendment say: Look. Force people to \nsell the family farm when papa dies. Force people to sell their \nbusiness because by them giving that money to the Government, the \nGovernment can spend it better. We don't agree. We think families can \nspend it better--not the Government.\n  The second argument is an argument we often hear from the Democrat \nside: We are talking about rich people. These are rich people.\n  I don't understand our Democrat colleagues. They profess to love \ncapitalism but they hate capitalists. Many of them are rich but they \nhate rich people.\n  Let me try to boil this down to its basic point because I only have a \ncouple of minutes. The only thing I was ever bequeathed in my life and \never will be was when my great-uncle Bill, my grandma's brother, left \nme a cardboard suitcase full of yellow sports clippings. If it had been \nbaseball cards, I would be a rich man today.\n\n[[Page S6630]]\n\n  Our agriculture commissioner in Texas owns a ranch that her family \nworked for four generations. When her dad died, she had to sell a third \nof that ranch to pay a death tax.\n  How does that help me? How did forcing her to sell off her family's \nranch that had been in her family for four generations help me or help \nmy family? How does tearing down one family build up another? We don't \nthink it does.\n  That is what this issue comes down to. We believe when people work, \nbuild up a business, or build up a farm, or build up assets, and they \npay taxes on it, that it ought then to belong to them and to their \nchildren, whether they are rich or whether they are not rich.\n  I think it is important to note that our colleagues, when they use \nall of those little examples, leave out one important thing. Over the \nnext 10 years, the revenues collected on this tax are going to \nquadruple. Why? Because of all of those teacher retirement programs. \nMany college professors are going to retire with $1 million in their \ninvestment accounts. I thank God for it. If they die before they can \nspend it, under current law, their children are going to end up having \nto give part of that retirement program to the Government. I think it \nis absolutely wrong and outrageous.\n  We are down to making a choice. They say don't eliminate the death \ntax--just raise the cap a little. Why do we need to eliminate it? When \nyou have a cancer, you don't cut out half of it. You cut out the whole \nthing.\n  Have we forgotten that when Bill Clinton was writing the 1993 tax \nbill he floated trial balloons about lowering the deduction from \n$600,000 to $200,000?\n  Does anyone doubt, if we don't repeal the death tax and if we ever \nhave a Democrat President and a Democrat Congress again, that the first \nthing they are going to do is lower the deduction back down to the \npoint where ordinary working families, farmers, ranchers, and small \nbusiness people will pay this tax? I don't doubt it. I want to cut it \nout by the roots.\n  That is what this vote is about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I request the Chair to notify me when \nI have 1 minute remaining of my 5 minutes.\n  This Bingaman amendment is a diversion from an important debate on \nthe elimination of the death tax. If you can't change people's minds, \nsometimes you want to change the subject. That is what the Democrats \nseek to do by this list of amendments.\n  We had an education debate. We spent 8 days on the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. I am ready to return to that. I think we \nshould. The majority leader has offered the opportunity to return to \nthe ESEA debate just as we did on DOD authorization. Let's do it next \nweek. But let's limit it to germane amendments.\n  The reason we are not on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nis because the Democrat side offered amendment after amendment that had \nnothing to do with education. I suggest if you want an education \ndebate, let's do it on ESEA. Let's not do it on the elimination of the \ndeath tax.\n  The death tax is growing increasingly unpopular with the American \npeople. It is for obvious reasons. They realize it is fundamentally \nwrong. They know double taxation when they see it. They know if they \npaid income tax, if they paid capital gains tax, and if they paid sales \ntax, that it is absolutely, fundamentally, inherently wrong to make \ndeath another taxable event.\n  That is what we are wanting to do with this legislation, eliminate \nit--not refine it, not tinker with it, not raise the cap but eliminate \nthe death tax once and for all because it is wrong.\n  The American people are increasingly opposed to the death tax because \nthey realize that it penalizes success; that the American way is to \nreward success. The death tax penalizes hard work. It penalizes \nsavings, and it penalizes investment.\n  Senator Bingaman, the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, who I \nhave the greatest respect for, says: Let's not eliminate it; let's just \ntinker with it, and take the savings--the so-called savings--and put it \ninto education.\n  We have increased spending on education.\n  But it would seem to me the logic is rather ironic; by putting it on \nthe elimination of the death tax and saying we want children to be \nbetter educated because we want them to use that better education so \nthey can be successful, but don't be too successful because, if you \nare, we are going to punish you when you die for the success you have \nachieved.\n  The Bingaman amendment says to young Americans that it is OK to dream \nbut don't dream too big because when you die we will punish you.\n  The turn of the century was a period appropriately dubbed ``the age \nof innocence.'' Millions of immigrants came to this country. They came \nso fast that we couldn't build ships enough to bring them into this \ncountry. They came with a dream. Some stayed in New York, others went \nto Detroit, Pittsburgh, and other industrial cities. But they came with \none goal in mind: to succeed with no limits, no caps, no punishing \neconomic thresholds, and, most importantly, no charade.\n  That is why they came here. They knew that life was too short and \ntheir families too precious to continue living under oppressive \ngovernments.\n  I ask my colleagues: Do you think we are fostering the same dream \nthat existed 100 years ago by keeping the status quo?\n  My esteemed colleague from New York, Senator Moynihan, said this \nmorning that it is a tax that has served us well. That is the basis of \nthis debate. If you believe that the death tax has served this country \nwell, then you certainly don't want to eliminate it. If you believe, as \nI believe, as Senator Gramm believes, and as I believe most Americans \nbelieve, that it is fundamentally un-American, then you want to \neliminate it.\n  Senator Gramm is absolutely right. It is a cancer. It is the cancer \nthat you don't just trim back. It is a cancer that must be removed from \nthe body politic and from our public policy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to reserve that last \nminute, if I might.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes and then the \nremainder of the time to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Let me respond to a couple of statements that were made.\n  First of all, this amendment was referred to as a diversion because \nit tries to bring into this debate the discussion about education and \nwhat we ought to be investing in education. Hopefully, we can persuade \nthe Senate to take some of the revenue that the Republican estate tax \nrepeal proposal contemplates eliminating and put it into education.\n  I do not see it as a diversion at all. I would love to have us back \non the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. We had that act before \nus. We offered some amendments. Those amendments were Democrat \namendments. One was for class size reduction. We talked about teacher \nquality. We had an amendment on that. It was pending, in fact, at the \ntime the bill was taken down by the majority leader.\n  I hope very much that next week we can go back to ESEA and have more \ndebate on that. But regardless of whether we are able to do that, I \nthink it is important that we consider and adopt this amendment as a \nstatement about what we think the priorities of this Nation are.\n  I do not shy from discussing the estate tax repeal proposal that is \nbefore us. In my State, frankly, the Democratic alternative, in my \nview, is a very enlightened and generous proposal which would \nsubstantially reduce the estate tax.\n  It would reduce to fewer than 100 estate tax returns that would be \nfiled in my State each year. That is the estimate I have received. It \nis something I think I can be proud to cosponsor and support.\n  I do not see why we have to go the full route the Republicans are \nproposing, as the Senator from Massachusetts said, and eliminate this \ntax entirely for those 2,400 wealthiest Americans. I do not think we \nare visiting any hardship upon them by maintaining in place some estate \ntax.\n  Let me get back to the subject of my amendment, which is education. \nPeople of this country support more investment in teacher quality, more \ninvestment in reducing the class sizes, more\n\n[[Page S6631]]\n\ninvestment in eliminating or reducing the number of students who drop \nout of our schools before they graduate, more investment in \naccountability of our schools so we can be sure the schools are \nperforming to standard, and more investment in school construction. \nThere are enormous needs in all these areas. This is an opportunity to \naddress those enormous needs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I think it would be a \nmajor statement of our priorities. We would not, in fact, leave one \nchild behind if we do this.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand, I have 8 minutes; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  As the Joint Tax Committee pointed out, as printed in the New York \nTimes today, according to the data, 95 percent of the roughly 6,000 \nfarmers who paid estate taxes that year would have been exempted under \nthe terms of the Democratic plan, as would 88 percent of the roughly \n10,000 small business owners who paid the tax. That responds to my good \nfriends from Texas and Arkansas.\n  I understand they want to protect any tax loophole that is in there. \nWe have a billionaire tax loophole that has permitted billionaires to \nleave the country, renounce their citizenship, and pay no tax at all. \nThey have defended that in the past. The fact is, the wealthiest \nindividuals are still going to get $150 billion in tax breaks.\n  All we are saying is that it is more valuable to invest in the \neducation of the children of this country than to give the 400 richest \nfamilies in this country $250 billion. That is what this amendment \ndoes. The 400 richest families, according to Forbes magazine, get $250 \nbillion; 2,400 families get $300 billion. We are saying, $150 billion \nfor them.\n  We need to get to what is essential to our national interest, and \nthat is children. It is a matter of priorities. They want to protect \nthe billionaires' tax loophole; they want to protect the 400 wealthiest \nfamilies in this country. We want to be debating the minimum wage this \nafternoon. We want to debate education and education funding.\n  This chart shows where the Republican Party has been in the last 7 \nyears on education. I ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nRepublican History of Cutting Education Funding in Appropriations Bills\n\n     Fiscal year 1995 rescission (House bill): -$1.7 billion \n         (below enacted FY 1995)\n     Fiscal year 1996 (House bill): -$3.9 billion (below FY 1995)\n     Fiscal year 1997 (Senate bill): -$3.1 billion (below \n         President's request)\n     Fiscal year 1998 (House and Senate bill): -$200 million \n         (below President's request)\n     Fiscal year 1999 (House bill): -$2 billion (below President's \n         request)\n     Fiscal year 2000 (House bill): -$2.8 billion (below \n         President's request)\n     Fiscal year 2001 (House bill): -$2.9 billion (below \n         President's request)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It shows they have effectively cut education every \nsingle year in either the House appropriations committee or in the \nSenate. The only one who has saved the education budget is President \nClinton. Do you hear that? President Clinton. Respond to these facts.\n  We ought to be debating the elementary and secondary education bill \nthis afternoon. That is what Senator Bingaman wants to do. That is what \nI want to do. But, no; Republicans want to debate a $250 billion cut \nfor 400 of the wealthiest families. That is what we are spending time \ndoing.\n  These are the wrong priorities for America. If we want to get back to \nthe right priorities that are in the Bingaman amendment, Senators will \nvote with him when the time comes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 30 seconds remaining.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. It seems ironic to me when we had the education bill \non the floor of the Senate for 8 days, the amendments offered by the \nother side of the aisle were on health care and campaign finance \nreform. They had nothing to do with education.\n  Now we have elimination of the estate tax bill on the floor of the \nSenate and they want to talk about education. The majority leader has \ndone everything in his power to give an opportunity for legitimate \neducation debate and to pass reauthorizing of ESEA. This is a \ndiversion, and all the protests will not change that fact.\n  The death tax has been repealed in 20 States since 1980. I say to \nSenator Kennedy, I believe the Senate ought to do what his home State \nof Massachusetts did; we ought to abolish it. We ought to eliminate it \nas Oregon, as Vermont, as Canada, as Israel, as Australia. We should \nabolish it--not tinker with it, not play with it, not raise the cap. We \nneed to eliminate it.\n  Senator Kennedy called it the millionaire tax loophole. That is why \nthe Black Chamber of Commerce has endorsed this bill, the Hispanic \nChamber of Commerce, the National Indian Association, and the Pan \nAmerican Chamber of Commerce have endorsed it. We need to abolish the \ndeath tax.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is focused on education. \nIt is an effort to put our priorities straight, to get our priorities \nin line with the priorities of the American people, to get back to \ntalking about how do we improve the lot of the average American, \ninstead of talking about the lot of the 400 wealthiest families in the \ncountry.\n  I believe this will put funds where they are needed the most, where \nthe American people want to see them spent. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on the amendment has expired.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. The pending amendment offered by the Senator from New \nMexico, Mr. Bingaman, will increase the spending by $11 billion. This \nadditional spending would cause the underlying bill to exceed the \nfinance committee section 302(b) allocation. Therefore, I raise a point \nof order pursuant to section 302(f) of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Pursuant to section 904 of the Budget Act, I move to \nwaive the applicable sections of the act for consideration of the \npending amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3829\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nDelaware is recognized to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Roth], for himself, Mr. \n     Breaux, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Robb, Mr. Murkowski, and Ms. \n     Collins, proposes an amendment numbered 3829.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal the \n       excise tax on telephone and other communication services)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n TITLE VI--REPEAL OF EXCISE TAX ON TELEPHONE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS \n                                SERVICES\n\n     SEC. 601. REPEAL OF EXCISE TAX ON TELEPHONE AND OTHER \n                   COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 33 (relating to facilities and \n     services) is amended by striking subchapter B.\n       (b) Conforming Amendments.--\n       (1) Section 4293 is amended by striking ``chapter 32 (other \n     than the taxes imposed by sections 4064 and 4121) and \n     subchapter B of chapter 33,'' and inserting ``and chapter 32 \n     (other than the taxes imposed by sections 4064 and 4121),''.\n       (2)(A) Paragraph (1) of section 6302(e) is amended by \n     striking ``section 4251 or''.\n       (B) Paragraph (2) of section 6302(e) is amended by striking \n     ``imposed by--'' and all that follows through ``with respect \n     to'' and inserting ``imposed by section 4261 or 4271 with \n     respect to''.\n       (C) The subsection heading for section 6302(e) is amended \n     by striking ``Communications Services and''.\n       (3) Section 6415 is amended by striking ``4251, 4261, or \n     4271'' each place it appears and inserting ``4261 or 4271''.\n       (4) Paragraph (2) of section 7871(a) is amended by \n     inserting ``or'' at the end of subparagraph (B), by striking \n     subparagraph (C),\n\n[[Page S6632]]\n\n     and by redesignating subparagraph (D) as subparagraph (C).\n       (5) The table of subchapters for chapter 33 is amended by \n     striking the item relating to subchapter B.\n       (c) Study Regarding Continuing Economic Benefit of \n     Repeal.--\n       (1) Study.--The Comptroller General of the United States, \n     after consultation with the Chairman of the Federal \n     Communications Commission, shall study and identify--\n       (A) the extent to which the benefits of the repeal of the \n     excise tax on telephone and other communication services \n     under subsection (a) are passed through to individual and \n     business consumers, and\n       (B) any actions taken by communication service providers or \n     others that diminish such benefits, including increases in \n     any regulated or unregulated communication service provider \n     charges or increases in other Federal or State fees or taxes \n     related to such service occurring since the date of such \n     repeal.\n       (2) Report.--By not later than September 1, 2001, the \n     Comptroller General of the United States shall submit a \n     report regarding the study described in paragraph (1) to the \n     Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives \n     and the Committee on Finance of the Senate.\n       (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to amounts paid pursuant to bills first rendered \n     after August 31, 2000.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is reminded there are now 20 \nminutes equally, divided, 10 minutes on a side.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the amendment I offer today would repeal the \ntelephone excise tax. My amendment is the same as the bill that was \nrecently approved by the Finance Committee on a bipartisan basis.\n  The phone tax repeal bill that Senator Breaux and I introduced \nearlier this year now has 43 cosponsors--members on both sides of the \naisle. The House of Representatives has already voted to repeal the tax \nby a vote of 420 to 2.\n  Mr. President, all of us who support repeal have recognized that the \ntelephone excise tax is outdated, unfair, and complex for both \nconsumers to understand and for the collectors to administer. It cannot \nbe justified on any tax policy grounds.\n  The federal government has had the American consumer on ``hold'' for \ntoo long when it comes to this tax. The telephone excise tax has been \naround for over 102 years. In fact, it was first imposed in 1898--just \n22 years after the telephone itself was invented.\n  This tax on talking--as it is known--currently stands at 3 percent. \nToday, about 94 percent of all American families have telephone \nservice. That means that virtually every family in the United States \nmust tack an additional 3 percent on their monthly phone bill. The \nFederal tax applies to local phone service; it applies to long distance \nservice; and it even applies in some cases to the extra amounts paid \nfor State and local taxes. It is estimated that this tax costs the \nAmerican public more than $5 billion per year.\n\n  The telephone excise tax is a classic story of a tax that has been \nsevered from its original justifications, but lives on solely to \ncollect money.\n  This tax is a pure money grab by the Federal Government--it does not \npass any of the traditional criteria used for evaluating tax policy. \nFirst, this phone tax is outmoded. Once upon a time, it could have been \nargued that telephone service was a luxury item and that only the rich \nwould be affected. As we all know, there is nothing further from the \ntruth today.\n  Second, the Federal phone tax is unfair. Because this tax is a flat 3 \npercent, it applies disproportionately to low and middle income people. \nFor example, studies show that an American family making less than \n$50,000 per year spends at least 2 percent of its income on telephone \nservice. These families also pay almost 60 percent of the total \ncommunications excise tax in the U.S. Families with incomes of under \n$20,000 earn less than 9 percent of the total income in the U.S.; yet \nthey shoulder almost one-quarter of the total communications tax \nburden. A family earning less than $10,000 per year spends over 9 \npercent of its income on telephone service. Imposing a tax on those \nfamilies for a service that is a necessity in a modern society is \nsimply not fair.\n  Third, the Federal phone tax is complex. Once upon a time, phone \nservice was simple--there was one company who provided it. It was an \neasy tax to administer. Now, however, phone service is intertwined with \ndata services and Internet access, and it brings about a whole new set \nof complexities. For instance, a common way to provide high speed \nInternet access is through a digital subscriber line. This DSL line \nallows a user to have simultaneous access to the Internet and to \ntelephone communications. How should it be taxed? Should the tax be \napportioned? Should the whole line be tax free? And what will we do \nwhen cable, wireless, and satellite companies provide voice and data \ncommunications over the same system? The burdensome complexity of today \nwill only become more difficult tomorrow.\n\n  As these questions are answered, we run the risk of distorting the \nmarket by favoring certain technologies. There are already numerous \nexceptions and carve-outs to the phone tax. For instance, private \ncommunications services are exempt from the tax. That allows large, \nsophisticated companies to establish communications networks and avoid \npaying any Federal phone tax. It goes without saying that American \nfamilies do not have that same option.\n  With new technology, we also may exacerbate the inequities of the tax \nand contribute to the digital divide. For example, consider two \nfamilies that decide it's time to connect their homes to the Internet. \nThe first family installs another phone line for regular Internet \naccess. The second family decides to buy a more expensive, dedicated \nhigh speed line for Internet access. The first family definitely gets \nhit with the phone tax, while the second family may end up paying no \ntax at all on their connection. I can't see any policy rationale for \nthat result.\n  It is time to end the Federal phone tax. For too long while America \nhas been listening to a dial tone, Washington has been hearing a dollar \ntone. This tax is outmoded. It has been here since Alexander Graham \nBell himself was alive. It is unfair. We are today taxing a poor family \nwith a tax that was originally meant for a luxury item. It is complex. \nOnly a communications engineer can today understand the myriad taxes \nlevied on a common phone bill and only the Federal Government has the \nwherewithal to keep track of who and what will be taxed. It is time we \nhung up the phone tax once and for all.\n  Ninety-three million households and 23 million business service \ncompanies are waiting for us to act. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting its repeal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Florida just arrived on the \nfloor. He wishes to speak on this bill. When he is ready, I will yield \nhim the time.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Baucus \nof Montana be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. I make a point of order a quorum is not present.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3824\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I understand we are now debating the \namendment as offered by Senator Roth relative to repeal of the \ntelephone tax. In the absence of anyone wishing to speak further on \nthat issue, I want to offer the next amendment which relates to \nprescription medication.\n  I rise today for myself and Senators Kennedy, Robb, Bryan, Lincoln, \nRockefeller, Daschle, Wellstone, John Kerry, and Dorgan to offer an \namendment which will couple the estate tax, as presented by Senator \nDaschle, with an amendment to the budget resolution which dedicates an \nadditional $40 billion of the new surplus dollars towards a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit.\n  To put this in context, in the budget resolution, $40 billion with \nconditions was inserted for purposes of a Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit. I believe that\n\n[[Page S6633]]\n\nno one will argue with the description of that $40 billion as being an \narbitrary number; that is, it was not a number which was derived by \nsome analysis of what was going to be required to fund an effective \nprescription medication benefit for the first 5 years of its \navailability.\n  I am here with a sense of disappointment. I am disappointed because I \ndo not think the issue of the prominence that is being given to the \nestate tax repeal should be what we are debating on July 13 of the year \n2000. I do not believe the issue of estate tax repeal, whatever \nabsolute value one places upon it, is among the highest priorities of \nthe American people and deserves the kind of time and attention it is \nreceiving today.\n  I am also disappointed that this discussion of the estate tax has, \nfrankly, become a charade. What is happening is that, on each side of \nthe aisle, we are hurling a grenade at the other side on the issue we \nthink is the most popular or politically difficult to vote upon, such \nas the issue of repealing the telephone tax. We ought to be discussing \nwhat is a first priority to Americans, and I happen to believe that in \nthat first tier is the issue of modernization of the Medicare program \nwhich just yesterday celebrated its 35th birthday. Unlike a human being \nwho, after 35 years of life, would have largely grown and matured into \nadulthood, the Medicare program at 35 years of life is still very much \nas it was on the day it was born in 1965.\n\n  One of the areas in which it is still as it was when it was born in \n1965 is the absence of a prescription medication benefit. Virtually \nevery program today which finances the health care of Americans, from \nthe Medicaid program, which is available to indigent Americans, to \nprivate health care financing programs, includes a prescription \nmedication benefit. Medicare stands out as the exception to that rule.\n  What is especially ironic to that exception is that some significant \nthings have happened in the 35 years we have had the Medicare program. \nOne of those things is that the characteristics of the American \nMedicare-eligible population have changed. When Social Security was \nestablished in the 1930s, the average American would only live a few \nyears, generally 7 years or fewer, after they had reached the age of \n65. Today the average American male will live 15 years after he reaches \nthe age of 65, and the average American female will live to be 85. \nThose numbers will dramatically increase during the 21st century as new \nmedical breakthroughs extend the age of life.\n  The significance of that aging process on the Medicare program is \nthat it makes services through Medicare which were irrelevant or \nunnecessary when the program commenced now a center part of American \nhealth care, programs such as prevention of illness, those things we \nnow know how to do to intervene and to avoid a condition degenerating \ninto a fatality.\n  It also fails to adequately cover chronic condition management, which \nis a very typical circumstance for persons who live into their eighties \nor nineties. Both of those, prevention and chronic condition \nmanagement, almost always involve prescription medication as an \nimportant part of the treatment regime, and yet our Medicare program \nfails to provide a prescription medication benefit.\n  I believe if we are going to have a prescription medication benefit--\nand it is critical that we do so--that we also be realistic. Part of \nthat realism is a recognition that this is not going to be an \ninexpensive additional benefit if it is to be meaningful.\n  As an example, the typical private sector health care plan today is \nspending between 15 and 20 percent of its total outlays on prescription \ndrugs. For those programs that focus on persons over the age of 65, the \npercentage for prescription drugs is in excess of 25 percent of all \nexpenditures. Yet with the structure of the program that was adopted in \nthe budget resolution--that is, $40 billion for the first 5 years of \nthe program--this would result in a prescription medication benefit \nthat would represent less than 10 percent of the cost of what we are \nspending on prescription medication.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Therefore, I urge we adopt this amendment which will \nallow us to have a more reasonable allocation of what has become a gush \nof new surplus funds to provide a prescription medication benefit that \nwill be affordable, adequate, humane, and medically appropriate for \nAmerica's older citizens.\n\n  Mr. President, I now send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will withhold, the Senator from \nDelaware still has time remaining on his amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Delaware told me he was not \ngoing to use the time. In the meantime, the Senator from Montana has \nshown up. There is about a minute prior to the amendment being offered. \nThe Senator from Montana is going to speak.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3829\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for this \namendment to repeal federal excise taxes on telephone services.\n  This tax was first introduced as a ``temporary'' luxury tax in 1898 \nto fund the Spanish-American War. However, over 100 years later this \ntax remains in effect. The definition of temporary should not span an \nentire century.\n  This tax is imposed on telephone and other services at a rate of 3 \npercent. Furthermore, these taxes are not applied to a specific purpose \nthat enhances telephone service in our nation--rather these taxes are \ndirected to the general revenue account. In other words, there is no \nreason we should not repeal this tax. Not doing so means only one \nthing--Montanans end up paying one more tax to encourage Government \nspending.\n  As I said a moment ago, this tax was enacted to fund the Spanish-\nAmerican War. Considering that war was ended a mere six months after it \nbegan, I feel it's time to repeal this tax. Instead, Montana consumers \ncontinue to pay this tax on all their telephone services--local, long \ndistance, and wireless.\n  It is time to eliminate this excise tax. At the time of enactment, \nthis tax was considered a luxury tax on the few who owned telephones in \n1898--this tax has now become an unnecessary burden on virtually every \nAmerican taxpayer. Repealing this excise tax on communications services \nwill save consumers over $5 billion annually.\n  Furthermore, this tax is regressive in nature. It disproportionately \nhurts the poor, particularly those households on either fixed or \nlimited incomes. Even the U.S. Treasury Department has concluded in a \n1987 study that the tax ``causes economic distortions and inequities \namong households'' and ``there is no policy rationale for retaining the \ncommunications excise tax.''\n  Rural customers in States like Montana are also disproportionately \nimpacted. This tax is even more of a burden on rural customers due to \nthe fact that they are forced to make more long distance calling \ncomparative to urban customers.\n  This tax also impacts Internet service. The leading reason why \nhouseholds with incomes under $25,000 do not have home Internet access \nis cost. If consumers are very price sensitive, the government should \nnot create disincentives to accessing the Internet. Eliminating this \nburdensome tax can help to narrow the digital divide.\n  This is a tax on talking--a tax on communicating--a tax on our \nNation's economy. I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of \nthis amendment to repeal this unnecessary and burdensome general \nrevenue tax.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we still have time. We have to yield back \nall our time--it is only a few seconds--and then the Senator can send \nhis amendment to the desk.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3824\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3824.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

ADDTIONAL BUDGET RESOURCES FOR A MEDICARE \n                   PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Beneficiaries under the medicare program under title \n     XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) are \n     the only group of insured Americans without prescription drug \n     coverage.\n       (2) At any point in time, approximately 13,000,000 medicare \n     beneficiaries are without prescription drug coverage.\n       (3) Over the course of a year, nearly 20,000,000 medicare \n     beneficiaries are without prescription drug coverage for all \n     or part of the year.\n       (4) The options available to medicare beneficiaries for \n     obtaining prescription drug coverage are declining since--\n       (A) the number of employers providing employer-sponsored \n     retiree coverage is declining at a dramatic rate;\n       (B) Medicare+Choice plans that might otherwise provide \n     prescription drug coverage are pulling out of counties \n     throughout the Nation; and\n       (C) medicare supplemental policies (medigap policies) that \n     offer prescription drug coverage are so prohibitively \n     expensive that only 8 percent of medicare beneficiaries have \n     the means to purchase such policies.\n       (5) An elderly individual without prescription drug \n     coverage living on $12,525 a year (150 percent of the Federal \n     poverty line), who has diabetes, hypertension, and high \n     cholesterol, pays more than 18.3 percent of their total \n     income on the prescription drugs most commonly prescribed to \n     treat their medical conditions.\n       (6) Medicare beneficiaries should never have to make the \n     choice between having a roof over their head, having food in \n     their mouth, or having necessary prescription drugs.\n       (7) Congress must provide medicare beneficiaries with a \n     meaningful medicare prescription drug benefit that--\n       (A) is universal and affordable;\n       (B) guarantees stable coverage for medicare beneficiaries \n     receiving benefits through the original fee-for-service \n     program or through enrollment in a Medicare+Choice plan; and\n       (C) provides real low-income and stop-loss protections.\n       (8) Meaningful prescription drug coverage includes stop-\n     loss protection above $4,000 of out-of-pocket expenses for \n     prescription drugs.\n       (9) In March 2000, the Congressional Budget Office \n     estimated the on-budget surplus for the 5-year period of \n     fiscal year 2001 through fiscal year 2005 to be \n     $148,000,000,000, assuming that discretionary spending was \n     allowed to increase with inflation.\n       (10) Relying on the March 2000 estimate of the \n     Congressional Budget Office, on April 12, 2000, Congress \n     passed the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \n     year 2001 which allocated $40,000,000,000 of the estimated \n     on-budget surplus for the 5-year period described in \n     paragraph (9) to provide a prescription drug benefit for \n     medicare beneficiaries.\n       (11) Forty billion dollars over 5 years cannot ensure \n     access to a meaningful medicare prescription drug benefit \n     that--\n       (A) is universal and affordable;\n       (B) guarantees stable coverage for medicare beneficiaries \n     receiving benefits through the original fee-for-service \n     program or through enrollment in a Medicare+Choice plan; and\n       (C) provides real low-income and stop-loss protections.\n       (12) Congress should not be bound to an arbitrarily low and \n     inadequate allocation for providing a medicare prescription \n     drug benefit when the estimated on-budget surplus for the 5-\n     year period described in paragraph (9) has increased \n     dramatically since March 2000.\n       (13) The Office of Management and Budget recently has \n     revised its estimates for the on-budget surplus for the 5-\n     year period described in paragraph (9) and now estimates that \n     the on-budget surplus will be $360,000,000,000 for such \n     period.\n       (14) The Congressional Budget Office will issue its revised \n     budget estimates in the next few days and those estimates are \n     widely expected to reflect a significant increase in the on-\n     budget surplus for the 5-year period described in paragraph \n     (9) as compared to the on-budget surplus that was estimated \n     for such period in March 2000.\n       (b) 2001 Budget Resolution Amendment.--Section 213(b) of H. \n     Con. Res. 290 (106th Congress) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(b) Adjustments.--The chairman of the Committee on the \n     Budget of the House or Senate, as applicable--\n       ``(1) shall revise committee allocations and other \n     appropriate budgetary levels and limits to accommodate \n     legislation described in section 215(a) which improves access \n     to prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries in an \n     additional amount of $40,000,000,000 or the difference \n     between the on-budget surpluses in the reports referred to in \n     subsection (a), whichever is less; and\n       ``(2) may, after the adjustment in paragraph (1), make the \n     following adjustments in an amount not to exceed the \n     difference between the on-budget surpluses in the reports \n     referred to in subsection (a) minus the adjustment made \n     pursuant to paragraph (1):\n       ``(A) Reduce the on-budget revenue aggregate by that amount \n     for such fiscal year.\n       ``(B) Adjust the instruction in section 103 or 104 to--\n       ``(i) increase the reduction in revenues by that amount for \n     fiscal year 2001;\n       ``(ii) increase the reduction in revenues by the sum of the \n     amounts for the period of fiscal years 2001 through 2005; and\n       ``(iii) in the House only, increase the amount of debt \n     reduction by that amount for fiscal year 2001.\n       ``(C) Adjust such other levels in this resolution, as \n     appropriate and the Senate pay-as-you-go scorecard.''.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, what we are about is to authorize that $40 \nbillion of the new surplus which has come into the Federal Government \nand is projected to come over the next 5 years to be dedicated to the \nprescription medication benefit. This would allow for a total of $80 \nbillion to be committed to this program.\n  The result of that will be to bring the scale of the prescription \nmedication benefit, as a totality of the Medicare program, somewhat \ninto line with what other health care programs are spending on \nprescription medications today.\n  The reality is that prescription medications have been the fastest \ngrowing sector of American health care, increasing at a rate of 15 to \n20 percent a year. The fact is, with the new breakthroughs in \nprescription medication,\n\n[[Page S6635]]\n\nthere is likely to be further escalation of prescription medication \ncosts.\n  We have incorporated in the bill that has been introduced, and which \nwould be supported by this allocation of additional funds, that annual \nincrease in the expected rate of prescription medication costs. It is \nour hope that through some of the procedures in this legislation--such \nas the encouragement for the use of generic drugs, the use of an \nintermediary called a pharmacy benefits manager, and multiple managers \nso that there will be competition between the pharmaceutical company \nand the Medicare beneficiary who is using those drugs--there will be \nefforts to restrain the enormous explosion in cost of prescription \nmedication.\n  But I would have to honestly say to my colleagues that there is every \nindication the prescription medication will continue to be a rapidly \ngrowing source of medical expenditures.\n  I take this occasion to commend Senator Roth, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, for the legislation which he has, this week, \noutlined to the committee and to the American people. I think it is a \nvery constructive contribution toward the goal of arriving at a \nprescription medication benefit that will serve the almost 40 million \nAmericans who depend upon Medicare for their health care financing.\n  I suggest that if we had a more realistic allocation for the purpose \nof prescription medication, the proposal that Senator Roth made would \nbe even more advantageous to Medicare beneficiaries. Thus, I hope this \namendment will be adopted and will give us the basis for a continuing \ndialog and discussion, leading to a prescription medication benefit \nthat will serve America's needs.\n  One of the things that Senator Roth has done in his proposal, which I \nthink is especially significant, is to recognize that prescription \ndrugs are a central part of a modern health care system. Some other \nproposals, particularly those emanating from the other Chamber, have \ntreated prescription drugs as if they were the red-headed third cousin \nat the family picnic --something that is still outside the main circle \nof appropriate health care.\n  The fact is, in modern medicine, prescription drugs are a \ncenterpiece, particularly as we make what I think is the most \nsignificant reform in the 35-year history of Medicare, and that is to \nmove it from a program which was exclusively acute care--one that would \nprovide extensive and very effective medical services if you had a \ndramatic incidence, such as a disease or an accident, but had almost no \norientation towards trying to keep you healthy through effective \nprevention measures --to me it is that movement from essentially a \nsickness plan to a wellness plan that is the most fundamental reform \nwhich Medicare must make now in its 35th year. And key to being able to \ndo that is the inclusion of prescription medication.\n\n  Is this $40 billion that we are discussing an unrealistic number? \nWell, let me just give you these numbers. When we started this budget \nyear, the assumption was that we would be dealing with a non-Social \nSecurity surplus, over the next 5 years, of $95 billion. We allocated \n$40 billion of that $95 billion to prescription drugs, or roughly 42 \npercent of the total non-Social Security surplus, for 5 years, was \ncommitted to this single purpose of financing a prescription drug \nbenefit.\n  It is now estimated that when the next non-Social Security surplus, \nfor 5 years, is calculated, it will be more in the range of $350 to \n$400 billion. We have had approximately a quadrupling of the non-Social \nSecurity surplus as a result of the strong economy from which we all so \nbenefit.\n  Is it not appropriate, out of that additional $300 billion, to take \nanother $40 billion and use it so that we can finance a prescription \nmedication benefit at approximately the same level that private sector \nhealth care plans are financing prescription medication in terms of a \npercentage of total health care expenditures?\n  We are expending, this year, about $280 billion on Medicare. This \nbenefit will add about $25 billion a year--half of which is the Federal \ncomponent, half of which is the beneficiary's monthly payment. So we \nnow will have a program with slightly over $300 billion. If we stay \nwith that $25 billion number, we will have less than 10 percent of the \ntotal Medicare program to be in prescription drugs, while private \nhealth insurance for persons over 65 are spending 25 percent or more.\n  By adding this additional $40 billion, we will double that percentage \nto approximately 18 to 19 percent of total Medicare expenditures, which \nI think is the range that is going to be required in order to finance a \nreasonable, affordable, medically appropriate prescription medication \nbenefit for America's older citizens.\n  Mr. President, I offer this amendment and urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I will speak for a minute--the time \nremaining allocated to the Senator from Florida--in support of his \namendment.\n  The resources that were allocated to the Budget Committee were simply \ninsufficient to deal with the problem of providing adequate \nprescription drug coverage under Medicare. This particular amendment \nwill make it possible to provide adequate, affordable, available \nprescription drug coverage to our seniors. We cannot do it under the \nconstraints of the current amendment.\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee has offered a good faith effort \nto try to resolve that problem but is constrained by taking away from \nPart A and Part B, causing beneficiaries to have to make a choice. They \nshould not have to make that choice. They should not have to make the \nchoice between food and medicine.\n  This will give us an opportunity to solve a problem that is long \noverdue. With the robust condition of the economy, we finally have an \nopportunity to do it. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of the \namendment offered by the Senator from Florida.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 7 minutes 3 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to support this amendment that would provide tax relief for \nfarmers, ranchers, and other small business owners.\n  This amendment contains several provisions that are very popular \namong the Nation's farming and small business communities. Among those \nprovisions is a bill I introduced in January along with over 40 of my \nSenate colleagues on both sides of the aisle. This bill, S. 2005, the \nInstallment Tax Correction Act of 2000, would allow small businesses to \npay the capital gains on the sale of their business over the term of \nthe sale rather than in one lump sum at the time of the sale.\n  Without this provision, the sales of small businesses will be \ndisrupted or scrapped altogether. Many sales of small businesses use \nthe installment sales method. This amendment will allow small business \nowners the opportunity to defer over the period of payments the capital \ngains tax on the sale of their business. We're not talking about major \ncorporations--rather, we are talking about small businesses that \nsupport a community.\n  This amendment will ensure that action is taken on this issue this \nyear and also ensure that the present or future sales of small \nbusinesses are not adversely affected by this legislation.\n  This amendment also contains several other tax relief measures for \nour Nation's farmers and ranchers. The amendment will not only create \nsavings for farmers but also encourage savings for farmers to be used \nfor future.\n  The agricultural community is in a crisis. These are the men and \nwomen\n\n[[Page S6636]]\n\nthat produce our Nation's food products. It is important that we do all \nwe can to help relieve these families of the burdens based on the \nunique fluctuations in agriculture. While a farmer may have a banner \nyear, his next may be devastated by hail, disease or price.\n  Mr. President, I can tell you that prices for agricultural products \nhave hit rock bottom and there is no sign of improvement.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the small business owner by \nsupporting this amendment.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am going to make a point of order very \nshortly. I think the Parliamentarian will agree that it will be granted \nunless a motion is made. They are going to have to have 60 votes to \nwaive it. It is good on the part of the Senate to have such rules.\n  To give a little history, in the Budget Committee we were talking \nabout $20 billion for Medicare over the next 5 years. My recollection \nis that the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg, \noffered an amendment and they took it all the way to $35 billion. A \nlittle while later in the process, with Senator Wyden helping, a \nbipartisan approach was taken in the committee and we said $40 \nbillion--$20 billion if you don't get any reform and $40 billion if you \nget some reform--in the first 5 years.\n  Everybody should know that the President asked for $31 billion. The \nbudget resolution provides $20 billion plus $20 billion, which is $40 \nbillion. And then, everybody should know that the President's proposal \ndoesn't take effect for 3 years, until 2003. All of a sudden, when the \nyear is about over, we have somebody proposing not to spend the $35 \nbillion that Senator Lautenberg wanted, not the $40 billion that the \nbipartisan Senators did in a budget resolution, which everybody thought \nwas a very wonderful idea--in fact, Senator Snowe and Senator Wyden led \nthat in the committee, as I recall; is that correct, I ask Senator \nNickles?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It was their proposal. Now they say forget about all \nthat; they want $80 billion. We want to rewrite a budget resolution in \nJuly of the year, instead of months ago when we were writing budget \nresolutions. All of a sudden, they want $80 billion set aside for \nMedicare and prescription drugs.\n  If ever a point of order was not only correct under the law, but, \nsubstantively speaking, right, so that we don't spend the whole \nMedicare fund and end up with more burdens on the fund than we can pay \nfor, and have some prescription drug program that starts 3 years from \nnow, it is now.\n  I feel very comfortable in saying to the Senate that you ought to \nstick with the Budget Act and the budget process. In the end, the \nseniors will be glad you did because their children will be protected. \nThere will be a Medicare program around for an awful long time, and we \nwill reform it in a way that can be sustained, that we can afford, and \nof which everybody will be proud.\n  If I have any time before I make the point of order, I yield it to \nSenator Nickles.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee. He is exactly right. The President's original proposal \nrequested $15 billion. Then he came back and said $31 billion. The \nBudget Committee started at $20 billion and ended up at $40 billion. \nNow people are saying we need $80 billion. We don't know what the \nprogram is. We have no idea how much it costs. We have no idea if it is \nduplicating coverage already in the private sector. It makes no sense \nwhere a program is not going to be effective for 3 years. That may be \ngood politics, but it is fiscally irresponsible. I join my colleague in \nhis point of order.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I make a point of order that this \nviolates section 306 of the Budget Act because it tries to rewrite the \nbudget resolution on a tax bill.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsection of the act for the consideration of the pending amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered, and the vote will be placed in the \nsequence.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, was the Senator from New Mexico speaking \non the opposition's time on our amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I assume so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on the amendment has expired.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3834\n\n  (Purpose: To provide tax relief for farmers, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley], for himself, Mr. \n     Craig, Mr. Burns, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Brownback, and Mr. Grams, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3834.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself 6 minutes. I want to \nreserve 4 minutes for other people who want to speak on my amendment.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I'm offering on behalf of myself and \nothers will assist millions of farmers across the Nation. In the midst \nof one of the worst farming crises we've seen, in addition to the \nestate tax repeal, it seems to me we ought to be doing everything we \ncan to help farmers survive.\n  The package of measures included in this tax relief amendment include \nthe following:\n  FARRM accounts. These farmer savings accounts would allow farmers to \ncontribute up to 20 percent of their income in an account, and deduct \nit in the same year. FARRM accounts would be a very important ``risk \nmanagement'' tool that will help farmers put away money when there's \nactual income, so that, in the really bad times, there will be a safety \nnet.\n  This measure has strong bipartisan support and was actually sent to \nthe President last year as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act that the \nPresident vetoed.\n  Reversing the unfair IRS decisions on self-employment tax for \nfarmers. Farmers who participate in the Conservation Reserve Program \nare unnecessarily struggling during tax season because of a recent case \npushed by the IRS. The latest 6th Circuit Court's ruling treats CRP as \nfarm income subject to the additional self employment tax rate of 15 \npercent. Senator Brownback has taken the lead on fixing this problem. \nThis unfair tax not only ignores the intent of Congress in creating the \nCRP, it discourages farmers from using environmentally pro-active \nmeasures. At a time when farmers are struggling to regain their footing \neconomically and do the right thing environmentally, it's important \nthat Congress support them by upholding its promise on CRP.\n  In addition, this amendment includes an effort I've been leading to \nreverse an IRS attempt to apply the self-employment tax on farmer's \ncash rental income.\n  A tax deduction for farmers to donate to food banks. Senator Lugar \nhas led the effort to expand the current program where companies can \ndonate to food banks, so that farmers can donate surplus food directly \nto needy food banks. This will be a win for the farmers and a big win \nfor people who depend on food bank assistance.\n  Income averaging for farmers who are caught in the alternative \nminimum tax. This was also part of last year's vetoed bill. When we \npassed income averaging for farmers a few years ago, we neglected to \ntake into account the problem of running into the alternative minimum \ntax, which many farmers are facing now. Our amendment will fix this \ngrowing problem.\n  Expansion of first-time farmer loans, or Aggie bonds. Our amendment \nexpands opportunities for beginning farmers who are in need of low \ninterest rate loans for capital purchases of farmland and equipment. \nCurrent law permits state authorities to issue tax\n\n[[Page S6637]]\n\nexempt bonds and to loan the proceeds from the sale of the bonds to \nbeginning farmers and ranchers to finance the cost of acquring land, \nbuildings and equipment used in a farm or ranch operation.\n  Unfortunately, Aggie bonds are subjected to a volume cap and must \ncompete with big industrial projects for bond allocation. Aggie bonds \nshare few similarities to industrial revenue bonds and should not be \nsubjected to the volume cap established for IRBs. Insufficient \nallocation of funding due to the volume cap limits the effectiveness of \nthis program. We can't stand by and allow the next generation of \nfarmers to lose an opportunity to participate in farming because of \ncompetition with industry for reduced interest loan rates.\n  Repeal of the installment method for certain small businesses. Our \namendment would repeal a law that was passed at the end of last year \nthat's had a very negative effect on the small business community. \nRepeal of this draconian installment sales method is one of small \nbusiness's biggest priorities.\n  Farmer co-op initiatives. Recently the IRS determined that some \ncooperatives should be exposed to a regular corporate tax due to the \nfact that they are using organic value-added practices rather than \nmanufactured value-added practices. This is unfair, and needs to be \nfixed.\n  In addition, we want to allow small cooperative producers of ethanol \nto be able to receive the same tax benefits as large companies. Our \namendment addresses these problems.\n  So, Mr. President, our amendment would do more for the American \nfarmer regarding taxes than any measure in recent memory. I know others \nwant to speak, so I would urge Members to strongly support this \nmeasure. It is an amendment that should have unanimous support.\n  I yield to the Senator from Minnesota 1\\1/5\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, current law provides for an income tax \ncredit of 10 cents per gallon for up to 15 million gallons of annual \nethanol production by a small ethanol producer. A small ethanol \nproducer is one defined as having a production capacity of less than 30 \nmillion gallons per year. The credit was enacted as part of the Omnibus \nBudget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and championed by our former \ncolleague, Senator Bob Dole. Unfortunately, the credit was enacted at a \ntime when the growth and shape of the ethanol industry was still \ndifficult to predict.\n  This situation has led to an unfortunate situation in my state and in \nother areas where farmer-owned cooperatives have been unable to access \nthe credit due to the way in which the original legislation was \ndrafted. The original legislation certainly envisioned these small, \nfarmer-owned cooperatives as being eligible for the tax credit, but the \nrealities of the tax code have made it impossible for them to do so.\n  There are currently 22 cooperative ethanol plants in the United \nStates. Twelve of them are located in Minnesota. Eleven of these \nMinnesota cooperatives involve over 5,000 farmers and their families. \nMinnesota cooperatives are able to produce roughly 189 million gallons \nof ethanol per year.\n  My language would simply correct the provision of the law that shuts \nout these farmer-owned cooperatives from the complete benefit of the \nsmall ethanol producer tax credit.\n  I want to again stress that this language is consistent with the \noriginal intent of the 1990 law that created the small ethanol producer \ntax credit. Farmer-owned cooperatives were never intended to be \nexcluded from receiving the benefits of the tax credit if they produce \nless than 30 million gallons and I believe it's time the Congress \nstepped in and clarified the law.\n  The ethanol industry in Minnesota and across the country is one we \nshould promote. Ethanol is a crucial product for rural America, for our \nnation as a whole, and especially for Minnesota. I'd like to point out \njust a few of ethanol's impressive benefits--environmentally and \neconomically. According to the Minnesota Corn Growers, ethanol \nproduction boosts nationwide employment by over 195,000 jobs. Ethanol \nimproves our trade balance by $2 billion and adds $450 million to state \ntax receipts. It reduces emissions from gasoline use and therefore \nhelps us clean up the environment.\n  According to the American Coalition for Ethanol, more than $3 billion \nhas been invested in 43 ethanol facilities in 20 states. Those \ninvestments have directly created 40,000 jobs and more than $12.6 \nbillion in increased income over the next five years.\n  Minnesota is now home to over a dozen operating ethanol plants with a \ncapacity of over 200 million gallons annually. These plants mean new \njobs with good wages and good benefits for people living in rural areas \nwhere these plants are built. According to a report by the Minnesota \nLegislative Auditor, those plants, and the resulting economic activity, \nare expected to create as many as 5,000 new, high-wage jobs--including \njobs in production, construction, and support industries.\n  In addition to its positive economic impacts, ethanol production \nallows our nation to move away from our dependence on foreign energy \nsources. The United States Department of Agriculture estimates that for \nevery gallon of ethanol produced domestically, we displace seven \ngallons of imported oil. Ethanol plays a role in increasing our \nnational energy security by providing a stable, homegrown, renewable \nenergy supply. Ethanol is estimated to reduce our demand for foreign \noil by 98,000 barrels per day.\n  Those are just some of the reasons why I urge my colleagues to join \nSenator Grassley and me in allowing small, farmer-owned cooperatives to \nenjoy the full benefits of the small ethanol producer tax credit.\n  I thank Senator Grassley for including this provision, which I had \nplanned to introduce separately, in his package of important tax relief \nfor farmers. As one who has sponsored similar legislation providing tax \nrelief for farmers, I strongly support his amendment and have asked to \nbe a cosponsor. I appreciate the Senator from Iowa's efforts in support \nof our nation's farmers and all of rural America.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield 1\\1/5\\ minutes to Senator Lugar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this amendment \naimed at providing tax relief to America's farmers.\n  I want to highlight and share my strong enthusiasm for one provision \ncontained as part of this amendment aimed at encouraging farmers, \nranchers and other small businesses to donate food to hunger relief \norganizations. This language is taken from bipartisan legislation I \nintroduced earlier this year--S. 2084, the Hunger Relief Tax Incentive \nAct.\n  Current law provides corporations with a special deduction for \ndonations to food banks, but it excludes farmers, ranchers and \nrestaurant owners from donating food under the same tax incentive. This \nlanguage would address this inequity by extending the deduction to all \nbusiness taxpayers and by increasing the deduction to the fair market \nvalue of the donation.\n  While recently visiting food banks in Indiana, I met a Hoosier apple \nfarmer who donates several hundred bushels of apples annually, despite \nthe lack of a tax deduction for his actions. Because of labor and \ntransportation costs, it would have been more cost effective to throw \nthe food away. This should not be the case. Our tax laws should reward \ncharitable giving, not discourage it.\n  Citizens have moved off of welfare, but not out of poverty. A \nDecember 1999 study by the U.S. Conference of Mayors found that \nrequests for emergency food assistance increased by an average of 18 \npercent in American cities over the previous year and that 21 percent \nof emergency food requests could not be met. I can personally attest to \nthis increased need after recently visiting the Tri-State Food Bank in \nEvansville, Gleaners Food Bank in Indianapolis, and Community Harvest \nFood Bank in Ft. Wayne.\n  This language, which enjoys broad support in the Senate, would be an \neffective private sector approach to addressing hunger. It has the \nendorsement of several hunger relief, food, and agricultural \norganizations, including the American Farm Bureau, the National Farmers \nUnion, the National Restaurant Association, America's Second Harvest \nFood Banks, and the Salvation Army.\n\n[[Page S6638]]\n\n  I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in \nsupport of this amendment that benefits our farmers and our food banks.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am here, along with Senator Baucus, as \nwell as Senator Dorgan, Senator Breaux, and Senator Robb, to talk about \nrescission of the estate tax that we think needs to be addressed. I \nbelieve the estate tax is unfair.\n  I worked with Senator Kyl of Arizona to write a bill to eliminate the \nestate tax, along with a stepped-up basis for capital gains which I \nthink is reasonable.\n  Unfortunately, there are two problems I have with the legislation. \nOne is that I see many other provisions in the Tax Code that I also \ndon't think are fair. I think the payroll tax is too high.\n  If you ask me what the No. 1 item is in terms of eliminating, I would \nlike to see the payroll tax reduced. I think it is too high. It is a \nbarrier to savings. It especially falls very hard on those Americans to \nwhom we are trying to give the most opportunity. I would like to see \nfull deductibility of health insurance.\n  There are a lot of things that I would like to see done. But I have \nto measure the cost of those against the budget itself to try to \nmaintain the fiscal discipline we have had since 1993.\n  As a consequence, I think what Senator Daschle has proposed as an \nalternative is reasonable.\n  In addition to that, if we are going to help 2 percent of Americans, \nit is very important for us to pay attention and try to help the 98 \npercent of Americans who do not have any estate. Senator Baucus has a \nproposal that will do just that.\n  The proposal that I want to talk about a bit is a proposal called \nKidSave that will similarly help 98 percent of the population of \nAmerican citizens who head toward old age and have no estate beyond \n$650,000 that can be taxed under any circumstances, which is rather \nshocking when you consider how easy it is to accumulate $650,000.\n\n  The proposal I have, and I have talked about it before--in fact, I \nworked with Republicans as well to refine and improve it--is called \nKidSave. It is based on a very simple mathematical certainty; that is, \nif you want to accumulate wealth, the most important variable is the \nlength of time over which you save. KidSave opens an account, \nadministered by the Social Security Administration, but very similar to \nwhat we have with the Thrift Savings Plan. It opens an account of \n$1,000 at birth. If you contribute $500 in the first 5 years, you have \n$3,500 at age 5; and over the next 55 years, that $3,500 is using \ncompounding interest rates.\n  The investment strategy is similar to the Thrift Savings Plan. \nMembers have not only invested in it ourselves, we have employees \ninvested in it. We become very excited about what it can do for \nindividuals. For example, the C Fund we have available, over the last \n12 years, has averaged an 18-percent compounded rate of return. It is \nlower if you pick a bond fund, lower than that if you pick a Treasury \nbond fund. The idea it is unsafe is an idea that doesn't make any sense \nto our employees who operate and live under that program. It gives them \na chance to have something when they head towards retirement that \nprovides them with real security--and that is wealth.\n  Members will find, talking to people who are concerned about the \nestate tax, as I have--and I think the estate tax is unfair; you can't \njustify 55-percent taxation especially when you bring the stepped-up \nbasis in--when we talk to people, it provides them with a sense of \nsecurity. It is not Social Security, but the wealth that accumulates \nprovides them with a sense of security.\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I know the \ndebate is not heading in that direction, unfortunately. We are \nbasically going to have a series of amendments which will go to the \nPresident, and he will veto the darn thing and we have our political \nissues.\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are \nconcerned about the impact on 2 percent of the population, what Senator \nBaucus and Senator Dorgan and Senator Breaux and myself are trying to \nsay is, let's express simultaneously a concern for that 98 percent of \nAmerican people who are working and have no prospect right now of \naccumulating an estate in excess of $650,000. It is not a gamble. It is \na mathematical certainty. If these accounts are opened early enough and \ncontinued over a course of a working life, every single individual in \nAmerica could head towards retirement knowing that they, too, are going \nto have a sufficient estate to pass on to their heirs. Not only is it \nrespectable, but it will give them security, as well.\n  I understand there are concerns with KidSave. We worked with \nRepublicans to try to improve it, try to make certain that it \naccommodates some ideological concerns. I am willing to continue doing \nthat effort. If we are going to be concerned that 2 percent of the \npopulation would have to pay estate taxes on estates in excess of \n$650,000, I believe this Senate should be similarly concerned about 98 \npercent of the population that heads towards retirement in older age \nwith estates that are under $650,000.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, might I make the point that the \nprovision that the Senator from Nebraska is offering is part of S. 21, \na bill that we introduced in the first session of the 106th Congress \nalmost 2 years ago. It was a bill to reduce Social Security payroll \ntaxes, provide KidSave, and provide for those who wish to take the \noption, a 2-percent thrift savings plan equivalent throughout their \nworking years to provide wealth.\n  The Senator has a powerful idea. We have provided security in the \ncourse of a long century, beginning with workman's compensation, \nwidows' pension, and then Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid. \nBut we have never been able to provide a great portion of our \npopulation, that which distinguishes this Nation, with a measure of \nwealth, an estate. Not an estate which would be much affected by the \nunderlying bill we are talking about today. Not many $4 million estates \nwould be acquired in the process, but there would be a measure of \nwealth.\n  It would be the first American initiative in the area of social \nwelfare. This starts right here in this Chamber, S. 21. The first 20 \nnumbers are reserved for the majority and minority leaders; the first \nbill otherwise in this Senate is this provision. We have not got to it \nin committee, but we have a part here on the floor. I welcome it.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I appreciate that. When I talk of the \nestate tax, understanding there could be genuine differences of \nopinion--and the distinguished Senator from New York likes the estate \ntax. I look at it and I think it is unfair. I hear people say it only \naffects 2 percent of the population. I say 2 percent are getting the \nshaft. We ought to still try to help them, whether they are wealthy or \nnot. I don't like the tax.\n  What is more startling to me is 98 percent of the population do not \nhave an estate over $650,000. Think about that, if $1,000 at birth, \ncompounded at 10 percent, produces $650,000.\n  I am not arguing that will happen over 60 years, but if you look at \nthe Thrift Savings Plan, it has compounded at 18 percent in the C fund \nover the last 12 years. It is a remarkable rate of return. It is \nabsolutely certain. If we want to help the 98 percent that don't have \nestates over $650,000, it is absolutely a mathematical certainty that \nwe can do it. One cannot wait until 55. One cannot wait until 65. One \ncannot wait even until 45. Start early. The earliest possible moment is \nat birth. Open these accounts at birth and contribute early.\n  One objection I heard on the other side is it ought to be an \n``earned'' entitlement. We worked with heritage to make it earned \nentitlement. I am willing to do that. If you understand compounding \ninterest rates, and if you are startled not by the fact that only 2 \npercent have estates over $650,000 but\n\n[[Page S6639]]\n\nthat 98 percent haven't reached $650,000--that is a startling number; \nit is not good. Inside of a liberal democracy in a free market system \nsuch as ours, it is not good because we have the rich getting richer \nand the poor getting poorer. Not because the rich are doing anything \nbad. I am not saying they are at fault.\n  What is happening relative to the wealth being generated in America, \npeople without wealth are getting poorer. Raising the minimum wage and \nexpanding the EATC--both of which I favor--do not address the problem \nof wealth. That is income. In order to address wealth, we have to do it \nin a different fashion.\n  I hope during this estate tax debate we not only notice that only 2 \npercent have estates over $650,000, but 98 percent don't, and we begin \nin an urgent and serious fashion to address that problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Kansas for \nspeaking on his portion of my amendment.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Iowa for \nrecognizing me for this portion of the bill. The portion of the bill I \nhave is a bill that I, along with Senator Daschle, have introduced, \nwith 32 other cosponsors, called the Conservation Reserve Program Tax \nFairness Act. What it would do is keep conservation reserve program \npayments from being subject to self-employment tax.\n  Unfortunately, a circuit court in this country determined that these \nCRP payments are subject to that. This removes that. That is in the \nbill. That is why I support my colleague from Iowa and urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself a final 30 seconds to ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter in support of \nthe amendment from the American Farm Bureau Federation.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              American Farm Bureau Federation,\n\n                                    Washington, DC. July 13, 2000.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: Farm Bureau supports a proposed \n     amendment to add several key agricultural tax provisions to \n     H.R. 8, the Death Tax Elimination Act of 2000. Included in \n     this amendment is the creation of Farm and Ranch Risk \n     Management Accounts (FARRM accounts), repeal of self-\n     employment taxes on farmland rental, and clarification that \n     farm income averaging does not trigger the Alternative \n     Minimum Tax (AMT).\n       Using a FARRM Account, producers would be able to save up \n     to 20 percent of net farm income in a tax-deferred account \n     where the funds could be held in reserve for up to five years \n     for financial emergencies. Unpredictable weather and \n     uncontrollable markets impact supply and demand making farm \n     income difficult to predict. Serious financial problems can \n     arise when agricultural producers are unable to cover \n     expenses with current income. Farmers and ranchers need \n     financial management tools that encourage savings as a means \n     of stabilizing their incomes.\n       Recent Internal Revenue Service (IRS) activities have \n     wrongly broadened the application of the self-employment tax. \n     Until 1996, farmers and ranchers paid the 15.3 percent self-\n     employment tax on income from labor and employment as \n     intended by Congress. In that year, a tax court case expanded \n     the tax to include income from the cash rental of farmland. \n     This was done even though the tax code does not generally \n     require nonagricultural property owners to pay self-\n     employment tax on cash rental receipts.\n       Congress enacted three-year averaging for farm and ranch \n     income in 1997 to protect agriculture producers from \n     excessively high tax rates in profitable year. The intended \n     benefits of income averaging, however, are being eroded by \n     the imposition of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) which \n     limits tax savings for farmers and ranchers. Producers most \n     at risk, those whose incomes vary greatly from year to year, \n     are hurt most by AMT-imposed limits on farm and ranch income \n     averaging.\n       Farm Bureau urges your support for the agricultural tax \n     amendment to H.R. 8. Thank you for your consideration.\n                                                     Bob Stallman,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, No. 2, I remind people the farmer \nsavings accounts give the farmers an opportunity to level out years of \nhigh income versus years of low income. Very seldom, because of nature, \ncan the farmers control their productivity to any great extent, so they \nhave these peaks and valleys. This gives the family farmer an \nopportunity to manage his income to a greater extent.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3835\n\n (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the \n   unified credit exemption and the qualified family-owned business \n     interest deduction, to provide a refundable credit to certain \n   individuals for elective deferrals and IRA contributions, and to \n   provide an incentive to small business to establish and maintain \n qualified pension plans, to amend the Social Security Act to provide \n  each American child with a KidSave Account, and for other purposes)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus], for himself, Mr. \n     Kerrey, Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. Robb, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3835.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is an amendment to help people who \nare not now putting aside money for their retirement. It is combined \nwith measures previously addressed by the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. \nKerrey, with respect to KidSave. It is a combined amendment along with \nthe Democratic estate tax alternative. So, like other Democratic \namendments, this replaces the estate tax provisions in the House bill \nwith the estate tax relief in the Democratic alternative.\n\n  As I said before, there are two reasons we have our Democratic \nalternative. One, it provides more relief more quickly to the folks who \nreally need it; that is, our family businesses, small businesses, \nranchers and farmers; and the second part of the basic Democratic \nalternative amendment is it puts the $40 billion that is saved, \ncompared with the House-passed bill, to better use. Instead of \nproviding further estate tax relief for the few individuals who, by any \nmeasure, are very well off--that is, the top portion of the 2 percent--\nwe decided to encourage middle-class families to do more to provide for \ntheir own retirement.\n  We give every child a stake in the American dream. Senator Kerrey \nmentioned the phenomenon of compounding interest. The rule of thumb is \nthat, if you earn 7 percent interest, your money will double every 10 \nyears, at 10 percent interest, your money doubles every 7 years. You \ncan imagine the magic of compounding over a child's lifetime. Senator \nKerrey has eloquently described that portion of the amendment.\n  I will explain the portion that is the incentive for retirement \nsaving. Why do we need an incentive? Let me start by pointing out that \nSocial Security is the primary source of income for two-thirds of \nelderly Americans. We have to stop and think about that just a second. \nSocial Security is the primary source of income for two-thirds of \nelderly Americans. That is, they do not have other sources of income \nthat amount to very much. In fact, it is the only source of income for \nabout 16 percent of the elderly. For 16 percent, it is the only source.\n  Those of us who offer this amendment believe, of course, we must \nprotect Social Security. I think everyone in this Chamber agrees with \nthat statement. But I also believe that is not enough. We must \ncomplement Social Security by helping people set additional savings \naside because Social Security is not enough. Otherwise, there are far \ntoo many Americans who will spend their retirement years just one step \naway from poverty.\n  So our goal is to increase pension savings, retirement savings, in \naddition to the Social Security program. That is partly because America \nis not a nation of savers. We have seen all the statistics. Personal \nsavings rates have continually declined in this country. One-half of \nall Americans have less than $10,000 set aside for retirement. Let me \nrepeat that. One-half of all Americans have less than $10,000 set aside \nfor retirement. Obviously, we need more.\n\n[[Page S6640]]\n\n  Part of the solution is pension and IRA reform. Senator Roth of \nDelaware has done wonderful work helping this Nation develop better IRA \nprograms. In fact, we have an IRA program named after him, the Roth \nIRA. And I have worked with Senators Graham and Grassley on reform for \nemployer-sponsored pension plans. But pension and IRA reform are not \nthe complete solution. After all, pension reform encourages people who \nare already saving to save a little more. We also need to give people \nwho are not saving anything now--middle- and lower-income people, an \nincentive to save as well. That is people who are working hard, playing \nby the rules, but still struggling to make ends meet--which is most \nAmericans, if truth were known--those folks with less than $10,000 set \naside for retirement.\n  That is what our retirement savings amendment would do. It would help \nin two separate ways: First, it provides a refundable tax credit to \nmatch the savings of middle-income workers and spouses. It phases out \nonce the income gets higher, but it is focused on lower and middle \nincome--and I mean middle income, because it phases out with incomes \nabout $75,000. Second, we provide tax incentives to encourage small \nbusiness owners to start new pension plans for themselves and their \nemployees.\n  My State of Montana is a small business State. About 20 percent of \nemployees have access to pension plans because it is very hard for a \nsmall business person to set up a pension plan. If you stop and think \nabout it, when a person sets up his business or her business, that \nfirst day that business owner must meet a payroll tax, and it is big. \nIt may take a while before the business starts making money, and even \nthen, there is only so much money to go around. So the business owner \nhas to prioritize. And most lower income workers are much more \ninterested in getting health care coverage or other benefits than they \nare in a pension plan. Our amendment provides an incentive to help make \nit a good business decision for that small business person to offer a \npension plan to his or her employees.\n  I believe this amendment gets our priorities pretty right. In estate \ntax reform, it provides dramatic tax relief for 90 percent of the \nfarmers and ranchers who are hit by an estate tax; three-quarters of \nfamily-held businesses who are otherwise paying estate tax, and about \ntwo-thirds of people overall who now pay tax. At the same time, it sets \naside $40 billion to give incentives to small businessmen to start \npension plans, and help them and their employees keep their pension \nplan going. It will help millions of Americans, particularly middle-\nincome Americans, increase their wealth so they can have their stake in \nthe economy and encourage them to save for retirement to supplement \nSocial Security.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. Senator Kerrey \nspoke earlier on the KidSave portion of this amendment.\n  I don't see anyone else wishing to speak, so I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, the clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I will be very brief in my comment on this \namendment. This amendment has the same fundamental defect that the \nother Democratic amendments have. It is built on the Democratic \nalternative to the House death tax repeal bill. For that reason, I must \noppose the amendment, as the Democratic alternative fails to achieve \nthe termination of the death tax.\n  Second, I want to raise a procedural point. While I agree and support \nthe concept of encouraging savings, I regret that this amendment would \ncause the Finance Committee to violate its outlay allocation under the \nbudget resolution. As a result, I raise a section 302(f) point of order \nagainst this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Delaware yield at this \ntime?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I move to waive the Budget Act.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded back, the vote \nwill occur in the sequence in which it has been stacked.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3836\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Grams], for himself and Mr. \n     Abraham, proposes an amendment numbered 3836.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To repeal the increase in tax on Social Security benefits.)\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n                   TITLE VI--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. 601. REPEAL OF INCREASE IN TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY \n                   BENEFITS.\n\n       (a) Repeal of Increase in Tax on Social Security \n     Benefits.--\n       (1) In general.--Paragraph (2) of section 86(a) (relating \n     to social security and tier 1 railroad retirement benefits) \n     is amended by adding at the end the following new flush \n     sentence:\n     ``This paragraph shall not apply to any taxable year \n     beginning after December 31, 2000.''\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by this subsection \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2000.\n       (b) Revenue Offset.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     transfer, for each fiscal year, from the general fund in the \n     Treasury to the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund \n     established under section 1817 of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1395i) an amount equal to the decrease in revenues to \n     the Treasury for such fiscal year by reason of the amendment \n     made by this section.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. The \namendment repeals the 1993 tax increase that was imposed as part of the \nClinton tax package in 1993, but this was an additional increase in \ntaxes on seniors' Social Security benefits. While we should repeal all \nof the taxes on seniors' Social Security benefits, as it was when \nSocial Security began, as I have proposed in my legislation, S. 488, I \nbelieve this amendment is at least a move in the right direction, and \nthat is to restore some fairness for our senior citizens.\n  This amendment, as I said, repeals completely President Clinton's \n1993 tax increase on seniors' Social Security benefits. The repeal does \nnot affect Medicare because the revenue loss is offset by the non-\nSocial Security surplus. We are holding the Medicare trust fund \nharmless while correcting what I believe, and I think the majority in \nCongress believe, is the injustice of the 1993 tax increase on Social \nSecurity benefits for our senior citizens.\n  There are many compelling reasons to repeal this unfair tax increase. \nWhen Congress established the Social Security program, the benefits \nthat were then paid to senior citizens were exempt from all Federal \nincome tax. In fact, Social Security benefits were not taxed at all by \nthe Federal Government for nearly half a century. However, when Social \nSecurity encountered a financial crisis in the early 1980s, Congress \nbegan taxing the benefits. Half--50 percent--of Social Security \nbenefits were subjected to taxation if a single senior citizen earned \nan annual income of over $25,000 a year and where a couple earned more \nthan $32,000 a year. With the couples and the singles, this is almost a \nmarriage penalty on senior citizens in their retirement benefits.\n  In 1993, when President Clinton needed even more money to fund his \nnew spending programs, he increased the taxable portion of Social \nSecurity benefits from the 50-percent level to 85 percent of income for \nour seniors. These tax increases have been an unfair tax burden on a \nnumber of our senior citizens. In fact, 25 percent of our retirees are \naffected by this provision.\n\n[[Page S6641]]\n\n  I believe taxation on Social Security benefits is wrong and it is \nunfair because Social Security benefits are already earned benefits for \nsenior citizens. By that I mean that Federal income tax has already \nbeen paid on Social Security contributions. I do not know if a lot of \npeople realize this, but before they take Social Security out of your \ncheck, the Government taxes it. So for your whole life, all of your \nSocial Security earnings have already been taxed before the Government \ntakes it and puts it into the system. What they are saying now is they \nwant to tax you again as you bring it out not at 50 percent, but as \nhigh as 85 percent for up to 25 percent of our seniors. This is a very \nunfair tax. Yet the Government is now taxing them again on the benefits \nthey are collecting. Clearly, taxing Social Security benefits is a \ndouble taxation.\n  Millions of senior citizens planned for their retirement based on the \nexpectation that their benefits would not be taxed. As the tax rate \ncontinues to grow and health care costs are also increasing, the income \nof more and more senior citizens is falling along with their standard \nof living.\n  Social Security has become the primary source of retirement income \nfor most Americans, and as I said, as the health care costs go up and \nthe Government is taking more money from them in taxes, it leaves them \nless to pay for health care and to pay for prescription drugs if they \nneed it. It all, again, goes back because the Government wants a bigger \npart of their income.\n\n  Six out of 10 recipients today get more than half of their income \nfrom Social Security. For some families, Social Security benefits are \nthe only source of their retirement income, and research shows American \nseniors will depend even more on just Social Security income in the \nfuture. That is because a lot of our citizens today do not have money \nleft at the end of the month to put into a savings account for their \nretirement. They are left with only one choice, and that is Social \nSecurity. Again, they have less left at the end of the month to put \ninto a savings account because Government taxes are going up. In fact, \nthey are 15 times higher on a household today than they were at the \nturn of the century in 1900.\n  Although Social Security has helped many American seniors, the income \nthat is derived from Social Security is often insufficient to maintain \na decent retirement today. For example, 1995 data shows that male \nretirees received on average $810 a month in benefits. Women received \nonly $621 a month from Social Security. I repeat, data from 1995 shows \non average $810 a month for men when they retire, and only $621 on \naverage for women when they retire.\n  In fact, Social Security benefits are paltry, which is one reason why \nthe poverty rate among widows is nearly 20 percent, two times greater \nthe rate than widowers, and poverty rates are higher among retired \nminority women. Twenty-nine percent of African American women and 28 \npercent of Hispanic women retire into poverty.\n  I believe it is unconscionable for Washington to tax Americans' \nSocial Security retirement benefits.\n  In addition, over the past 15 years, goods purchased by seniors have \nincreased 6 percentage points more than goods purchased by the general \npublic. Again, their dollars are not stretching as far as they used to \nstretch. Their medical costs skyrocketed by 156 percent, and they have \nless of their retirement benefits because the Government is taxing \nmore.\n  My concern is as inflation on medical and pharmaceutical goods \ncontinues to rise, without repeal of this unfair tax increase, older \nAmericans' hard-earned Social Security benefits will be worth less and \nless, and that means their purchasing power will continue to diminish \nand so will their standard of living.\n  This tax hurts seniors who choose to work or must work after \nretirement in order to maintain their standard of living or to pay for \nhealth insurance premiums, medical care, prescriptions, and many other \nexpenses.\n  This tax increase is nothing but a reduction in seniors' benefits \nthat Washington has promised. Unlike welfare where need determines the \nlevel of benefits, Social Security is an earned right for our seniors. \nTaxing their benefits--again, double taxation--is simply an indirect \nmeans test on those benefits.\n  I bet millions of American seniors would agree with me. In fact, \nrepeal of the 1993 tax increase has strong support in the Congress. It \nwas part of the Republican Contract With America and was approved by \nthe House as part of the omnibus reconciliation bill in 1995. In the \n106th Congress, 14 bills have been introduced calling for the repeal of \nthis unjust increase in taxation. Some will argue that Medicare will be \nhurt through this amendment, but, in fact, Medicare funding will be \nleft untouched. Social Security tax dollars going to Medicare will be \nsupplanted by general revenue funds. I believe all of us recognize the \nneed to preserve the integrity of the Medicare program. Therefore, I \nhave ensured through this amendment that it will not harm Medicare.\n  Many seniors across the country strongly support the repeal of this \nunfair tax increase. Seniors' organizations such as United Seniors and \nthe Council for Government Reform strongly favor its repeal. The \nNational Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare has also \nstated that it favors the repeal of this 1993 tax increase that was \nimposed by President Clinton on our senior citizens.\n  The American Association of Retired Persons originally opposed the \n1993 tax increase and has not changed its position. In this era of \nbudget surplus, there is absolutely no reason at all for the Government \nto continue taxing our seniors' retirement income in order for the \nGovernment to subsidize excessive spending from Washington.\n  I believe seniors deserve tax relief so they can keep a little more \nof their own money in their pockets, again, so they can help pay for \ntheir own medical bills, their prescriptions, and other expenses.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 48 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Minnesota for \noffering this amendment.\n  This has been a long time in coming. Just about 7 years ago, on \nAugust 6, 1993, the Vice President cast the deciding vote in this \nChamber to raise taxes on Social Security benefits. That same day, in \nthe House of Representatives, I introduced legislation to roll back \nthat Clinton-Gore tax hike for seniors. I was proud to have my \ncolleague from Minnesota as a cosponsor of that bill, and I am pleased \nto offer my support for his amendment today.\n  Millions of Americans depend on Social Security as a critical part of \ntheir retirement income. Having paid into the program throughout their \nworking lives, older Americans plan their retirement budgets very \ncarefully assuming that expected benefits will be there.\n  The 1993 Clinton-Gore Social Security tax hike upset the carefully \nlaid plans of millions of retirees by subjecting to federal taxation \n85% of the benefits earned by seniors above $34,000--or $44,000 for a \ncouple. For affected seniors, this constituted an increase of as much \nas 70 percent in the marginal tax rate.\n  The result is that seniors who had planned to continue building their \nnest eggs after retirement found themselves facing an overwhelming \ndisincentive to continue earning.\n  This is not just counterproductive--it is blatantly unfair. Younger \ninvestors face no such disincentives to save and invest. And yet \ninvestment income is much more important to seniors than it is younger \ncitizens. Sixty percent of seniors' income is derived from their \ninvestments.\n  It is simply not credible to dismiss the millions of Americans who \nmust pay this unfair tax hike as ``the rich.'' Last year, 4.6 million \nAmerican households had to pay more in taxes than they would have had \nthe Clinton-Gore increase not been in effect. That is more than a \nquarter of all households that include at least one Social Security \nbeneficiary.\n  Earlier this year, we came together on a bipartisan basis to repeal \nthe Social Security earnings limit. At that time, I wondered if the \nunanimous vote\n\n[[Page S6642]]\n\nto put an end to that relic of the Depression Era indicated a new \nwillingness to remove the barriers that discourage older Americans from \nsupplementing government assistance with self-help.\n  Our vote on the Grams amendment will demonstrate which Members of \nthis body are prepared to follow through on that principle. I certainly \nhope that this vote will be just as overwhelming as the vote on the \nearnings limit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as soon as the time expires on the majority \nside, we will yield back the remainder of our time. The respective \nCloakrooms have hotlined all Senators. I ask unanimous consent that the \nvote start when the time is yielded back rather than at 6:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Does the Senator from Minnesota yield back the remainder of his time?\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I reiterate this is an unfair tax. This is \ndouble taxation on senior citizens, raising it from 50 to 85 percent on \ntheir income, and at a time when we are talking about seniors needing \nadditional dollars to help pay their medical bills, and especially to \nhelp them meet their prescription drug bills. So I think this would be \none way to enable our seniors to have a little more say in their income \nand be able to provide for themselves a little better.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to repeal the \nPresident's 1993 tax on Social Security earnings for our retired \nAmericans.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I simply point out that this amendment \nwould move us backward in our efforts to produce a stable and \ncontinuous Social Security and Medicare systems.\n  In 1993, I was chairman of the Finance Committee. We expanded \nprovisions with respect to the normal taxation of benefits received \nfrom Social Security, just as all other pension benefits, are taxed, \nwhich is to say, taxes on that part which is not taxed as employee \nincome at the time the contribution is made. This obviously only \naffects persons with substantial income who are subject to the income \ntax. I think a quarter of Social Security recipients will pay no tax of \nany kind, they having low incomes generally and are below the income \ntax thresholds.\n  We did this as part of a general program to secure the Social \nSecurity system for the next 75 years. We have not completed this work. \nWe have to adjust the Consumer Price Index. We have to bring in State \nand local employees, almost a quarter of whom pay no Social Security \ntax on their regular job but pick up Social Security on the side and \nget a much higher return than the persons who pay through their regular \nemployee.\n  The exemption for State and local employees is an anachronism that we \ninherited from 1935 when it was not clear that the Federal Government \ncould tax a State government, and the issue was just not joined. It is \nnow clear. Most State governments do it; some do not.\n  There are another few corrections that could be made. And then we \nhave an actuarially sound program for 75 years. To go back now on this \none step we have made is to go back to a prospect that in 15 years' \ntime the Social Security system will not be bringing in the amount of \nrevenues it needs to pay benefits and we will start drawing out of \ngeneral revenues, and very quickly the insurance system will cease to \nbe that, it will be a transfer of payments subject to all of the \ndifficulties we have seen with such payments. And we will do the same \nto the solvency of Medicare as this change would accelerate the date of \nthe Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund from 2025 to 2020.\n  I remind the distinguished Presiding Officer that the one change we \nhave seriously made in the Social Security system in this decade is to \nabolish the provision for children, title IV-A, which was a direct \ntransfer.\n  I hope we do not accept this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have at \nleast 30 seconds to respond.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thought all time had been yielded back.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator be \nrecognized for 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the Senator is recognized for 30 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, all I want to say is that if it is \njustifiable to increase taxes on our senior citizens to help supplement \nthe Social Security system, it would be like increasing taxes on our \nfarmers so we could give them a better farm bill. It would be like \ntaking more taxes from the farmers so we can give them more back in the \nfarm program. It is saying: Let's tax our seniors at a higher rate--\nwhich is unfair--so we can give them more back to stabilize the Social \nSecurity system. It is a basic double taxation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, this is not, sir, \ndouble taxation. This is the normal taxation of retirement benefits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield back all his time?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I yield back.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3828\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded back, under the \nprevious order, the Senate will now address the Bingaman amendment No. \n3828. The question is on agreeing to the motion to waive the Budget \nAct.\n  There are 2 minutes equally divided.\n  Who yields time?\n  Is all time to be yielded back?\n  Mr. REID. All time has been yielded back on all these amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded back, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the motion to waive the Budget Act.

The question now is on the motion to waive the \nBudget Act with respect to the Graham amendment, No. 3824. The yeas and \nnays have been ordered.\n  There is 2 minutes of debate equally divided. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, when we adopted the budget resolution, we \nallocated $40 billion over 5 years to finance a prescription medication \nbenefit. Two things have happened since then, and a third is about to \nhappen.\n  The first thing that happened is we have recognized that $40 billion \nover 5, which is actually over 3 years that the prescription benefit \nwill be available, would result in a prescription medication benefit \nthat would be less than a third of the prescription medication benefit \nwhich most health insurance programs for over-65-year-olds provide. So \nwe are about to propose going in with a grossly deficient prescription \nmedication benefit if we restrict ourselves to the $40 billion.\n  The second thing that happened is we have new revenue estimates which \nhave quadrupled the amount of surplus we are going to have.\n  The third thing is we have just made a series of decisions already \ntonight, which will be confirmed by final passage, to spend some $100 \nbillion over 5 years for tax cuts, from the estate tax to the R tax \nto the phone tax cut we just passed, and if we pass the Social Security \ncut of Senator Grams.\n  How can we go home and say we can pass $100 billion over 5 years in \nthese tax cuts but cannot add $40 billion which will allow us to \nfinance a decent prescription benefit for 40 million American elderly?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The time of the Senator has \nexpired. Who yields time? The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have raised the point of order on this \namendment. Let me just recap for you.\n  Not too many months ago, we produced a budget resolution. There was \ndebate in committee. We started at $20 billion as a good starting point \nto reform Medicare and provide some prescription drugs. Just to show \nthe sequence, the ranking member, Senator Lautenberg, thought we ought \nto have $35 billion. Before we finished, a bipartisan solution was \ncrafted by the distinguished Senator from Maine, as I recall, and the \ndistinguished Senator from Oregon. It was heralded as the solution. It \nwas $20 billion to reform, $20 billion for prescriptions. Everybody \nsaid, ``Good.''\n  That is in effect. When somebody comes to the floor tonight, with a \nfew days left in the session, and wants to rewrite the budget and \nchange that to $80 billion, I say the seniors know we just cannot \ncontinue to have this kind of bidding. We will bankrupt Medicare \nultimately and we will not get the kind of reform we need and we will \nbe holding out to them a bankrupt system, but we got prescription \ndrugs. Incidentally, the President thought we could do it with $31 \nbillion, and he would not start it for 3 full years. How do you like \nthat?\n  All of a sudden, we have the solution to all the problems, and the \nsolution is, not $20 billion, not $35 billion that Senator Lautenberg \nwanted, not even $40 billion. It is $80 billion.\n  The point of order is real substance in this case. Seniors know we \nshould not be doing this because of their future and the children's \nfuture. We should not be trying to raise the ante on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nquestion is on agreeing to the motion. The yeas and nays have been \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nTorricelli) is necessarily absent.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 46, nays 53, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 186 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Chafee, L.\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--53\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Torricelli\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment falls.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3834\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on amendment No. 3834. \nThere are 2 minutes for debate. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, with this amendment we are making very \ncertain that farmers are a high priority with this bill and with this \nbody.\n  This amendment is a major package of tax benefits for farmers: No. 1, \nthe farmers savings account; No. 2, fixing a number of misguided IRS \ndecisions that are very detrimental to farming and not within the \nintent of Congress; No. 3, repealing the draconian installment sales \nprovision which is a No. 1 provision that small business seeks; No. 4, \nto increase bonding for beginning farmers.\n  I thank Senators Roth, Roberts, Brownback, Lugar, and Grams for their \ncontributions. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, is the Senator from Iowa going to require a \nrecorded vote on this?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. No.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while everybody is here, we can finish \nquickly tonight if everybody adheres to the 10 minutes. The votes are \nrunning over 10 minutes considerably. I hope we can all vote on time \nand move this bill along a little more quickly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. It will move faster.\n\n[[Page S6644]]\n\n  If there is no further debate, the question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 3834.\n  The amendment (No. 3834) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3835\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the adoption of the motion \nto waive the Budget Act with regard to the Baucus amendment No. 3835. \nThere are 2 minutes for debate.\n  Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is a good amendment which includes \nthe best two-thirds of the estate tax relief in the House bill, which \nis the bill promoted by the majority side. It combines this estate tax \nrelief with important incentives for middle-income persons to save for \ntheir retirement. Retirement security is known as a stool with three \nlegs--Social Security, employer-sponsored pension plans and personal \nsavings. This amendment goes a long way toward strengthening those last \ntwo legs for middle and lower-income America. By giving a tax credit to \nthose under $75,000 in income to encourage them to save for retirement, \nand tax credits to small businesspeople who set up new plans for their \nworkers, we can truly help average Americans save for the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 1 minute has expired.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this amendment includes the Democratic \nsubstitute that fails to sunset the death tax. Moreover, the amendment \nincludes two additional provisions which cause the Finance Committee to \nexceed its 301 spending allocation.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on waiving the point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment falls.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3836\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now is on the Grams amendment No. \n3836. There will be 2 minutes equally divided.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. It asks \nfor the repeal of the 1993 tax increase that was placed on Social \nSecurity benefits. By the way, that does not affect Medicare because we \nhave provided offsets to do that in this amendment.\n  For the first 50 years of Social Security, there was no Federal tax \non the benefits our seniors received from Social Security. You were \ntaxed on those benefits before it was taken out of your check and not \nwhen you received the benefits. But in the 1980s, they put on a tax and \nexposed 50 percent of the benefits. Then in 1993, under President \nClinton's tax increase plan, it increased to 85 percent. Social \nSecurity is taxed before being taken from your checks. Now it is taxed \nup to 85 percent when you receive the benefits. That is double dipping, \nand, at a time when health care costs are going up and we are debating \nprescription drug benefits, we need to leave more dollars in our \nseniors' pockets.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I repeat, sir, that the 1993 measure was \npart of a long-range effort to restore actuarial balance to the Social \nSecurity and Medicare systems. It treats Social Security income, \nretirement income, as all other retirement income is treated. That part \nfor which taxes have been paid is exempted. The rest is taxed normally \nfor others. Low-income beneficiaries of Social Security would pay no \ntax. This money goes into the Medicare trust fund and is part of the \nlong-term solvency we seek.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we can proceed to the vote now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Grams \namendment No. 3836. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nTorricelli) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson).

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know Senators are anxious to get an \nagreement on how we proceed at this point. Once again, I thank the \nDemocratic leader for his work with us as we develop these unanimous \nconsents. It is next to impossible to accommodate every Senator's \nwishes. My goal is to try to find a way to get this work completed in \nas reasonable a time as possible. I think this will help us get that \ndone.\n  With regard to the legislation before the Senate, I ask consent that \nthe time\n\n[[Page S6645]]\n\nbetween now and 10 p.m. be equally divided in the usual form between \nthe two leaders, and the following amendments be debated for up to 10 \nminutes, equally divided, in the following order: the Kerry amendment \nregarding housing; Santorum regarding community renewal; Harkin on \nSocial Security; Roth on retirement; Wellstone-Dodd on child care \nadoption tax credit; Bayh on long-term care, self-employed health care; \nLott on ESAs, et cetera; Feingold amendment on $100 million cap; and \nthe final motion to recommit by myself.\n  I further ask consent at 9 a.m. on Friday the Senate proceed to a \nseries of votes in relation to the above-listed amendments in the order \noffered, with 2 minutes of debate equally divided for each amendment \nprior to each vote.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, I suggest to the majority \nleader, we have been consulting on the order. On our side, Senators \nDodd and Wellstone would like to switch the order with Senator Harkin. \nI make that modification.\n  We have a number of Senators who are hopeful they can catch planes. \nIt is so tight that if we have the 2 minutes of debate, in a couple of \ncases they may miss their planes. I ask that we delete that for this \ntime only. I know it is a very important matter, and oftentimes it is \nessential for Members to understand the amendments. We will have \ntonight and tomorrow morning to look at these amendments. I ask that we \ndelete the reference to the 2 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. I think those are reasonable requests, so I modify my \nrequest, No. 1, to move the Wellstone-Dodd amendment in order after \nSantorum and before the Harkin amendment; and that the 2 minutes of \ndebate equally divided be deleted.\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object, I don't know whether I \nmisheard the majority leader or whether he said 10 minutes equally \ndivided; I think he means 20 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. LOTT. It is 10 minutes equally divided, not 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If I could respond to the Senator's inquiry, if it could \naccommodate some of those Senators who need more time, we still have \nmore time on the bill. I am happy to authorize the use of whatever \nadditional time allocated to me to those Senators who may require some \nadditional time to further explain their amendment, keeping, therefore, \nthe 10 minutes in the unanimous consent request if that accommodates \nthe Senators.\n  Mr. LOTT. I, too, make the point that brevity, succinctness, and \ntargeted debate is very persuasive.\n  Mr. KERRY. Does that mean if I speak for 1 minute the Senator will \nvote with me?\n  Mr. LOTT. It would be much more likely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, with regard to reconciliation and the \nmarriage penalty tax issue, there is an awful lot of interest in that \nmatter in how we proceed tomorrow. We will have a series of stacked \nvotes tomorrow morning, possibly as many as nine.\n  But I believe we can get through it in a reasonably short period of \ntime--hopefully 2 hours. If Senators will come to the floor for the \nfirst vote and stay on the floor, we can move much more quickly and we \nwill be able to be completed with that series, I hope, by 11 o'clock, \non the marriage penalty.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Agreement H.R. 4810\n\n  I now ask unanimous consent, notwithstanding any provisions governing \nthe reconciliation budget process, that immediately following the \npassage of H.R. 8 on Friday, July 14, the Senate turn to consideration \nof H.R. 4810, the reconciliation bill, and the Senate bill be offered \nas an amendment and immediately be agreed to and considered as original \ntext for the purpose of further amendments, and the following \namendments be the only first-degree amendments in order, and limited to \nall the restraints outlined in the budget resolution, except that each \namendment be limited to up to 30 minutes each with 20 minutes for any \nsecond-degree amendment.\n  Those amendments are as follows. I send to the desk the amendments \nthat have been requested by Republican Members and Democratic Members.\n  The list is as follows:\n       Grams--Social Security.\n       B. Smith--Internet Tax.\n       B. Smith--Marriage penalty.\n       B. Smith--Relevant.\n       B.

I further ask unanimous consent that all amendments be \ndebated during Friday or Saturday's session of the Senate, and those \namendments, both first- and second-degree amendments, may be laid aside \nfor other amendments to be offered as deemed necessary by either \nleader.\n  I further ask consent that the votes ordered with respect to the \namendments occur in a stacked sequence beginning at 6:15 p.m. on \nMonday, July 17, with 2 minutes prior to each vote for explanation, if \nit is requested of course, and all votes after the first vote in the \nsequence be limited to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, I ask for one minor \nmodification. With reference to either of the leaders, I suggest we add \n``or designee,'' or ``a leader designee.''\n  Mr. LOTT. I think that is a reasonable request, Mr. President. I \nmodify my request to that effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I noted I did not have an amendment on \nthe list. I was wondering if I might add an Abraham relevant amendment \non the list.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that, to the list of Republican \namendments, a relevant amendment by Senator Abraham be added.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. In light of this agreement then, Mr. President, there will \nbe no further votes tonight. The next votes will occur at 9 a.m. on \nFriday in stacked sequence, with 9 or 10 back-to-back votes that could \nbe required. I hope Senators will consider the possibility of not \noffering their amendments or agreeing to a voice vote, if there is any \nway possible to accommodate other Senators, so the sequence won't go on \nlonger than a couple of hours.\n\n  Following those stacked votes on Friday, Members who have amendments \nto reconciliation and marriage penalty tax will have to stay around to \noffer and debate them. It can take up\n\n[[Page S6646]]\n\nto as long as 20 hours. Senators who have amendments on these lists, if \nthey want to offer them, need to be here to offer them and they need to \nmake their case because there will not be an opportunity, other than \nthe 2 minutes equally divided, to talk about the specifics on Monday \nnight. So these votes will be stacked in sequence at 6:15 on Monday, \nJuly 17.\n  I thank again all my colleagues for their cooperation. I know this \ndoes not meet everybody's scheduling desires. I had actually hoped to \nbe able to finish the marriage penalty tax tomorrow night or Saturday, \nbut this agreement allows us to get it done, I think, in an efficient \nway, have it completed on Monday night, complete the Interior \nappropriations bill on Tuesday morning, and be prepared to go to the \nnext appropriations bill after that.\n  I thank all Senators for their willingness to help us work through \nthis. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I allocate 5 minutes of my time under the \nprevious agreement to the following Senators: Senator Dodd, Senator \nKerry, Senator Harkin, Senator Wellstone, Senator Bayh, and Senator \nFeingold. That will be 5 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nInouye, Sarbanes, Dodd, and Wellstone be added as original cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the Senator from Massachusetts yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I add to that request 5 minutes for \nSenator Lieberman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3839\n\n(Purpose: To establish a National Housing Trust Fund in the Treasury of \n the United States to provide for the development of decent, safe, and \n              affordable housing for low-income families)\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I call up my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry], for himself and \n     Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Dodd and Mr. Wellstone, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3839.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to offer an \namendment to the estate tax repeal bill. This amendment would establish \na National Affordable Housing Trust Fund to fill the growing gap in our \nability to provide affordable housing in this country.\n  Over the past two decades, income and wealth disparities in our \ncountry have increased. The gap between the rich and the poor has \nwidened. Even our robust economy has not been able to bridge the great \ndivide between the haves and have-nots.\n  This great divide remains impassable for millions of Americans who \nstruggle to survive on the minimum wage. This divide remains impassable \nfor millions of Americans who have no health insurance, no prescription \ndrug coverage. This divide remains impassable for millions of Americans \nwho cannot afford housing, child care, or a college education, who \ncannot afford to even finish high school because they must drop out and \nwork in order to support their family.\n  Despite the economic boom that heralded in the new millennium, \npoverty rates in our country have dropped only marginally. Today, 1 out \nof ever 5 children still lives in poverty, compared with 1 out of every \n7 in the 1970s. The number of families living in extreme poverty--on \nless than $6,750 a year for a family of 3--has increased from 13.9 \nmillion in 1995 to 14.6 million in 1997. Over the 1990's, the average \nreal income of high-income families grew by 15 percent, while average \nincome grew by less than 2 percent for middle-income families and \nremained the same for the lowest-income families.\n  I ask, with the futures of so many lower- and middle-income Americans \nhanging in the balance, what is the majority in Congress doing? What is \nthe majority in Congress defining as a top priority?\n  Would you believe a tax cut for the richest of the rich? Indeed they \nhave. It is before us today. A tax break for the highest income earners \nin our country. A fiscally irresponsible tax cut which stands to \nthreaten our non-Social Security surplus and undercut the critical \ninvestments we should be making in the future of all Americans.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Republican proposal \nto repeal the estate tax will cost $105 billion over the first 10 \nyears, as it slowly phases in. Once the repeal has been fully \nimplemented, it will cost an additional $50 billion each year. That \ncomes out to roughly three-quarters of a trillion dollars over 20 \nyears.\n  Three-quarters of a trillion dollars is a generous hand-out, Mr. \nPresident. But into exactly whose hands does it fall? Does it go to the \nsenior citizen who has survived one heart attack only to find that she \ncannot afford her cholesterol lowering medication? Does it go to the \ndecorated homeless veteran who cannot afford to put a roof over his \nhead? Does it go to the graduating high school senior who cannot afford \nto pay tuition and be the first generation of his family to go to \ncollege?\n  The simple answer is no. The estate tax repeal would give the Forbes \n400 richest Americans a windfall of $250 billion--that is enough to pay \nfor prescription drug coverage, housing costs, and college scholarships \nfor millions of Americans.\n  The majority's priorities are misguided, irresponsible, and an \naffront to the American public. Don't get me wrong; I support targeted \nestate tax relief for small businesses and family farms. Owners of \nsmall businesses and farms should neither be penalized for their \nsuccess nor denied the opportunity to pass their family businesses on \nto future generations. And the Democratic alternative which I support \nwould increase the exemption for family-owned small businesses and \nfarms from $1.3 million to $4 million by 2001, and to $8 million by \n2010. But the outright repeal proposed by the majority goes far beyond \nwhat is necessary to save family businesses and family farms.\n  Let's be clear: The majority is serious about one thing--unwise, \nunrealistic, and untenable tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans at a \ntime when the Federal tax burden has shrunk to its lowest level in four \ndecades; at a time when low- and middle-income Americans are struggling \nto afford decent health care, housing, and education.\n  I ask my colleagues, does anyone really believe that Donald Trump, \nBill Gates, or Steve Forbes needs a tax cut? Does anyone really believe \nthat before doing anything to strengthen Social Security and Medicare, \nwe should provide a tax break to the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans \nwho control 40 percent of the wealth in this Nation? Apparently, the \nmajority believes it. That is their idea of tax fairness: millions for \nthe rich, not a penny for the middle class.\n  The bottom line is: the Republican proposal mortgages America's \nfuture. It threatens our ability to reduce interest rates and protect \nthe economy, to help secure a strong Social Security system for our \nnation's retirees, to modernize Medicare by establishing a prescription \ndrug benefit for seniors and the disabled, and to provide educational \nassistance for those that want to climb up the ladder.\n  There are many more worthwhile investments we could be making with \nthe $750 billion this bill hands out to the extremely wealthy. I am \noffering an amendment to ensure that we make at least one of these \ncritical investments--an investment in housing.\n  The booming economy is fueling rising housing costs. While housing \nprices and costs skyrocket at record pace, many families are unable to \nkeep up. Even during this time of great economic expansion, the housing \ncrisis in this country worsens, quickly becoming a national disgrace.\n  HUD estimates that 5.4 million low-income households have ``worst \ncase'' housing needs. This means they are\n\n[[Page S6647]]\n\npaying over half their income towards housing costs or living in \nseverely substandard housing. In the past decade, the number of \nfamilies who have ``worst case'' housing needs has increased by 12 \npercent--that's 600,000 more American families who cannot afford a \ndecent and safe place to live. For these families living paycheck to \npaycheck, one unforseen circumstance, a sick child, a car repair bill, \ncan send them into homelessness.\n  Another recent study actually estimates that 13.7 million households \nhave critical housing needs, including 6 million working and 3.7 \nmillion elderly households.\n  Moreover, there is not one metropolitan area in the country where a \nperson making minimum wage can afford to pay the rent for a two-bedroom \napartment. A person needs to earn over $11 an hour to afford the median \nrent for a two bedroom apartment in this country. This figure rises \ndramatically in many metropolitan areas: an hourly wage of $22 is \nneeded in San Francisco; $21 on Long Island; $17 in Boston; $16 in the \nD.C. area; $14 in Seattle and Chicago; and $13 in Atlanta.\n  We have to remember that there are real people behind these numbers--\nreal people who are struggling to keep their families housed each \nmonth. The stories are a testament to the need for increased affordable \nhousing. Let me give you a few.\n  On Cape Cod, Susan O'Donnell a mother of three, earns $21,000 a year \nworking full-time. Nonetheless, she is forced to live in a campground \nbecause she can not find affordable housing. The campground she is \nliving at has time limits, so the only way she is able to stay for a \nprolonged period of time is through cleaning the campground's toilets. \nWhen her time runs out at the campground, she will again be forced to \nmove with her three children, though it is not clear where she will be \nable to afford to move. Skyrocketing housing costs have pushed her, and \nother full-time workers on the Cape out of their housing and into \nhomelessness.\n  Janitors who work at high-tech companies in Silicon Valley are living \nin egregious conditions, including several large families living in \nsingle-family homes and others renting out garages for families to live \nin--garages which can cost $750 a month. Maria Godinez, of San Jose, \nworks full time for Sun Microsystems making $8 an hour. She shares one \nbedroom of a single-family house with her husband and five children; 22 \npeople live in that house.\n  Not too far from where we are today, in Fairfax County, VA, Anita \nSalathe and her two children live in a shelter despite her having a job \nand a voucher for assisted housing--there just are not enough \naffordable housing units. The homelessness rate in Fairfax County has \nincreased by 21 percent in the last two years. Full-time workers are \nliving in shelters because their paychecks are not rising fast enough \nto keep pace with their growing housing costs.\n  These stories are all too common. As housing costs rise around \nAmerica, more working families are being pushed closer to homelessness.\n  Despite these abysmal stories, we have decreased Federal spending on \ncritical housing programs over time. From fiscal year 1995 to fiscal \nyear 1999, we engaged in what I call the ``Great HUDway Robbery,'' \ndiverting or rescinding over $20 billion from Federal housing programs \nfor other uses. With a few exceptions, the funding increases of this \npast year have gone primarily to cover the rising costs of serving \nexisting assisted families.\n  Affordable housing units are being lost. Between 1993 and 1995, a \nloss of 900,000 rental units affordable to very low-income families \noccurred. From 1996 to 1998, there was a 19 percent reduction in the \nnumber of affordable housing units. This amounted to a dramatic \nreduction of 1.3 million affordable housing units available to low-\nincome Americans.\n\n  We need to bring our levels of housing spending back up to where they \nbelong. Between 1978 and 1995, the Government increased the number of \nhouseholds receiving housing assistance by almost 3 million. From 1978 \nthrough 1984, we provided an additional 230,000 families with housing \nassistance each year. This number dropped significantly to 126,000 \nadditional households each year from 1985 to 1995.\n  If we hoped things could not get worse, in 1996 this nations' housing \npolicy hit a brick wall. Not only was there no increase in families \nreceive housing assistance, but the number of assisted units actually \ndecreased. From 1996 to 1998, the number of HUD assisted households \ndropped by 51,000. In this time of rising rents and housing costs, and \nthe loss of affordable housing units, it is incomprehensible that we \nare not doing more to bring the levels of housing assistance back from \nthe dead.\n  It is high time that we focused on housing policies in Congress and \naround the country. Housing is an anchor for families. When we focus \nour efforts on other social issues like education and health care, it \nis beyond comprehension that housing does not take a front seat in \nthese discussions.\n  It is no secret that neighborhood and living environment play \nenormous roles in shaping young lives. It should not be news that \nhousing assistance, which helps a family maintain a stable home, is \npositive for low-income children. We know that a child can not learn if \nhe has to attend 3 or 4 schools in a single year, if his family moves \nfrom relative to relative to friend to friend because his parents can't \nafford the rent.\n  A recent study conducted by Johns Hopkins University helps to show \nthat housing assistance is beneficial. Housing assistance makes it \neasier to get and retain a job by providing stability. We need to \nensure that every American family has these same opportunities. We need \nto address the lack of opportunity, the lack of affordable housing.\n  I am proposing to address this severe shortage of affordable housing \nby establishing a National Affordable Housing Trust Fund. While we are \nconsidering a bill which allows the wealthy to pass on large estates \nand homes to their families, let's ensure that all Americans can afford \na place to live.\n  My proposal would create an affordable housing production program, \nensuring that new rental units are built for those who most need \nassistance--extremely low-income families, including working families. \nIn addition, Trust Fund assistance will be used to promote \nhomeownership for low-income families, those families whose incomes are \nbelow 80 percent of the area median income.\n  The Trust Fund aims to create long-term affordable, mixed-income \ndevelopments in areas with the greatest opportunities for low-income \nfamilies.\n  A majority of assistance from the Trust Fund will be given out as \nmatching grants to the States which will distribute funds on a \ncompetitive basis like the low-income housing tax credit. Localities, \nnon-profits, developers and other entities will be eligible to apply \nfor funds. The remaining 25 percent of the Trust Fund assistance will \nbe distributed through a national competition to intermediaries, such \nas large, national non-profits which will be required to leverage \nprivate funds.\n  This proposal will bring Federal, State and private resources \ntogether to create needed affordable housing opportunities for American \nfamilies.\n  When we allow families in this country to live in severely distressed \nhousing, or in situations where they are forced to move from place to \nplace, American children suffer--they have behavioral problems, they \nsuffer from more health problems, and they do worse in school. I think \nthe American people understand that helping children escape these \nproblems today will pay us back tenfold in the years to come. I think \nthe American people understand how we can measure what actually counts \nin America. I think they know that housing is more than a word or a \ngovernment program--it is the quality of life--it is how we measure our \nlives and it is how we ought to take the measure of our nation.\n  I urge you to support this amendment which restores our commitment to \nproviding affordable housing for all families. We should not vote to \nensure that the wealthiest Americans can retain more of their incomes \nand estates, while turning our back on those families who struggle each \nmonth just to put a roof over their heads.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support Senator Kerry's \nproposal to create a housing trust fund. In this period of strong \neconomic growth and record expansion, the lack of affordable housing is \nan increasingly serious problem for millions of families\n\n[[Page S6648]]\n\nacross the country, especially low income families struggling to lift \nthemselves out of poverty. Our national prosperity means less if \nfirefighers, teachers, police officers, nurses, and many other hard-\nworking Americans cannot afford to live in the communities where they \nwork.\n  As long ago as 1949, the nation pledged safe, clean, decent housing \nfor all Americans. As we begin a new century, this promise is still \nunfulfilled. Even worse we are not making even modest progress to \nachieve this goal.\n  The rising cost of housing is one of the most difficult challenges \nfor many families. It is particularly serious for the elderly, many of \nwhom also face the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs as well.\n  In a period of economic prosperity such as the one we now enjoy, it \nis wrong that we have one of the lowest housing production levels in \nhistory. Affordable housing must be a higher priority for the Congress.\n  Over the past five years, more than $20 billion has either been \nrescinded or diverted by Congress from federal housing programs for \nother uses, while the number of Americans who cannot afford a decent \nplace to live continues to rise.\n  The problem is particularly acute in Massachusetts. The average time \non waiting lists for public housing and housing vouchers is over 3 \nyears, and more than 13,000 families are on those waiting lists.\n  In the Greater Boston area, affordable housing is not only a problem \nfor many families, it is becoming a problem for businesses. Many of the \nmost successful companies report difficulties in their efforts to \nattract and retain employees because of the high cost of housing. \nWithout an ability to retain a strong workforce, unaffordable housing \nthreatens to undermine prosperity at every level, federal, state, and \nlocal.\n  The costs of new construction and rehabilitation of existing housing \nare very high. The price of owning a home is increasing faster in \nMassachusetts than in any other state in the country.\n  I support the Clinton's Administration's budget request of $32.5 \nbillion for the Department of Housing and Urban Development for FY \n2001, a 25 percent increase over FY 2000. By contrast, the budget \nadopted by the Republican Congress in April proposed a $400 million \nreduction in the HUD budget.\n  The Trust Fund proposed by this amendment is an important start to \nending this period of disinvestment.\n  Senator Kerry's amendment will provide funds for new units and for \nthe renovation of existing units, along with increases in ownership. It \nchannels money through local and state governments, primarily to \nalready established programs with a track record of success. The \nmajority of Trust Fund assistance will be used for the neediest \nfamilies, including the working poor.\n  As we debate the misguided priority of massive tax relief for the \nwealthiest 2 percent of estates, I urge my colleagues instead to \nconsider the needs of millions of families who are working hard, but \nwho find it increasingly difficult to afford housing for their \nfamilies.\n  I urge the Senate to support this amendment. Housing must be a higher \npriority for Congress. The time to act is now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes in opposition.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I will be brief in my 5 minutes.\n  First, I know the Senator from Massachusetts is sincere about this \namendment, but I remind my colleagues of a few key points. We are here \nto repeal the death tax. All over America, families work, sacrifice, \nsave, and through sweat equity build up businesses, farms, and assets. \nThen they die, and the Government, because they die, taxes their life's \nwork even though they paid taxes on every dollar they earned. Too often \nin America, their children have to sell the farm or sell the business \nto give the Government up to 55 cents out of every dollar they earn. \nRepublicans believe that is unfair, that is un-American, and that is \nimmoral.\n  Our colleague from Massachusetts calls getting rid of this tax a \nwindfall. If your parents worked a lifetime to build up a farm, and \nthey were there when it was dry and they had droughts, they were there \nwhen there were floods and when the hail killed the crops, and they \nsaved and sacrificed, and they did it so their children could some day \nrun that farm, I do not call that a windfall. That is just a \nfundamental difference in philosophy.\n  There are two big-time problems with this amendment. No. 1, it sets \nup this new trust fund not out of taxes that were raised to pay for \nthis activity but basically by requiring people to sell off the family \nfarm or sell off the family business to fund this trust fund.\n  The second problem is, there is no point of order against it. One \nmight ask why is that true of amendments that have been offered that \nspend money. It is true because this amendment takes $5 billion that \nthe Finance Committee was allocated to do something else with. For what \nwere they allocated the money? They were allocated the money to repeal \nthe marriage penalty for people who receive the earned-income tax \ncredit. That is what this $5 billion was for.\n  A janitor with three children meets a waitress with two children. \nThey fall in love, and they find the solution to their problems. Only, \nunder the marriage penalty, they both end up losing the earned-income \ntax credit, and they end up in the 28-percent tax bracket if they get \nmarried.\n  We are planning to use the $5 billion that Senator Kerry would use to \nfund this trust fund to repeal the marriage penalty for the lowest \nincome individuals to be sure they do not lose their earned-income tax \ncredit if they meet, fall in love, and get married.\n  Senator Kerry is trying to do a very good thing, but unfortunately \nthere is something I think is of a higher order: repealing the marriage \npenalty for poor people and not taking away their earned-income tax \ncredit. Senator Kerry is inadvertently taking this money from that \npurpose.\n  So ultimately you come down to choices. The choice he would make is: \nSell the family farm, sell the family business, and let the Government \nhave that money; and, secondly, the money you were going to take--that \n$5 billion that we gave the Finance Committee in the budget to repeal \nthe marriage penalty for low-income people, by changing the earned-\nincome tax credit, where they do not lose it if they get married to \nsomebody who also works--the net result of this is, sell the farm, sell \nthe business, and take away the earned-income tax credit from the \njanitor and the waitress who have a total of five children, who met, \nfell in love, wanted to get married, and who saw it as a solution to \ntheir problem. But Senator Kerry will be sure they get subsidized \nhousing. I do not think it is a good swap. I do not think it is a good \ntrade. So on another day, on another issue maybe, but not today.\n  Finally, let me remind my colleagues, if they are worried about \nhousing--and we would be if we did not have a house--that we have a \n$1.9 billion increase in the 2000 budget for housing, $25.9 billion for \nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development--and that is a 7-\npercent increase. Very few families in America had a 7-percent increase \nin their income last year.\n  So it is a good amendment--well-intended--but we should reject it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. KERRY. Does the Senator from Texas have any time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3838\n\n(Purpose: To provide for the designation of renewal communities and to \n provide tax incentives relating to such communities, to provide a tax \ncredit to taxpayers investing in entities seeking to provide capital to \n create new markets in low-income communities, and to provide for the \nestablishment of Individual Development Accounts (IDAs), and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nPennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3838.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum], for himself, \n     Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Torricelli, \n     Mr. DeWine, Mr. Kohl, Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. Kerry, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 3838.\n\n\n[[Page S6649]]\n\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the amendment that we have now before us \nis a package of legislation that I have been working on with my \ncolleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, as well as Senator Kerry \nfrom Massachusetts, and Senator Abraham, Senator Kohl, Senator \nHutchinson, Senator Torricelli, and Senator DeWine.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senators Ashcroft and \nCollins as cosponsors to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. This is a bipartisan attempt in the Senate to match the \nbipartisan effort that has been ongoing in the House of Representatives \nwith the President of the United States on what is called the Community \nRenewal New Markets Initiative. Basically, we have taken the House-\npassed legislation and added a couple of very important provisions to \nthat House-passed legislation, and we are now offering it to this death \ntax repeal legislation in the Senate.\n  The two major additions to the House-passed legislation--there are \nseveral, but the two major additions are the low-income housing tax \ncredit, which is something that has passed this body before, and again \nhas broad bipartisan support, raising the per capita number or \nallotment for the low-income housing tax credit per State; and the \nsecond is something that Senator Lieberman and I have been working on \nnow for quite some time called individual development accounts.\n  I think these two key provisions are very important to the idea of \nempowering individuals, not only in their communities, which the \ncommunity renewal package does, but also in providing the opportunity \nfor wealth accumulation through individual development accounts, and \nproviding that incentive to save for a home, to save for a college \neducation, to save for the startup of a new business.\n  In addition, there are some other very important provisions. Earlier \nthis year, Senator Abraham offered the New Millennium Classroom Act, \nanother addition to the House-passed bill, which provides incentives \nfor businesses to donate money to poorer schools, so we can have \ncomputer equipment in those poorer schools to bridge the digital \ndivide.\n  We have a charitable choice provision, which is broader than the \nHouse provision, which was introduced by Senator Ashcroft, the \nPresiding Officer, that is in line, frankly.\n  I was reading Vice President Gore's speech that he gave last year \nwhere he talked about a ``New Partnership.'' He talked about the 1996 \nwelfare reform bill. He said:\n\n       [This provision states] that states can enlist faith-based \n     organizations to provide basic welfare services, and help \n     move people from welfare to work.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       They can do so with public funds--and without having to \n     alter the religious character that is so often the key to \n     their effectiveness.\n\n  I go on to quote:\n\n       I believe we should extend this carefully tailored approach \n     to other vital services where faith-based organizations can \n     play a role--such as drug treatment, homelessness, and youth \n     violence prevention.\n\n  That is just to name a few.\n  So what we see is that the Vice President has embraced this \ncharitable choice provision and an expansion of that, which I think is \nvitally important.\n  With that, Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President. I rise to support the American Community \nRenewal and New Markets Empowerment Amendment offered by Senators \nSantorum, Lieberman, Kerrey, myself and others.\n  This amendment represents a bipartisan effort designed to address the \nsocial and economic ills which are preventing our poorest areas from \nparticipating in the current economic boom. I strongly believe that it \nwill go a long way toward bringing the economic growth and sense of \ncommunity necessary to maintain, safe streets, strong families, and \nthriving neighborhoods.\n  Under this legislation, 50 new Renewal Communities--one for each \nstate--would be created. Characterized by pervasive poverty, Renewal \nCommunities provide financial incentives to promote economic growth and \nsocial health in distressed areas.\n  Incentives include: a zero capital gains rate, increased expensing of \nequipment costs for small businesses, employment wage credit for hiring \nRenewal Community Residents and an extension of the Brownfields \nprovision.\n  In addition, our amendment would increase housing opportunities \nnationwide for poorer families by increasing and indexing for inflation \nthe Low Income Housing Tax Credit and the volume caps on Private \nActivity Bonds.\n  Since implemented in 1986, thanks to the Low Income Housing Tax \nCredit, in Michigan, 27,000 housing units have gone up. Nationally, the \ncredit is responsible for one million apartments dedicated to low-\nincome tenants at restricted rents.\n  Mr. President, increasing the volume cap on private activity bonds \nwill help finance thousands of single and multi-family mortgages and \nproperty improvement loans.\n  The legislation also calls for the establishment of Individual \nDevelopment Accounts to help the working poor build financial assets.\n  The IDAs in this bill apply this concept nationally, giving all \nfamilies the opportunity to buy a home, further their education or \nstart up a new business.\n  The amendment also includes the faith-based treatment and charitable \nchoice provisions will continue the work started in the 1996 Welfare \nReform bill.\n  Religious-based organizations will be able to compete on equal \ngrounds with non-religious organizations. This will allow them to \nprovide drug and alcohol treatment and other welfare-related services \nwithout compromising the religious nature of their treatment or \norganization.\n  The creation of privately managed, for-profit companies and the New \nMarkets tax credit will provide the financial security necessary to \nbring investment to communities which would otherwise be considered too \nhigh-risk.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this amendment includes the New Millennium \nClassrooms Act, which would help address the issue of the digital \ndivide, providing tax incentives to companies to increase the amount of \ncomputer and related technology donations to qualified recipients in \ndesignated poor areas.\n  To increase the amount of technology donated to schools, libraries, \nsenior centers and vocational education centers in economically \ndisadvantaged areas, the New Millennium Classrooms Act would expand the \nparameters of the current tax deduction and add a tax credit.\n  Introduced as the New Millennium Classrooms Act in March, 1999, this \nlegislation has the support of 32 cosponsors and most recently passed \nas an amendment to the Affordable Education Act, on a vote of 96-2.\n  Despite the recent gains made in increasing the level of computers \nand technology in schools, unacceptable disparities still exist.\n  Schools with greater numbers of poor and minority students simply do \nnot have the same access to the Internet and computer technology as \nwealthier schools and schools with lower minority enrollment.\n  If our poorer communities are to truly experience a complete and \nlong-term economic rejuvenation, their residents must have access and \ninstruction in information technologies.\n  Many Americans--particularly those with less income and education--\nare still missing out on the digital age. More and more, everyday \nactivities migrate to the Internet. Unless we act now, the gap in \nopportunities available to those on the other side of the digital \ndivide will continue to increase.\n  I hope that my colleagues will support this amendment to provide real \nhope and opportunity for all Americans.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about the Santorum/\nLieberman amendment being offered to the Estate Tax bill. This \namendment gives the Senate the opportunity to vote on broad economic \ndevelopment\n\n[[Page S6650]]\n\npolicies originally introduced a few weeks ago as S. 2779, the American \nCommunity Renewal and New Markets Empowerment Act.\n  Of the many important and innovative provisions in this legislation, \nI would like to focus on the community development and venture capital \ninitiative and full funding for Round II of Empowerment Zones. Mr. \nPresident, as my colleagues may remember last year I introduced the \nCommunity Development and Venture Capital Act. The purpose of community \ndevelopment and venture capital is to stimulate economic development \nthrough public-private partnerships that invest venture capital in \nsmaller businesses. Not just any small businesses, but those that are \nlocated in impoverished rural and urban areas, known as new markets, or \nthat employ low-income people. We call these areas new markets because \nof the overlooked business opportunities. According to Michael Porter, \na respected professor at Harvard and business analyst who has written \nextensively on competitiveness, ``. . . inner cities are the largest \nunderserved market in America, with many tens of billions of dollars of \nunmet consumer and business demand.''\n  Both innovative and fiscally sound, my new markets initiative is \nfinancially structured similar to Small Business Administration (SBA)'s \nsuccessful Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program, and \nincorporates a technical assistance component similar to that \nsuccessfully used in SBA's microloan program. However, unlike the SBIC \nprogram which focuses solely on small businesses with high-growth \npotential and claims successes such as Staples and Calaway Golf, the \nNew Markets Venture Capital program will focus on smaller businesses \nthat show promise of financial and social returns, such as jobs--what \nwe call a ``double bottomline.''\n  To get at the complex and deep-rooted economic problems in new market \nareas, my initiative has three parts: a venture capital program to \nfunnel investment money into our poorest communities, a program to \nexpand the number of venture capital firms that are devoted to \ninvesting in such communities, and a mentoring program to link \nestablished, successful businesses with businesses and entrepreneurs in \nstagnant or deteriorating communities in order to facilitate the \nlearning curve.\n  What I'm trying to do as Ranking Member of the Small Business \nCommittee, and have been working with the SBA to achieve, is expand \ninvestment in our neediest communities by building on the economic \nactivity created by loans. I think one of the most effective ways to do \nthat is to spur venture capital investment in our neediest communities.\n  Building on part of the President's and Speaker Hastert's agreement, \nthis amendment secures full, mandatory funding for Round II empowerment \nzones. In Massachusetts--specifically Boston--this amounts to a little \nmore than $93 million. Now, I know many of my colleagues are in the \nsame boat because they have empowerment zones in their states--Ohio, \nSouth Carolina, Florida, California--but let me just give you the \nhistory of why this funding is so important. Funding for Round II \nempowerment zones started in 1998. So far, however, the money has \ndribbled in--only $6.6 million of the $100 million authorized over ten \nyears--and made it impossible for Boston, and other empowerment zones, \nto implement its plan for economic self-sufficiency. In Boston, 80 \npublic and private entities, from universities to technology companies \nto banks to local government, showed incredible community spirit and \ncommitted to matching the EZ money, eight to one. Let me say it another \nway--these groups agreed to match the $100 million in Federal \nEmpowerment Zone money with $800 million. Yet, and regrettably so, in \nspite of this incredible alliance, the city of Boston has not been able \nto tap into that leveraged money and implement the strategic plan \nbecause Congress hasn't held its part of the bargain. I am extremely \npleased that we were able to find a way to provide full, steady funding \nto these zones. That money means education, daycare, transportation and \nbasic health care in areas--in Massachusetts that includes 57,000 \nresidents who live in Roxbury, Dorchester and Mattipan--where almost 50 \npercent of the children are living in poverty and nearly half the \nresidents over 25 don't even have a high school diploma.\n  Mr. President, this bill goes further than funding empowerment zones \nand establishing incentives to attract venture capital into distressed \ncommunities. It enhances education opportunities, creates individual \ndevelopment accounts to help low-income families save and invest in \ntheir future, increases affordable housing, improves access to \ntechnology in our classrooms and creates incentives to help communities \nremediate brownfields.\n  I thank my colleagues for their work on this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \namendment which I have cosponsored with the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nusing the 5 minutes that have been generously allocated to me by the \nDemocratic leader.\n  I am proud today to join with a distinguished and diverse coalition \nof Senators--Senators Santorum, Abraham, Hutchinson, and DeWine; and my \nfellow Democrats, Senators Kohl, Kerry, Torricelli, and Landrieu--in \noffering this amendment which we believe is a groundbreaking package to \nhelp low-income Americans into the economic mainstream. This is a truly \nbipartisan approach to bring economic revitalization to American \ncommunities and families.\n  The truth is that we could not have broken this ground if we did not \nfirst find common ground. For that we are grateful for the leadership \nof President Clinton and Speaker Hastert, who reached across the \npartisan divide to make this project a top priority.\n  I think the amendment that we offer today is a model of cooperation \nand innovation. It combines much of the President's new markets \ninitiative with the Republican-initiated American Community Renewal \nAct, and blends them into a progressive new synthesis for stimulating \ninvestment, entrepreneurship, and economic opportunity in poorer parts \nof our country.\n  This bill encompasses the range of the Clinton-Hastert plan with a \nfew key additions which we think will make an outstanding package even \nbetter.\n  One important addition is aimed at fixing America's asset liability \nor, to be more precise, closing the growing gap in asset ownership in \nthis country which separates millions of low-income Americans from \ntheir fair shot at the American dream.\n  We believe that one of the best ways to help close this gap is to \npromote the use of individual development accounts, known as IDAs. \nBanks and credit unions that offer these special savings accounts match \nthe deposits dollar-for-dollar, and in return account holders commit to \nuse the proceeds to buy a home, upgrade their education, or start a \nbusiness, in other words, to build assets.\n  The only problem with IDA programs that I see is that there are not \nenough of them. This addition to the Clinton-Hastert proposal will now \nprovide the support to make that happen.\n  Another important addition to this package, that, again, reflects \nbipartisan cooperation in support of economically distressed \ncommunities, is the full funding of the existing 20 second round \nempowerment zones.\n  We believe this amendment reaffirms and reinforces some old American \nideals, including strengthening communities, rewarding work, and \nencouraging responsibility.\n  I would say, in developing this package, and in offering it as an \namendment today, it is our primary objective to continue working in a \nbipartisan manner. To that end, Senator Santorum, and I, along with the \nother cosponsors, recognize the need to continue a dialog on the \ncharitable choice expansion provisions in this package.\n  Specifically, we are prepared to work to narrow the scope of the \nexpansion to a limited number of appropriate programs, building on the \ncharitable choice precedent that Congress established in TANF, the \nwelfare-to-work programs, in welfare reform.\n  I also understand that some of my colleagues, and others, have \nexpressed concern about the provision that would allow groups receiving \nFederal money to require their employees to adhere to the ``religious \ntenets and teachings of\n\n[[Page S6651]]\n\nthe organizations'' provisions. I understand their concerns and look \nforward to working with them as this bill, hopefully, receives \nindependent consideration.\n  There is too much good in this proposal that has broad bipartisan \nsupport that will be fundamentally helpful to poor people in \ncommunities in America to have the proposal fail for one or two \nrelatively small parts of it.\n  So I say to my colleagues that we are committed to working with \nMembers from both sides of the aisle, with the administration, and with \nthose community-based and faith-based organizations in the field, \nworking in these communities, to come up with an agreement that can be \npassed and signed into law by the President this year.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nConnecticut for his words. I regret to say that I rise in opposition to \nthe new markets initiative as it is currently structured. I agree with \nthe Senator from Connecticut. With additional work, we can find common \nground. It is critically important that we pass a new markets \ninitiative. My staff has been working for some time with several other \noffices on a bill that reflects the compromise the President and the \nSpeaker entered into. This bill is going to be dropped next week, and I \nwelcome input from all offices on both sides of the aisle.\n  This is complicated tax policy, and it ought to go through the \nFinance Committee. We ought to have a hearing. In the House, the \nCommittee on Ways and Means is working a bill to mark up, and we ought \nto be doing the same thing.\n  I regret that the characterization of this bill is one that I cannot \nagree with at this particular moment. It seems to me it adds too much \nto the renewal communities at the expense of the already established \nempowerment zones.\n  Most importantly, the legislation as it is currently drafted would \nallow every recipient of Federal grant funds to discriminate against \nthose they hire based on the applicant's religion. This Chamber has \nfought for the last 40 years to eliminate discrimination. I simply \ncannot support legislation that turns back the clock.\n  With that, I yield such time as I have remaining to the distinguished \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator Robb in \nopposing the Santorum-Lieberman amendment. I support the new markets \ninitiative promoted by the President and Speaker Hastert, but I think \nit is important for my colleagues to understand that this amendment is \nnot the President's initiative. No one is arguing against reform, not \nat all. But to introduce a factor that permits religious \ndiscrimination--it does do that--to enter into these evaluations as to \nwho can participate, will we see a sign that says ``no people of this \nfaith allowed'' or ``only people of that faith allowed.'' I hardly \nthink that is an improvement, regardless of the fact that there may be \nsome modest, or perhaps more than that, improvements made in the way \nthe new markets initiative operates.\n  The fact is, we should not be introducing an opportunity to \ndiscriminate against one group or another, not to set religious \nboundaries on how an organization performs these services, how they \nencourage people to strike out for themselves and to be able to make a \nliving on their own.\n  I hope our colleagues will examine this amendment seriously. Hidden \nin the good that it is doing is some, I would call, possible serious \nevil. We ought not to be, in this Chamber, saluting the ability of \norganizations to discriminate against one person or another based on \ntheir religious preferences.\n  With that, I hope we will not support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, all time having been yielded back on this \nparticular amendment, I raise a point of order that the pending \namendment would decrease Social Security surpluses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator from Virginia \nthat the Senator from Pennsylvania has time remaining.\n  Mr. ROBB. I apologize. I thought the Senator from Pennsylvania had \ncompleted his presentation. I will withhold until he has completed his \npresentation.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield 45 seconds to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment. I am a cosponsor \nof the legislation that it embodies. I believe this is the kind of \ndirection we should pursue to try to revitalize parts of this country \nwhich require assistance to be completed on parts of our overall \neconomic progress and growth as a Nation.\n  I am particularly pleased that included in this is our new \nmillenniums classroom component which will make it far easier for \nschools in this country to gain access to the computer technology they \nneed to make sure that the digital divide, as we call it, is closed, so \nthat opportunities for people to gain the training and skills they need \nwith respect to our new high-tech world will be available to them.\n  I compliment the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from \nConnecticut for their work on this and look forward to working with \nthem to secure its ultimate passage and enactment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I have two final comments. I want to \nmention some of the people who today let us know that they are \nsupporting this amendment: The National Association of Home Builders, \nthe Chamber of Commerce, the Credit Union National Association, \nAmerican Bar Association, the Corporation for Enterprise Development, \nto name a few.\n  With regard to the charitable choice language, I certainly understand \nthe concerns. The Vice President, the nominee of the Democratic Party, \ndoes not share the concerns voiced by many Members on the other side. I \nunderstand the White House has some concerns about the breadth of \nprograms covered.\n  I said to Secretary Sperling, I am very willing to negotiate those \nand put a list together and limit those covered, but the charitable \nchoice provisions are very broadly supported, I must say.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, all time now having expired, I raise a point \nof order that the pending amendment would decrease Social Security \nsurpluses and therefore violates section 311(a)(2)(B) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I move to waive the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question will be placed in the stacked \nvotes for tomorrow.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3837\n\n (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the \n   unified credit exemption and the qualified family-owned business \n  interest deduction, to increase, expand, and simplify the child and \n dependent care tax credit, to expand the adoption credit for special \nneeds children, to provide incentives for employer-provided child care, \n                        and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself, Mr. \n     Wellstone, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. Kennedy, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 3837.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n\n[[Page S6652]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this is the child care tax credit and \nrelated issues amendment. I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, \nmy colleague from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, my colleague from \nLouisiana, Senator Landrieu, Senator Kohl of Wisconsin, Senator \nKennedy, and others who may be interested in supporting this.\n  This is an amendment we have discussed and debated in the past. It \nwould expand the current dependent care tax credit to allow parents to \nclaim credit for a greater percentage of their child care expenses. The \namendment would also make this credit refundable so that low-income \nfamilies who have child care bills but little or no tax liability can \nbenefit. The amendment also extends the refundable tax credit to stay-\nat-home parents.\n  This amendment reaches across the entire spectrum of family \nsituations, recognizing the tremendous burdens that parents today are \nfacing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article that appeared on July 6 in \nthe Washington Post, entitled ``A Cost Squeeze in Child Care; Families \nWonder Where the Aid Is,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     A Cost Squeeze in Child Care: Familis Wonder Where the Aid Is\n\n                          (By Dale Russakoff)\n\n       Debra Harris, a single mother, quit her $34,000-a-year job \n     as an occupational therapist for the summer because she can't \n     afford full-time care for her two children.\n       Kathy Popino, a receptionist, and her electrician husband \n     have gone into debt to keep their toddler and 8-year-old in \n     child care at the YMCA, after a bad experience with a lower-\n     priced home caregiver.\n       Mary O'Mara, a computer network administrator, and her \n     husband, a factory worker, have junked the conventional \n     wisdom of ``pay your mortgage first.'' They sometimes pay a \n     late fee on their home loan to cover child care first, lest \n     they lose coveted spaces in a center they trust.\n       Child care is in slow-motion crisis for middle-income \n     families, and Middlesex County, N.J., is in the thick of it. \n     With three of four mothers working outside the home-near the \n     national average--this swath of suburbs dramatizes the cost \n     of working families of the national political consensus that \n     child care is a private, not public, responsibility.\n       For 30 years, politicians have promised to shift the burden \n     for families in the middle, and with little result. Vice \n     President Gore recently called for tens of billions of \n     dollars in spending and tax breaks over a decade to improve \n     care from infancy through adolescence--a proposal advocates \n     called impressive in its reach, but short on resources and \n     details.\n       Texas Gov. George W. Bush has proposed initiatives only for \n     the poor, saying working families can apply his proposed \n     income tax cut to child care bills.\n       Would-be beneficiaries here had a feeling they'd heard that \n     before. ``I was so hopeful when the Clintons came in,'' said \n     Popino, 34. ``I saw Hillary as a working mom's best friend. I \n     remember she said, `It takes a village.' Okay, it's been \n     eight years. When are they going to get to my village?''\n       The politics of welfare reform has focused national \n     attention and money on the vast child care needs of women in \n     poverty, which remain unmet. And the economic boom is helping \n     affluent families pay full-time nannies or the $800- to \n     $1,000-a-month fees at new, high-quality centers.\n       But with a record 64 percent of mothers of preschoolers now \n     employed, and day care ranked by the Census Bureau as the \n     biggest expense of young families after food and housing, \n     officials say middle-income families routinely are priced out \n     of licensed centers and homes. The median income for \n     families with two children is $45,500 annually, according \n     to the Census Bureau.\n       ``Basically, we have a market that isn't working,'' said \n     Lynn White, executive director of the National Child Care \n     Association, which represents 7,000 providers.\n       In a booming economy in which almost any job pays better, \n     day care centers now lose a third to more than half of their \n     staffs each year, and licensed home caregivers have quit in \n     droves, according to national surveys.\n       The average starting wage for assistant day care teachers \n     nationally rose 1 cent in eight years--to $6 an hour. Weekly \n     tuition at centers in six cities rose 19 percent to 83 \n     percent in the same period, as states tightened regulations.\n       Most industrialized countries invested heavily in early-\n     childhood care as women surged into the work force in the \n     1970s, but Congress and a succession of presidents left the \n     system here mostly to the marketplace, directly subsidizing \n     only the poorest of the poor.\n       A federal child care tax credit, enacted in 1976, saves \n     working families $3 billion, but advocates say it has fallen \n     far behind inflation. (It saved Debra Harris $980 last year, \n     leaving her cost at more than $7,000.)\n       When the military faced the same crisis of quality, \n     affordability and supply a decade ago, Congress took a \n     strikingly different approach. It financed a multibillion-\n     dollar reform in the name of retaining top recruits and \n     investing in future ones.\n       The result was a system of tightly enforced, high-quality \n     standards for day care, home care and before- and after-\n     school care. It included continual training of workers and \n     more generous pay and benefits.\n       Advocates hail the system as a model. With 200,000 children \n     in care, it costs an average of $7,200 a child, which the \n     government subsidizes by income.\n       ``The best chance a family has to be guaranteed affordable \n     and high-quality care in this country is to join the \n     military,'' concluded an analysis by the National Women's Law \n     Center.\n       Debra Harris used to drop her kids at Pumpkin Patch Child \n     Development Center in working-class Avenel every morning at 7 \n     in a weathered Ford Escort. She popped buttered bagels in the \n     center's microwave for their breakfasts before heading to \n     Jersey City, where she was a school occupational therapist.\n       A bus took, Whitney, 9, and Frankie, 7, to school and \n     brought them back at day's end to Pumpkin Patch, which they \n     complained was cramped and a bit boring. Their mother \n     considered it the safest and best care she could afford.\n       This summer, though, Whitney and Frankie's needs would have \n     grown from before- and after-school care (total: $440 a \n     month) to full-day care at Pumpkin Patch's camp (total: \n     $1,400 a month). Harris recently went back over the math, \n     incredulous at the results.\n       ``I can make $25 an hour on a per-diem basis,'' she said. \n     ``If I work 40 hours a week, that's $4,000 a month, $3,200 \n     after taxes. If I take out $1,400 for my mortgage and $1,400 \n     for full-time day care, that leaves $400--$100 a week to buy \n     food and gas, pay bills, go to the shore on the weekend. This \n     is crazy!''\n       So Harris decided to quit her job for the summer, find \n     part-time work and draw down her savings.\n       At 30, Harris prides herself on providing for her children \n     ``without ever using the welfare system,  thank God,'' \n     despite difficulties that include an ex-husband who is \n     more than $6,000 behind in child support, according to her \n     records.\n       Child care was easier when she was married, and not just \n     because of her husband's paycheck, Harris said. Early in \n     their marriage, they were stationed in Germany with the Air \n     Force and had access to German-subsidized child care. They \n     paid $40 a month per child for full-time care in a stately, \n     19th-century building within walking distance of their home.\n       ``I find it really discouraging that my own government says \n     I shouldn't need help with child care,'' Harris said. ``Now \n     is when I really need some help.''\n       The first time Washington tried to help--and failed--was \n     1971. Congress passed a $2 billion program to help \n     communities develop child care for working families, but \n     President Richard M. Nixon vetoed it as ill-conceived, \n     writing in his veto message that it would ``commit the vast \n     moral authority of the National Government to the side of \n     communal approaches to child-rearing over . . . the family-\n     centered approach.''\n       Mothers of school-age children kept going to work anyway. \n     In 1947, 27 percent were employed at least part time; in \n     1960, it was 43 percent; in 1980, 64 percent; in 1998, 78 \n     percent. State governments took the lead in setting child \n     care standards, which vary dramatically, as do fees and \n     quality.\n       In the late 1980s, with the number of children in care \n     surging, Congress again took up the cause of middle-income as \n     well as poor families. The resulting Act for Better \n     Childcare, signed by then-President George Bush in 1990, \n     vastly increased aid to the poor, whose needs were the most \n     urgent. But middle-income families were left out.\n       Poor families' needs became even more pressing in 1996 with \n     the passage of welfare reform, which sent women from \n     assistance rolls to the work force. A federal child care \n     block grant aimed at families making up to 85 percent of a \n     state's median income is going overwhelmingly to families in \n     or near poverty, reaching only 1 in 10 eligible children, \n     according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human \n     Services.\n       In 1998, President Clinton moved to expand the child care \n     tax credit but was blocked by Republicans who said it \n     slighted mothers who stayed home with their children.\n       This election year could be different, several analysts \n     said. Although most voters care less about child care than \n     Social Security and taxes, the issue rates highest with women \n     younger than 50, particularly those under 30, a crucial \n     voting bloc for both Bush and Gore.\n       Unlike 1996, when these women were solidly for Clinton, \n     their concerns now have political cachet, according to Andrew \n     Kohut of the Pew Research Center for the People and the \n     Press.\n       At the same time, advocates are linking quality child care \n     to school readiness, hoping to tap into the national focus on \n     education. They emphasize that the government subsidizes \n     higher education for all families, but not ``early ed,'' as \n     they call child care, which hits young families, who have \n     fewer resources.\n       Another political impetus comes from recen reports of the \n     U.S. military program's success. Newspaper editorials in \n     almost every region of the country asked why the civilian \n     world can't have the same quality child care.\n\n[[Page S6653]]\n\n       Kathy Popino has been asking for years. Her husband, \n     Warren, was in the Coast Guard when their son, Matthew, was \n     born, and they paid $75 a month--subsidized by the Department \n     of Defense--to a home caregiver trained by the DOD. ``She was \n     wonderful. The military inspected all the time,'' Popino \n     said.\n       When Warren left the Coast Guard to become an electrican, \n     they moved to Metuchen, N.J., but couldn't find licensed care \n     at even twice that price. They opted for an unlicensed home \n     caregiver who cared for Matthew for $80 a month, along with \n     two other children.\n       But Matthew, then 2, began crying nights, and ``his \n     personality did a 180,'' Kathy said. Unable to sleep herself \n     or concentrate at work, Kathy moved him to a state-of-the-art \n     KinderCare Learning Center they couldn't afford. ``Visa \n     became our best friend,'' she said.\n       Ultimately, they moved him to the YMCA, where they now pay \n     about $800 a month for high-quality, full-time care for \n     Gillian, 1\\1/2\\, and after-school care for Matthew, 8. The \n     program there includes weekly swim lessons, daily sports and \n     homework help in spacious, sun-filled rooms.\n       In the process, Popino has developed a keen class \n     consciousness. ``When summer camp starts, you pay every \n     Monday, and everybody who pays with credit cards walks out to \n     our used cars we owe money on. The people paying by check \n     walk out and get in their new Lexus,'' she said.\n       The Y's fees are lower than prices at similar, for-profit \n     centers, but cost pressures are rising as the labor market \n     tightens. Child care director Rose Cushing said turnover \n     rates are well over 30 percent, even with the agency paying \n     health benefits to its teachers.\n       Twenty minutes south on U.S. Route 1, at Pumpkin Patch, \n     where fees, teacher pay and the facilities are more modest, \n     proprietor Michelle Alling has held on to four of her head \n     teachers for five years, mainly because of their loyalty to \n     the children.\n       On a recent morning, as one teacher baked chocolate-chip \n     cookies with flour-blotched 3- and 4-year-olds, Alling \n     acknowledged that they all desperately needed higher wages.\n       But ``then you have families literally handing you their \n     entire paycheck,'' she said, ``and where does it come from?''\n       Mary O'Mara, the mother who sometimes makes ends meet by \n     paying late fees on her mortgage, said politicians who look \n     past this issue must live in a different world than hers. She \n     wishes she could show them what she showed her mother, who \n     used to tell her to relax and stay home with her children.\n       ``I sat her down with a calculator, and I gave her a \n     month's worth of bills--food, mortgage, child care, \n     gasoline,'' O'Mara said. ``There was almost nothing left, and \n     that's with two middle-class incomes.\n       ``She looked at me like she didn't believe it. She said, `I \n     didn't realize how tough it was out there.' ''\n\n  Mr. DODD. I won't read the entire article, but it cites case after \ncase after case of middle and lower-income families being squeezed \nevery single day to trying to handle the cost of child care, \nparticularly for infants.\n  One mother says: I could make $25 dollars an hour on a per diem \nbasis. If I worked 40 hours a week, that is $4,000 a month, $3,200 \nafter taxes.\n  If I take out $1,400 for my mortgage and $1,400 for full-time day \ncare, that leaves $400--$100 a week to buy food, gas, and pay bills for \nmy family. Most families simply can not get by on that. I will put up a \nquick chart for colleagues to peruse. It lays out the costs of child \ncare in various cities in the country. For example, infant care in \nBoston is over $11,000 a year. If you are a parent earning $30,000 a \nyear and have a 1-year-old and a 3-year-old, you are spending from a \nthird to a half of your income on child care. That is before you try to \npay the rent and put food on the table.\n  The current child care tax credit helps, but not as much as it could \nfor the reality of the child care market. The maximum a family can \nclaim is $720 a year for one child. Double that for two. That is not an \ninsignificant amount, but it is not enough to make up the $8,000 child \ncare bill that a middle-income family can be paying.\n  By making this credit refundable, families with incomes around \n$20,000 or less can benefit. If you are in that income level, you have \nlittle or no tax liability--making the tax credit refundable is the \nonly way you can help these families.\n  I emphasize again that under this amendment, stay-at-home parents \nwith children under the age of 1 could claim a credit of up to $500. \nThis new credit would also be refundable. So here we are dealing with \nstay-at-home parents, working parents, and, as my colleague from \nLouisiana will shortly point out, dealing also with adoption issues. \nAlso, Senator Kohl has included in this amendment a provision to deal \nwith employers and incentives for them to offer better child care for \nemployees.\n  Here we are in the midst of this bill which will provide help to \n44,000 Americans. That is the universe that is going to be benefited by \nthis. In contrast, this amendment would help 8 million families. Choose \nup sides: 44,000 people who will pay an estate tax, or 8 million \nworking people who have incomes in that $20,000 $30,000, $40,000, \n$50,000 range--the expansion of the credit goes to families under \n$60,000. These are middle-income families in America, with young kids, \ntrying to pay child care.\n  I will end on this note. I was at a hospital in Baltimore today. I \ntook a family member there. A woman was talking to a fellow employee, \nand I overheard the conversation. She thought she got the best break in \nthe world. She figured out that for one of her two children--she \ncouldn't afford to send both--child care would be $100 a week. That is \n$400 a month for that one child. But she can't send both, not as a \nworking mother who earns around $20,000.\n  We ought to be able to do better. If we are going to provide tax \nrelief for 44,000 of the wealthiest Americans, why don't we try to do \nsomething good here for the working families, as Senator Snowe and \nother Members have proposed in the past? The Expanding and making the \ndependent care tax credit refundable would really make a difference for \nthe 8 million working families who have true child care needs. I have \nraised this issue on countless occasions. This is an opportunity to do \nsomething about it.\n  I yield to my colleagues.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time do we have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized, and \nthere are 4 minutes 15 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, one thing about this god-awful process \nis there is not enough time to talk about this legislation. I will take \nless than 2 minutes, and my colleague from Louisiana will have 2 \nminutes.\n  Senator Dodd outlined this amendment. Both of us have worked in this \narea. I think making this tax credit refundable is hugely important. I \nthink the fact that some of the money applies to parents who are at \nhome is hugely important. I think going up from $10,000 to $30,000 and \nthen up from $30,000 to $60,000 cuts across a broad section of the \npopulation.\n\n  I have no doubt that 99.9 percent of the people in Minnesota, if \ngiven the choice between the tax break our Republican colleagues are \ntalking about, the estate tax break that goes to the wealthiest 2 or 3 \npercent of the population, versus a focus on helping families with \nchild care expenses, working families and low-income families--I want \nto use that label as well--would say let's put the money into child \ncare. That is what this amendment calls for.\n  This is just a matter of priorities. It is just crazy to be talking \nabout this giveaway to the wealthiest 2 or 3 percent and not making the \ninvestment in affordable child care for families in our States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleague tonight \nto discuss an important amendment. Let me just talk about the \nunderlying amendment for just a moment.\n  There were 523 families in Louisiana who paid the estate tax last \nyear. I am one of the nine Democrats who are willing to talk about some \nsignificant relief because some parts of the tax are clearly unfair, \nand the Democratic alternative we have offered, I am convinced, would \nhelp bring relief to many of those families who have small businesses \nand family farms.\n  To go where the Republican leadership in the House wants to take us \nwould lead us to a place where we can't provide any help to many other \nfamilies--as my colleague pointed out, the 8 million middle-income \nfamilies who need help with child care--and we could not provide for \nthe businesses across this Nation. Small business is struggling. Tax \nrelief for health insurance is something which our colleague from \nIllinois has championed on many occasions. We could not expand the \nearned-income tax credit.\n  So let's try to be fair in this debate and give some estate tax \nrelief and give us some opportunities to do other things.\n\n[[Page S6654]]\n\n  In my last minute, that brings me to my point on the adoption tax \ncredit. Americans, in record numbers, are opening their hearts and \nhomes to more children. Last year, 100,000 American families opened \ntheir hearts and homes to children throughout the United States and \nfrom abroad.\n  Several years ago, Congress gave an important tax credit of $5,000. \nThis amendment will extend that tax credit but will almost double it \nfor families who adopt children with special needs. There are over \n500,000 children in foster care in America. We need to promote adoption \nand permanency. This will be a great incentive for families to do that. \nSo I am happy to join my colleagues on this. It costs so little, but it \nwould mean so much and would go such a long way in helping to \nstrengthen families, relieve tax burdens on the general public, and \ngive these children an opportunity to be raised in a loving home.\n  I will soon yield back the remainder of my time. It will be just a \nsmall amount. If we do this estate tax relief right, we could do the \nadoption tax credit, the child care credit, and the health insurance \nfor businesses. I hope we will, in the end, accomplish that goal.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Iowa, who \ngraciously allowed us to step ahead of him in line this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, first of all, I note the incredible paradox \nthat this wonderful amendment offered by our dear colleague from \nConnecticut was in the Republican tax bill that Bill Clinton vetoed \nlast year. I wish our colleagues had supported that bill, and I wish \nthey had helped us override the President's veto.\n  I have two simple responses here. One, it is true that if you count \nup the number of people affected by his amendment, Senator Dodd has \nmore numbers. But the point is, he is asking us to forgo repealing the \ndeath tax so that families will continue to work a lifetime to build up \na business or a family farm, pay taxes on every dollar they earn; yet, \nwhen they die, their children have to sell off the farm or the business \nin order to give this tax to the Government. We would repeal the tax. \nHe would take funds from it for another purpose.\n  So when we talk about somebody's home, somebody's farm, somebody's \nbusiness, and the fact that there are a larger number of people who \nwould like to have their home or business, I am not surprised by that, \nnor am I overwhelmed by it. Almost any robber anywhere would say, ``I \nhad six children and he had two; I had a gun and he had a wallet.''\n  That is my first point.\n  My second point is that the $5 billion they spend here is $5 billion \nthat was allocated to the Finance Committee to allow us to repeal the \nmarriage penalty for people who get the earned-income tax credit.\n  There was no point of order against this amendment because it has \ntaken the $5 billion that we were going to use in repealing the \nmarriage penalty to see that people who get the earned-income tax \ncredit don't lose that earned-income tax credit when they get married.\n  Let me give you an example. A janitor with three children meets a \nwaitress with two children. They are both working. They are both low \nincome. They both get the earned-income tax credit. They meet and they \nfall in love. They have the answers to their prayers--a father for the \nchildren and a mother for the children. They get married. What happens? \nThey both lose their earned-income tax credit. They are in the 28-\npercent tax bracket. So, as a result, they decide not to get married.\n  It is a crazy policy. We want to repeal it. We are going to repeal it \ntomorrow.\n  But our ability to fund the earned-income tax credit so they can keep \nthe earned-income tax credit and not move into the 28-percent bracket \nis made possible by the $5 billion that this amendment will take away \nfrom the Finance Committee.\n  The question you have to ask is not does the Senator's amendment do \nany good. It does good. But the question is, Is it worth taking away \nthe earned-income tax credit from working poor people who are trying to \nbetter their lives? Is it worth forcing people to sell their farm and \nsell their business that their parents spent a lifetime building up as \na way of funding it?\n  I think this is a proposal that has merit. We wrote it into the \nRepublican tax package last year that the President vetoed. But I don't \nthink we ought to eliminate EITC relief for working people who get \nmarried to fund this proposal, which is what it does.\n  Second, the amendment also keeps part of the death tax in place. Why \nis that dangerous? They argue that at least we are reducing it. They \nare. But do you remember in 1993 when the President was putting \ntogether his tax increase, and one of the ideas he floated was lowering \nthe deduction from $600,000 to $200,000?\n  Does anybody doubt that unless we kill the death tax, get rid of it \nand pull it out by the roots, that the next time we have a Democrat \nPresident and a Democrat Congress we are going to end up as we were in \n1993 with this deduction back down to $600,000, $400,000, or $200,000?\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I believe this is an amendment that should be defeated.\n  If I have any time, I would love to yield to my dear friend.\n  Mr. DODD. My point is, I am for making clear changes in the estate \ntax proposal. I think all of us are.\n  Could I ask for 30 additional seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. You have proposed a tax break that costs $750 billion in \nthe second 10 years. It seems to me that we ought to be able to find \nsome room for child care for which 8 million people will benefit.\n  People should remember what my colleague and friend from Texas says--\nhelp out those 43,000 richest Americans.\n  Mr. GRAMM. There is one difference. No matter how many of them there \nare, it is their home. It is their business. It is their farm. They \nbuilt it up. It belongs to them. You are taking it away from them to \ngive it to somebody else that it doesn't belong to. I don't care how \nmany there are.\n  Mr. DODD. We can help them and we can also carve $5 billion out of a \n$750,000 billion tax break to help 8 million Americans?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes under leader \ntime.\n  For the information of my colleague from Connecticut, I think that a \npoint of order lies against the bill. That will be made again by the \nchairman of the Budget Committee tomorrow after it has been checked. We \nhaven't had enough time to review the amendment. For example, we are \ntalking about changing child care tax credits.\n  I ask my colleagues from Connecticut: Is this a refundable tax credit \nas proposed?\n  Mr. DODD. It is refundable, and covers those who stay at home as \nwell.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, if it is a refundable credit, we have now \nturned a tax cut into a spending bill, I would assume spending billions \nof dollars.\n  Again, we haven't had a chance to review the amendment. We haven't \nhad it scored. We will review it. We will find out if a point of order \nlies against it. I happen to think that one does. We will find out when \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee makes that decision tomorrow. If \nit is a refundable tax credit, it is a spending bill.\n  This is a way for Uncle Sam to be writing checks. This is a way for \nus to be spending more money. I question the wisdom of doing that, \nespecially without a chance to review it and consider it.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will, but not right now. I want to move on and finish \nthis bill tonight.\n  Again, I compliment my colleague from Delaware and my colleague from \nNew York. I personally haven't agreed with the process under which we \nare considering this bill. I compliment the managers for their \npatience. The hour is late. I think we still have two or three other \namendments to consider. I\n\n[[Page S6655]]\n\nhope we can finish those. We can vote on these tomorrow. We can pass \nthis bill tomorrow, and I hope lay the predicate and foundation for \npassing the elimination of the marriage penalty as well. If so, we will \nhave done a couple of days of good work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the next amendment \nis the amendment of the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, might I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Connecticut be given 2 minutes to respond?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will not take 2 minutes.\n  As my colleague notes, this amendment would make the child care tax \ncredit refundable--that's one of its strongest points. My friend from \nTexas said we adopted a similar provision in the tax proposal offered \nby the Republicans a year or so ago. That's not true. It was not \nrefundable and would not have benefited lower-income families. There is \na significant difference.\n  Refundability is important because as it stands now the tax break we \nare talking about is not terribly meaningful for families earning less \nthan $20-$25,000. Refundability is the only way to help people in that \nincome level.\n  I mentioned earlier that I was listening to a woman today who was \nsaying how happy she was that she found child care for one of her two \nchildren for $100 a week. That is $5,200 a year. She makes, according \nto her, about $25,000 or $30,000 a year. That is a quarter of her gross \nincome going to care for one child. Without refundability, the current \ntax credit really doesn't mean much to her. It is simply inequitable to \ndeny her a tax credit that families at higher incomes with the same \ntype of child care expenses enjoy.\n  If we can find the time, as we have for a day and a half, to debate a \nbill that would assist 43,000 or 44,000 people, can't we carve out a \nplace in a $750 billion tax break for 8 million working people in this \ncountry who are trying to raise their children under very difficult \ncircumstances. That is the purpose of the amendment.\n  I suspect it does suffer a potential point of order. We will make our \nmotion at the time. But I hope my colleagues will be supportive.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If you are making it a refundable credit, you are making \nthis more of a priority than health care. You are saying this is a more \nimportant item than food, in some cases, because you are having the \nFederal Government write a check to pay for it. We don't do that with \nhealth care.\n  I understand your desire to do some things for child health care. We \nhappen to agree with much of that because we passed it last year in the \nbill the President vetoed. But now you are trying to make it refundable \nby having Uncle Sam write a check for it. I personally think you are \ngoing too far with that amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask for an 15 additional seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. My point is this: Raising children in this country in \naffordable, decent circumstances is about as basic as it gets. Eight \nmillion Americans can benefit from this amendment. This is a good \ninvestment for our country. With a $750 billion tax break for 43,000 \npeople, I think we ought to be able to do something for 8 million \nworking families with young children.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, did not our Democrat colleague from New \nYork ask that both sides get 2 minutes?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I surely wish to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Give me 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, 30 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, what we are talking about here is basically \na setting of priorities. Do we want to take money away from eliminating \nthe marriage penalty in the earned-income tax credit for working \nfamilies to give a tax credit for a noble purpose? In fact, a purpose \nthat we had written into our tax bill last year that the President \nvetoed. That is what we are debating: priorities.\n  We set aside the $5 billion in the budget to fund earned-income tax \ncredit for the elimination of the marriage penalty. If we spend it \nhere, we cannot do it tomorrow.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3841\n\n    (Purpose: To provide for pension reform, and for other purposes)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nDelaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Roth] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3841.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment which addresses \na very important topic for many Americans--retirement savings.\n  Many Americans, especially Boomers, increasingly worry: Will I have \nenough to live on when I retire? According to recent studies, one third \nof Americans are not confident that they will have enough to live on in \ntheir retirement years, and for others that optimism about retirement \nincome may not be well founded.\n  Savings--whether through employer retirement plans or as personal \nsavings--are necessary for a comfortable retirement.\n  Overall savings by Americans are at an all time low. The U.S. \nDepartment of Commerce stated that Americans' personal savings rate for \nthe first half of 1999 fell below zero.\n  I believe, and many economists agree, that increasing tax incentives \nfor savings will result in more savings.\n  The amendment I offer provides many tax incentives which will result \nin greater savings. Let me outline just a few of them.\n  The maximum contribution limit for IRAs both traditional IRAs and \nRoth IRAs is $2,000. This limit, which has been in place since 1982, \nhas never been indexed for inflation. According to the Joint Committee \non Taxation, If the IRA limit were indexed for inflation it would be \nover $5,000.\n  This amendment increases the contribution limit for all IRAs (both \ntraditional IRAs and Roth IRAs) to $5,000 per year and under that \namount for inflation.\n  It is important to remember that people at all income levels make IRA \ncontributions.\n  An estimated 26 percent of American households now own a traditional \nIRA. In 1993 (the most recent year for which comprehensive aggregate \ndata is available) 52 percent of all IRA owners earned less than \n$50,000.\n  We know that people at all income levels are limited by the $2,000 \ncap on contributions. For example, IRS statistics show that the average \ncontribution level in 1993 for people with less than $20,000 in income \nwas $1,500.\n  Lower income people clearly want to make contributions of more than \nthe $2,000 limit.\n  This amendment also increases other benefit limitations. Currently, \nthe maximum pre-tax contribution to a 401(k) plan or a 403(b) annuity \nis $10,000.\n  In addition, the maximum contribution to a 457(b) plan, a plan for \nemployees of government and tax exempt organizations is $8,000.\n  Finally, the maximum contribution to a simple plan, a simplified \ndefined contribution plan available only to small employers, is $6,000.\n  This amendment increases limits for 401(k), 403(b) and 457 plans to \n$15,000 and for simple plans to $10,000.\n  This does not mean that business executives can automatically take \nadvantage of these higher contribution limits; lower income employees \nmust benefit in order for the executive to benefit.\n  Consequently, business owners and high paid employees cannot benefit \nwith this new higher contribution limits unless the amount of savings \nthat low paid people make--either on their\n\n[[Page S6656]]\n\nown or with the help of the employer--increases.\n  This amendment adds a new type of employer savings plan.\n  We heard testimony before the Finance Committee that the first year \nof the Roth IRA was a success. And we have all seen the television and \nprint ads touting the benefits of the Roth IRA. The opportunity for \ntax-free investment returns has clearly caught the fancy of the \nAmerican people.\n  In less than five months after the Roth IRA became available, \napproximately 3 percent of American households owned a Roth IRA.\n  In addition, the survey found that the typical Roth IRA owner was 37 \nyears old, significantly younger than the traditional IRA owner who is \nabout 50 years old, and that 30 percent of Roth IRA owners indicated \nthat the Roth IRA was the first IRA they had ever owned.\n  This amendment intends to harness the power of the Roth IRA and give \nit to participants in 401(k) plans and 403(b) plans.\n  We will give companies the opportunity to give participants in 401(k) \nplans and 403(b) plans the ability to contribute to these plans on an \nafter-tax basis, with the earnings on such contributions being tax-free \nwhen distributed, like the Roth IRA.\n  This amendment will also provide an additional savings opportunity to \nthose individuals who are close to retirement.\n  We all know that there can be other pressing financial needs earlier \nin life--school loans, home loans, taking time off to raise the kids--\nwhich limit the amount that we may have available to save for \nretirement.\n  The closer that we get to retirement, the more we want to put away \nfor those years when we are not working.\n  However, the current law limitations on how much may be contributed \nto tax qualified savings vehicles may restrict people's ability to save \nat this time in their lives.\n  This amendment will give those who are near retirement--age 50--the \nopportunity to contribute an additional amount in excess of the annual \nlimits equal to an additional 50% of the annual limit.\n  Catch-up contributions will be allowed in 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans, \n457(b) plans and IRAs.\n  For IRAs, this will mean that someone age 50 could contribute $7,500 \neach year rather than $5,000.\n  Never before have Americans had better opportunities to provide for a \ncomfortable retirement--with a strong economy together with increasing \nopportunities for saving and investment.\n  The result of this amendment will be more personal savings to assist \npeople in providing for a comfortable retirement.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield back all time on this side on the Roth amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Iowa is to be recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time am I recognized for?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3840\n\n  (Purpose: To protect and provide resources for the Social Security \n System, to amend title II of the Social Security Act to eliminate the \n``motherhood penalty,'' increase the widow's and widower's benefit and \n  to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the unified \n   credit exemption and the qualified family-owned business interest \n                   deduction, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I call up amendment 3840 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, and Mr. \n     Feingold, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. Leahy, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3840.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, women in America have made significant \nstrides for equality and fair treatment. They have more opportunities \nand face less discrimination. However, there are still gross \ninequities, and this is particularly true in Social Security.\n  The average Social Security benefit received by a man is modest, \nabout $10,508 on average in 1998. But for the 21 million American women \nwho depend on Social Security, their average benefit is over 25 percent \nless, just $7,836 a year. That is 25 percent less to pay for \nprescription drugs; 25 percent less to pay for food; and 25 percent \nless to pay for the rent and utilities.\n  Largely as a result of these lower Social Security benefits, elderly \nwomen are twice as likely to be poor than older men. Fully, 19 percent \nof single older women--those who have been widowed, divorced, or never \nmarried--live in poverty.\n  There are a number of reasons for this. Women live longer than men. \nWomen earn less during their working years due to wage discrimination \nand other factors. And women reach retirement with smaller pensions and \nother assets than men.\n  Parts of the problem lie with the Social Security itself. Our \namendment that I have offered on behalf of myself, Senator Feingold, \nSenator Mikulski, Senator Leahy, and Senator Murray, tries to fix two \nof these problems in Social Security.\n  First, under current law, when a man dies, his widow sees only 50 to \n66 percent of the couple's previous combined Social Security benefit. \nIn one day, her basic income is cut by as much as half. However, the \nofficial poverty rate for a single person is 79 percent of that for a \ncouple. That means that experts have determined it takes about 79 \npercent of a couple's income for a single person to maintain a minimum \nstandard of living.\n  So the current widow's benefit forces many older women into poverty \nupon the death of their spouse. Our amendment would change that by \nincreasing the Social Security survivors' benefit to at least 75 \npercent of the combined benefits of the husband and wife. This simple \nchange will provide a greatly needed boost to more than 3 million low- \nand moderate-income widows and widowers.\n  The second part of our amendment addresses the Social Security \nmotherhood penalty. The motherhood penalty is just this. In Social \nSecurity, it provides lower benefits for women who take time off their \njobs to raise their children or to care for a sick parent. Our \namendment would eliminate this penalty by allowing people to take time \nout of the workforce to raise a child or to care for a dependent \nrelative, and to eliminate up to 5 years of zero or very low earnings \nfrom those used to calculate their future Social Security benefits.\n  Social Security benefits are based on your average earnings over 35 \nyears. This generally works for men who spend an average of 39 years in \nthe workforce. When Social Security was established in 1935, most women \nstayed at home. It was assumed most women would get benefits through \ntheir husbands. The 35-year average formula fails to recognize that \ntoday an increasing number of women work but also take time off to \nraise children. Thus, the average woman is in the workforce 27 years \ntoday. The other 8 years are counted as earning zero dollars, resulting \nin lower benefits. Our amendment recognizes the importance of care \ngiving, of women taking time out of the workforce to have children, and \nallows up to 5 years of zero or lower earnings to be exempted when \ncalculating future retirement benefits.\n  I will just give a brief example. Suppose you have a woman who worked \nthroughout her life but took time off to raise three children. She \nworked for a total of 30 years, retired at age 65. In those 30 years \nshe averaged $20,000 a year in earnings.\n  But since she had 5 years with no earnings while caring for her \nchildren, her lifetime average earnings calculated on a 35-year formula \nis $17,142.\n\n[[Page S6657]]\n\nThis entitles her to an annual Social Security benefit of $9,369. Under \nour amendment she would be allowed to erase those 5 zero-earning years, \nbringing her lifetime average back up to $20,000. As a result, her \nannual benefits would be increased by about $800, a significant and \nneeded boost.\n  The motherhood penalty will become increasingly important as more \nwomen receive benefits based on their own earnings. Today, about 37 \npercent of women receive Social Security benefits based on their own \nearnings rather than getting the spousal benefit. But this is expected \nto rise to 60 percent over the next two generations, by 2060.\n  Finally, the third part of our amendment makes a major contribution \nto shoring up Social Security for the future. What we do is dedicate \nthe interest savings from paying off the national debt to Social \nSecurity. By doing this, we are using good economic times to prepare \nfor the future. These interest savings are substantial, totaling about \n$120 billion this decade, and growing to $250 billion a year by 2015. \nThis simple step of locking away these savings for Social Security \nwould assure Social Security's fiscal health for the next 50 years. \nWhat we are saying is when we buy down the national debt, the savings \nin the interest payments on that, which would normally go to general \nrevenues, will go to Social Security and not to general revenues.\n  Again, our amendment offers a clear choice. If you want to make \nSocial Security sound and secure for the next 50 years, you should vote \nfor this amendment. If you want to do away with the motherhood penalty \nand make sure that women have their proper years counted so we do not \ndiscriminate against them for raising children, then I think you should \nvote for this amendment. If you think millions of moderate-income women \ndeserve a financial boost, making sure they get at least 75 percent of \ntheir spouse's benefits rather than the 50 to 66 percent they get now, \nand get a lot of women over that poverty line, I think you should vote \nfor this amendment.\n  There are three parts to this amendment: Do away with the motherhood \npenalty; second, make sure the spousal benefits are at least 75 percent \nof their spouse's upon death; third, use the savings from the interest \npayments to put into Social Security rather than general revenues.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 55 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield the remainder of the time to the cosponsor of the \namendment, the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as we on this side of the aisle have \nmade clear, this debate is about priorities. The majority has made \nclear that its highest priority is to expand tax breaks for the \nwealthiest 2 percent of the population.\n  Yes some sensible reforms are in order to the estate tax, and the \nDemocratic alternative, which our amendment incorporates, would make \nthose.\n  But shouldn't our first and highest priority for using our surplus be \nextending the life of Social Security? Our amendment would do that, as \nwell.\n  Thirdly, our amendment would make much-needed improvements in Social \nSecurity benefits for widows and those who take time out of the \nworkforce to raise their children.\n  As President Kennedy said in his 1962 state of the Union address, \n``[T]he time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining,'' This \nyear, the Social Security Trust Fund is taking in nearly $100 billion \nmore in payroll tax revenues that it pays out in Social Security \nbenefits, building up assets. It will continue to do so for pretty much \nthe entire decade.\n  But then, in the next decade, as the baby boom generation begins to \nretire in numbers, that cash surplus will shrink. Starting in 2015, the \ncost of Social Security benefits is projected to exceed payroll tax \nrevenues. Under current projections, this annual cash deficit will grow \nso that by 2036, Social Security will pay out a trillion dollars more \nin benefits that it takes in in payroll taxes. By 2037, the Trust Fund \nwill have consumed all of its assets.\n  We as a Nation have made a promise to workers that Social Security \nwill be there for them when they retire. Our Nation's commitment to \nSocial Security will not go away. We should start planning for that \nfuture.\n  The Social Security Trustees released their last annual actuarial \nreport at the end of March. That report indicated that to maintain \nsolvency of the Social Security Trust Fund for 75 years, we need to \ntake actions equivalent to raising payroll tax receipts by 1.89 percent \nof payroll or making equivalent cuts in benefits. In 2037, annual \nSocial Security tax revenues will be sufficient to cover 72 percent of \nannual expenditures.\n  The Trustees' report sounds a warning: We can fix the Social Security \nprogram so that it will remain solvent for 75 years if we make changes \nnow in either taxes or benefits equivalent to less than 2 percent of \nour payroll taxes. But if we wait until 2037, we would need the \nequivalent of a 28 percent cut in benefits to set the program right. \nPut another way, if we wait until the trust funds run out of assets in \n2037, we will need to make changes equal to an increase in the payroll \ntax rate of 5.4 percentage points, to set the program right.\n  The choice is clear: Small changes now or big changes later. That's \nwhy Social Security reform is important, and why it is important now.\n  And that's why President Clinton was right when in his 1998 State of \nthe Union Address, he said, ``What should we do with this projected \nsurplus? I have a simple four-word answer; Save Social Security \nfirst.''\n  That's why it doesn't make sense to enact either tax cuts or spending \nmeasures that would spend the non-Social Security surplus before we've \naddressed Social Security for the long run. Before we enter into new \nobligations, we need to make sure that we have the resources to meet \nthe commitments we already have.\n  The complete repeal of the estate tax before us today would head in \nthe opposite direction. It could cost $750 billion a decade, when it if \nfully phased in. These costs would begin to hit most heavily in the \ndecade after 2011, just when the baby boom generation will begin to \nretire in large numbers, just when the financial pressures on Social \nSecurity will begin to mount.\n  It would be irresponsible to enact a tax cut of this size before \ndoing anything about Social Security. Before the Senate passes major \ntax cuts like the one pending today, the Senate should do first things \nfirst. And that's what this amendment does. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, our colleagues have just introduced the \nGore plan to extend Social Security by giving the Social Security \nAdministration a bunch of new IOUs. Of course, the IOUs are from the \nsame Government that is going to have to pay the Social Security \nbenefits in the future.\n  We currently have $800 billion of paper IOUs in a steel filing \ncabinet in West Virginia. They represent the trust fund of Social \nSecurity. When Social Security takes in more taxes than it spends, this \ncomputer in West Virginia prints out this IOU, and the Government goes \non about its business and spends the money on something else. That \nsomething else can be any other Government program, or buying down the \ndebt of the Treasury. But the Social Security Administration gets the \nIOUs.\n  What we are hearing here is a new gimmick, where you give them the \nIOU and then maybe you buy down debt, maybe not, but you still give \nthem another IOU. Then that IOU earns interest and you get another IOU.\n  Let me go back and start at the beginning. Let me quote President \nClinton in his year 2000 budget. I know it is late, but I hope my \ncolleagues will listen to this quote.\n\n       These Social Security trust fund balances are available to \n     finance future benefit payments and other trust fund \n     expenditures--but only in a bookkeeping sense. These funds \n     are not set up to be pension funds, like the funds of private \n     pension plans. They do not consist of real economic assets \n     that can be drawn down in the future to fund benefits. \n     Instead, they are claims on the Treasury that, when redeemed, \n     will have to be financed by raising taxes, borrowing from the \n     public, or reducing the benefits--\n\n  Which means cutting Social Security benefits--\n\n\n[[Page S6658]]\n\n\n     or other expenditures. The existence of large trust fund \n     balances, therefore, does not, by itself, have any impact on \n     the Government's ability to pay benefits.\n\n  That is not me talking. That is President Bill Clinton from his \nfiscal year 2000 budget. What is he saying? This $800 billion of \nGovernment IOUs we have represents a debt of Government. So when the \nGovernment has to pay Social Security benefits in the future, they have \nan IOU and they can collect it. But who has to pay it? The same \nGovernment that collects it.\n  It is why I cannot write an IOU and put it on my balance sheet. The \nSenator from Oklahoma, when he was running Nickles Machine Corporation, \ncould not inflate his balance sheet by simply adding another IOU. \nPresident Clinton clearly explains that.\n  Our Vice President is saying: OK, I want to make Social Security \nsolvent for 50 more years--I do not know why he did not do 100 or 500--\nand the way I am going to do it is I am going to print up these IOUs \nthat say the Government owes the Government money, and they are going \nto put the IOUs in that filing cabinet in West Virginia.\n  Here is the problem. When they get them out to cash and they say: OK, \nthis IOU is for $100 billion; we will pay benefits with this. Who is \ngoing to pay the $100 billion? The Government has to pay the $100 \nbillion. To quote Bill Clinton, they have to raise taxes, borrow from \nthe public, they have to reduce benefits, which is cut Social Security \nbenefits, or they have to cut other expenditures. The point being this \nis a totally fraudulent proposal. It simply acts as if you can pay \nbenefits that the Government owes with an IOU that the Government owes.\n  The problem is there is no way the Government, with its own debt, can \npay anybody benefits because it has to pay its own debt first. All the \nVice President is proposing is that we commit future income taxes to \npay benefits in the future. How does that in any way improve the \nsolvency of Social Security? It does not, and this whole proposal \nshould be rejected.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Harkin \namendment.\n  The Harkin amendment would make changes to Social Security benefits. \nIt would: increase benefits to widows; and increase benefits for stay-\nat-home parents by attributing earnings to them while they stay home.\n  Mr. President, everyone wants to help moms and widows, especially \nduring election years, but Social Security is exactly the wrong tool \nfor the job.\n  The Harkin amendment would fail to provide meaningful assistance to \nthe people they are targeted to aid.\n  Worse, it would increase Social Security's unfunded liabilities by \nalmost a third, reduce Social Security trust fund balances by hundreds \nof billions, and accelerate the system cash-flow crisis.\n  Social Security is one of the few federal programs that already takes \nstay-at-home parents into account.\n  Under the current system, married spouses generally receive about the \nsame Social Security benefit regardless of whether they worked full-\ntime, part-time, took a break for child-rearing, or did not work at \nall.\n  For example, in 1996 women who receive Social Security benefits based \nupon their own work record received an average benefit of $657, while \nwomen whose benefits are based upon their husband's work record \nreceived $596, just a 10-percent difference [Social Security \nAdministration].\n  In other words, there is no motherhood penalty in Social Security.\n  If Senator Harkin wants to help mothers, why doesn't he embrace tax \nrelief like the Senate Marriage Tax Relief Act, which would allow \nparents to keep more of their income before it gets sent to Washington?\n  Instead, his proposal would take a program already under financial \ndistress and make it go broke faster.\n  Moreover, under the Harkin amendment, years after you've incurred the \nexpense and raised your children, you get a few more benefits from the \nFederal Government. Who pays for those benefits? You guessed it, your \nchildren. Not much of a deal.\n  The Harkin amendment is exactly the wrong solution to help stay-home \nparents.\n  Senator Harkin estimates this proposal would cost just a few billion \nover the next 10 years. That is a gross underestimate.\n  While the Social Security Administration has not estimated the \n``motherhood'' proposal, economist Henry Aaron offered a ``seat-of-the-\npants'' estimate in Slate Magazine [4/5/00] of .25 percent of taxable \nwages.\n  That's about $150 billion over 10 years.\n  Meanwhile, Senator Harkin's proposal to increase widow's benefits \nwould cost about .32 percent of taxable wages [Report of the 1994-1996 \nAdvisory Council on Social Security, Volume I: Findings and \nRecommendations, January 1997].\n  That translates into $166 billion over the next 10 years. Now the \nSenator has put a limit on his benefit, so it won't cost quite that \nmuch, but it is still substantial.\n  The Harkin amendment claims to pay for these new benefits by \ntransferring money from general funds to the Social Security trust \nfund.\n  The amount of the suggested transfers is staggering. Including \ninterest, it literally amounts to over 60 trillion dollars over the \nlife of the transfers--over sixty trillion dollars!\n  What do general fund transfers accomplish to help ease the burden \ntaxpayers face in coming years? Nothing.\n  What do the experts have to say about general fund transfers? \nPresident Clinton's Budget: ``These [trust fund] balances are available \nto finance future benefit payments and other trust fund expenditures \nbut only in a bookkeeping sense. These funds are not set up to be \npension funds, like the funds of private pension plans. They do not \nconsist of real economic assets that can be drawn down in the future to \nfund benefits. Instead, they are claims on the Treasury that, when \nredeemed, will have to be financed by raising taxes, borrowing from the \npublic, or reducing benefits or other expenditures. The existence of \nlarge trust fund balances, therefore, does not, by itself, have any \nimpact on the Government's ability to pay benefits.''\n  Congressional Budget Office: ``The Administration's proposals would \ncreate transactions between government accounts, but such intra-\ngovernmental transfers do not by themselves increase the resources \navailable to the government.''\n  Dan Crippen--Director of the Congressional Budget Office: ``Too many \nof us--from the President to members of Congress to my high school \nclassmates--believe the current balances in the Social Security trust \nfunds will help ease the burden on the children of the baby boomers. \nThat is, unfortunately, not true.''\n  Henry Aaron--Brookings Institute: ``The president proposes to deposit \ngovernment bonds to defray part of this unfunded liability, thereby \nputting a call on future general revenues--personal and corporation \nincome taxes--to pay for this unfunded liability,'' according to \ntestimony before the Ways and Means Committee, 2/2/99.\n  Mr. President, Senator Harkin's trust fund transfers are a fraud.\n  Whether the system is financed through payroll taxes or from general \nfunds, the Social Security system is poised to claim an increasing \nshare of future worker income. By 2075, that share is one-fifth of \ntaxable payroll--20 cents of every dollar a worker earns.\n  That 20 cents is taken before the other income taxes, sales taxes, \nand property taxes are collected to pay for national defense, policing \nthe streets, educating children, and other government services.\n  It also is assessed before the worker can purchase housing, clothing, \nfood, education, and transportation. All for a program that--in many \ncases--offers the worker less money than he or she contributed.\n  Meanwhile, expanding Social Security benefits when the program is \nalready going broke is wholly irresponsible.\n  As Robert Reischauer, former Congressional Budget Office Director, \nobserved about similar proposals. ``We still have a program that is \ngoing to face difficulties. Compounding those difficulties is not \nresponsible policy.''\n  The Harkin amendment is the worst sort of pandering. It pits one \ngeneration against another. Younger workers against older retirees. It \nshould be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes of leader time \nto speak on this amendment.\n\n[[Page S6659]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I mention to my colleagues, I think \neveryone is aware the minority leader yielded 5 minutes to his \ncolleagues on each of these minutes. I do not like to do it, but it is \nimportant to point out some of the facts. I appreciate my colleague \nfrom Texas pointing them out.\n  This amendment and the Vice President's proposal is one of the \nriskiest, maybe one of the most deceitful I have seen in my years in \nCongress. It basically says we should have double accounting of \ninterest. It says we are going to take the interest savings from debt \nreduction and apply that to Social Security, as if we are going to make \nSocial Security more solvent. It would not do that.\n  I will give some quotes from people who studied the proposal. One is \nfrom David Walker, Comptroller General of GAO:\n\n       [The Clinton-Gore proposal] does not come close to saving \n     Social Security.\n\n  The proposal he is referring to is the Clinton-Gore proposal.\n\n       Under the President's proposal, the changes to the Social \n     Security program will be more perceived than real: although \n     the trust funds will appear to have more resources as a \n     result of the proposal, nothing about the program has \n     changed.\n\n  Dan Crippen, Director of CBO:\n\n       Those transfers would have no effect on the ability of the \n     Federal Government to meet the obligations of those programs. \n     The transfer would not, as some have asserted, strengthen \n     Medicare or Social Security. At most, they might have the \n     opposite effect of imparting a false sense of security.\n\n  It is double accounting.\n  I have a statement from CBO's ``An Analysis of the President's \nBudgetary Proposals for Fiscal Year 2001.'' On page 67, it talks about \nthe interest savings transfers to Social Security. It says:\n\n       The Social Security trust funds already receive credits for \n     interest on their accumulated balances under current law.\n\n  They already get interest on the surpluses. That is already current \nlaw.\n  It continues:\n\n       The proposed transfers would simply add extra interest \n     credits on top of those that would be provided anyway. . . . \n     The transfers themselves would have no economic significance \n     because they would flow out of one government fund and into \n     another.\n\n  If we want to say we are making the Social Security fund more solvent \nby adding more IOUs, we should do what the Senator from Texas did. Why \nstop at $100 billion?\n  I read that the Senator's amendment will add $250 billion annually \nafter 2015. Why not right now? Let's just add $5 trillion. We have \nabout $10 trillion of unfunded liability in Social Security. Let's just \nsay we have a Government IOU, $10 trillion. It is fully funded. In the \nyear 2012 or 2015, there is going to be a shortage. There is going to \nbe more money going out than coming in, and those IOUs will not be able \nto pay one check--not one.\n  At that point in time, the Government is going to have to borrow more \nmoney, raise taxes, or cut benefits. In other words, we have not \nchanged the program, and putting in more IOUs will not pay one benefit, \nwill not pay one Social Security check. If my colleagues are interested \nin the solvency--my colleague is saying let's also increase benefits; \nlet's increase retirement benefits; let's increase survivor benefits; \nlet's increase benefits for people not paying into the system and \nincrease survivor benefits, none of which had hearings before the \nFinance Committee.\n\n  Talk about being irresponsible and playing politics with Social \nSecurity. This amendment does it in the worst way. This amendment needs \nto fail and, frankly, the Vice President should be ashamed of this \nproposal. I hope our colleagues will vote against it, and I urge our \ncolleagues to vote against it tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If all time has expired on that amendment, I would like to \nbe recognized----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will use it for a small rebuttal. I \nnoticed my friends on the other side going after the Social Security \ntrust funds. The Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Grams, had an amendment to \nput money into the Social Security trust fund, and they all voted for \nit. So much for being consistent around here.\n  Quite frankly, I listen to the arguments on the other side, and I \nthink my friends from the other side want to privatize Social Security. \nOn top of that, they want to say you do not get Social Security until \nyou are 70. They want to raise the retirement age.\n  Don't let all that fog over there cloud what we are trying to do. We \nare trying to change the motherhood penalty so women are not penalized \nraising children and getting Social Security.\n  Secondly, our amendment says widows ought to get at least 75 percent \nof their spousal benefit, rather than the 50 to 60 percent now.\n  Lastly, when we pay down the national debt, you are right, take the \nsavings from that and stick it into Social Security so that money will \nbe there for future generations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 25 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, maybe my colleague from Iowa did not \nunderstand what we voted on earlier. Earlier we voted on repeal of the \ntax on Social Security which was passed by the Clinton-Gore \nadministration, passed by Vice President Gore because he broke the tie, \npassed by every Democrat, but not one Republican voted for it. We had \n58 votes, I believe, in the Senate to repeal it today. Those are the \nfacts.\n  There was a tax increase on Social Security that passed in 1993, and \nit was passed by every Democrat. Today we had an overwhelming majority \nwho voted to repeal it. Those are the facts.\n  Now we have an amendment before us that says let's double count \ninterest savings even though we count the interest on Social Security \nsurpluses. Let's double count and let's pretend that is going to make \nSocial Security more solvent and, in the process, let's add a whole \nbunch of new benefits and see if we can't buy more votes and tell \npeople we are going to give them something even though they know it is \nnot going to happen. It has not been considered in the Finance \nCommittee and Ways and Means Committee. Even though they know it is \nirresponsible and Social Security has big problems coming up in 13, 14 \nyears, they say: Let's put more IOUs in and pretend it will make it \nmore solvent. The budget experts say it will not work. The President in \nhis own budget statement said it will not work.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I do not have any time left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has no time left on this \namendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, let me read the exact language of the \nGrams amendment.\n\n       Revenue offset.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     transfer, for each fiscal year, from the general fund in the \n     Treasury to the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund \n     established under section 1817 of the Social Security Act . . \n     . an amount equal to the decrease in revenues to the Treasury \n     for such fiscal year by reason of the amendment made by this \n     section.\n\n  I rest my case. They all voted for it transferring money from General \nTreasury to Social Security. That is the Grams amendment. They all \nvoted for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nfor me to offer the Lott amendment on the list at this time and that I \nbe allowed to yield back all the time and that the vote occur in the \nsequence to follow the Bayh amendment as previously ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3842\n\n                    (Purpose: To provide tax relief)\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk and yield \nback all time that is allotted.\n\n[[Page S6660]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], for Mr. Lott, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 3842.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I want to ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIndiana is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3843\n\n (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the \n   unified credit exemption and the qualified family-owned business \n interest deduction and provide a long-term care credit, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nmyself, and Senators Durbin, Feingold, Mikulski, Kohl, Biden and \nGraham, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Bayh] for himself, Mr. \n     Durbin, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Biden, and \n     Mr. Graham, proposes an amendment numbered 3843.\n\n  Mr. BAYH. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise to support our amendment because it \nnot only provides for substantial estate tax relief, but it also \nprovides for substantial tax cuts for millions of American families, in \nproviding for long-term care for sick and elderly dependents, and also \nprovides for important tax relief for millions of American families who \nwork hard, play by the rules, are self-employed, but struggle to meet \nthe costs of health insurance.\n  I express my appreciation to my colleagues, Senator Durbin, Senator \nFeingold, and others, for their leadership in bringing us to this \npoint, and for their support of these critical and important steps.\n  I want to make clear that I strongly support the cause of providing \nfor estate tax relief. That is why I am delighted to say that our \napproach provides, when fully implemented, that 99.3 percent of the \nAmerican people--99.3 percent--will be entirely exempt from any estate \ntaxes in our country.\n  This means that fully 95 percent of farms that would currently be \nsubject to the estate tax have their estate tax liability eliminated \nentirely, and 75 percent of small businesses currently subject to the \nestate tax will have their estate tax liability eliminated entirely.\n  In a perfect world, I would also support the elimination of the other \none-tenth of 1 percent of families in our country who will still be \nsubject to the estate tax. But we have other priorities which must also \nbe met.\n  One of the foremost among these is the fact that currently 2.6 \nmillion families across our country struggle to provide care for a \nsick, elderly parent in their home. This figure is expected to \nskyrocket in the coming years because, among other facts, those in our \ncountry over the age of 65 will more than double during that period of \ntime.\n\n  We find too many families today caught in what we refer to as the \n``sandwich generation,'' struggling not only to provide for their \nchildren, pay the mortgage, put food on the table, but also to care for \na sick, elderly parent or grandparent. It is not right in our country \nthat families must be forced to choose between caring for a child or \ncaring for a parent. They deserve tax relief, too.\n  That is exactly what our bill would do, providing up to a $3,000 tax \ncredit every year, once fully phased in, to help alleviate those \nburdens, allowing families to meet all of their priorities, and \nparticularly to provide for long-term care for a sick, elderly parent \nor other dependent.\n  Likewise, it is not right that so many of our families currently work \nand struggle to provide for the cost of health insurance. Just last \nyear, one million fewer Americans had health insurance, and many of \nthese are self-employed. Under our approach, we would accelerate the \nfull deductibility for the cost of health insurance for those who are \nself-employed to next year, providing an additional 2 years of tax \nrelief for hard-working Americans.\n  In conclusion, let me say this. It has been eloquently stated by our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle that death should not be a \ntaxable event, and they are right. But it is equally true no family in \nour country should face the painful dilemma of providing care for their \nchildren or care for their parents. That is not right. They deserve our \nhelp. They deserve tax cuts, too.\n  It is not right that hard-working Americans, who play by the rules, \npay their taxes, and get up and go to work every day, struggle to make \nends meet, and provide for health care. They deserve tax cuts. They \ndeserve our help, too.\n  That is exactly what our bill would provide. It meets our priorities, \nit is financially responsible, and it is true to our enduring values. \nThat is why I encourage my colleagues to adopt this important \namendment.\n  I now yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Illinois, my friend and \ncolleague, Mr. Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Indiana for his \nleadership. I fully support his amendment.\n  For those who are trying to understand what is happening on the floor \nof the Senate, allow me to give a summary of the game to this point.\n  The Republican leadership has come forward with a basic proposal to \neliminate the estate tax. They have suggested that we should take $850 \nbillion over the next 20 years and dedicate it to eliminating the tax \nliability for 44,000 of the wealthiest Americans in our Nation. They \nbelieve that is our highest priority. When they look at our Tax Code, \nthe Republicans have concluded the greatest inequity in America's taxes \nis the tax paid by less than 2 percent of our population.\n  They have decided that the most deserving group for tax relief in \nAmerica today are 44,000 of the wealthiest people in our Nation. That \nis their decision. That is their priority. They have made it clear with \nevery single vote.\n  We have come forward and said we can reform the estate tax so that \nvirtually two-thirds of those currently paying will not have any \nliability and still have money left to do important things.\n  We said to the Republican side of the aisle: Will you join us in \nallowing families to deduct college education expenses for their kids \nas part of it?\n  No, they said, we are not interested.\n  Will you join us in a prescription drug benefit for seniors as part \nof the relief that we are going to offer in this?\n  No, they are not interested.\n  Will you join us in child care relief so that families can afford to \nhave safe and quality child care?\n  No, they are not interested. Their only interest is in protecting the \n44,000 wealthiest people in this country.\n  What Senator Bayh is offering in this amendment is a long-term care \ntax assistance package which every family with an aging parent can \nunderstand, which every family that faces that responsibility will \nclearly understand. This is family oriented. It will affect literally \nmillions.\n  My portion of this amendment will affect 13 percent of the workforce. \nIt will allow the self-employed businesses across America--those are \nfarmers and small businesses, by and large --to deduct immediately next \nyear their health insurance premiums paid for their employees instead \nof waiting an additional 2 years.\n\n[[Page S6661]]\n\n  Right now, the big corporations deduct all the expenses for the \nhealth insurance of their employees. Self-employed people cannot. When \nyou ask small businesses across America: What is your highest priority? \nit is not the elimination of the estate tax. The highest priority is \nthe cost of health insurance. And the second highest, I noticed this \nmorning, happens to be education and finding skilled and trained \nworkers.\n  So this amendment addresses not only an inequity in the Tax Code that \naffects literally millions in America--21 million self-employed \npeople--but it is also going to provide for those truly deserving, so \nthey can afford health insurance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. BAYH. I thank the Senator from Illinois and I yield 3 minutes to \nmy colleague and friend, the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I certainly thank the Senator from \nIndiana and the Senator from Illinois. I am delighted to be part of \nthis effort, as three States in the Midwest link together to fight for \nthis long-term care issue.\n  As the Senator from Illinois indicated, this debate all day and \nthroughout this week has been about priorities.\n  By moving this bill, the majority has made clear that its highest \npriority is to grant tax breaks to the wealthiest 2 percent of the \npopulation. But there are other priorities that I think are more \nimportant than that.\n  Yes, some sensible reforms are in order to the estate tax for middle-\nincome Americans and to address the special needs of small businesses \nand farmers. But we can do that and, by cutting back on the Republican \nplans tax cuts for the very wealthiest, still have money left over for \nother pressing needs.\n  One of our Nation's most pressing unmet needs is the acute and \ngrowing demand for help with long-term care. As our country's \npopulation ages and as Americans live longer lives, we face a major \nlong-term care challenge in the decades to come. And I do not think we \nare meeting it as a country. I think we talk about Medicare, we talk \nabout Social Security--and those are critical--but this is really the \nthird major piece that we are not adequately addressing.\n  Today, one in eight Americans are over the age of 65. By 2030, one in \nfive will be.\n  Today, 4 million Americans are over 85 years old. By 2030, more than \ntwice as many--9 million Americans--will be.\n  And already today, 54 million Americans--one in five--live with some \nkind of disability. One in ten copes with a severe disability.\n  The job of helping people with disabilities to deal the life falls \nheavily on the family. Four out of five primary helpers are relatives, \nand nearly half of these primary helpers live with the person with a \ndisability.\n  And the burden on the family is not just emotional, but also \nfinancial. More than three-quarters of Americans age 22 to 64 with \ndisabilities receive no public assistance.\n  The fact is, our Nation has no comprehensive long-term care system. \nRather, patients and their families struggle through a fragmented, \nuncoordinated, and costly labyrinth.\n  Millions of vulnerable Americans cannot get the care they need. They \ncannot afford it, they do not qualify for the limited public funding \navailable, or they simply cannot find the services they need.\n  Whenever people have a choice, they would rather get the long-term \ncare they need in their own homes. If they can't get care at home, \npeople want care as much like home as possible, in places like assisted \nliving facilities. Nearly 4 out of 5 older Americans who need long-term \ncare live in the community, and most receive no paid services.\n  This amendment would take one small, concrete step to help them out. \nMuch more than this step is needed. But let us at least take this step. \nI urge my Colleagues to support the amendment.\n  What the Bayh-Durbin-Feingold amendment and the other cosponsors are \ntrying to do and say is that instead of having this very narrow \npriority for the very wealthiest Americans, what we have to do is \naddress a true crisis that will only get worse and to do something to \nassist people with these very difficult costs.\n  I thank the Senator from Indiana for the time and especially for his \nleadership on this issue.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I thank Senator Feingold and Senator Durbin \nfor their eloquent advocacy of this important issue.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator has 25 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. BAYH. I yield back the remainder of my time, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, providing for America's long-term care needs \nis an important priority. An important way to help Americans provide \nfor their long-term care needs is by providing various tax incentives.\n  We have already addressed many of these long-term care tax incentives \nin other tax bills the Senate has voted on. More recently, the Senate \napproved the various tax incentives for long-term care insurance and \nprovided for an additional tax exemption for those who are caring for \ntheir parents who have long-term care needs.\n  Last year, the Senate approved a bill which would have provided tax \nincentives for long-term care insurance. Unfortunately, the President \nvetoed that bill. When we added these tax provisions to the managed \ncare bill, my friends on the other side opposed these incentives.\n  I think it is fair to say the Senate has shown its concern towards \nhelping Americans provide for long-term care. However, I must oppose \nthis legislation for it contains a basic defect. It is built on the \nDemocratic alternative to the House death tax repeal bill. In other \nwords, it strikes the House death tax repeal and replaces it with the \nDemocratic alternative.\n  For this reason, I oppose the amendment and urge my colleagues to \nvote against it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, a few comments. Our colleagues are \nproposing a tax credit for long-term health care. The Senate has passed \nthat in a couple of bills. We passed it on minimum wage. We passed it \non the Patients' Bill of Rights, giving an above-the-line deduction.\n  There is a difference between a deduction and a credit. By a credit, \nthey are saying: You should pay no taxes whatsoever. We are saying: You \nshould get a deduction. There is a difference. With a credit, you are \nsaying that is a better priority. The Federal Government has decided \nthat is a better priority than your health care because people don't \nget a credit for their health care deductions. We are going to say this \nis more important.\n  I think it is equally important. As a matter of fact, the bill we \npassed said we should have an above-the-line deduction for health care \nand for long-term health care costs. We want to encourage both. But to \nsay that one is more important than the other, as this bill does, by \nsaying that long-term health care is more important than health care \ninsurance, is a mistake. Most people would say they would rather have \nhealth care.\n  I noticed my colleague added expensing for self-employed. I am sure \nmy friends are aware that I am very much a proponent of that. We have \nled the fight to make that happen. Incidentally, we have already passed \nthat as well. We passed that on the minimum wage bill. We passed it on \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights. I assure my colleagues, before any \nminimum wage bill passes, this is going to be part of it.\n  What my colleagues are not telling people is, they are including with \nit an amendment that basically guts the estate tax provision that we \nhave in this bill. You go in and tell employers: We want to make sure \nthat you pay estate taxes. And if you pay estate taxes, your minimum \nrate, the beginning rate, under the Democrat proposal, is 37 percent. \nIf you have a taxable estate of $2 million, you will be paying 37 \npercent. I don't think they would think that is\n\n[[Page S6662]]\n\na very good deal. Small businesspeople would say: You didn't do me any \nfavors.\n  I urge my colleagues, at the appropriate time tomorrow, to vote \nagainst this amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWisconsin is recognized to offer an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3844\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3844.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To preserve budget surplus funds so that they might be \n     available to extend the life of Social Security and Medicare)\n\n       On page 2, line 16, after ``is hereby repealed'', insert \n     the following: ``for estates up to $100,000,000 in size''.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. It \nlimits the estate tax repeal for estates over $100 million.\n  As I mentioned earlier on the floor, this debate is about priorities. \nIn particular, it is a debate about where we should devote our \nresources. This amendment provides a clear, easily definable choice.\n  Many Members have indicated that reforming the estate tax, especially \nfor small businesses and farms, should be a priority of the body. I am \nsympathetic to that goal. Let's face it, Mr. President. This bill goes \nmuch further than addressing that targeted concern. As it rests now, \nthe bill leaps far beyond any commonsense definition of modest estates \nand provides massive tax relief to the extremely wealthy, even to \nmultimillionaires.\n  How can anyone suggest that providing such massive tax relief to \nmultimillionaires should be among our highest priorities? They seem to \nbe doing very well. There are millions of Americans who have more \npressing needs.\n  Fiscal prudence dictates that we exercise restraint in considering \nthe disposition of projected budget surpluses. First and foremost, of \ncourse, these surpluses may never materialize. But even granting or \nassuming they do, there are many competing needs for this limited pot \nof money. Providing a massive tax cut to estates of over $100 million \nis not the best, highest use of the projected surplus.\n  When we increase spending, we are implementing policies that benefit \nsome while increasing the fiscal burden on everyone else. We are \nengaged, of course, in a zero sum enterprise. There is limited money. \nMilton Friedman's famous quote is: Of course, there is no free lunch. \nThis is true of tax cuts as well.\n  Every time we lower our tax rate or create a new tax loophole, the \ntax burden on everyone else increases. Specific tax cuts or spending \nincreases come with a price. They come at the expense of other tax cuts \nor spending increases or they come at the expense of a higher national \ndebt.\n  Way too often, as we do our work, the choices we weigh are \nheartbreakingly difficult. They truly are. This is not one of those \ncases though. It may make some sense to increase the current exemption \non estates, but it makes no sense at all to repeal the estate tax for \nthe handful of estates over $100 million.\n  Mr. President, surely the supporters of estate tax cuts must agree \nthat eliminating the estate tax on the handful of estates of over $100 \nmillion is not our highest priority, or anywhere close to it. It is not \neven in the ballpark. When I first ran for the Senate back in 1992, the \ncentral issue of my campaign was reducing and, hopefully, eliminating \nthe Federal budget deficit --the result of a decade-long binge of self-\nindulgent fiscal policies. When I came into office, the deficit stood \nat about $340 billion. Today, we hope to have a balanced budget for the \nsecond year in a row. That, of course, is a remarkable achievement. It \ncame, in large part, because of the tough choices we made in 1993 and, \nto a lesser extent, in 1997. Nobody can credibly argue that our greatly \nimproved budget position, as well as the sustained economic growth we \nhave experienced, are not, in part, the result of the tough choices we \nmade.\n  I think it would be tragic if Congress now squandered all that has \nbeen achieved to appease a handful of enormously wealthy interests--\ninterests, it should be noted, that have been the greatest \nbeneficiaries of our strong economy and, thus, of the fiscal \nresponsibility shown in 1993.\n  This last point bears some emphasis because so often the tax cuts we \nhave seen proposed by the majority have the immediate effect of \nbenefiting the very well off in our society, while in fact the policy \nthat most benefits the well-to-do is fiscal restraint, not politically \nappealing tax policies.\n  Let's exercise just a little bit of restraint. It is a very modest \nproposal that we just cut this thing off at a $100 million estate. I \nhope my colleagues will consider adopting this amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the way I look at the Tax Code, I think \nit should be fair; it should be uniform. It is interesting to hear \npeople say: This tax only applies to 2 percent, so let's sock it to \nthem. They have been enormously successful. So what is the right rate? \nIs it 55 percent or 60 percent, as it is on Americans today? Are my \ncolleagues aware of the fact that if you have a $10 million taxable \nestate, the death tax is 60 percent?\n  I know my colleague says he picked a higher figure, $100 million, and \nthat is only 55 percent. Incidentally, he didn't mention it in his \ncomments, but he also eliminates the stepped-up basis. That means you \nwill have a much greater capital gains tax. So you have a 55-percent \nrate and you have capital gains. It is a really heavy hit. Uncle Sam \nwill get over half.\n  What is fair? It is easy to demagog and say those guys are supporting \ntax cuts for the wealthy. That is hogwash. What is fair? If somebody \nworks their entire life and has enormous success and builds up a \ncompany--and say it is worth $100 million, which is great--and the \nprincipal dies and their kids want to operate that plant, they don't \nwant to sell it. Uncle Sam is entitled to 55 percent of it? I don't \nthink so. What is fair about that or uniform about it? I don't think it \nmakes sense. Maybe they want to continue that.\n\n  I can think of a lot of businesses--for example, Bechtel Construction \nis one of the world's premier construction companies; it happens to be \na private business. I am sure it is worth a lot more than this. If the \nprincipal owner dies and his kids want to run it, the Government can \nsay, no, we want half. What is right about that? Maybe I shouldn't \nmention anybody by name. They have never contacted me on this issue.\n  My point is, where is the Government's right to say that? He said we \nare squandering ``our'' resources. How is that the Federal Government's \nresources? They are the ones who built up these companies, but the \nFederal Government is entitled to take over half of it when somebody \ndies? Don't say, well, those estates are getting away from taxes \nbecause, under our proposal, when the property is sold, they pay \ncapital gains. That rate is 20 percent; it is not 55 percent. To me, it \nis a lot more manageable. That is a taxable event just as it would be \non any American. But it is basically when the property is sold, not \nwhen somebody dies.\n  We want to eliminate the death tax for all Americans, not just \nwealthy Americans. They should not have to pay a tax on death. The \ntaxable event would be on the sale of the property--when and if they \nsell the property. The kids would receive the property and keep running \nthe business; there is no tax. If they sell the business, there is a \ntax. They pay capital gains.\n  Under my colleague's proposal, they pay a whole lot more tax because \nhe eliminates the stepped-up basis as well. You keep the extra high \nrates, and you also have no stepped-up basis and capital gain. So you \nhit them really hard.\n  Why don't we just make it 100 percent? Let's just eliminate anybody \nwho accumulates wealth that happens to be over $100 million. Then we \nwon't have\n\n[[Page S6663]]\n\nthe entrepreneurs; we won't have the Microsofts; we won't have the \nOracles or the other high-tech companies; we won't have the young \nentrepreneurs who are building and expanding these businesses in our \ncountry.\n  You can go to a lot of countries that don't have taxes on estates. It \nis pretty easy today to start a new business in high technology. You \ncan go to other countries easily because they want the entrepreneurs; \nthey will welcome them in because they realize that is the engine of a \ngrowing economy, and it is fantastic, so they will give great benefits.\n  We have one of the highest estate taxes in the world. Some of my \ncolleagues say: Let's only have it on the wealthy, successful people; \nwe will really sock it to them. I think that is really unfair. The Tax \nCode should be uniform and fair. As a matter of fact, I think of the \nConstitution where I read that the Tax Code should be uniform. Now when \npeople say we have to increase the exemption so much that we will sock \nit to the wealthy, the rates already at 55 percent--60 percent for some \nAmericans--that is way too high. We say, wait a minute, the Tax Code \nshould be uniform. Let's eliminate the tax on death on all Americans--\nnot just wealthy Americans but on all Americans--and have the taxable \nevent when the property is sold on wealthy Americans as well. They can \npay 20 percent just as any other American does.\n  To me, that is fair, uniform and, frankly, would probably raise more \nmoney because wealthy people have figured out lots of ways to get \naround estate taxes--through foundations and other little gimmicks. \nThey hire lots of attorneys and successful people and pay them lots of \nmoney every year to make sure they pay no tax.\n  It would be very interesting to know how much money is utilized--some \nsay wasted--but generated to avoid this tax or how many businesses \naren't expanded to avoid this tax.\n  If my colleague's amendment would pass, how many successful people \nwould flee to another country to expand their business and grow their \nbusiness so they would not be faced with the situation where they \nworked their entire life for success, and they happen to die, and Uncle \nSam says: Thank you very much; we want 55 percent. Thank you for your \nefforts, but those are ``our\" resources. Ours? The Government didn't \nbuild that company, but the Government is entitled to over half of the \nestate. The power to tax is the power to destroy.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment at the appropriate \ntime tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has 5 minutes 26 \nseconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in listening to the Senator from \nOklahoma, you would think I were up here proposing for the first time \nin American history that we implement an estate tax or that perhaps it \nwas something created in the heart of the 1960s as an extreme, liberal \nidea, and that finally the Republican majority were going to eliminate \nit.\n  That isn't the truth at all. The fact is, as I understand it, this \nkind of tax has been around for about a hundred years. When the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma condemns the idea of having some kind of limitation on a \ntax that has been there for decades and decades, in fact, I voted for \nit, and I assume the Senator from Oklahoma, on a number of occasions, \nvoted for increasing the exemption. He has not taken the position in \nthe past that it must be completely eliminated; otherwise, it is not \nworth increasing the exemption.\n  That is all this amendment does. It goes awfully high. My amendment \nsays we are going to completely eliminate the estate tax in estates of \nup to $100 million. In other words, this gentleman that the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma is concerned about leaving the United States, under my \nproposal, would have the first $100 million of his estate exempted. If \nhe is going to take off after the first $100 million is exempted, I \nreally question his business judgment. He has to leave the United \nStates because somehow he is going to be taxed over $100 million?\n  Let's face it--and I hate to use this term--but when you start \ntalking about over $100 million and having to pay some kind of tax, \njust as people have always had to pay in this country, the word \n``greed'' comes to mind rather than ``business judgment.'' There is no \nneed in the pressure of this society to provide an exemption to the \nestate tax on over $100 million. It would be absolutely clear. Under my \namendment, up to $100 million is still covered.\n  Why in the world can't people at that level at least help us out a \nlittle bit? Under current law, they are not getting this break anywhere \nnear this level. But I am suggesting once we hit this extreme level, \nthe real extreme idea here is to have no estate tax at all. That is the \npoint.\n  The question is, What should the exemption level be? I am suggesting \nthere is number up in the stratosphere. It is just absurd to provide \nthis kind of benefit.\n  I would suggest that almost any average American you would ask would \nsay, sure, if somebody is at that level, it is reasonable and fair to \nsay they ought to pay some estate tax.\n  That is all this amendment tries to do.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, again, I want to be very clear. I can \nthink of a female entrepreneur in Oklahoma building a business. It has \nbeen very successful. She built it basically from scratch. I am going \nto guess it is worth $100 million. For this hypothetical example, it is \nworth $100 million. I bet it is. This business has worldwide sales in \npies. She will know who I am talking about. They have had great \nsuccess.\n  The value of that company probably 20 years ago was probably less \nthan $1 million. Today, for this purpose, it is worth $100 million.\n  Let's say she is the sole owner of the company and she dies. Under \nthe Democrat proposal of my colleague from Wisconsin, the tax would be \n55 percent. Once you get to the higher levels, you don't get to phase \nin. That is $55 million--55 percent.\n  Under his proposal, also you would lose the stepped-up basis, which \nis kind of complicated. Basically, it means you go back to the zero \nbasis of what it was.\n  Since the value was almost $1 million, or nothing, 20 years ago, you \nare going to have to pay another 20 percent on top of that. For this \n$100 million corporation, say, her sole survivor who wants to inherit \nthis company and keep it running has to pay a tax bill in the \nneighborhood of about $75 million out of a $100 million company.\n  What is right about that? What is fair about that? Nothing, zero.\n  Again, taxes should be uniform. They should be fair.\n  This amendment is written to demagog. This amendment says: Yes. These \ntax cuts are really going to benefit people making even over $100 \nmillion.\n\n  My point is that the Tax Code should be fair and uniform. If we are \nnot going to have death taxes, they should not apply to anybody. \nConversely, if we eliminate the tax on death for everybody, including \nthe people over $100 million and under $100 million, all would pay \ncapital gains. So when and if that business is sold there would be a \ncapital gains tax. It would be 20 percent. If you have a $100 million \nbusiness, or gain in property, and they sell it, the Federal Government \nwould get $20 million.\n  Isn't that enough? Why in the world would my colleague think the \nFederal Government under present law and under my colleague's proposal \nshould get over 50 percent? Why would the Federal Government be \nentitled to 60 percent or 75 percent of that business under his \nproposal? He taxes them twice.\n  Under the proposal of my colleague from Wisconsin, the estate would \npay twice: once at the death based on the appraised value, and again \nwhen the asset is sold without a stepped-up basis.\n  You couldn't be more unfair. If you are going to go to 75 percent, \nwhy don't you make it 100 percent?\n  This idea of it being the resource of the Government when somebody \ndies belongs in the Kremlin. It doesn't belong in the United States.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I move to commit \nthe bill to the Finance Committee to report back forthwith with the \ntext of H.R. 8.\n\n[[Page S6664]]\n\n  I send the motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion will be received.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this motion, if adopted, sends the death tax \nrepeal directly to the President for signature. This avoids the \nuncertainty of a conference, expedites our tight floor schedule, and \nremoves the possibility that floor consideration of a conference report \ncould be delayed and blocked altogether.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all time on both sides be yielded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Akaka, and I wish to \nengage the floor managers of the bill--the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Roth, and the ranking member, Senator Moynihan--in a \ndiscussion on the eventual compromise for estate tax relief.\n  As the distinguished floor managers and all Senators are well aware, \nthe present strategy in this election year is for the Senate to pass \nH.R. 8 without any change. The majority will vote down all amendments \nand pass the bill in the exact form as received from the House. the \nSenate can thus avoid a conference with the House and send the bill \nimmediately to the President to be vetoed.\n  The President repeatedly has said that he will veto H.R. 8 in its \npresent form. But the President has added that he is willing to work \nwith the Congress on a bipartisan basis to enact appropriate estate tax \nrelief for small businesses and family farms. So, if any estate tax \nrelief is to be enacted this year, it will occur as part of an eventual \ncompromise on an omnibus legislative, tax, and spending package in \nSeptember.\n  Senator Akaka and I have raised with the distinguished floor managers \nthe need to expand eligibility for deferral and installment payment of \nthe estate tax.\n  Current law allows qualifying estates a 4-year deferral followed by \n10-year installment payment of the estate tax liability arising from \ncertain qualified interests in closely held businesses. The estate tax \nis not avoided or reduced but only deferred. The Treasury will receive \nthe same amount of tax with a discounted rate of interest, but the \nfamily gets a longer period to pay the tax. This relief has proven \nsuccessful in that closely held and family businesses can continue to \noperate and keep their workers employed while using business earnings \nto pay off the estate taxes.\n  The present deferral and installment payment relief was part of the \nSubchapter S Act of 1958. Congress in that Act used the same \neligibility requirement for Subchapter S tax treatment of closely held \nbusinesses and for estate tax relief. Years later, eligibility was \nbroadened for qualification under Subchapter S, but not for estate tax \nrelief. Current eligibility for estate tax relief is too narrowly \nrestricted.\n  When the expected year-end negotiations between Congress and the \nPresident turn to estate tax relief, would the distinguished bill \nmanagers seek to widen eligibility for deferral and installment payment \nfor closely held businesses?\n  Mr. AKAKA. If the senior Senator from Hawaii would allow me to \ninterject before the distinguished floor managers respond to his \nquestion, I wish to explain the need for this relief measure.\n  According to witnesses who have testified before Congress and tax \nexperts, the estate tax poses a dire problem for family-owned and \nclosely held businesses. The owners typically have all their assets \ntied up in the business, and they have re-invested all their profits to \nmake the business grow. When the owners die, the estate tax must be \npaid within 9 months and in many cases the families will have to sell \nthe businesses to pay the tax. With only 9 months to pay off the estate \ntax, the families are often forced to settle for whatever price they \ncan get. Now, rather than face such a fire sale, many business owners \nwill sell their businesses while they are still alive so that their \nfamilies can get a fair price. Many family-owned and closely held \nbusinesses do not show up on estate tax returns, because they have \nalready been sold off in anticipation of having to pay the tax.\n  Recognizing the liquidity problem that the estate tax imposes on \nclosely held businesses, the Treasury Department has suggested that the \nnumber of owners permissible in a qualifying business should be raised \nfrom 15 to 75 so that eligibility for estate tax deferral and \ninstallment payment can be consistent with Subchapter S qualification. \nIn the House, Representative Carolyn McCarthy, together with various \nmembers of the Small Business Committee and Representative Neil \nAbercrombie, have advocated this proposal as H.R. 4512. This is the \nproposal that Senator Inouye and I have raised with the distinguished \nfloor managers. Am I correct in my understanding that the senior \nSenator from Delaware and the senior Senator from New York will \nfavorably consider this proposal for inclusion in the eventual package \nof estate tax relief measures?\n  Mr. ROTH. The two Senators are correct in their understanding. I \npersonally do not believe that the federal estate tax should force the \nsale of closely held and family-owned businesses.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Senators from Hawaii have identified a true problem \nwith the estate tax, and they have proposed a very meritorious \nsolution. Let me assure the two Senators that I will do all I can to \ninclude this proposal in any estate tax relief measure.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the Senator from Delaware and the Senator from \nNew York for their kind response.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I, too, join in expressing my appreciation for the \ndistinguished floor managers' support.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the ``Death Tax \nElimination Act.'' This bill would reduce federal estate and gift tax \ncollections over the next nine years, followed by full repeal in the \ntenth year.\n  Many of my colleagues have come to the floor and made compelling \narguments for the elimination of the death tax. Many have argued that \nthe death tax is unfair and even immoral in a sense. The death tax \npenalizes the most productive in our society and discourages savings \nand investment.\n  Mr. President, I agree with all of these arguments. Each of these \narguments supply ample warrants for eliminating the death tax. And \nultimately, I have concluded the estate tax stunts continued economic \ngrowth and provides only very limited federal revenues. Simply put, the \nnegative economic and societal consequences of the death tax, coupled \nwith-- at best--very limited contributions to federal revenues simply \ndo not justify its continued existence.\n  So, what exactly does the collection of this tax mean to federal \nrevenues? In Fiscal Year 1999, the estate tax amounted to just 1.5 \npercent of all federal revenues, or $28 billion. While $28 billion sure \nsounds like a lot of money, when put in the context of overall federal \nrevenue, it is difficult to comprehend just how inconsequential this \namount really is. Given that, how can anyone make the argument that the \nestate tax is an essential part of our nation's tax code?\n  Mr. President, I said before that the limited benefits of the death \ntax do not justify its negative economic and societal consequences. \nWhat are these negative consequences? Studies indicate that the death \ntax results in lower savings, reduced capital accumulation, slower \neconomic growth, and fewer new jobs. These studies simply confirm what \nour own common sense should have already made plain: Confiscatory \ntaxes, such as the death tax, discourage industry and hurt the overall \neconomy.\n  Throughout this debate, I have heard my colleagues quote seemingly \ncontradictory statistics gleaned from different studies or economic \nexperts. I am not going to engage in that sort of discussion. Instead, \nI am going to focus on the stories of some of my constituents in Ohio \nto help confirm the facts that many studies and my own common sense \ntell me are true.\n  Like many of my colleagues, my office has received hundreds of \nletters from constituents and their families who have been or will be \naffected by the death tax. One farmer from a small town in Fulton \nCounty, Ohio wrote: ``. . . the `Death Tax' wrecks havoc on family \nfarms when parcels have to be sold to pay estate taxes to the \ngovernment. . . . We have paid our taxes on property, on our equipment, \non our income and when its time to transfer our properties to our \nchildren, we do not want them to have the added burden of\n\n[[Page S6665]]\n\nhaving to sell off assets to pay Uncle Sam.'' My staff followed up with \nthis constituent to find out more about his story. This particular \nfarmer, who is shy about having his name used, has been involved with \nagriculture his whole life. He grew up on a farm owned by his father. \nIn 1969, he purchased land of his own for about $700 per acre. Since \nthen, he continually has added land, and he now farms approximately 425 \nacres. In his words, he and his wife have sacrificed and ``skimped to \nmake sure it works.'' He is now 53 years-old, with three sons, all of \nwhom farm. When the time comes, he'd like to pass his farm on to his \nchildren. Unfortunately, his land and equipment are now too expensive \nto escape the death tax. Rather than become more efficient and perhaps \ngrow his farm further, this farmer has begun the process of estate \nplanning. If we do not eliminate this tax, it is quite likely that his \nsons will be forced to sell land and/or equipment to meet the tax bill. \nThis just isn't right.\n  A second story comes from Jerry Boes, of Antwerp, Ohio. Mr. Boes \nwrote: ``I have worked hard all my life and paid all my taxes on \neverything I own. Why does the government take away 50 percent of \nwhatever might remain upon my death?'' Again, my staff followed up with \nMr. Boes, who is now 62 years-old. It seems that around 15 years ago, \nhe saw an ad in the local newspaper for opportunities to own a \n``Subway'' sandwich shop franchise. He took a chance and almost lost \nhis home in the process. Mr. Boes now says this: ``I took chances, \nstuck my neck out and paid my taxes.'' It has indeed paid off for him. \nHe now owns six ``Subway'' stores and employs around 75 people on \naverage. I am happy to report that he was able to keep his house, too.\n  Mr. Boes' story is representative of our American entrepreneurial \nspirit. It is a fantastic example of many Americans' struggle to own \ntheir own businesses. Unfortunately, he may have done too well. When he \npasses away, he'd like to hand the business down to his children. But, \nbecause most of his assets are tied up in land and buildings, his \nchildren will be forced to sell about 50% of his assets to pay the \ndeath tax. He has tried to do some estate planning on at least two \ndifferent occasions to no avail. He has become so frustrated that he, \nand I quote, ``Just threw up my hands and gave up.'' Upon his death, I \nwonder what will become of his 75 employees?\n  Finally, there is a story of Erin Nyrop Glasgow from Dublin, Ohio. In \n1952, her parents started an electrical contracting business out of the \ntrunk of their car. They worked hard over the years to build up that \nbusiness. The Sterling Electric Company currently employs 40 people. \nAgain, this is another great story of our American entrepreneurial \nspirit--and one that we, as a nation, should be encouraging. In the \nearly 1990's, Erin's parents convinced her to take over the company. \nThey wanted to keep it in the family upon their passing. The death of \nErin's father and the fact that another local family-owned business was \nforced to sell upon the death of its founder, really caused her to \nbecome aware of the perils of the death tax.\n  Now, she spends thousands of dollars, practically on an annual basis, \nin estate planning. These dollars could be used to grow the business, \nbecome more efficient, or hire new employees. She views monthly finance \nreports with trepidation. She is happy to find out that Sterling \nElectric is profitable. But, it is, in her own words, ``A double-edged \nsword.'' The more profitable she is, the more she'll lose upon her \nmother's death. Again, this is just wrong. The federal government \nshould not, on the one hand, encourage businesses to grow and be more \nand more profitable, while on the other hand, threaten the loss of a \nfamily business for becoming too successful.\n  Mr. President, these stories tell more about the regressiveness and \nthe simply unfair nature of the death tax better than any think tank \nstudy. Right now, we have an opportunity to eliminate this burdensome \ntax. This is an opportunity we simply should not miss. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill, and I thank the Chair and yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to make a few comments regarding \nthe need to repeal the estate tax. The United States has had an estate \nor death tax of some form since 1916. The current version of the death \ntax came into existence after the Tax Reform act of 1976. This change \ncombined the estate and gift tax structures in one gift and estate tax \nsystem, which is essentially a wealth transfer tax. Of course, that's \nwhat many on the other side stand for--they want to transfer your money \nto the federal government so they can decide how your money will be \nspent.\n  The Public Interest Institute at Iowa Wesleyan College has recently \nreleased a Policy Study entitled, ``A Declaration of Independence from \nDeath Taxation: A Bipartisan Appeal.'' The director of the Institute is \nDr. Don Racheter, who I know and respect very much. I'd like to thank \nDr. Don Racheter for his help with providing this information. The \nstudy was written by Edward McCaffery of the University of Southern \nCalifornia Law School and Richard Wagner of George Mason University. \nI'd like to just mention three points made by the study. These three \npoints show from both a liberal and conservative perspective that the \ndeath tax should be repealed.\n  First, we've heard the other side argue that this repeal really only \naffects the wealthiest of taxpayers. So, once again, the other side has \nrolled out the old, tired class warfare argument. The fact is the death \ntax affects nearly everyone, not just the wealthy. In fact, a 1999 poll \nshowed that 84 percent of the people surveyed believe the estate tax \naffects other groups of Americans besides the wealthy. Anyone who owns \na family business knows that the estate tax creates major hurdles for \nsmall and large family-owned enterprises, which in turn negatively \naffects local communities. While only about 2 percent of inherited \nestates are large enough to actually fall under the death tax, millions \nof more people have to spend substantial amounts of time and money \nplanning their way around it.\n  All of society loses opportunities by these avoidance procedures. \nSuch tactics are costly, inefficient, and they monopolize many \nprofessionals who could be spending their time on more productive \nendeavors.\n  The study also shows the death tax damages the patterns of work, \nsavings, and capital information by encouraging taxpayers to slow their \nwork and savings, give money away whenever possible, and spend the rest \nso they can die broke. By encouraging people to avoid this tax, we are \ndamaging the entire system.\n  A second point the study makes is that the death tax does not provide \nthe government with extra funds for social purposes, which our friends \non the other side have been advocating. It only generates .01 to .0125% \nof the federal budget. More importantly, the amount of revenue \ncollected from death tax filings has a negative impact on other forms \nof tax revenue and cash flow. This includes restricted savings and \ncapital formation, hindered creation and growth of private family \nenterprises, lower amount of jobs, and a lower personal income. These \neffects lead to the loss of revenue from income taxes which is equal to \nor greater than that collected from the death tax.\n  So, when you add up the cost of collecting for the death tax, we do \nnot gain much, if anything for our efforts.\n  I've heard these Treasury numbers of a $750 billion cost over 20 \nyears or so from the other side. The Minority Leader mentioned the $750 \nbillion number. Then, the senator from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, \nupped it to $850 billion. Then, we heard Senator Boxer come up with a \ntrillion dollar number. Among the three of them, they've already lost \n$250 billion!\n  And, of course, this close to the election, the Treasury Department \nis acting like an arm of the Democratic Party throwing numbers out of \nthin air to justify their cause. These estimates are about as \nbelievable as a Treasury three dollar bill. It's important to remember \nthat many estates will lose their stepped-up basis under this repeal \nbill. Then, once the assets are sold, there will be a sizable capital \ngains tax on the entire appreciated value of the estate.\n  So, the government will still get a substantial amount of money from \nthese estates over the long run, despite what the Treasury Department \nand the other side would have you believe.\n\n[[Page S6666]]\n\n  Third, finally, we hear the argument that if the estate tax didn't \nexist, taxpayers would give less to charity since they wouldn't have to \navoid the tax. I hope no one took seriously the so-called estimates \nthat the senator from California alluded to, citing some ambiguous \nFinance Committee estimates that charities would lose $250 billion if \nthe estate tax is repealed. I assume these estimates were created by \nthe other side. So, once again, we have the Democrats conjuring up \ntheir own facts to make their arguments.\n  Beyond the cynicism of this charitable giving argument, the study \nargues that the tax exemption for charitable giving does not \nnecessarily benefit private philanthropy. If encouraging charitable \ngiving is going to be the goal of a tax, more specific income tax laws \nneed to be made.\n  The study makes the point that this charitable giving claim is based \non the assumption that the tax works as a subsidy to charitable \nbequests. In reality, the cost of one dollar of giving, no matter the \ntax rate, is one dollar. The death tax is neutral towards charitable \nbequests as long as these bequests are exempt from tax.\n  Keeping a complicated death tax to encourage charitable giving is not \nworth the economic and social costs to the government and the \ntaxpayers.\n  Mr. President, the estate tax does not accomplish any of the goals \nit's supposed to. It doesn't raise money overall, or promote well-\nbeing. It stands in the way of human progress and encourages wasteful \nand time-consuming financial planning. I hope we repeal this \ncomplicated and inefficient tax and I urge everyone to support this \neffort.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I strongly support elimination of the \nfederal Death Tax. The Death Tax is an injustice that should be removed \nfrom the tax code. The bill the Senate is considering, which passed the \nHouse of Representatives with a large, bipartisan majority, takes a \nresponsible approach to ending the Death Tax by phasing-out the tax \nrate over a decade, and at the end of that decade eliminating the \ncapital gains step-up in basis and creating a carryover basis to treat \nfamilies with fairness upon the death of a loved one.\n  It is simply wrong for the Tax Collector to knock on a grieving \nfamily's door to collect taxes on the life's work and earnings of the \nrecently deceased. There are those who charge that the Death Tax \naffects only the richest Americans. Apparently, they have never met the \nRevesz family from Battle Ground, Washington. Peter and Jane Revesz are \nfamily tree farmers, and they recently wrote to me to express their \nfear that the federal Death Tax may mean their farm will have to be \nsold and the forestland lost to development. To those who claim ending \nthe Death Tax affects only the rich, I challenge you to listen to their \nwords. Peter and Jane wrote to me that the Death Tax could cause the \n``loss of so much of our farm and timber to taxes when we die that our \nchildren and grandchildren will lose the farm. . . . For us to have \nsustainable, productive timber on a family farm means that every year \nor two we need to have a small harvest and that the profits go to the \nfamily. To accomplish this in a 60 or more year cycle it is necessary \nto have a considerable value in the timber so that there can be small \nbut steady harvest and reforestation over a long growth cycle. If much \nof this long-term crop is lost with each generation to estate taxes, it \nis impossible to continue a sustainable income for the family or a \nsustainable annual supply of wood products for the public. Often if a \nfamily loses a tree farm, that land becomes something other than \nforestland. If one family cannot make it, probably the next one cannot \nmake it.''\n  These are not the words of the greedy rich, they are the honest words \nof hardworking Americans who simply question why part of the farm they \nhave built-up must be sold to pay the government because they die. \nUncle Sam did not maintain and care for the farm, why is the government \ndue a portion of it upon the death of its owners?\n  I have heard from many constituents who share this very real fear \nthat the Death Tax will cause their children to have to sell the family \nfarm or business to be able to pay the Internal Revenue Service.\n  Oak Harbor Freight Lines is a family owned business in Auburn, \nWashington, about 15 miles outside Seattle. Ed Vander Pol and his \nbrother David began working at the business in the early 1970s when Oak \nHarbor had around 100 employees. As the years went by, Ed and David \nbought the business from their father and grew it to where it is today: \na thriving regional trucking line with over 1100 employees. Out of \nthose 1100, over 700 are union workers; Teamsters, mainly, driving the \nfreight trucks and doing other jobs within the company. Naturally, Ed \nand David would like to keep this business in the family, and not have \nto sell the company to a larger, national carrier when they die.\n  But for all their hard work, the Vander Pol's have been rewarded with \nuncertainty about their company's future. They must pay a yearly life \ninsurance bill of over $150,000--dedicated solely to helping their \nchildren pay the onerous Death Tax bill that will be due, in cash, nine \nmonths after Ed or David dies. If not for the Death Tax, this money \nwould be re-invested in the business and its people, growing the \ncompany and providing additional well paying jobs to people in the \nSeattle area.\n  Why should Ed and David's children have to pay a tax to the federal \ngovernment upon the death of their father? Those who fight elimination \nof the death tax refuse to answer this basic question; they refuse to \njustify its existence. Instead of directly telling the American people \nwhy they oppose ending this disgraceful tax, they choose to dust-off \ntired ``tax cuts for the rich'' rhetoric. The American people deserve \nhonest, straight-forward answers: Those who oppose elimination of the \nDeath Tax simply believe they know better how to spend your money than \nyou and your children. They want to control your pocketbook both when \nyou are alive and when you are dead. They oppose tax reform and tax \ncuts, whether it is ending the death tax or fixing the marriage \npenalty, because it means less money for them to spend from Washington, \nDC.\n  Ending the Death Tax is about protecting hard work, honoring \nresponsible saving and investment, and protecting family farms and \nsmall businesses. The federal government should stop punishing those \nwho pursue the American dream and restore some fairness to the tax code \nby eliminating the federal Death Tax.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the repeal \nof the estate tax.\n  I support the repeal of the estate tax because, on a very basic and \nfundamental level, I believe that the estate tax is unfair.\n  In some respects, for example, the estate tax amounts to double \ntaxation, taxing, at times at a confiscatory rate in excess of 50 \npercent, assets which were already taxed when the income was earned. \nRegardless of how much or how little, if you have earned money, and \npaid taxes on it, you ought to be able to pass it on to your children \nwithout it being taxed yet again.\n  I also believe that it is critical to our continued economic growth \nand prosperity that small business owners and family farmers be given \nevery incentive to work and grow their business, and to be able to pass \nthose businesses on to their children to run and grow.\n  If a family works for years to establish and grow a business, an heir \nshould not find that they are forced to sell the business simply to pay \ntaxes on it, or that they must assume a crushing debt burden--which may \nwell make the continued survival of the business untenable--simply to \npay the taxes.\n  That is not fair, not right, and not what the American dream is all \nabout.\n  In addition, because of soaring real estate prices, the estate tax is \nunfair to many middle class residents of my state who never thought, \nplanned, or expected to find themselves subject to the estate tax. And \nthe simple fact of the matter is that they should not be subject to the \nestate tax.\n  As I am sure many of my colleagues are aware, in recent years housing \nprices in California have gone through the roof. Modest two and three \nbedroom houses in many parts of California now sell for close to three-\nquarters of a million dollars.\n  These are not mansions, but simple and straightforward middle class \nhouses--two or three bedrooms, perhaps a small back yard--in modest \nneighborhoods.\n\n[[Page S6667]]\n\n  But because of the soaring value of their homes, many middle class \nfamilies with modest incomes now find that they would be faced with \nhaving to pay estate taxes simply because of the value of their family \nhome.\n  With few other assets other than their primary residences, a parent \nwho wanted to pass on the family home to his or her children would find \nthat their children would be forced to sell the family house simply to \npay the estate taxes on the house itself.\n  That is not fair and that is not right.\n  Mr. President, I can think of few things that this Congress can do in \naddressing tax reform this year that are more important than repealing \nthe estate tax. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join \nme in support of estate tax repeal.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to vote to bury \nthe death tax once and for all. This tax is anti-family and anti-\ncapitalist, smothers the American Dream, and is rationalized only by \nthe greed of government and envy of success.\n  The debate over death tax repeal highlights, as much as any issue \nthat we will consider, a fundamental difference in philosophy among \nmembers of this body, and between the Republican Congress and the \ncurrent Administration. We in the majority believe that the federal \ngovernment has no right to claims the lion's share of any person's \nwealth just because that person had the misfortune of dying. The \nproponents of the death tax think otherwise.\n  At the root of this philosophical difference are two vastly different \nviews of the nature of wealth creation and its role in society. The \nsupporters of the death tax seem to harbor a pessimistic, zero-sum view \nof wealth--the belief that every dollar saved by one person is one less \ndollar for the rest of us. This belief makes it easier to argue that a \nceiling be placed on the level of wealth attained by any individual or \nfamily in America--people justify the confiscation of wealth above this \nlevel by attacking as greedy any family that seeks to accumulate more \nat the expenses of the rest of society.\n  But this view is flawed. There is no finite limit to the amount of \nwealth that can be created in a society. People become wealthy in a \nmarket economy by satisfying the wants of others. Wealth is not a \nwindfall to people with natural intelligence or ability, or who happen \nto stumble across valuable resources; it is created by providing \nconsumers the goods, materials, and services that they desire at a \nprice that does not exceed their estimate of its value.\n  When one understands this concept, the death tax cannot be justified. \nIf Bill Gates had chosen a career as a government bureaucrat instead of \nbeing a software entrepreneur, the tens of billions of dollars he has \namassed in wealth would not have been distributed to others in \nsociety--instead, this fortune would never have been generated. It came \nabout because Mr. Gates has provided goods and services to the public \nthat they valued as much or more than the price he charged. Every \nvoluntary exchange between that free individuals in a market economy \ncreates wealth, and the businesses that provide the most consumer \nsatisfaction will create the most wealth. When those goods and services \nare not offered, this wealth is not created, and everyone in society is \npoorer because their preferred choice does not exist.\n  Proponents of the death tax argue that the heirs and legatees of an \nindividual's fortune did nothing to deserve this bounty. Since it is a \nwindfall to these individuals, why shouldn't the government get a piece \nof the action? Some death tax supporters go one step further, and have \nargued on this very floor that, unlikely the heirs, the government has \na claim to this wealth because it is responsible for the prosperous \nAmerican economic environment. This argument amounts to the claim that, \nsince government refrains from confiscating property while people are \nalive, the government is entitled to confiscate upon death.\n  It makes no sense to terminate property rights at death as the price \nto pay for their protection while living. The inheritors of property \nhave a right to the property not because of anything they have done, \nbut because it is the will of the decedent. If people cannot leave to \ntheir family and friends the wealth they create, they lose the \nincentive to create it. The higher the rate of death tax falling on \ntheir estate, the smaller, the motive to invest in and build a \nbusiness. The inheritors of property have earned the right to receive \nit, because they served as the motivation behind the creation of wealth \nbeyond what decedents would consume in their respective lifetimes.\n  It has been estimated that the death tax will cost the economy almost \none trillion dollars over the next decade and almost 275,000 jobs in \nlarge part because it robs people of the incentive to invest. I \nregularly receive letters from older constituents explaining that they \nhave no desire to reinvest profits in their business only to have the \ngovernment claim 55 percent of the business's increase in value. I am \nsure all of my colleagues receive similar letters.\n\n  The death tax robs people of the incentive to build up their \nbusinesses, smothering the American Dream. The death tax eliminates the \njobs that these discouraged entrepreneurs would have created. The death \ntax reduces the savings pool, reducing capital investments and reducing \nfuture productivity. The death tax reduces the choices of goods and \nservices available to consumers. And, perhaps worst of all, the death \ntax places the interest of government over that of families.\n  Why do we have to impose a tax upon death? Every person spends a \nlifetime paying taxes on the earnings from which their life savings \ncomes. The income from inherited assets, such as stock dividends or \nbusiness profits, will be taxed as it is earned. And, under our death \ntax repeal bill, any capital gain above the exemption amount will \nresult in capital gains taxes when the asset is actually sold. Why the \nhurry to impose a tax at the time of death, a tax which forces families \nto sell land, personal property, and business interests that had been \nin the family for generations?\n  The only reasons are the greed of the government and the death tax \nsupporters' disapproval of inherited wealth. Under current law, the \nfederal government will be collecting over $4 trillion more in taxes \nthan it is budgeted to spend in the next decade alone. It is the \nfederal government that needs a limit to its ability to enjoy the \nfruits of the hard work of our taxpayers, not the families of these \ntaxpayers.\n  The supporters of the death tax seem genuinely puzzled that the \nAmerican people, in poll after poll, overwhelmingly support repeal of \nthe death tax. They cannot understand why do many people would oppose a \ntax that directly affects so few. But the American people understand \neconomics much better than the death taxers. They recognize the loss of \njobs and opportunity. They also harbor in their hearts the dream that \none day they, too, might be so successful as to amass the wealth that \nis subject to the confiscatory rates of the death tax. But, most of \nall, they recognize that a tax may be unfair even though it targets a \nsmall segment of the population--indeed, a tax may be unfair because it \ndoes so. This part of the American spirit does not seem to be \nappreciated by the death taxers.\n  Mr. President, the specter of the federal death tax should no longer \nhover over our citizens, waiting to swoop down and confiscate the \nsavings that has taken a lifetime to build. I urge all of my colleagues \nto vote for the Death Tax Elimination Act.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the estate tax \nrepeal bill which is currently pending before this body. Like all of my \ncolleagues, I deplore conditions that lead to families losing their \nfamily businesses and farms. The family farm is at dire risk of \nbecoming extinct. Some of my colleagues want to attribute this to the \nestate tax which they claim prevents succeeding generations from \ncarrying on their heritage. Rightfully, that blame belongs to a failed \nfarm policy more than a progressive tax policy. The failed Freedom to \nFarm policy has driven more farmers out of business than any \ninheritance tax.\n  In my state of South Dakota, 102 estates had to pay federal estate \ntax in 1997. That figure amounts to .2 percent of all estates for that \nyear. I support bringing more relief to the bulk of these estates that \nare trying to pass down family businesses and farms to their children, \nbut the proposal before us does nothing for these families for ten \nyears while bringing immediate help to the elite of the wealthy.\n\n[[Page S6668]]\n\n  The House passed plan essentially does nothing for most estates that \npay the estate tax over the next decade. The benefits go only to the \nsuper-rich worth almost $4 million. Only after ten years will the \nfamily farmer and small business owner see any benefit. At that point, \nthe entire estate tax is eliminated, exploding a $50 billion annual \nhole in the budget.\n  I support some estate tax relief aimed at preserving family farms and \nsmall businesses. Under current law, a couple with a farm or business \nworth up to $2.6 million can give it to their heirs tax-free. Our \napproach would raise that to $4 million, which would mean that only 1 \nout of every 100 estates would face any federal estate tax.\n  But it would not help the super-rich, as the Republican proposal \nwould. The federal estate tax is a progressive tax. In 1998 more than \nhalf the money collected came from estates of $5 million or more. There \nwere exactly 2,898 such estates nationwide. In other words, the \nRepublican plan is aimed predominantly at helping the richest of the \nrich in our country. Fewer than three thousand estates would get the \nbulk of this tax break. Three thousand of the richest families in \nAmerica would benefit.\n  I do not begrudge the wealthy their position. Wealth is often \naccumulated through hard work, serendipity and more hard work. However, \nthere is no compelling public policy reason to give the largest single \ntax break in American history to those fortunate enough to be born into \nthe right families, and expend so much revenue doing so that nothing is \nleft for tax relief for the middle class, paying down accumulated \nnational debt, improving schools, Medicare or veterans health care. \nEspecially when we have such critical needs elsewhere in our society. \nThe majority wants to give a tax break to fewer than three thousand \nfamilies that will cost over $50 billion annually. The Democrats want \nto help families maintain their small businesses and family farms, and \nwe can do that for $20 billion per year. With the remainder of that \nmoney, we can help millions of Americans meet their basic needs such as \nhelping with extraordinarily high prescription drug costs, child care \nor education related expenses.\n  Why is it that the Senate can somehow find all this time to debate \ntax bills, which I agree are legitimate and important issues, but we \ncan't find the time in this body to debate the number one issue facing \nthe elderly and disabled in this country--rising prescription drug \nexpenses?\n\n  Not only should we be here today questioning why it is not good \npolicy to only give enormous federal tax breaks to the super rich but \nmaybe we should also be questioning the huge tax breaks that go to the \nmulti-million dollar drug companies. As reported by Fortune 500 \nmagazine earlier this year, the pharmaceutical companies once again \nrepresent the most profitable industry in this country with profits \nthree times that of other industries. These are the same companies that \nare price gouging millions of elderly senior citizens throughout \nAmerica, many of whom can't afford their daily medications. Millions of \nindividuals who Congress thus far has said ``no we can't help you this \nyear because we don't have the time to debate prescription drug \nproposals''. Instead, we are saying to the American public that we can \nfind the time and money to pass a fiscally irresponsible estate tax \nbill that will probably not help any of the millions of Medicare \nbeneficiaries who struggle between paying for their prescription drugs \nand groceries.\n  I think we should do both. I believe we could pass a meaningful and \nfiscally responsible estate tax bill and still have resources available \nfor addressing critically important priorities such as prescription \ndrugs. Instead, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to \nuse all of these resources solely for a bloated estate tax bill that \nwill benefit only three thousand families.\n  Prescription drug prices are skyrocketing at unfathomable levels and \ndrug expenditures have grown at double-digit rates during almost every \nyear since 1980 and more than twice the rate of all other health care \nexpenses. Not surprising, the elderly and in particular elderly women, \nsee the largest increases. Combine this crisis with the fact that the \nSenate has less than eight working weeks left this year and held only \none floor debate on a prescription drug bill thus far, which was forced \nby members on this side of the aisle, and you find the picture for the \nAmerican senior looking very bleak. If we cannot address the \nprescription drug issue now, then when?\n  I am committed to helping seniors and those disabled on Medicare \nafford their prescription drugs. Equally, I am not going to stop \nfighting for lower prescription drug prices for Americans who pay by \nfar more for prescription drugs than people in other countries.\n  Several bills that I have sponsored this Congress aim to address the \nproblem of escalating prescription drug prices. However, these and \nother prescription drug bills have been the target of an aggressive \nmulti million dollar advertising campaign, operated by the \npharmaceutical industry and their so called front group called Citizens \nFor Better Medicare, aimed to kill any hopes of prescription drug \nlegislation this year. In fact, I question just how many ``real \ncitizens'' are behind that name? According to Public Citizen the drug \nindustry is on pace to spend nearly $14 million every election and \nanother $150 million every two years lobbying Congress to protect its \nincredibly high profit rates. This is the classic case of the role of \nbig money in politics: the industry takes in billions in profits from \nhigh prices and gives out millions in campaign contributions to make \nsure Congress protects those profits.\n  The time for Congress to act on providing an affordable, accessible \nprescription drug bill, while at the same time addressing skyrocketing \ndrug prices, is now. Congress cannot be bullied by the big drug \ncompanies pocketbook any longer. Better yet, the American public cannot \nwait any longer. In the next couple of days the Senate may take up yet \nanother tax bill and we will again be faced with an opportunity to \naddress such critical priorities as prescription drugs. But I guess the \nAmerican public will have to stay tuned as to whether or not we will \neven be given the opportunity to debate one of the greatest issues \nfacing our nation.\n\n\n                       ESTATE TAX ELIMINATION ACT\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I intend to vote for H.R. 8, the Death \nTax Elimination Act, as amended. On January 19, 1999, I introduced the \ncompanion bill, S. 38, to the original House bill, along with my \ncolleagues, Senators Mack and Hutchison. I felt then, as I do now, this \nlegislation is of vital importance to farmers and family business \nowners.\n  Since the time that I introduced the original companion to H.R. 8, I \nhave heard from hundreds of Coloradans and numerous national \norganizations about the need to eliminate this burdensome and \noverreaching tax. I believe that eliminating this tax is a fundamental \nissue of fairness. Death should not be an event government prospers \nfrom.\n  Estate and gift taxes continue to be an enormous burden on American \nfamilies, particularly those who pursue the American dream of owning \ntheir own business. It is often the family-owned businesses and farms \nthat are hit with the highest tax rate when they are handed down to \ndescendants--often immediately following the death of a loved one. \nFamilies ought to be encouraged, not discouraged, from building \nsuccessful farms, ranches and businesses and keeping the ownership of \nthose enterprises within the families that worked to make them \nsuccessful.\n  These taxes, and the financial burdens and difficulties they create \ncome at the worst possible time. Making a terrible situation worse is \nthe fact that the rate of this estate tax is crushing, reaching as high \nas 55 percent for the highest bracket. That's higher than even the \nhighest income tax rate bracket of 39 percent. Furthermore, the tax is \ndue as soon as the business is turned over to the heir, allowing no \ntime for financial planning or the setting aside of money to pay the \ntax bills. Estate and gift taxes right now are one of the leading \nreasons why the number of family-owned farms and businesses are \ndeclining; the burden of this tax is simply too much for many American \nfamilies to bear.\n  This tax sends the troubling message that families should either sell \nthe business while they are still alive in order to spare their \ndescendants this huge tax after their passing, or rundown the value of \nthe business, so that\n\n[[Page S6669]]\n\nit won't make it into their higher tax brackets. This is not how \nAmerica was built. Private investment and initiative has historically \nbeen a strong part of our American heritage and we should encourage \nthose values, not tax successful family businesses into submission.\n  That is why I will vote for this important legislation. We need to \nchange the message we are sending to farmers and family business \nowners. The Death-tax repeal has been endorsed by numerous \norganizations that represent family farms and businesses such as the \nNational Federation of Independent Business, the Farm Bureau, the \nFamily Business Estate Tax Coalition, National Association of Women \nBusiness Owners, the National Black Chamber of Commerce, the National \nIndian Business Association, the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, and \nthe National Association of Neighborhoods.\n  Mr. President, if there is one thing Congress absolutely ought to do \nwhile we are trusted with our jobs it should be to protect American \nfamilies and their interests. This tax is fundamentally unfair and \nwould never survive if it were being proposed today. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the repeal of the Death-tax and help restore a \nsmall degree of integrity to the tax structure imposed on America's \nfamilies.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 8, the Death \nTax Elimination Act of 2000.\n  This is a sound, sensible approach to providing death tax relief. It \nphases out the tax over a ten-year period by gradually reducing the \nmarginal rates that apply to estates. And it includes a so-called \n``step-up'' in basis for the first $1.3 million in assets ($3 million \nfor spouses) that applies if assets are ever sold by heirs.\n  Right now the marginal rates assessed against estates are the highest \nin our tax code--55 percent for estates larger than $3 million plus a 5 \npercent surcharge assessed against larger estates. In fact, the United \nStates has the dubious honor of imposing the most onerous estate tax in \nthe developed world. This comes on the heels of recent moves by China, \nCanada and other developed countries to repeal their death taxes.\n  It is pitiful that in the U.S. we have worse death taxes than \nCommunist China.\n  The estate tax was originally passed in 1916 to help fund our efforts \nin World War I. The last time I checked, that war was over. By the way, \nfor my friends in the Senate who are still living in the early 20th \ncentury and oppose death tax repeal, I should point out that we won \nWorld War I.\n  Mr. President, these are a number of sound reasons to repeal the \ndeath tax. The best of these is the awful effect it has on small \nbusiness and family farms. For years and years Congress has heard the \nsad stories about how small business owners and farm families have to \nsell family enterprises just to pay the taxes on estates that are \npassed down from generation to generation.\n  Additionally, a number of recent analyses make the case for death tax \nrepeal. Studies by the Joint Economic Committee, the National Center \nfor Policy Analysis, the Heritage Foundation, the American Council for \nCapital Formation, the Institute for Policy Innovation, the Cato \nInstitute, and others all indicate the federal estate tax imposes \nsignificant costs on the economy and family-owned businesses, resulting \nin lower economic growth, job creation, and the destruction of family \nbusinesses.\n  The death tax hurts the ability of small businesses to vie against \nlarger competitors. For instance, in testimony before the House Ways \nand Means Committee, a lumberyard owner from New Jersey spoke of \nincurring up to $1 million in costs associated with preserving the \nfamily business pending the death of his grandmother. At the same time \nthe family was incurring these costs, the business was also competing \nagainst a new Home Depot store that had moved into the area. Remember \nthat Home Depot and other big business is not subject to the estate \ntax.\n  In fact, a recent survey of 365 businesses in upstate New York found \nan estimated 14 jobs per business were lost in direct consequence of \nthe costs associated with estate tax planning and payment. That amounts \nto more than 5,000 jobs lost in a limited geographical area. \nNationally, the Wall Street Journal reported that an estimated 200,000 \njobs would be created or preserved if the estate tax were eliminated.\n  The liberals who oppose death tax repeal claim this is a red herring, \nand that the bill will really only would help the super-rich and multi-\nbillionaires. In fact, 50 percent of the revenue the federal government \nderives from the death tax comes from estates worth less than $5 \nmillion.\n  Additionally, the death tax provides less than 2 percent of the \nfederal government's total tax revenues. To hear the Chicken Little \nliberals talk about it, repealing this tax would cause the sky to fall \nand the government to collapse for lack of funding. These are only \ncrocodile tears from the big government addicts who cannot bear the \nthought of hard-working Americans not being forced to send more of \ntheir money to Washington to fund big government programs.\n  Although this bill passed the House by a veto-proof margin, and \nenjoys bipartisan support here in the Senate, the President has still \npromised to veto it. Well, I think we should still pass it and let him \nexplain to the American people why he favors ``death'' taxes that hurt \nour small business and rural communities.\n  To his credit, the President did sign into law some death tax relief \nin 1997 as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act. Of course, we had to lead \nhim kicking and screaming to the signing ceremony. And this came on the \nheels of his vetoing stronger death tax relief in the 1995 balanced \nbudget bill. Then later he vetoed death tax relief in last year's tax \nbill.\n  So who knows what he will actually do in the end. We should give him \nthe chance to decide once and for all if he wants to help us repeal the \ndeath tax. Maybe, like Paul on the road to Damascus, he wills see the \nlight. After all, as one senior House Democrat noted several years ago: \n``We've learned that if you don't like the President's position on the \nissue, all you have to do is to wait for a few days for him to change \nhis mind.'\n  Mr. President, surveys have consistently shown that death tax repeal \nis popular with Americans--70 to 80 percent usually favor it in opinion \npolls. It is popular for the reasons I have laid out, but the most \ncompelling reason is a moral one. After the death of a loved one, when \nfamilies are grieving, Americans just do not believe that they, or \nanyone else, should have to talk to the undertaker and tax man on the \nsame day. It's just not right.\n  Since 1980, over 20 states have repealed their state death taxes, and \nit's time the federal government followed suit and learned a lesson \nfrom the states. It's time to kill the death tax, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/13/senate-section/article/S6669-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ROTH.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to reflect \non the life and work of Gerald Clifford, an important and influential \nSouth Dakotan and Oglala Sioux tribal member who recently passed away \nafter courageously battling a debilitating illness.\n  Gerald Clifford, with whom I worked for many years, was a leader and \na driving force for change among Native Americans in South Dakota and \nacross the country. He was a champion for rural water development in \nsouthwestern South Dakota and a strong advocate for Indian education \nand Indian self-determination. Earlier this week, Mr. Clifford began \nhis journey to the spirit world at the young age of sixty. I express my \nheartfelt condolences to Gerald's family and relatives during this \ndifficult time. My prayers and thoughts are with them.\n  The void left by Gerald's passing was felt especially deeply today, \nas his life was celebrated at a funeral service in\n\n[[Page S6670]]\n\nManderson, South Dakota, on the Pine Ridge Indian reservation. While \nthe work of this body required my presence in Washington today, I do \nwant to honor and remember Gerald here in the Senate for his many \noutstanding contributions to his community and state.\n  Over the years, Gerald and I worked together on a number of projects. \nAnd I can tell you for a fact: he is a tenacious advocate for his \ncauses and never gives up. Never.\n  I had the honor and pleasure of working closely with Gerald on the \nconstruction of the Mini Wiconi Rural Water System. In his role as \ndirector of the Mini Wiconi project, Gerald accepted the daunting \nchallenge of bringing the state of South Dakota, three South Dakota \ntribes and local non-Indian communities together to achieve a common \nvision. The project bridged historically-vast political and cultural \ngaps to bring the precious resources of clean water to rural \ncommunities and remote reservations areas.\n  Even after many South Dakotans had lost hope of ever seeing the Mini \nWiconi water project finished, Gerald kept working at it. He shepherded \nthe Mini Wiconi project during the last several years, a critical \nperiod in its construction, fulfilled the promise of clean water for \nmany, and laid a strong foundation for completing the project in the \nforeseeable future.\n  Gerald managed this project with skill and with diplomacy, and I am \nproud to have been able to work with him to accomplish our mutual goal. \nHis contribution will be felt for decades to come.\n  Gerald made many other contributions to his people and his state in \naddition to Mini Wiconi. I would like to highlight just a few examples \nthat provide a snapshot of the magnitude of this involvement in efforts \nto benefit the people of South Dakota and our nation.\n  Gerald Clifford was first and foremost an articulate and impassioned \nadvocate for justice for his people. No one who knew Gerald could ever \nquestion the intensity or sincerity of his commitment to this \noverriding goal.\n  Gerald also understood the critical importance of education as a \nmeans of improving the quality of life for Indian people, working hard \nto promote tribally-controlled education, particularly tribal colleges \nand universities, and contributing to the initiation and development in \nthe early 1970's of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium \n(AIHEC) and the tribal college movement. He was also among the first to \nhave assisted in the creation of tribally-controlled entities, such as \nthe Coalition of Indian-Controlled School Boards. Through this work, he \nhelped provide educational opportunities for 26,000 students at the \nnation's thirty-three tribal colleges and universities, and opened a \nmajor educational pathway for many generations to come.\n  Gerald Clifford was a highly respected leader of the American Indian \npeople. He was elected by Great Plains tribal leaders and tribal peers \nto serve as the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) Aberdeen \narea Vice-President. As their voice on Capital Hill, Gerald helped many \ntribes in South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska and throughout the mid-\nWest.\n  Gerald was a dominant presence at the forefront of the many struggles \nthat the Aberdeen area tribes faced over the past four decades. It was \nthrough his focused dedication and skilled advocacy that Indian people \nhave prevailed in the face of numerous adversities placed in their way. \nGerald served as an elder, mentor, colleague and friend to so many \nyoung Indian men and women, imparting many of his outstanding qualities \nto this and future generations of tribal leaders.\n  Earlier this year, I addressed the National Congress of American \nIndians general assembly while Gerald was in Washington fighting hard \non issues that meant so much to him. Later, I learned that he was \nforced to return to South Dakota prematurely because he was struggling \nwith his health. As a result, I was unable to see him. I will always \nregret that I did not get to visit with Gerald during his last visit \nhere.\n  Gerald fought illness with courage, determination and indomitable \nspirit.

Mr. President, shortly before the July 4th recess, \nthe Senate passed an Emergency Supplemental spending measure as part of \nthe Military Construction Appropriations Bill. This measure dealt with \na number of critical needs, including aid for fire victims in New \nMexico and funds to continue the war on drugs in Colombia. I am pleased \nthat this legislation also included $12 million to reimburse county and \nmunicipal governments along the U.S.-Mexico border for the high costs \nthat they have incurred in handling drug prosecutions and \nincarcerations for the federal government.\n  Dramatic increases in manpower and resources for the Border Patrol \nand Customs Service has meant dramatic increases in drug and alien \nsmuggling and illegal crossing apprehensions. Our border counties, \nwhich have handled these cases for the federal government for many \nyears, have borne heavy costs of these prosecutions with no \nreimbursement from the federal government. These are some of the \npoorest counties and communities in the nation, and they can no longer \nafford to pay the costs associated with an expanded caseload they are \nhandling for the federal government.\n  Specifically, this provision will enable the United States Attorneys \nto assist border county and municipal governments in the Southwest \nBorder states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California with their \ncourt costs, courtroom technology needs, the building of prisoner \nholding spaces, administrative staff, and indigent defense costs that \nare associated with the handling and processing of drug cases that \nwould otherwise fall under the jurisdiction of the Federal government.\n  I appreciate the help and commitment of Senator Gregg, Chairman of \nthe Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations Subcommittee, and Senator \nStevens, the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, for working so \nclosely with me to address the needs of the Southwest border. I also \nwant to thank Jim Morhard, Staff Director of the Commerce-Justice-State \npanel, and Kevin Linskey, for their hard work on this matter. Jim and \nKevin serve both the Committee and Senator Gregg very well, and their \nefforts on the staff level are making a difference in improving the \nlives of people living along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/13/senate-section/article/S6670-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6670-S6671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        GUNRUNNING IN THE STATES\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, two new studies just released show that \nstates with a high concentration of gun industry activity and weak gun \nlaws tend to be the major suppliers of crime guns in other states.\n  On June 28, 2000, the Violence Policy Center (VPC) released Gunland \nUSA, a study which ranks states by their level of gun industry \nactivity. For each state VPC reported the number of gun shows, licensed \nfirearms retailers (including pawnshops), manufacturers producing \nfirearms, and licensed machine gun dealers as well as the number of \nregistered machine guns. In each of these categories, Texas ranks \nnumber one. Other states that showed a very high level of gun industry \npresence were California, Florida, Illinois, Georgia and Ohio.\n  People in my state of Michigan may wonder how activity in other \nstates like Illinois or Georgia affects them at home. A study released \nby Senator Schumer entitled War Between the States explains that many \nof the crime guns used in Michigan come from out of state. Interstate \ngunrunners acquire guns in states with weak laws and flood the markets \nin specific states and regions that have stricter gun laws. According \nto this report, states such as Texas, California, Florida, Georgia, and \nOhio--the same states with high levels of gun industry activity--are \nthe major suppliers of guns used to commit crimes in other states with \ntougher gun laws. The study cites Michigan as a state ``with strict gun \nlaws'' and as one with 41% of guns traced to crime coming from other \nstates such as Ohio and Georgia.\n  These findings demonstrate the need to tighten our national gun laws. \nWithout national standards, states with a\n\n[[Page S6671]]\n\nhigh level of gun industry presence and weak gun laws will continue to \nserve as major suppliers for gunrunners who traffic guns to states with \ntougher gun laws--states like Michigan. We must close the loopholes in \nour national framework for firearms distribution by among other things \nclosing the gun show loophole.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/13/senate-section/article/S6671-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO THE SHANIN FAMILY\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the 20th century story of the Shanin \nFamily portrays the success of immigrants in America and the success of \nAmerica itself.\n  The naturalization papers of Freda Mermorvich Shanin show that she \ntraveled from Lugansk, Russia and arrived at Ellis Island on October \n31, 1906, with her two children, Lilli and Max, enroute to joining her \nhusband, Mordecai Shanin, in St. Joe, MO. The Shanin Family grew with \nthe addition of five more children: Annie, Louie, Rose, Albert, and \nMargaret. Mordecai Shanin struggled to earn a living with a variety of \noccupations including selling Singer sewing machines.\n  Lilli Shanin, later to become my mother, told me about her father \ndying in her arms form a heart attack in 1916 on the backstairs of the \nShanin home at 922 South Ninth Street. My grandmother, Bubbie Freda, \ntold me she was left a widow with seven children and seven dollars. \nDeeply religious, proud and independent, Freda Shanin raised her \nchildren with the help of Lilli, who left school to work in a tablet \nfactory, and the other siblings pitching in when they became old enough \nto contribute to the family's support.\n  In 1917 Freda Shanin met a young immigrant, Harry Specter, who was \nbuying dry goods and blankets at the wholesale house for sales in his \ntravels to farms in Nebraska, Kansas, and Missouri. Harry Specter asked \nFreda Shanin if she had a daughter. ``Yes I do'' said the protective \nmother, ``But she's too young for you.''\n  Harry Specter courted Lilli Shanin, won her heart, went off to World \nWar I, was wounded in the Argonne Forest, and returned in uniform to \nSt. Joe to marry the beautiful 19-year-old redhead in her resplendent \nwhite gown carrying a large bouquet of roses. That union produced \nMorton, Hilda, Shirley, and Arlen Specter, who in turn brought Mordecai \nand Freda Shanin 10 great grandchildren, 25 great-great grandchildren \nand 6 great-great-great grandchildren.\n  The three sons, Max, Louie, and Albert grew up in hard times in St. \nJoe with Albert, who added a granddaughter to the family tree, becoming \na prosperous pharmacy owner who spent much of his time and drugstore \nmedicines devoted to his ailing mother. Annie, who wrote a book of \nHebrew poetry in 1945, married a distinguished chemist, Dr. Morton \nKleiman, and they in turn had Dr. Adina Kleiman, a noted psychologist, \nand Dr. Jay Kleiman, an eminent cardiologist, who added two more great \ngrandchildren to the Shanin family. Margaret ``Mashie'' Shanin married \nhandsome Leslie Hoffman, who brought a truckload of watermelons from \nthe family produce business in Waco, TX, to St. Joe. Mashie added to \nthe family tree with four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.\n  Rose Shanin left St. Joe at the age of 18 to live with her sister, \nLilli, in Wichita, where Rose became a high-powered executive secretary \nfor the Beyer Grain Company. In 1930, at my birth, Tante Rose \nintervened to save me from the name ``Abraham'' with the suggested \n``Arlen'' after the famous movie star, Richard Arlen. Rose would later \nstart my brother Morton and me in the development of our work ethics as \nmessengers riding our bicycles all over Wichita delivering bills of \nlading for Beyer and other grain companies. Rose married Julius \nIsenberg and added a daughter and son to the growing family tree.\n\n  Judaism has continued to be the mainstay of the Shanin Family with \nmany, albeit not all, maintaining strictly kosher homes, with a few \nemigrants to Jerusalem and Tel Aviv to strengthen the State of Israel. \nThe 70 descendants of Mordecai and Freda Shanin have contributed to the \nvalues, prosperity, and success of the United States. Interspersed in \nthe family tree are Ph.Ds, LL.Ds, MDs, a Federal judge, businesspeople, \nprofessionals, and elected public officials.\n  Today, members of the Shanin Family have assembled in Washington for \na Shanin Family reunion led by the matriarchs of the family, Annie \nKleiman and Rose Isenberg and Joyce Specter, who were privileged to \nmeet with the President today. The entire family visited the White \nHouse, the Senate, the Washington Monument, the Jefferson Memorial, the \nLincoln Monument, President Kennedy's gravesite, and the Secret Service \nheadquarters.\n  America is the spectacular story of immigrants who have come in \nsearch of freedom and opportunity who have contributed so much. The \nShanin Family is typical of the great contributions by immigrants, who, \nalong with native Americans, have made the United States the greatest \ncountry in the history of the world.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wanted to say this to the Senator from \nPennsylvania. Not only is he proud of his family, but certainly they \nshould be proud of him. He has rendered great service to the State of \nPennsylvania and to this country. Even though we are in a real quandary \nfor time here, every word he said I appreciate very much. I understand \nthe pride he expresses in his family, as they should in him.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I believe it is probably the case, \nalthough we are not supposed to mention such things on the floor, that \nthe family may be present. I welcome them and congratulate the Senator \non such a fine progeny.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleagues for their very kind remarks.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I join my colleagues and say to the \nSenator's family what pride they should take in you. I know of no \nSenator that has had a more positive affect on the work of the Senator \nthan Senator Specter. I am proud of him.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleagues from Delaware for those very \ngenerous comments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/13/senate-section/article/S6671-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6671-S6672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FUNDING FOR THE ARTS IN SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I would like to briefly express my full \nsupport for the funding contained in the fiscal year 2001 Interior \nAppropriations bill for the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). \nYesterday, I joined 72 of my Senate colleagues--Republicans and \nDemocrats alike--in defeating an effort to cut the NEA's budget. The \nfunding level approved in the Senate version of the Interior \nAppropriations bill is $7 million above that approved by the House of \nRepresentatives and represents a modest increase from last year's \nbudget.\n  Opponents of the NEA claim that it simply subsidizes a small number \nof wealthy people in the big cities. The truth is that the NEA supports \npublic-private art projects that benefit millions of people across our \ncountry; young and old, rich and poor, rural and urban. One needs to \nsimply look at the NEA's role in South Dakota to see how a small \npercentage of our tax dollars improve the lives of entire communities \nin our state.\n  Last year, South Dakota received over $630,000 in grants from the \nNEA. That equates to nearly one dollar for every resident of our state. \nNEA grants are coordinated by the South Dakota Arts Council, and this \nsuccessful federal-local-private relationship supports programs like \nthe L. Frank Baum Oz Festival in Aberdeen. NEA funds were instrumental \nin getting the Washington Pavilion of Arts and Sciences constructed in \nSioux Falls. In fact, the Black Hills Community Theatre and the Black \nHills Symphony Orchestra provide year-long entertainment as a direct \nresult of NEA funds. Residents of Brookings benefitted from NEA funding \nof the Brookings Chamber Music Society, the SDSU-Civic Symphony, and \nthe Prairie Repertory Theatre. Restoration of the Historic Homestake \nOpera House in Lead has been supported through the NEA. In Pierre, NEA \nfunds have allowed the Capital City Children's Chorus to entertain area \nresidents. Vermillion's historic Shrine to Music Museum receives NEA \nsupport for its annual programs, and Watertown's Symphony Orchestra and \nTown Players theater group also received NEA funds this past year. I \njust returned from attending a performance of ``Spiritscapes'', a South \nDakota cantata, at the Sioux Falls Washington Pavilion which was \nfinanced in part by the NEA.\n\n[[Page S6672]]\n\n  However, it isn't just the larger cities in South Dakota that benefit \nfrom NEA funding. Last year, the South Dakota Arts Council funded over \n220 weeks of Artists-In-Schools residencies conducted by professional \nartists at schools and other educational institutions throughout our \nstate. Some of the communities that benefitted from the annual Artists-\nIn-Schools program include: Arlington, Batesland, Belle Fourche, \nBeresford, Box Elder, Brandon, Buffalo, Canton, Castlewood, Cavour, \nCenterville, Chester, Clark, Doland, Emery, Fairfax, Faulkton, \nGarretson, Gettysburg, Harrold, Hartford, Hitchcock, Huron, Kadoka, \nKimball, Leola, Madison, Martin, Mission, Mobridge, North Sioux City, \nPiedmont, Pollock, Porcupine, Revillo, Sisseton, Tyndall, Valley \nSprings, Wakonda, Waubay, Webster, White River, Wilmot, Woonsocket, and \nWorthing.\n  I am pleased to note that NEA funds have been essential in helping to \ncultivate art on South Dakota's Native American Reservations. Federal \nfunds have supported arts education at the Tiospa Zina Tribal School, \nthe St. Joseph Indian School, the HVJ Lakota Cultural Center, Lower \nBrule Elementary School, and throughout the Wounded Knee School \nDistrict. The Northern Plains Tribal Arts festival has also grown into \nthe region's premiere Native American art show and market, in large \npart to NEA funding.\n  The total NEA budget amounts to one one-thousandth of one percent of \nthe federal budget. I believe that this extremely modest investment in \nthe NEA is overwhelmingly well spent, thanks to the leadership and \ncreativity of those within the South Dakota arts community. While I am \npleased that the Senate was able to once again fight off an attack on \nthe NEA, I hope that we will soon be debating expansion of this \nfederal-local-private partnership with a proven record of success in \nSouth Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/13/senate-section/article/S6672-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6672-S6673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FOREIGN DEVELOPMENT AID\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, since the end of the Second World War, the \nUnited States has provided billions of dollars in development \nassistance worldwide--foreign aid. The goal of that aid has been to \nbring recipient countries out of poverty.\n  That is an admirable goal, but in those 40 years, aid has failed to \neven come close to meeting it.\n  The most telling regional example is sub-Saharan Africa, home to the \ngreatest number of aid recipients. The countries of the region have \nreceived over $200 billion in aid from donors since 1980 and $27 \nbillion from the United States alone in the past 40 years.\n  As a percentage of Gross Domestic Product, the average of current aid \nrecipient countries in the region far exceeds that of the beneficiaries \nunder the Marshall Plan--the intellectual basis for modern development \naid programs and a resounding success for recipients and donors alike. \nThose percentages are 13.2 percent to 2.5 percent, respectively.\n  Yet almost every country in Africa that has received aid--some of \nthem since the early 1960s--are no better off now than when they began \nan aid program. Some are considerably worse off than at any time since \ntheir independence. Clearly, no positive link exists between foreign \naid--even massive amounts of foreign aid--and bringing recipient \ncountries out of poverty and off dependence on foreign donations.\n  We must come to the uncomfortable but obvious conclusion that, \nalthough very well intentioned in most cases, aid has neither ended \npoverty on a reasonable scale nor has it supported our policy goals.\n  But why such a difference in results?\n  The World Bank itself has concluded that development aid can be \neffective only in an environment of sound economic policies and good \neconomic management. Economic freedoms, rule of law, and governmental \nand regulatory transparency are essential elements in providing an \nenvironment in which aid can reasonably be expected to promote economic \ngrowth.\n  While many internal and external factors contribute to poverty and \nquality of life for the people in recipient countries, the governments \nof those recipient countries determine the degree of economic freedom, \neconomic management, and regulatory and transparency which dictate \nwhether development assistance can reasonably be expected to help \npromote sustained economic growth.\n  Foreign assistance can improve the lives of individual recipients and \ninstitutions to which it is directly applied, unless it brings about \nnecessary changes in the bigger picture, the economy and welfare of the \nrecipients will not change on a nationwide scale to any meaningful \ndegree.\n  Recipient countries which do not provide economic freedom, sound \nmanagement, and regulatory transparency do not provide an environment \nwhere development assistance can be expected to eliminate poverty and \npromote economic growth. In some cases, it can even constitute a \n``moral hazard,'' where it weakens pressures for necessary changes by \nsupporting institutions or governments that should otherwise be allowed \nto collapse and clear the way for real reform.\n  Thus, the provision of development assistance into unreceptive \nenvironments does not promote United States' interests nor the people \nof recipient countries' welfare. Those efforts and funding would thus \nbe more effectively committed elsewhere, or to programs which, over \ntime, will help the intended beneficiaries (the citizens of the \ncountries) change their governments and other factors that contribute \nto the perpetuation of poverty and support American goals of democracy, \neconomic development and peaceful coexistence.\n  Congress must be frank and recognize that well-intentioned aid has \nnot worked, and that special interests and those who depend on aid \nprograms for contracts and employment are a great barrier to necessary \nchange.\n  In recognition of the fact that foreign development aid has not \nreduced poverty and has not made reasonable progress toward America's \ngoals overseas, I will today introduce legislation which aims to end \nour spending on programs which, over 40 years, have achieved too \nlittle.\n  The legislation directs the Secretary of State to establish an index \nof recipient countries which evaluates their degree of economic \nfreedom. The index will be based on trade policy, including the level \nof tariffs and other barriers to foreign goods and services as well as \nthe extent of corruption in their customs service; taxation policy, \nincluding individual and corporate earnings tax rates; the degree of \ngovernment intervention in the economy; the country's monetary policy; \nthe degree to which the recipient country allows foreign investment, \nincluding foreign ownership of business, land, etc., and the extent to \nwhich it allows the investor to use the earnings outside the country; \nthe recipient country's banking policies; whether the country has price \ncontrols; the degree of property rights and rule of law and whether the \ngovernment retains ``rights'' to seize property without just cause and \ndue process; the regulatory environment and whether it is just and \ntruly designed to protect consumers, the environment, and economic \nfreedom; and the state of the black market and the response by the \nrecipient government.\n  The index will rate economic freedom for each country and sets a \ntimetable to phase out or terminate accordingly to governments who do \nnot provide a free environment for economic development. It is \nconstructed to provide incentives for reform and ends support for the \nundemocratic and predatory governments which often benefit from our \nassistance.\n  In addition, Mr. President, the Secretary will also have to provide a \ndescription of the total amount of assistance the country receives from \nall foreign sources; the total revenues from all sources; the total of \nits own revenues each recipient government spends on eliminating \npoverty; and the total they spend on military expenditures and whether \na legitimate security threat warrants them. From this and the index, \nCongress will be able to clearly judge the viability of countries as \nrecipients and the degree to which the recipients share our priorities \nin combating poverty.\n  This legislation will allow for a degree of honesty about heavily \ndefended aid programs. It will allow Americans to use those resources \nfor other national priorities we know to be effective, or to simply \nrelieve the burden on taxpayers overall. It will set the stage for \ntesting new strategies to combat\n\n[[Page S6673]]\n\npoverty and pursue American interests across the globe.

BECKHAM, JR. MEMORIAL TRIBUTE\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to the life of \none of Michigan's great civic leaders, William J. Beckham, Jr. After \nliving a remarkably accomplished life, sadly, Bill passed away April 27 \nwhile on vacation with his beloved wife, Mattie Maynard Beckham. This \nweek, Bill's friends and colleagues and members of the Senate and the \nHouse will come together in our Nation's capital to celebrate his \nmemory and his legacy.\n  Bill loved life and all the important things in it--his family, his \nfriends, school kids, and his African American heritage. Bill loved the \ndifference that he was making in Michigan through his work on school \nreform--enhancing and expanding the quality of education for all \nstudents in the Detroit public school system. Behind Bill's dignified, \ngentle yet deliberate manner was a fierce determination to help improve \nthe everyday lives of families. Multitudes were beneficiaries of his \nvisionary efforts. He showed that character and the principles of hard \nwork, integrity and perseverance can transform one's dreams into \nreality. He has left a mark of great achievement in civil rights, \neducation, economic and political reform.\n  Bill had a distinguished career of public service in Michigan, which \nincluded positions as Vice Chair of the School Board for the Detroit \nPublic Schools, Chairman of the Schools of the 21st Century \nCorporation, President and Trustee of The Skillman Foundation, the \nfirst Deputy Mayor of Detroit, and President of New Detroit, Inc. His \nsuccessful career in the private sector included key leadership \npositions at Burroughs/Unisys Corporation, Envirotest Systems \nCorporation in Phoenix and the Ford Motor Company.\n  Bill also enjoyed a long and noteworthy career in federal service \nfrom 1967 through the early 1980s. Over a period of eight years, he \nserved Senator Phil Hart in several capacities including Policy Adviser \nin his Washington office for four years, Chief of Staff of the \nSenator's office in Detroit for three years, and Campaign Assistant for \none year. Bill subsequently served as Staff Director to the House \nEducation and Labor Subcommittee on Equal Opportunity, chaired by \nRepresentative Gus Hawkins. Sought out by President Jimmy Carter, Bill \nwas nominated and confirmed first as Assistant Secretary of the U.S. \nDepartment of the Treasury and later as Deputy Secretary of the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation.\n  During his tenure on Capitol Hill, Bill joined with several of his \nstaff colleagues to establish the first minority congressional staff \ngroup to study and act on the political and legislative demands of \nminority communities nationwide. The group's pioneering efforts in \nQuitman and Cohoma Counties in Mississippi, along with civil rights \nleader John Lewis and, my brother, Sander Levin (both of whom now serve \nin the House) helped to mark a new and powerful political and \nparticipatory direction for the people of the Mississippi Delta. Wise \nand loyal colleagues--Gordon Alexander, Jackie Parker, Judy Jackson, \nWilla Rawls Dumas, Alan Boyd, Dora Jean Malachi, Mattie Barrow and Bob \nParker--declared Bill their leader. The group moved ahead and soon \ndesigned the legendary mission to the Mississippi Delta; and, under the \ndirection of Julian Bond of the then-Southern Elections Fund, pursued \nother worthy political initiatives, during a time when there was only a \nhandful of minority elected officials nationwide.\n  Mr. President, I include for the Record the names of the members of \nthe William J. Beckham, Jr. Memorial Committee, all of whom were former \nstaff colleagues of Bill's during his tenure of federal service, \nincluding my current Deputy Legislative Director Jackie Parker. These \ndevoted friends and former colleagues organized this week's great \ntribute to Bill and will be attesting, along with others, to the truly \nincredible life that Bill led and the impact he had on their lives. \nThey are as follows:\n\n               William J.

JOHNSON\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor \nAdmiral Jay L. Johnson, United States Navy, our 26th Chief of Naval \nOperations, as he prepares to turn over the helm of the United States \nNavy to his successor.\n  As former Secretary of the Navy and a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee for 22 years, I have worked closely with every Chief of Naval \nOperations since 1969. Admiral Johnson, in my view, ranks with the \nfinest of this long line of great Chiefs.\n  Thirty-six years ago, on the 30th of June, 1964, a young Midshipmen \nJohnson raised his hand on Tecumseh Court at the United States Naval \nAcademy and took his oath of office to support and defend the \nConstitution. In the years since that day he has devoted indeed all of \nhis great energy and talent to that task. Oceans of water have passed \nbeneath the keels of the ships he has commanded and many men and women \nhave stood proudly on their decks. He has been steadfast in his \ncovenant to this nation and his devotion to those with whom he has \nserved. An illustrious career gives eloquent testimony to his service \nto our country and his leadership of its Navy.\n  He was commissioned an Ensign upon his graduation in 1968 and, \ndemonstrating exceptional tactical and technical acumen, he soloed in \nboth propeller and jet aircraft within six months, setting the pace for \na most impressive future.\n  His first sea duty tour was aboard U.S.S. Oriskany (CVA 34), where he \nmade two combat cruises flying and fighting the F-8J Crusader over \nVietnam with the Hellcats of VF-191. He flew the F-14 Tomcat as a \nGhostrider of VF-142, a Grim Reaper of VF-101, and as Commanding \nOfficer of the Jolly Rogers of VF-84.\n  Admiral Johnson's follow-on sea tours demonstrated the tactical \nbrilliance and the consensus-building skills that would characterize \nhis tenure as CNO. As Commander, Carrier Air Wing ONE, he planned and \ncoordinated the joint Navy and Air Force air strikes against Libya in \nresponse to terrorist acts in Europe. In this same carrier airwing, he \nsuccessfully integrated the F/A-18C with the F-14, providing a superior \nday-night combat capability to our forward-deployed carrier battle \ngroups.\n  Admiral Johnson's early shore assignments reinforced his commitment \nto our Sailors as he served in the Bureau of Naval Personnel, detailing \njunior aviation officers. His selection to the prestigious Chief of \nNaval Operations' Strategic Studies Group further cemented his \nreputation as a Naval Warfare visionary, and marked him as a future \nleader of our nation's Navy.\n  As a new Flag Officer, Admiral Johnson went back to the Bureau of \nNaval Personnel, where his profound concern for the well being of our \nSailors resulted in dramatic improvements in retention and support of \nour Fleet Sailors. It is particularly noteworthy that these \ninstitutional changes were orchestrated at the same time he was \ncoordinating the Navy's activation and call-up of Reserve Sailors in \nsupport of Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm.\n  Back to sea in command of U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt Battle Group, his \ntactical acumen and diplomatic skills proved key to a more efficient \nand combat-ready coalition of forces in Bosnian Theater operations.\n  But nowhere was Admiral Johnson's leadership, focus on mission \nexecution, and consensus-building skill more brilliantly demonstrated \nthan in his next assignment as Commander, Second Fleet: Striking Fleet \nAtlantic and Joint Task Force 120. He simultaneously guided the \nEisenhower Battle Group through preparations for its deployment to the \nSixth Fleet while serving as the Deputy Commander for Operation Uphold \nDemocracy, which restored the democratically elected government to \nHaiti.\n  After serving as the Vice-Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Johnson \ntook the helm of our Navy as its 26th Chief. He has exemplified the \nquiet dignity and honor of that office, ably and wisely counseling \nleaders at the highest echelons of our Government. His leadership, \nintegrity and foresight have set a true and steady course for the Navy \nas it transitions into the 21st century. It has been written in ancient \nannals that ``anyone can hold the helm when the sea is calm.'' This man \ntook the helm of our Navy in heavy seas. Steering by a constellation of \nfour guide stars--Operational Primacy, Leadership, Teamwork, and \nPride--Admiral Johnson guided the Navy through the shoals of four \ntempestuous years, balancing mandated reductions in forces with \ndramatically increased operational tasking. The Fleet's mission \naccomplishment in our forward operating areas overseas--at the tip of \nthe spear--was never placed in doubt. And never for a moment did he \nloose sight of the interests of the men and women of our Navy.\n  Admiral Johnson empowered the Navy's commanding officers by removing \nunnecessary inspections and burdensome paperwork, and gave these \nskippers the opportunity to lead and truly command their ships, \nsubmarines, squadrons, and SEAL teams. He also led the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff in calling for much-needed increases in the Navy's budget: Pay \nTable Reform and the reform of the Retirement Program are resulting in \ndramatic increases in retention of the Navy's most valuable asset--our \nSailors.\n  Admiral Johnson's legacy for the future of Naval Warfare is embodied \nin his vision of the Navy at sea and ashore. At sea, he has boldly \ncommitted his service to build upon the Navy's strategy laid down in \n``Forward From the Sea'' and the Marine Corps' ``Operational Maneuver \nFrom the Sea.'' He has championed the creation of a Navy and Marine \nCorps team that will directly and decisively influence events ashore--\nanytime, anywhere. He has focused the Navy's research, development and \ninvestment capital upon improving the Fleet's ability to conduct Land \nAttack Warfare, Theater Air and Missile Defense, and Organic Mine \nWarfare. Admiral Johnson has prepared the Sailors and the Fleet to \ndefeat future threats and he has created an information technology \nrevolution at sea, which is dramatically and irreversibly changing the \nway we employ our Navy in peacetime, crisis, and war.\n  Ashore, Admiral Johnson has re-invigorated the Naval War College, \nreminding us of the years prior to World War II, when the Navy's war \ngames anticipated nearly every enemy operation. He has conducted Battle \nExperiments with cutting-edge technology and brought together the best \nminds of government, academia, business, and the military to create new \nrule sets for an international security environment characterized by an \nInternet-driven, global economy.\n  Standing beside this officer throughout his superb career has been \nhis wife Garland, a lady to whom he owes much. She has been his key \nsupporter, devoting her life to her husband, to her family and to the \nmen and women of the Navy family. She has traveled by his side for \nthese many years visiting the Fleet. Her sacrifice and devotion have \nserved as an example and inspiration for others. This team has served \nour Navy well and we will miss them both.\n  With these words before the Senate, I seek to recognize Admiral \nJohnson for his unswerving loyalty to the Navy and the Nation. From the \nbeginning, he has\n\n[[Page S6675]]\n\nbeen a model Naval officer who has always done his duty to God and to \nCountry. It has been my personal good fortune, and the Senate's good \nfortune as a whole, to witness Admiral Johnson's leadership of the \nfinest Navy in the world.\n  The Department of the Navy and the American people have been served \nwell on his watch. The men and women of the United States Navy will not \nforget the leadership, service and dedication of Admiral Johnson as he \nhas left the Navy better prepared to face the challenges and \nopportunities of the 21st century.\n  We thank him and wish Jay, and his lovely wife Garland, fair winds \nand following seas as they continue forward in what will most assuredly \nremain lives of service to this Great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/13/senate-section/article/S6675-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          NORTHAMPTON COUNTY CELEBRATES ITS 250TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize \nNorthampton County, Pennsylvania as it begins preparation for its 250th \nanniversary. Northampton County was established in 1752, thus its \nofficial celebration will not occur until March 11, 2002. However, on \nJune 26, 2000, Northampton County kicked off this celebration with a \nlunch designed to draw support and preparation for the events in 2002.\n  Jerry Seyfried, former county executive and current court \nadministrator, is coordinating the celebration preparations. He \nmentioned some of the events that are in the works, including a parade \non September 23, 2001, a historic family treasure hunt, a black-tie \ngala, and a sports showcase. Most importantly, the celebrations will be \ngeared toward local schools, churches and ethnic groups. This \ncelebration is expected to be the largest event that Northampton County \nhas ever undertaken.\n  Northampton County has served as a crucial part of Pennsylvania's \nhistory, and I commend the area for initiating such a tremendous \ncelebration for this most historic event. I look forward to the \nupcoming festivities in 2002 and hope to participate in them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/13/senate-section/article/S6675-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting two \ntreaties and sundry nominations which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/13/senate-section/article/S6675-3", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:26 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4169.

A bill to designate certain land of the National Forest \nSystem located in the State of Virginia as wilderness; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                    virginia wilderness act of 2000\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce a \nbill that will protect one of the most beautiful areas of Virginia. \nToday, with my colleague John Warner, I am introducing the Virginia \nWilderness Act of 2000. This Act will provide wilderness status to two \nexceptional areas of Virginia. These areas, the ``Three Ridges'' and \n``The Priest'' have long been recognized for their outstanding vistas, \ndeep valleys and rugged beauty.\n  After receiving wilderness designation these areas will remain \navailable for hunting, fishing, hiking, picnicking, and other \ntraditional uses. Wilderness protections will ensure that ``The Three \nRidges'' and ``The Priest'' remain available for the full enjoyment of \nour children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n  This action is now fully supported by the Virginia delegation, and \nthe communities closest to the proposed wilderness areas. I hope we \nwill see quick action on this bill through the committee and that we \ncan move it to floor and complete action on the bill this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2865\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Virginia Wilderness Act of \n     2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF WILDERNESS AREAS.\n\n       Section 1 of the Act entitled ``An Act to designate certain \n     National Forest System lands in the States of Virginia and \n     West Virginia as wilderness areas'' (Public Law 100-326; 102 \n     Stat. 584) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (5), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (2) in paragraph (6), by striking the period and inserting \n     a semicolon; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(7) certain land in the George Washington National \n     Forest, comprising approximately 6,500 acres, as generally \n     depicted on a map entitled `The Priest Wilderness Study \n     Area', dated June 6, 2000, to be known as the `Priest \n     Wilderness Area'; and\n       ``(8) certain land in the George Washington National \n     Forest, comprising approximately 4,800 acres, as generally \n     depicted on a map entitled `The Three Ridges Wilderness Study \n     Area', dated June 6, 2000, to be known as the `Three Ridges \n     Wilderness Area.''.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of legislation to \nadd two areas in my State to the National Wilderness Preservation \nSystem. These areas, known as The Priest and the Three Ridges, are \nlocated in the George Washington National Forest and comprise \napproximately 10,500 acres.\n  The Commonwealth of Virginia is blessed with rich geographic \ndiversity. From the Chesapeake Bay in the East to the Appalachian \nMountains in the West, residents of the state and visitors alike are \nable to participate in a broad range of activities not often found in \nother areas of the country.\n  The Priest and the Three Ridges, in particular, offer unique \nopportunities for visitors to enjoy scenic views, interaction with \nwildlife, hiking, fishing, and other types of outdoor recreation. These \nareas need to be protected from development, and this legislation would \nensure that they remain pristine for the use and enjoyment of present \nand future generations.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to the designation of The Priest and \nThree Ridges as wilderness through the swift passage of this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Dodd, \n        Mr. Domenici, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Bond, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, Mr. Cochran, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Mr. L.

A bill to provide for early learning programs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                    early learning opportunities act\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues from \nboth sides of the aisle in the introduction of the ``Early Learning \nOpportunities Act of 2000''. We first brought this legislation to the \nfloor of the Senate as an amendment to the reauthorization of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. In fact, it is the pending \namendment when we return to consideration of S.2.\n  Simply stated, this bill is designed to help parents and others who \ncare for young children acquire the resources and tools that they need \nto do their most important job---nurturing and teaching our children. \nThere is broad, bi-partisan support for this legislation because many \nof my colleagues recognize the importance of learning in the first few \nyears of life.\n  Science has taught us that the most explosive time of learning for \nhumans is during the first few years of life. Parents and others who \nprovide care for our children need some help and support to make the \nmost of these early years. Changes in family structures, the weakening \nof the role of the\n\n[[Page S6679]]\n\nextended family, and the rise in the number of working mothers have \nincreased the need for communities to provide additional support for \nparents.\n  The Early Learning Opportunities Act builds on existing state and \nfederal efforts by expanding the range of programs, the types of \nactivities, and the populations served by other early learning \ninitiatives. Current federal efforts focused on early childhood \nlearning promote programs that provide full- or part-day out of home \ncare and education. Rather than duplicate these programs, the Early \nLearning Opportunities Act places its emphasis on helping parents and \nother caretakers increase their abilities to support positive child \ndevelopment.\n  The Early Learning Opportunities Act will provide funding for parent \nsupport programs. Parents are their child's most important teachers. \nBefore anyone thinks about kindergarten, teaching the alphabet, or \ncounting the number of blocks in a tower, children are learning from \ntheir parents. When a parent talks and sings to an infant, the baby is \nlearning about sounds and words as a method of communication. When \nchildren are fed and then rocked to sleep, they learn about security \nand love, which will contribute to their sense of self and autonomy. \nLong before they walk through the schoolhouse door, children have \nlearned important lessons from their parents and others who have taken \ncare of them during the first few years of life.\n  Funding for the Early Learning Opportunities Act can be used to \npromote effective parenting and family literacy through a variety of \ncommunity-based programs, services and activities. If parents are \nactively engaged in their child's early learning, their children will \nsee greater cognitive and non-cognitive benefits. While all parents \nwant their children to grow up happy and healthy, few are fully \nprepared for the demands of parenthood. Many parents have difficulty \nfinding the information and support they seek to help their children \ngrow to their full potential. Making that information and support \navailable and accessible to parents is a key component of the Early \nLearning Opportunities Act.\n  Early Learning Opportunities Act funds can be used to provide \ntraining for child care providers on early childhood development, child \nsafety, and other skills that improve the quality of child care. For \nmany families it is not possible for a parent to remain home to care \nfor their children. Their employment is not a choice, but an essential \npart of their family's economic survival. And for most of these \nfamilies, child care is not an option, but a requirement, as parents \nstruggle to meet the competing demands of work and family. Just as it \nis essential that we provide parents with the tools they need to help \ntheir children grow and develop, we also must help the people who care \nfor our nation's children while parents are at work.\n  States can use a portion of the funds made available for the Early \nLearning Opportunities Act for statewide initiatives, such as wage and \nbenefit subsidies which encourage child care staff recruitment and \nincentives to increase staff retention Today, more than 13 million \nyoung children--including half of all infants--spend at least part of \ntheir day being cared for by someone other than their parents. In \nVermont alone, there are about 22,000 children, under the age of six, \nin state-regulated child care.\n  The Early Learning Opportunities Act will improve local collaboration \nand coordination among child care providers, parents, libraries, \ncommunity centers, schools, and other community service providers. By \nassessing existing resources and identifying local needs, the community \norganizations receiving funds will serve as a catalyst for the more \neffective use of early learning dollars and the removal of barriers \nthat prevent more children, parents and caretakers from participating \nin good programs. Parents and child care providers will be able to \naccess more services, activities and programs that help them care for \nchildren.\n  An investment in early learning today will save money tomorrow. Many \nof America's children enter school without the necessary abilities and \nmaturity. Without successful remediation efforts, these children \ncontinue to lag behind for their entire academic career. We spend \nbillions of dollars on efforts to help these children catch up. \nResearch has demonstrated that for each dollar invested in quality \nearly learning programs, the federal government can save over five \ndollars. These savings result from future reductions in the number of \nchildren and families who participate in federal government programs \nlike Title I, special education, and welfare.\n  The Early Learning Opportunities Act is designed to be locally \ncontrolled and driven by the unique needs of each community. The \nlegislation authorizes $3.25 billion in discretionary funding over \nthree years for early learning block grants to states. The bill ensures \nthat the majority of the funds will channeled through the states to \nlocal councils. The councils are charged with assessing the early \nlearning needs of the community, and distributing the funds to a broad \nvariety of local resources to meet those needs. In Vermont, the Success \nby Six initiative has demonstrated the importance of placing the \nresources and responsibilities at the local community level.\n  The Early Learning Opportunities Act will serve as a catalyst to \nengage diverse sectors of the community in increasing programs, \nservices, and activities that promote the healthy development of our \nyoungest citizens. Funds may be used by the local councils in a variety \nof ways: to support reading readiness programs in libraries, parenting \nclasses at the local health center, parent-child recreation programs in \nthe park, and child development classes at the school. Access to \nexisting early learning programs can be increased by expanding the days \nor times that young children are served, by increasing the number of \nchildren served, or by improving the affordability of programs for low-\nincome children. Transportation can be provided to increase \nparticipation in early learning programs, activities and services. By \nkeeping the use of the funds flexible, local councils can work with \nparents, health care professionals, educators, child care providers, \nrecreation specialists, and other groups and individuals in the \ncommunity to create an affordable, accessible network of early learning \nactivities.\n  The Early Learning Opportunities Act will help parents and care \ngivers who are looking for better ways to integrate positive learning \nexperiences into the daily lives of our youngest children. When \nchildren enter school ready to learn, all of the advantages of their \nschool experiences are opened to them--their opportunities are \nunlimited. I urge my colleagues to support and co-sponsor the ``Early \nLearning Opportunities Act of 2000''. I urge you to give our nation's \nchildren every opportunity to succeed in school and in life.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, our bipartisan goal in introducing The \nEarly Learning Opportunities Act is to provide greater support for \nparents across the country in preparing their children for a lifetime \nof learning, beginning at the earliest age.\n  I commend Senators Stevens, Jeffords, Dodd, Domenici, and Kerry for \ntheir support and leadership in developing this legislation and in \nseeing to it that children's voices are heard and their needs are a \npriority in this Congress. Senator Kerry and I have worked together to \nimprove early learning opportunities in Massachusetts, and this \nnational initiative is based in part on successful models in our state. \nSenator Dodd has been an outstanding leader on children's issues for \nmany years. Senator Jeffords, the chairman of our Senate committee, has \nshown great skill and determination in shaping this legislation, and in \nkeeping our committee focused on the important issue of early learning. \nSenator Domenici has been an essential ally throughout the development \nof this bill, as has the senior Senator from Alaska. Senator Stevens \nand I introduced the Early Learning Trust Fund Act as a predecessor to \nthis legislation, and he was a leader in obtaining approval of $8.5 \nbillion for early learning in this year's Senate budget resolution.\n  Clearly, the need for this legislation is urgent. Today's families \nare legitimately worried about the quality of care provided to their \ninfants and toddlers while the parents are at work. Of mothers with \nchildren aged zero to five, a record 64 percent worked outside the home \nin 1999. The average cost of care for each of these children is four\n\n[[Page S6680]]\n\nto ten thousand dollars a year. This is their highest expense besides \nfood and shelter, consuming a quarter to half of their wages. Too \noften, even this level of sacrifice isn't enough. Many families simply \ncannot find quality care for their children. Facilities are dangerous, \ncrowded, or closed at the non-traditional times that many mothers work. \nLow wages attract the least skilled care givers, over a third of whom \nquit each year. Enforcement of quality standards is rare. Elementary \nand Secondary education fully deserve to be a priority for the nation, \nbut so does early learning--and it is needed at a time when many young \nfamilies are least able to bear the full cost.\n  In Massachusetts, the Community Partnerships for Children Program \ncurrently provides quality full-day early learning for 15,300 young \nchildren from low-income families. Yet today, over 14,000 additional \neligible children in the state are waiting for the early learning \nservices they need--and some have been on the waiting list for 18 \nmonths. A 1999 report by the Congressional General Accounting Office on \nearly learning services for low-income families was unequivocal--\n``infant toddler care [is] still difficult to obtain.''\n  Even as the need to provide early learning opportunities increases, \nit is clear that many current facilities are unsafe. The average early \nlearning provider is paid under seven dollars an hour--less than the \naverage parking lot attendant or pet sitter. These low wages result in \nhigh turnover, poor quality of care, and little trust and bonding with \nthe children.\n  The Nation's military faced these same problems in the 1980's, and \nbecause of the threat that the poor quality of care posed to children, \nto morale, and to retention of personnel, the armed forces worked long \nand well to create a model program. The Defense Department now provides \nquality care to 200,000 children. Many European nations have followed \nthe same path as the U.S. military, building a broad array of quality \nearly learning models that prepare children to reach their full \npotential.\n\n  Head Start is one example of the kind of quality program that has \nalready proved effective throughout the United States. A recent survey \nfound that more parents are satisfied with Head Start than any other \nfederal program. But only two in five eligible 3- and 4-year-olds are \nenrolled in Head Start--and only one in 100 eligible infants and \ntoddlers are enrolled in Early Head Start. As a result, literally \nmillions of young children never have the chance to reach their full \npotential. We must do better, and we can do better.\n  It is time to act to make early learning a top education priority for \nthe nation, just as governors urged us to do a full decade ago. All \npreschool children should have access to the kind of care and brain \nstimulation necessary to enable them to enter school ready to learn. We \ncannot rest until all children have the opportunity to develop to their \nfull potential.\n  Academic studies have confirmed what parents have long understood--\neducation occurs over a continuum that begins at birth and extends \nthroughout life. Study after study proves that positive brain \nstimulation very early in life significantly improves a child's later \nability to learn, to interact successfully with teachers and peers, and \nto develop crucial skills like curiosity, trust, and perseverance. Two \nyears ago, the Rand Corporation reported that ``after critically \nreviewing the literature and discounting claims that are not rigorously \ndemonstrated, we conclude that these [early learning] programs can \nprovide significant benefits.'' Governors, state legislatures, local \ngovernments, and educators have all supported these studies and called \nfor increased investments in early learning as the most effective way \nto promote healthy and constructive behavior.\n  The goal of this legislation is to enable all children to enter \nschool ready to learn, and to maximize the impact of federal, state, \nand local investments in education. We must do more to ensure that \nchildren have access to the experiences they need during the five or \nsix years before they walk through their first schoolhouse door. \nEducation begins at birth. It is not a process that occurs only in a \nschool building during a school day. When our policies respond to this \nreality, we will reduce delinquency, improve productivity, and become a \nstronger and better nation. Early learning programs are good for \nchildren, good for parents and good for society as a whole.\n  The Committee for Economic Development reports that the nation can \nsave over five dollars in the future for every dollar invested in early \nlearning today. The investment significantly reduces the number of \nfamilies on welfare, the number of children in special education, and \nthe number of children in the juvenile justice system. Investment in \nearly learning is not only morally right--it is economically right.\n  Two months ago, Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, a bipartisan coalition \nincluding hundreds of police chiefs, sheriffs, and crime victims, \nreleased another convincing report. It finds that children who receive \nquality early learning are half as likely to commit crimes and be \narrested later in life. Our greatest opportunity to reach at-risk \nchildren is in their youngest years.\n  It is especially important for low-income parents who accept the \nresponsibility of work under welfare reform to have access to quality \nearly learning opportunities for their children. The central idea of \nwelfare reform is that families caught in a cycle of dependence can be \nshown that work pays. But children's development must not be sacrificed \nas families move from welfare to work.\n  We must expand access to Head Start and Early Head Start. We must \nmake parenting assistance available to all who want it. We must support \nmodel state efforts that have already proved successful, such as \nCommunity Partnerships for Children in Massachusetts and Smart Start in \nNorth Carolina, which rely on local councils to identify early learning \nneeds in each community and allocate new resources to meet them. We \nmust give higher priority to early childhood literacy. In ways such as \nthese, we can take bolder action to strengthen early learning \nopportunities in communities across the nation.\n  The legislation that we introduce today will move us closer to all of \nthese goals. It includes $3.25 billion over the next three years to \nenable local communities to fill the gaps that limit current early \nlearning efforts. Local councils will direct the funds to the most \nurgent needs in each community. These needs include parenting support \nand education--improving child care quality through professional \ndevelopment and retention initiatives--expanding the times and the days \nthat parents can obtain these services--enhancing childhood literacy--\nand greater early learning opportunities for children with special \nneeds. These priorities are designed to strengthen early learning \nprograms in all communities across the country, and give each community \nthe opportunity to invest the funds in ways that will meet its most \nurgent needs.\n  Much more needs to be done to improve early learning throughout \nAmerica. But we know from our experience in improving the military's \nearly learning program that with small steps, over time we can go a \nlong way. I urge the Senate to approve this important bill, and I look \nforward to its enactment and to the significant differences it will \nmake.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE:\n       S. 2867. A bill to provide for the funding and \n     administration of a Veterans Mission for Youth Initiative \n     within the Troops-to-Teachers Program; to the Committee on \n     Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                 VETERANS MISSION FOR YOUTH INITIATIVE\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill today--\nthe ``Veterans Mission for Youth Initiative''--that would expand the \ncurrent mission of the successful Troops to Teachers program. As many \nof my colleagues know, Troops to Teachers is a practical and sensible \nteacher recruitment program--a program that helps our veterans and \nretired military personnel gain the necessary certification to teach in \nour children's classrooms.\n  The bill I am introducing today would build on the current program's \nsuccess by expanding its mission to help veterans who want to volunteer \nin our schools and be role models, but do not necessarily want to \nbecome certified teachers. This bill not only will help children \nbenefit from the knowledge and experiences of veterans, but it also \nwill help our veterans get more involved and active in their own local\n\n[[Page S6681]]\n\ncommunities. I am pleased that Governor George W. Bush is proposing \nthis same idea today in Pittsburgh.\n  Specifically, the ``Veterans Mission for Youth Initiative,'' would \nauthorize $75 million to be used for matching federal grants to \ncommunity organizations that help train and then link veterans and \nretired military personnel with local school volunteer opportunities to \nmentor and tutor students. The grant program will be administered \nthrough the Defense Department's Defense Activity for Non-Traditional \nEducation Support division, which runs the Troops-to-Teachers program.\n  Mr. President, the sad reality is that our schools are in crisis--\nespecially in the inner cities and in places like Appalachia. And, I am \nfrustrated and saddened that far too many children simply are not \ngetting the quality education they deserve. The current Troops to \nTeachers program is helping to improve educational quality in America \nby providing mature, motivated, experienced, and dedicated personnel \nfor our nation's classrooms. In fact, when administrators were asked to \nrate Troops to Teachers participants in their schools, 54 percent of \nthe administrators said that the former military personnel turned \nteachers were among the best teachers at the schools. I am pleased to \nsay that since 1994, 3,720 retired members of the U.S. military have \nbeen hired as teachers in all 50 states.\n  Additionally, a 1999 alternative teacher certification study found \nthat participants in the Troops to Teachers program broaden the make-up \nand skills of our current teacher pool. For example, 30 percent of \nparticipants are minorities, compared to 10 percent of all teachers; 30 \npercent of participants are teaching math, compared to 13 percent of \nall teachers; 39 percent are willing to teach in inner cities compared \nto the current 16 percent urban teaching force; and 90 percent are \nmale, compared to the overall current teaching force which is 26 \npercent male.\n  By expanding the current mission of the Troops to Teachers program by \nhelping to link veterans with community volunteer opportunities to \ntutor and mentor school children, we can strengthen our education \nsystem overall. By linking students and America's retired military \npersonnel--men and women who have exhibited the ideals of discipline, \norder, courage, and civic responsibility--we can teach our children \nvaluable lessons outside the classroom.\n  Sadly, Mr. President, a recent survey of American youth, called the \n``New Millennium Project,'' found that students chose as their three \nlowest-ranking priorities in life: 1. Being a good citizen who cares \nabout the good of the country; 2. Being involved in democracy and \nvoting; and 3. Being involved in helping make one's community a better \nplace. Furthermore, a recent survey by the Horatio Alger Society found \nthat 21 percent of students had no heroes.\n  We need to change this, Mr. President. We need to change these \napathetic and aimless attitudes. We need to give American youth some \ndirection--the right direction. After all, these children are our \nfuture--we need to equip them with an arsenal of lessons--lessons they \ncan learn in the classroom and out of the classroom by interacting with \nour country's heroes--our veterans.\n  The bottom line is this: As a nation, we need to do all we can to get \nthe best teachers available into our public schools. We are trying to \ndo just that through the current Troops to Teachers program. Now, the \n``Veteran's Mission for Youth Initiative'' is another step in that \ndirection. I urge my colleagues to support this effort and to join me \nin taking an important step toward improving education in this country. \nWe owe it to our children; we it to our veterans; and we owe it to our \nnation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2867\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act with respect \nto children's health; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n                  children's public health act of 2000\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nJeffords, Kennedy, Dodd, DeWine, Reed, Murray, Bond, Hatch, Gorton, \nAbraham, and Durbin to introduce the Children's Public Health Act of \n2000.\n  This bill is the result of months of close collaboration begun last \nfall between members of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee, and in discussion with Congressmen Bliley and Bilirakis to \nbegin an effort to address children's health issues this Congress.\n  I am pleased that the House has already passed a companion bill to \nthe one which we introduce today, and I look forward to working with \nthe House to ensure that we enact this needed bill by the end of the \nyear.\n  The Children's Public Health Act of 2000 has four overriding themes \nrepresented in its four titles: Injury Prevention, Maternal and Infant \nHealth, Pediatric Health Promotion, and Pediatric Research. I view \nthese four themes as critical to ensuring that we are able to promote \nthe health of our Nation's children.\n  In the first title we address the critical problem of unintentional \ninjuries. According to the CDC, unintentional injuries are the leading \ncause of death for every age group between 1 and 19 years of age. \nUnintentional injuries comprise 26 deaths per 100,000 children aged 1-\n14 and 62 deaths per 100,000 children aged 15-19. In addition, more \nthan 1,500,000 children in the United States sustain a brain injury \neach year. To help address this problem, the bill would reauthorize and \nstrengthen the Traumatic Brain Injury programs at the Centers for \nDisease Control (CDC) and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health \n(NIH) and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).\n  The bill also includes a provision which I originally introduced with \nSenator Dodd in March of this year, to address the issue of child care \nhealth and safety. In my own state of Tennessee, there have been 4 \ndeaths in the past 3 years in child care settings, and 1 in 15 child-\ncare programs in the Nashville area were found by state inspectors to \nhave potentially put the health and safety of children at risk during \n1999. In addition, in 1997, 31,000 children aged 4 and younger were \ntreated in hospital emergency rooms for injuries sustained in child \ncare or school settings across this nation. Therefore, the bill \ncontains child care safety and health grants to assist states to fund \nspecific activities to increase safety and health in child care \nsettings.\n  To address the tragic fact that birth defects are the leading cause \nof infant mortality and are responsible for about 30 percent of all \npediatric hospital admissions, the second title of the bill focuses on \nmaternal and infant health. According to the CDC, an estimated 3,000 \nbirth defects have been identified, of which 70 percent have no known \ncause. To provide national leadership to combat birth defects, the bill \nwould establish a National Center for Birth Defects and Developmental \nDisabilities at the CDC, which is strongly supported by the March of \nDimes and other birth defects groups, to collect, analyze, and \ndistribute data on birth defects. In addition, the bill authorizes the \nHealthy Start program for the first time, which is designed to reduce \nthe rate of infant mortality and improve perinatal outcomes by \nproviding grants to areas with a high incidence of infant mortality and \nlow birth weight. This bill also contains folic acid education programs \nto spread the knowledge of the positive health effects of folic acid in \nthe diet of pregnant women.\n\n  To address the fact that over 3,000 women experience serious \ncomplications due to pregnancy and that 2 to 3 of these women will die \nfrom pregnancy complications, the bill would develop a national \nmonitoring and surveillance program to better understand the burden of \nmaterial complications and mortality and to decrease the disparities \namong populations at risk of death and complications from pregnancy.\n  The third title addresses the promotion of pediatric health by \nfocusing on screening and prevention programs to combat some of the \nmost common childhood diseases and conditions. This bill helps to \ncombat asthma, the most common chronic disease of childhood, affecting \nnearly 5 million children under the age of 18 in the United States, by \nproviding comprehensive asthma services to children and to coordinate \nthe wide range of asthma prevention programs in the federal government.\n  We also focus on childhood obesity, which has increased by 100% among \nchildren in just the past 15 years, and has resulted in 4.7 million \nchildren and adolescents ages 6-19 years becoming seriously overweight. \nTo address this obesity epidemic, the bill provides programs to support \nthe development, implementation, and evaluation of state and community-\nbased programs to promote good nutrition and increased physical \nactivity among American youth.\n  In examining the problems affecting children across the nation and in \nTennessee, I was very concerned to learn that in Memphis, Tennessee, \nover 12 percent of children under the of age of 6 have screened \npositive for lead poisoning. At high levels, lead can cause a variety \nof debilitating health problems, including seizure, coma, and even \ndeath. At lower levels, lead can contribute to learning disabilities, \nloss of intelligence, hyperactivity, and behavioral problems. This bill \nincludes physician education and training programs on current lead \nscreening policies, tracks the percentage of children in the Health \nCenters program who are screened for lead poisoning, and conducts \noutreach and education for families at risk of lead poisoning.\n  This bill also targets pediatric oral health, which was recently \nhighlighted by the May 2000, Surgeon General report which focused on \nthe fact that oral health is inseparable from overall health, and that \nwhile there have been great improvements in oral health for a majority \nof the population, there are disparities that primarily affect poor \nchildren and those who live in underserved areas of our country, with \n80 percent of all dental cavities found in 20 percent of children. This \nbill would support community-based research and training to improve the \nunderstanding of etiology, pathogenesis, diagnoses, prevention, and \ntreatment of pediatric oral, dental, and craniofacial diseases. In \naddition, the bill would provide state grants to increase community \nwater fluoridation and to provide school-based dental sealant services \nto children in low income areas.\n  The last title of this bill is a focus on strengthening pediatric \nresearch efforts in the country. To give us a fuller understanding of \nhow we can help promote the health of our children we establish a \nPediatric Research Initiative within the National Institutes of Health \nto enhance collaborative efforts, provide increased support for \npediatric biomedical research, and ensure that opportunities for \nadvancement in scientific investigations and care for children are \nrealized. The bill would also expand research into autism, which \naffects 1 in 500 children, establish a long term Child Development \nStudy at the NIH to evaluate the effects of both chronic and \nintermittent exposures on human development.\n  Mr. President, this bill is comprehensive; it systematically \naddresses several critical childhood health issues and I am committed \nto ensure that it will be enacted before the end of this Congress. I \nwould like to thank Senator Jeffords, the chairman of the Senate \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and Senator Kennedy and \ntheir staffs for their critical collaboration which has led to the \ndevelopment of a strong bipartisan bill. I would also like to thank \nSenators Dodd, DeWine, Reed, Murray, Bond, Hatch, Gorton, Abraham, and \nDurbin, for their work on selected provision's in this bill and to \ntheir commitment to children's health issues. I would also like to \nthank Mr. Bill Baird, from the Office of Senate Legislative Counsel, \nfor his great work in drafting this bill. I ask unanimous consent that \na full summary of the bill appear in the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S6683]]\n\n           The Children's Public Health Act of 2000--Summary\n\n       In an effort to address the health and well being of our \n     most precious resource, the Children's Public Health Act of \n     2000 amends the Public Health Service Act to revise, extend, \n     and establish programs with respect to children's health \n     research, health promotion and disease prevention activities \n     conducted through Federal public health agencies. The Act \n     contains four titles to address critical issues in the areas \n     of children's health; including Injury Prevention, Maternal \n     and Infant Health, Pediatric Public Health Promotion, and \n     Pediatric Research.\n\n\n                       title I--injury prevention\n\n     Subtitle A--Traumatic Brain Injury\n       Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a term descriptive of \n     injury occurring to the brain as a result of external forces. \n     These injuries may include intracranial (inside the skull) or \n     intraparenchymal (inside the brain tissue) hemorrhage, \n     parenchymal edema, or shear injury. The CDC Center for Injury \n     Prevention estimates that more than 1,500,000 children in the \n     US sustain a brain injury each year, and many more are living \n     with the consequences. According to the CDC National Center \n     for Health Statistics, unintentional injuries including TBI \n     are the leading cause of death for every age group from 1 to \n     19 years of age, comprising 26 deaths per 100,000 children \n     aged 1-14 and 62 deaths per 100,000 children aged 15-19. \n     Younger children and infants are at an increased risk of \n     brain injury because the size and weight of their heads is \n     greater in proportion to their body size. Young children also \n     lack mature muscle control, which contributes to an increased \n     risk of head injury.\n       This provision would reauthorize the Traumatic Brain Injury \n     Act of 1996 to extent the authority for CDC to support \n     research into strategies for the prevention of TBI and \n     implementing public information and education programs for \n     the prevention of TBI. NIH research is expanded to cognitive \n     disorders and neurobehavioral consequences arising from TBI. \n     The bill authorizes HRSA to make grants for community support \n     services to develop, change, or enhance service delivery \n     systems. Grants may be used to educate consumers and \n     families, train professionals, improve case management, \n     develop best practices in the areas of family support, return \n     to work, and housing for people with traumatic brain injury.\n     Subtitle B--Child Care Safety and Health Grants\n       Of the 21 million children under the age of 6 in the United \n     States, almost 13 million spend some part of their day in \n     child care. There is alarming evidence to suggest that more \n     must be done to improve the health and safety of children in \n     child care settings. For example, a 1998 Consumer Product \n     Safety Commission Study revealed that two-thirds of the 200 \n     licensed child care settings investigated exhibited safety \n     hazards, such as insufficient child safety gates, cribs with \n     soft bedding, and unsafe playgrounds. In 1997 alone, 31,000 \n     children age 4 and younger were treated in hospital emergency \n     rooms for injuries sustained in child care school settings. \n     Even more tragically, since 1990 more than 56 children have \n     died in child care settings.\n       To address the need for increased safety of child care \n     facilities, this provision would give the Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services the authority to provide grants to states \n     to carry out activities related to the improvement of the \n     health and safety of children in child care settings. Grants \n     may be used for two or more of the following activities: \n     train and educate child care provides to prevent injuries and \n     illnesses and to promote health-related practices; strengthen \n     and enforce child care provider licensing, regulation, and \n     registration; rehabilitate child care facilities to meet \n     health and safety standards; provide health consultants to \n     give health and safety advice to child care providers; \n     enhance child care providers' ability to serve children with \n     disabilities; conduct criminal background checks on child \n     care providers; provide information to parents on choosing a \n     safe and healthy setting for their children; or improve the \n     safety of transportation of children in child care.\n\n\n                  title ii--maternal and infant health\n\n     Subtitle A--Safe Motherhood and Infant Health Prevention\n       Every day, 2-3 women die from pregnancy complications and \n     over 3,000 women experience serious complications due to \n     pregnancy. Despite nearly 4 million deliveries in the United \n     States each year, we have little information about unintended \n     health consequences related to pregnancy and childbirth. The \n     nation's infant mortality rate has steadily declined over the \n     last decade, but the percentage of women who die in \n     childbirth has remained unchanged. Maternal mortality rates \n     reveal significant disparities between African American and \n     white women, but the reasons for those differences are not \n     well understood. When compared with white women, black women \n     continue to have four times the risk for dying from \n     complications of pregnancy and childbirth.\n       The provision would authorize the Secretary of HHS to \n     develop a national monitoring and surveillance program to \n     better understand the burden of maternal complications and \n     mortality and to decrease the disparities among populations \n     at risk of death and complications from pregnancy. The \n     provision would also allow the Secretary to expand the \n     Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System program to \n     provide surveillance and data collection in each of the 50 \n     States. Furthermore, the provision would expand research \n     concerning risk factors, prevention strategies, and the roles \n     of the family, health care providers, and the community in \n     safe motherhood. The provision also authorizes public \n     education campaigns on healthy pregnancies, education \n     programs for health care providers, and activities to promote \n     community support services for pregnant women. Finally, the \n     provision provides grant funding for research initiatives and \n     prevention programs on drug, alcohol, and smoking prevention \n     and cessation for pregnant women.\n     Subtitle B--Healthy Start Initiative\n       The Healthy Start initiative began as a demonstration \n     project in 1991 to help mothers from disadvantaged \n     neighborhoods improve their chances of having a healthy \n     pregnancy and, ultimately, a healthy baby. This provision \n     authorizes the Healthy Start program for the first time. \n     Healthy Start is designed to reduce the rate of infant \n     mortality and improve perinatal outcomes by providing \n     grants to areas with a high rate of infant mortality and \n     low birth weight. Newly authorized services include \n     expanding access to surgical services to the fetus, \n     pregnant woman, and infant during the first year after \n     birth.\n     Subtitle C--National Center for Birth Defects and \n         Developmental Disabilities\n       Birth defects are the leading cause of infant mortality and \n     are responsible for about 30% of all pediatric hospital \n     admissions. According to the CDC, of the estimated 3,000 \n     different birth defects that have been identified, up to 70% \n     without a known cause. Of the four million babies born each \n     year in the United States, approximately 150,000 are born \n     with one or more serious birth defects. About 17% of U.S. \n     children under 18 years of age have a developmental \n     disability. In the United States, 12 out of every 1,000 \n     school children have mental retardation, approximately 10,000 \n     infants born each year develop cerebral palsy, and as many as \n     1 in every 500 children under 15 years of age may have one of \n     the autism spectrum disorders.\n       This provision would create a National Center for Birth \n     Defects and Developmental Disabilities within the CDC. The \n     purpose of this Center would be to collect, analyze, and \n     distribute data on birth defects including information on \n     causes, incidence, and prevalence; conduct applied \n     epidemiological research on the prevention of such defects; \n     and provide information to the public on proven prevention \n     activities.\n     Subtitle D--Folic Acid Education Programs\n       Each year, an estimated 2,500 infants are born in the \n     United States with serious birth defects of the brain and \n     spine, called neural tube defects. The most common neural \n     tube defects are spina bifida, which is due to an incomplete \n     closure of the spinal column, and anencephaly, a fatal \n     condition where an infant is born with a severely \n     underdeveloped brain and skull. Spina bifida is the leading \n     cause of childhood paralysis. As many as 70 percent of all \n     neural tube birth defects could be prevented if all women of \n     childbearing age consumed 400 micrograms of folic acid daily, \n     beginning before pregnancy. Folic acid is a B vitamin found \n     naturally in leafy green vegetables, beans, citrus fruits, \n     and juices. Since January 1998, the Food and Drug \n     Administration has required that all foods containing \n     enriched flour, such as breads, pasta, and breakfast cereal, \n     be fortified with folic acid. In addition to consuming a diet \n     high in folate-rich foods, a daily multivitamin is one of the \n     most reliable sources of folic acid. A majority of women are \n     not aware of this prevention opportunity, nor are they \n     consuming the recommended daily amount. A national folic \n     campaign is needed to urge women to take this simple step to \n     prevent neural tube defects.\n       This provision would establish a national folic acid \n     education program to prevent birth defects. CDC, in \n     partnership with the States and local, public, and private \n     entities, is authorized to launch an education and public \n     awareness campaign; conduct research to identify effective \n     strategies for increasing folic acid consumption by women of \n     reproductive capacity; and evaluate the effectiveness of \n     these strategies.\n\n\n              title iii--pediatric public health promotion\n\n     Subtitle A--Asthma\n       Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood. It \n     affects nearly five million children under the age of 18 in \n     the United States, and the incidence is dramatically \n     increasing. Several studies suggest that between 1980 and \n     1994, asthma increased 160% among children under age 4, and \n     74% among children aged 5-14. According to the National \n     Center for Health Statistics, children under 18 years of age \n     miss nearly 72 out of every 1,000 school days due to asthma. \n     This is more than three times the number of missed school \n     days than their unaffected peers accounting for almost 10 \n     million missed days each year.\n       This provision would authorize the Secretary to award \n     grants to provide comprehensive asthma services to children, \n     equip mobile care clinics, conduct patient and family \n     education on asthma management, and identify children \n     eligible for Medicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance \n     Program, and other children's health programs. This provision \n     amends the Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant \n     program to provide for the establishment, operation, and \n     coordination of effective and cost-\n\n[[Page S6684]]\n\n     efficient systems to reduce the prevalence of asthma and \n     asthma-related illnesses among urban populations, especially \n     children, by reducing the level of exposure to cockroach \n     allergen through the use of integrated pest management. This \n     provision also requires HHS to establish a coordinating \n     committee to identify all Federal programs that carry out \n     asthma-related activities; develop, in consultation with \n     appropriate Federal agencies, professional and voluntary \n     health organizations, a Federal plan for responding to \n     asthma; and submit recommendations to Congress within 12 \n     months after enactment regarding ways to strengthen and \n     improve the coordination of asthma-related Federal \n     activities.\n     Subtitle B--Childhood Obesity Prevention\n       Obesity has increased by more than 50 percent among adults \n     and 100 percent among children in just the past 15 years. \n     Approximately 4.7 million children, or 11% of youths ages 6-\n     19 years are seriously overweight. Obesity is associated with \n     many of the leading causes of death and disability, including \n     heart disease, diabetes, certain forms of arthritis, and \n     cancer. Research shows that 60% of overweight 5 to 10 year \n     old children already have at least one risk factor for heart \n     disease (hyperlipidemia, hypertension, or altered insulin \n     levels). Almost 25 percent of young people ages 6-17 are \n     overweight, and the percentage who are seriously overweight \n     has doubled in the last 30 years. Part of the reason for \n     youth inactivity is the reduction of daily participation in \n     high school physical education classes has declined from 42 \n     percent in 1991 to 27 percent in 1997.\n       This provision would authorize the CDC to administer a \n     competitive grant program to support the development, \n     implementation, and evaluation of state and community-based \n     programs to promote good nutrition and increased physical \n     activity among American children and adolescents. States \n     would be required to develop comprehensive, inter-agency \n     school- and community-based approaches to encourage and \n     promote nutrition and physical activity in local \n     communities. The proposal would allow CDC to provide \n     states with technical support as well as disseminate \n     information about effective prevention strategies and \n     interventions in treating obesity.\n       The CDC will coordinate and conduct research to improve our \n     understanding of the relationship between physical activity, \n     diet, health, and other factors that contribute to obesity. \n     Research will also focus on developing and evaluating \n     effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of \n     obesity and eating disorders, as well as study the prevalence \n     and cost of childhood obesity and its effects into adulthood.\n       The CDC in collaboration with State and local health, \n     nutrition, and physical activity experts, will develop a \n     nationwide public education campaign regarding the health \n     risks associated with poor nutrition and physical inactivity, \n     and will promote information on effective ways to incorporate \n     good eating habits and regular physical activity into daily \n     living.\n       The CDC, in collaboration with HRSA, will develop and carry \n     out a program to train health professionals in effective \n     strategies to better identify, assess, and counsel (or refer) \n     patients with obesity, an eating disorder, or who are at risk \n     of becoming obese or developing an eating disorder. They will \n     also develop and carry out a program to educate and train \n     educators and child care professionals in effective \n     strategies to teach children and their families about ways to \n     improve dietary habits and levels of physical activity.\n     Subtitle C--Childhood Lead Prevention\n       At high levels, lead can cause a variety of debilitating \n     health problems, including seizure, coma, and even death. At \n     lower levels, lead can contribute to learning disabilities, \n     loss of intelligence, hyperactivity, and behavioral problems. \n     Screening is a critical element in eliminating childhood lead \n     poisoning because in most cases there are no distinctive or \n     obvious symptoms. Children with elevated blood lead levels \n     are seven times more likely to drop out of high school and \n     six times more likely to have reading disabilities. It costs \n     an average of $10,000 more a year to educate a lead-poisoned \n     child.\n       This provision requires HRSA to report annually to the \n     Congress on the percentage of children in the Health Centers \n     program who are screened for lead poisoning. Requires HRSA to \n     work with the CDC and HCFA to conduct physician education and \n     training programs on current lead screening policies along \n     with the scientific, medical, and public health basis for \n     such policies.\n       This provision requires CDC to issue recommendations and \n     establish requirements for its grantees to ensure uniform and \n     complete reporting of blood lead levels from laboratories to \n     State and local health departments and to improve data \n     linkages between health departments, CDC, WIC, Early Head \n     Start, and other federally funded means-tested public benefit \n     programs.\n       This provision authorizes new funding through the Maternal \n     and Child Health Block Grant to states with a demonstrated \n     need (based on local surveillance data) to conduct outreach \n     and education for families at risk of lead poisoning, provide \n     individual family education designed to reduce exposures to \n     children with elevated blood lead levels, implement community \n     environmental interventions, and ensure continuous quality \n     measurement and improvement plans for communities committed \n     to comprehensive lead poisoning prevention.\n     Subtitle D--Oral Health\n       In May 2000, the Surgeon General of the United States \n     published the landmark report, Oral Health in America: A \n     Report of the Surgeon General. The report focuses on the fact \n     that oral health is inseparable from overall health. However, \n     tooth decay is the most prevalent preventable chronic disease \n     of childhood and only the common cold, the flu and onitis \n     media occur more often among young children. And while there \n     have been great improvements in oral health for a majority of \n     the population, there are disparities that primarily affect \n     poor children and those who live in underserved areas of our \n     country, with 80 percent of all dental cavities found in 20 \n     percent of the children. ``The devastating consequences of \n     untreated disease can affect children's health and well \n     being, causing pain and suffering, time lost from school, \n     loss of permanent teeth, self-consciousness and loss of self-\n     esteem, and even more complications in children with \n     coexisting medical conditions.'' The United States must \n     improve and enhance the training of dental health \n     professionals to meet the increasing need for dental services \n     for children .\n       This provision would require the Secretary of HHS to \n     support community-based research and training to improve the \n     understanding of etiology, pathogenesis, diagnoses, \n     prevention and treatment of pediatric oral, dental and \n     craniofacial diseases and conditions. The Secretary of HHS is \n     authorized to provide grants to States to increase community \n     water fluoridation and to provide school-based dental sealant \n     services to children in low income areas.\n\n\n                      title vi--pediatric research\n\n     Subtitle A--Pediatric Research Initiative\n       The rapidly expanding knowledge base in genetics and \n     biomedicine affords an unparalleled opportunity to understand \n     gene-environment interactions and to apply this knowledge to \n     the benefit of children and society. Findings in pediatric \n     research not only promote and maintain health throughout a \n     child's lifespan, but also contribute significantly to new \n     insights and discoveries that will aid in the prevention and \n     treatment of illnesses and conditions among adults. A growing \n     body of evidence shows that risk factors for diseases such as \n     coronary artery disease and stroke begin in childhood and \n     persist through adulthood.\n       This provision would establish a Pediatric Research \n     Initiative within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to \n     enhance collaborative efforts, provide increased support for \n     pediatric biomedical research, and ensure that expanding \n     opportunities for advancement in scientific investigations \n     and care for children are realized.\n       The Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) will make \n     available enhanced support for activities relating to the \n     training and career development of pediatric researchers, \n     including  general authority for loan repayment of a portion \n     of education loans.\n     Subtitle B--Autism\n       Autism and autism spectrum disorders are biologically-based \n     neurodevelopment diseases that cause severe impairments in \n     language and communication. These disorders often manifest in \n     young children sometime during the first two years of life. \n     Estimates indicate that 1 in 500 children born today will be \n     diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder and that 400,000 \n     Americans have autism or an autism spectrum disorder.\n       Under this provision, the Director of NIH shall expand, \n     intensify, and coordinate the activities of the NIH with \n     respect to research on autism. The Director of NIH will carry \n     out through NIMH and other agencies that may be appropriate, \n     and establish not less than five Centers of Excellence on \n     autism research. Each center will conduct basic and clinical \n     research into the cause, diagnosis, early detection, \n     prevention, control and treatment of autism, including \n     research in the fields of developmental neurobiology, \n     genetics and psychopharmacology. The Director shall provide \n     for the coordination of information among centers. A center \n     may provide individuals referrals for health and other \n     services and patient care services as required for research. \n     The Director shall provide for a program under which samples \n     of tissues and genetic materials that are of use in research \n     on autism are made available for this research.\n       The proposal also establishes through the CDC, at least \n     three regional centers of excellence in autism and pervasive \n     developmental disabilities epidemiology to collect and \n     analyze information on the number, incidence, and causes of \n     autism and related developmental disabilities would be \n     established. The Secretary shall establish a program to \n     provide information on autism to health professionals and the \n     general public, and establish an Autism Coordinating \n     Committee to coordinate all efforts within HHS on autism.\n     Subtitle B--Child Development Study\n       Findings in pediatric research not only promote and \n     maintain health throughout a child's lifespan, but also \n     contribute significantly to new insights and discoveries that \n     will aid in the prevention and treatment of illnesses and \n     conditions among adults. A growing body of evidence shows \n     that risk factors for diseases such as coronary artery \n     disease and stroke begin in childhood and persist through \n     adulthood. Children are more vulnerable to physical, \n     chemical, biological, safety, and psychosocial exposures than \n     adults. Evidence-based policies and effective\n\n[[Page S6685]]\n\n     prevention and health promotion strategies to achieve a \n     healthy and safe environment for children and families, are \n     best derived from a federal multi-agency longitudinal study.\n       Authorizes NICHD to convene and direct a consortium of \n     federal agencies, including CDC and EPA, to plan, develop and \n     implement a prospective cohort study to evaluate the effects \n     of both chronic and intermittent exposures on human \n     development, and to investigate basic mechanisms of \n     developmental disorders and environmental factors, both risk \n     and protective, that influence growth and development \n     processes. The study will incorporate behavioral, emotional, \n     educational, and contextual consequences to enable a complete \n     assessment of the physical, chemical, biological and \n     psychosocial environmental influences on children's well-\n     being.\n       The study shall include diverse populations, before birth, \n     to gather data on environmental influences and outcomes until \n     at least age 21, and shall consider health disparities.\n     Subtitle D--Research on Rare Diseases\n       This Provision would require the NIH Director to report to \n     Congress within 180 days of enactment regarding activities \n     conducted and supported by the NIH during Fiscal Year 2000 \n     with respect to rare diseases in children and the activities \n     that are planned to be conducted and supported by the NIH \n     with respect to such diseases during the Fiscal Years 2001 \n     through 2005.\n     Subtitle E--GME in Children's Hospitals\n       The health of the nation's children depends upon a steady \n     supply of well-trained pediatricians and pediatric \n     specialists. Independent children's hospitals train about \n     half of all pediatric specialists, and 30 percent of \n     pediatricians. Graduate medical education (GME) activities \n     have historically been supported by Medicare, but, because \n     these hospitals serve very few Medicare patients, they \n     receive very little financial support for this important and \n     costly activity. Children's hospitals are an important \n     resource for all children. The training, pediatric research, \n     and primary and specialty care services that occur in these \n     facilities should be preserved and strengthened. \n     Unfortunately, however, many of these hospitals are \n     struggling to maintain their missions. Last year, a new \n     program was authorized to provide discretionary support for \n     pediatric GME activities in free-standing children's \n     hospitals. This provision extends the authorization to 2005.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to join my \ncolleagues today in introducing the Children's Health Act of 2000. This \nbill authorizes a variety of programs and initiatives that promise to \nsignificantly improve the health of children in this nation. I want to \ncommend Senators Frist, Kennedy, Dodd, Gregg, DeWine, Reed, Bond, \nGorton, Abraham, and Durbin for their work and commitment to protecting \nand improving the health of our children.\n  This bill takes a multifaceted approach in addressing the most \npressing healthcare problems facing our children today, such as brain \ninjury, birth defects, asthma, and obesity. The bill authorizes \nprevention programs, educational programs, clinical research, and \ndirect clinical care services. It also enhances the training and \nknowledge base of pediatric healthcare researchers through training and \nloan repayment programs. In the face of so many dangerous diseases and \nconditions, the holistic approach taken by this bill offers the best \nhope for protecting and improving our children's health.\n  This bill provides funding for critical research on children's heath. \nThe Pediatric Research Initiative, based in the National Institutes of \nHealth, will lay the foundation for comprehensive, cross cutting \npediatric biomedical research. Such a center has the potential to yield \nvaluable new information on child growth and development.\n  The Child Development Study, a long term study of environmental \ninfluences on children's health, will also yield important insights \ninto the environmental factors that influence the growth and \ndevelopment of our children. This understanding will play a critical \nrole in shaping future policy and programs for children's health. This \nresearch, in addition to other research opportunities provided in this \nbill promises to significantly improve our ability to protect the \nhealth of our children.\n  In addition to research, this bill provides resources for care and \nprevention programs. For example, this bill authorizes aggressive \nprograms to prevent and treat one of the most challenging childhood \nhealth problems, traumatic brain injury. The Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention is directed to conduct research on prevention \nand to implement public education and information programs. The Health \nResearch and Services Administration is authorized to fund community \nsupport services to develop support or enhance care systems for \nindividuals with brain injuries. These programs, coupled with research \nat NIH, address both the causes and the consequences of traumatic brain \ninjury.\n  This bill authorizes the creation of a National Center for Birth \nDefects and Developmental Disabilities to collect, analyze, and \ndistribute data on birth defects. This provision will allow for \nimportant data to be developed to guide the development of programs and \npolicies to assist children and families coping with disabilities. \nHaving worked for many years to improve the quality of life of people \nliving with disabilities, I strongly support this effort to address the \nchallenges of disabilities at the earliest age possible. This center \nwill help to coordinate and focus our approach, and serve as a \nclearinghouse for information that will improve both healthcare and \nquality of life for children with disabilities.\n  By targeting asthma, the most common chronic disease of childhood, \nthis bill will make a difference in the lives of thousands of children \nand young people who suffer with this disease across the nation. Asthma \njumped by 75 percent in the general population between 1980 and 1994. \nAmong children under four there was a rise of 160 percent. It is \nestimated that this condition debilitates about 33,000 Vermonters \n(22,000 adults and 11,000 children). Grant programs authorized under \nthis bill will fund comprehensive asthma services, mobile health care \nclinics, and patient and family education to reduce the impact of this \ndangerous disease. As this disease continues to strike more and more of \nour youth, it is critical that programs to reduce asthma have priority.\n  Oral health is also improved under this legislation, which targets \nthe disparities in access to dental care and preventive therapies among \npoor children. In addition to direct care services, this provision \nenhances community based research and training to improve our knowledge \nof effective clinical and preventive measures. With 20 percent of \nchildren experiencing 80 percent of the dental cavities, it is time we \nfocus on this neglected population and make a difference in their \nhealth.\n  An investment in the health of the nation's children will undoubtedly \nhave long term rewards, as we move our understanding of and ability to \ntreat childhood diseases far beyond current capabilities. Clearly, the \ntime has come to comprehensively and aggressively tackle the primary \ncauses of poor health for our children. I strongly support this \nlegislation. The health of the nation rests on the health of our \nchildren, and we must do all we can to prevent and treat diseases that \nstrike at the most vulnerable members of society.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Frist \nand our other colleagues in introducing the Children's Public Health \nAct of 2000. This bipartisan legislation will help millions of children \nin the years ahead. It takes needed action to improve children's health \nby expanding pediatric research and calling for specific steps to deal \nwith a wide range of childhood illness, disorders, and injuries. \nCoordinated action in these areas can lead to significant benefits for \nall children.\n  Senator Frist and I have worked closely with many of our Democratic \nand Republican colleagues on this legislation. We have talked with \nexperts and advocates in the children's health community. We believe \nthis legislation will lead to significant progress in addressing some \nof today's most pressing pediatric public health problems.\n  The legislation includes a variety of new and reauthorized children's \nhealth provisions that are organized under four broad categories--\ninjury prevention, maternal and infant health promotion, public health \npromotion, and research.\n  Traumatic brain injury is the leading cause of death and disability \nin young Americans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has \nestimated that 5.3 million Americans are living with long-term, severe \ndisability as a result of brain injuries, and each year 50,000 people \ndie as a result of such injuries. The Children's Public Health Act \nrevises and extends the authorization for the important programs \nenacted in 1996 to deal with these injuries. This reauthorization will \nassure\n\n[[Page S6686]]\n\ncontinued progress toward our understanding, treating and preventing \nthem.\n  Improving and protecting the safety of child care environments should \nalso be a high priority for Congress. This legislation creates a new \nprogram to improve the safety of children in child care settings, and \nto encourage child care providers to take steps to prevent illness and \ninjuries and protect the health of the children they serve.\n  In addition, this legislation includes programs to improve the health \nof pregnant women and prenatal outcomes, including prevention of birth \ndefects and low birth weight. It establishes a new Center for Birth \nDefects and Developmental Disabilities at the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention in order to focus the nation's activities more \neffectively in these important areas. The new center will be especially \nhelpful for children and families affected by these conditions.\n  The bill also takes a number of steps to address other prevalent \nchildhood conditions. Asthma is the most common chronic childhood \nillness, affecting more than seven percent of all American children. \nThe death rate for children with asthma increased by 78 percent between \n1980 and 1993, and asthma-related costs total nearly $2 billion \nannually in direct health care for children. The nation is handicapped \nby a lack of basic information on where and how asthma strikes, what \ntriggers it, and how effectively our current health care system is \nresponding to those who suffer from this chronic disease. Our bill will \nprovide greater asthma services to children, including mobile clinics, \nand patent and family education, and it will help to reduce allergens \nin housing and public facilities.\n  Poor nutrition and lack of physical activity are also hurting many \nAmerican children and contributing to lifelong health problems. The \nnation spends $39 billion a year--equal to six percent of overall U.S. \nhealth care expenditures--on direct health care related to obesity. \nTwenty percent of American children--one in five--are overweight. \nUnhealthy eating habits and physical inactivity in childhood can lead \nto heart disease, cancer and other serious illnesses decades later. \nChildren and adolescents who suffer from eating disorders, such as \nanorexia nervosa and bulimia, can have wide-ranging physical and mental \nhealth impairments. Our legislation establishes new grant programs to \nreduce childhood obesity and earing disorders, promote better \nnutritional habits among children, and encourage an appropriate level \nof physical activity for children and adolescents.\n  Last May, the Surgeon General published a landmark report on oral \nhealth in America, emphasizing the need to consider oral health as an \nessential part of total health. There is no question that oral and \ndental health care should be included in our primary care. Tooth decay \nis the most common childhood infectious disease, and it can lead to \ndevastating consequences, including problems with eating, learning and \nspeech. Twenty-five percent of children in the United States suffer 80 \npercent of the tooth decay, with significant racial and age \ndisparities. The number of dentists in the country has been declining \nsince 1990, and is projected to continue to decline through the year \n2020.\n  According to a 1995 report by the Inspector General, only one in five \nMedicaid-eligible children receive dental services annually, and the \nshortage of dentists exacerbates the problem of unmet needs. Yet tooth \ndecay is largely preventable. More effective efforts to educate parents \nand children about the causes of tooth decay, and initiatives to \nprevent and treat it can lead to lasting public health improvements. \nOur legislation includes a variety of approaches to deal with this \nsilent epidemic.\n  Research has long shown that childhood lead poisoning can have \ndevastating effects on children, causing reduced IQ and attention span, \nstunted growth, behavior problems, and reading and learning \ndisabilities. Yet too children remain unscreened and untreated, and \nadequate services often are not available for children with elevated \nlevels of lead in their blood. There is no excuse for not taking \ngreater steps to eliminate childhood lead poisoning. Our bill includes \nscreening for early detection and treatment, professional education and \ntraining programs, and outreach and education activities for at-risk \nchildren.\n\n  Pediatic research discoveries promote and maintain health throughout \na child's life span, and also contribute significantly to new insights \nthat aid in the prevention and treatment of illnesses and conditions \namong adults. A growing body of evidence shows that risk factors for \nconditions such as coronary artery disease and stroke begin in \nchildhood and persist through adulthood. Congress has a strong history \nof promoting basis and clinical research, and the steps taken in this \nlegislation continue that priority.\n  The legislation establishes a pediatric research initiative, \nauthorized at $50 million annually, that will increase support for \npediatric biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health, \nincluding an increase in collaborative efforts among multidisciplinary \nfields in areas that are promising for children. The legislation also \nrequires coordination with the Food and Drug Administration to increase \nthe number of pediatric clinical trails, and to provide greater \ninformation on safer and more effective use of prescription drugs in \nchildren.\n  Children have unique health care needs. They are not simply small \nadults. Nothing is more important to the future health of America's \nchildren than maintaining a steady supply of pediatricians, pediatric \nspecialists and pediatric-focused scientists.\n  Our legislation takes two important steps to improve the growth and \ndevelopment of a pediatric-focused medical community. First, it \nenhances support by the National Institute for Child Health and Human \nDevelopment expressly for training and career development activities of \npediatric researchers, and it establishes a loan repayment program for \npediatricians who conduct research.\n  Second, it extends the authorization of a new program that supports \ngraduate medical education activities at independent children's \nhospitals. These hospitals train half of all pediatric specialists, and \n30 percent of all pediatricians. However, because GME activities have \nhistorically been supported by Medicare and because these hospitals \nserve very few Medicare patients, they receive very little financial \nsupport for this important and costly activity. As a result, children's \nhospitals are struggling to maintain the important training, pediatric \nresearch, and primary and specialty care services that they provide. \nChildren's hospitals should be treated like all other teaching \nhospitals when it comes to support for their GME activities. I have \nsponsored another legislative proposal to guarantee full funding each \nyear, without being subject to the appropriations process. That \nproposal is awaiting consideration in the Finance Committee. Until it \nis enacted, we owe it to America's children to invest in their future \nhealth care by improving our support for pediatric GME activities.\n  The bill also authorizes a new study to monitor and evaluate \ndevelopment of children through adulthood. The kind of information that \nwill be obtained by this study is long-overdue. Children are more \nvulnerable to physical, chemical, biological, and other risks than \nadults, and we must make a major commitment to learning more about the \ninfluences and effects of the environment.\n  Finally, this legislation also includes a program to address the \nunique needs of children with autism and related disorders. I look \nforward to working with Chairman Frist, members of the Committee and \nothers to assure that the needs of children with Fragile X are met in \nthe final legislation.\n  This legislation deserves to be a major public health priority for \nthe nation. Congress should send the President a strong bill on these \nissues before the end of this year.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today as a co-author of the \n``Children's Public Health Act of 2000.'' The sad fact is that far too \nmany children never realize success as adults or even reach adulthood \nbecause of debilitating or life-threatening disease. That is why we \nmust build a health care system that is responsive to the unique needs \nof children. The ``Children's Public Health Act of 2000'' is a big step \nin the right direction, and I commend my colleagues, Senators Frist, \nJeffords, and Kennedy for their efforts to construct a bill that can \nreally make a positive difference in the health and the lives of \nchildren.\n\n[[Page S6687]]\n\n  Mr. President, I am especially pleased that the ``Children's Public \nHealth Act'' contains several important initiatives that my colleagues \nand I had already introduced as separate bills. One such initiative--\nthe Pediatric Research Initiative--would help ensure that more of the \nincreased research funding at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) \nis invested specifically in children's health research.\n  While children represent close to 30 percent of the population of \nthis country, NIH devotes only about 12 percent of its budget to \nchildren, and, in recent years, that proportion has been declining even \nfurther. We must reverse this disturbing trend. It simply makes no \nsense to conduct health research for adults and hope that those \nfindings also will apply to children. A ``one-size-fits-all'' research \napproach just doesn't work. The fact is that children have medical \nconditions and health care needs that differ significantly from adults. \nChildren's health deserves more attention from the research community. \nThat's why the Pediatric Research Initiative is such an important part \nof the ``Children's Public Health Act.'' It would provide the federal \nsupport for pediatric research that is so vital to ensuring that \nchildren receive the appropriate and best health care possible.\n  The Pediatric Research Initiative would authorize $50 million \nannually for the next five years for the Office of the Director of NIH \nto conduct, coordinate, support, develop, and recognize pediatric \nresearch. By doing so, we will be able to ensure that researchers \ntarget and study child-specific diseases. With more than 20 Institutes \nand Centers and Offices within NIH that conduct, support, or develop \npediatric research in some way, this investment would promote greater \ncoordination and focus in children's health research and should \nencourage new initiatives and areas of research.\n  The ``Children's Public Health Act'' also would authorize funding \nthrough the National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development \n(NICHD)--for pediatric research training grants to support training for \nadditional pediatric research scientists and would provide funding for \nloan forgiveness programs. Trained researchers are essential if we are \nto make significant advances in the study of pediatric health care, \nespecially in light of the new and improved Food and Drug \nAdministration (FDA) policies that encourage the testing of medications \nfor use by children.\n  Additionally, the ``Children's Public Health Act'' includes the \n``Children's Asthma Relief Act,'' which Senator Durbin and I introduced \nlast year. The sad reality for children is that asthma is becoming a \nfar too common and chronic childhood illness. From 1979 to 1992, the \nhospitalization rates among children due to asthma increased 74 \npercent. Today, estimates show that more than seven percent of children \nnow suffer from asthma. Nationwide, the most substantial prevalence \nrate increase for asthma occurred among children aged four and younger. \nThose four and younger also were hospitalized at the highest rate among \nall individuals with asthma.\n  According to 1998 data from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), my \nhome state of Ohio ranks about 17th in the estimated prevalence rates \nfor asthma. Based on a 1994 CDC National Health Interview Survey, an \nestimated 197,226 children under 18 years of age in Ohio suffer from \nasthma. This is a serious health concern among children--and we must \naddress it.\n  The ``Children's Public Health Act'' would help ensure that children \nwith asthma receive the care they need to live healthy lives. The bill \nwould authorize $50 million annually for five years for the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services (HHS) to award grants to eligible entities \nto develop and expand projects that would provide asthma services to \nchildren. These grants also may be used to equip mobile health care \nclinics that provide asthma diagnosis and asthma-related health care \nservices; educate families on asthma management; and identify and \nenroll uninsured children who are eligible for, but are not receiving \nhealth coverage under Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram (SCHIP). The ability to identify and enroll children in these \nprograms will ensure that children with asthma receive the care they \nneed.\n  Since research shows that children living in urban areas suffer from \nasthma at such alarming rates and that allergens, such as cockroach \nwaste, contribute to the onset of asthma, this bill also adds urban \ncockroach management to the current preventive health services block \ngrant which currently can be used for rodent control.\n  To better coordinate federal activities related to asthma, the \nSecretary of HHS would be required to identify all federal programs \nthat carry out asthma research and develop a federal plan for \nresponding to asthma. To better monitor the prevalence of pediatric \nasthma and to determine which areas have the greatest incidences of \nchildren with asthma, this bill would require the CDC to conduct local \nasthma surveillance activities to collect data on the prevalence and \nseverity of asthma and to publish data annually on the prevalence rates \nof asthma among children and on the childhood mortality rate. This \nsurveillance data will help us better detect asthmatic conditions, so \nthat we can treat more children and ensure that we are targeting our \nresources in an effective and efficient way to reverse the disturbing \ntrend in the hospitalization and death rates of asthmatic children.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the bill we are introducing today includes \nlanguage that I strongly support to re-authorize funding for children's \nhospitals' Graduate Medical Education (GME) programs for four \nadditional years. Last year, as part of the ``Health Care Research and \nQuality Act,'' which was signed into law, we authorized funding for two \nyears for children's hospitals' GME programs. The teaching mission of \nthese hospitals is essential. Children's hospitals comprise less than \none percent of all hospitals, yet they train five percent of all \nphysicians, nearly 30 percent of all pediatricians, and almost 50 \npercent of all pediatric specialists. By providing our nation with \nhighly qualified pediatricians, children's hospitals can offer children \nthe best possible care and offer parents peace of mind. They serve as \nthe health care safety net for low-income children in their respective \ncommunities and are often the sole regional providers of many critical \npediatric services. These institutions also serve as centers of \nexcellence for very sick children across the nation. Federal funding \nfor GME in children's hospitals is a sound investment in children's \nhealth and provides stability for the future of the pediatric \nworkforce.\n  Mr. President, as the father of eight children and the grandfather of \nfive, I firmly believe that we must move forward to protect the \ninterests--and especially the health--of all children. The ``Children's \nPublic Health Act of 2000'' makes crucial investments in our country's \nfuture--investments that will yield great returns. If we focus on \nimproving health care for all children today, we will have a generation \nof healthy adults tomorrow.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this vital children's health care \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. \n        Daschle, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 2869. A bill to protect religious liberty, and for other purposes; \nread the first time.\n\n\n      religious land use and institutionalized persons act of 2000\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a narrowly \nfocused bill that protects religious liberty from unnecessary \ngovernmental interference. It will provide protection for houses of \nworship and other religious assemblies from restrictive land use \nregulation that often prevents the practice of faith. This legislation \nalso allows institutionalized persons to exercise their religion to the \nextent that it does not undermine the security, discipline, and order \nof their institutions.\n  Seven years ago, recognizing the need to strengthen the fundamental \nright of religious liberty, Congress overwhelmingly passed the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). Unfortunately, in 1997, in \nthe case of City of Boerne v. Flores, the Supreme Court held that \nCongress lacked the authority to enact RFRA as applied to state and \nlocal governments. In an attempt to respond to the Boerne decision, I \nintroduced S. 2081 earlier this year. Legislation similar to S. 2081 \npassed the\n\n[[Page S6688]]\n\nHouse of Representatives. Yet, concerns were raised by some regarding \nthe scope of S. 2081, and I undertook an effort to seek out a consensus \napproach. The legislation I am introducing today, which maintains \ncertain provisions of S. 2081, is a tailored version which represents \nthe product of our efforts.\n  The Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 \nprovides limited federal remedies for violations of religious liberty \nin: (1) the land use regulation of churches and synagogues; and (2) \nprisons and mental hospitals.\n\n\n                          land use regulation\n\n  At the core of religious freedom is the ability for assemblies to \ngather and worship together. Finding a location to do so, however, can \nbe quite difficult when faced with pervasive land use regulations. As \nwas seen during congressional hearings in both the House and Senate, \nland use regulations, either by design or neutral application, often \nprevent religious assemblies and institutions from obtaining access to \na place of worship. Under current law, an assembly whose religious \npractice is burdened by an otherwise ``generally applicable'' and \n``neutral'' law can obtain relief only by carrying the heavy burden of \nproving that there is an unconstitutional motivation behind a law, and \nthus, that it is not truly neutral or generally applicable. Such a \nstandard places a seemingly insurmountable barrier between the \nreligious assemblies of our country and their right to worship freely.\n  An example of this was seen recently when a city refused to allow the \nLDS Church to construct a temple simply because it was not in the \n``aesthetic'' interests of the community as set forth in a ``generally \napplicable'' statute. Another example includes an effort to suspend the \noperation of a religious mission for the homeless operated by the late \nMother Teresa's order because it was located on the second floor of a \nbuilding without an elevator.\n  The land use section of the bill prohibits discrimination against \nreligious assemblies and institutions, and prohibits the total \nexclusion of religious assemblies from a jurisdiction. The section also \nprohibits unreasonable limits on religious assemblies and institutions \nand requires that land use regulations that substantially burden the \nexercise of religion be justified by a compelling governmental \ninterest.\n  It is important to note that this legislation does not provide a \nreligious assembly with immunity from zoning regulation. If the \nreligious claimant cannot demonstrate that the regulation places a \nsubstantial burden on sincere religious exercise, then the claim fails \nwithout further consideration. If the claimant is successful in \ndemonstrating a substantial burden, the government will still prevail \nif it can show that the burden is an unavoidable result of its pursuit \nof a compelling governmental objective.\n\n\n                       institutionalized persons\n\n  Our bill also provides that substantial burdens on the religious \nexercise of institutionalized persons must be justified by a compelling \ninterest. Congressional witnesses have testified that institutionalized \npersons have been prevented from practicing their faith. For example, \nsome Jewish prisoners have been denied matzo, the unleavened bread Jews \nare required to consume during Passover, even though Jewish \norganizations have offered to provide it to inmates at no cost to the \ngovernment. While this legislation seeks to improve the ability of \ninstitutionalized persons to practice their religion, it remains under \nthe complete application of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\n  Both sections are based firmly on constitutional principles that \ngrant Congress its authority. Thus, today's legislation should \nwithstand the scrutiny that has thwarted our efforts in the past.\n  As we begin in this effort, it is worth pondering just why America \nis, worldwide, the most successful multi-faith country in all recorded \nhistory. The answer is to be found, I submit, in both components of the \nphase ``religious liberty.'' Surely, it is because of our \nConstitution's zealous protection of liberty that so many religions \nhave flourished and so many faiths have worshiped on our soil.\n  Our country has achieved its greatness because, with its respectful \ndistance from our private lives, our government has allowed all its \ncitizens their own forms of ``internal governance,'' that is, those \nreligious and moral tenets that make a free society possible. Our \ncountry has allowed people to answer for themselves, and without \ninterference, those questions that are most fundamental to humankind. \nAnd it is in the way that religion informs our answers to these \nquestions, that we not only survive, but thrive as human beings.\n  While this bill provides much needed preservation of our religious \nliberty, I personally would have preferred a broader approach. I \nrecognize, however, in this shortened legislative year, the long list \nof items before the congressional leadership that require their \nattention. In order to ensure enactment of a measure this year, I think \nall advocates of a broader approach took a prudent step in embracing a \nmore targeted, consensus bill.\n  With the help of Senator Kennedy, Congressman Canady, and others, I \nhope this legislation will move swiftly through the Congress. We look \nforward to welcoming others to our modest, yet important, effort to \nenact this legislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Religious freedom is a bedrock principle in our nation. \nThe bill we are introducing today reflects our commitment to protect \nreligious freedom and our belief that Congress still has the power to \nenact legislation to enhance that freedom, even after the Supreme \nCourt's decision in 1997 to strike down the broader Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act that 97 Senators joined in passing in 1993.\n  In striking down the Religious Freedom Restoration Act on \nconstitutional grounds, the Court clearly made the task of passing \neffective legislation to protect religious liberties more difficult. \nBut too often in our society today, thoughtless and insensitive actions \nby governments at every level interferes with individual religious \nfreedoms, even though no valid public purpose is served by the \ngovernmental action.\n  Our goal in proposing this legislation is to reach a reasonable and \nconstitutionally sound balance between respecting the compelling \ninterests of government and protecting the ability of people freely to \nexercise their religion. We believe that the legislation being \nintroduced today accomplishes this goal in two areas where infringement \nof this right has frequently occurred--the application of land use \nlaws, and treatment of persons who are institutionalized. In both of \nthese areas, our bill will protect the Constitutional right to worship, \nfree from unnecessary government interference.\n  After numerous Congressional hearings on religious liberties, the \nevidence is clear that local land use laws often have the \ndiscriminatory effect of burdening the free exercise of religion. It is \nalso clear that institutionalized persons are often unreasonably denied \nthe opportunity to practice their religion, even when their observance \nwould not undermine discipline, order, or safety in the facilities.\n  Relying upon the findings from Congressional hearings, we have \ndeveloped a bill--based upon well-established constitutional \nauthority--that will protect the free exercise of religion in these two \nimportant areas. Our bill has the support of the Free Exercise \nCoalition, which represents over 50 diverse and respected groups, \nincluding the Family Research Council, Christian Legal Society, \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, and People for the American Way. The \nbill also has the endorsement of the Leadership Conference for Civil \nRights.\n  The broad support that this bill enjoys among religious groups and \nthe civil rights community is the result of many months of difficult, \nbut important negotiations. We carefully considered ways to strengthen \nreligious liberties in other ways in the wake of the Supreme Court's \ndecision. We were mindful of not undermining existing laws intended to \nprotect other important civil rights and civil liberties. It would have \nbeen counterproductive if this effort to protect religious liberties \nled to confrontation and conflict between the civil rights community \nand the religious community, or to a further court decision striking \ndown the new law. We believe that our bill succeeds in avoiding these \ndifficulties by addressing the most obvious threats to\n\n[[Page S6689]]\n\nreligious liberty and by leaving open the question of what future \nCongressional action, if any, will be needed to protect religious \nfreedom in America.\n  The land use provision covers regulations defined as ``zoning and \nlandmarking'' laws. Under this provision, if a zoning or landmarking \nlaw substantially burdens a person's free exercise of religion, the \ngovernment involved must demonstrate that the particular law is the \nleast restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental \ninterest. This provision is based upon the constitutional authority of \nCongress under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment, as well as the Commerce \nand Spending powers of Congress. The institutionalized persons section \napplies the strict scrutiny standard to cases in which the free \nexercise rights of such persons are substantially burdened. This \nprovision is based upon Congress's constitutional authority under the \nSpending and Commerce powers.\n  Applying a strict scrutiny standard to prison regulations would not \nlead, as some have suggested, to a flood of frivolous lawsuits by \nprisoners, and it will not undermine safety, order, or discipline in \ncorrectional facilities. Arguments opposing this provision have been \nmade in the past, but they were based on speculation. Now, the \narguments can be proven demonstrably false by the facts.\n  Since the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was enacted in 1993, \nstrict scrutiny has been the applicable standard in religious liberties \ncase brought by inmates in federal prisons. Yet, according to the \nDepartment of Justice, among the 96 federally run facilities, housing \nover 140,000 inmates, less than 75 cases have ever been brought under \nthe Act--most of which have never gone to trial. On average, over seven \nyears, that's less than 1 case in each federal facility. It's hardly a \nflood of litigation or a reason to deny this protection to prisoners.\n  Following the enactment of the 1993 Act, Congress also passed the \nPrison Litigation Reform Act, which includes a number of procedural \nrules to limit frivolous prisoner litigation. Those procedural rules \nwill apply in cases brought under the bill we are introducing today. \nBased upon these protections and the data on prison litigation, it is \nclear that this provision in our bill will not lead to a flood of \nfrivolous lawsuits or threaten the safety, order, or discipline in \ncorrectional facilities. Sincere faith and worship can be an \nindispensable part of rehabilitation, and these protections should be \nan important part of that process.\n  In sum, our bill is an important step forward in protecting religious \nliberty in America. It reflects the Senate's long tradition of \nbipartisan support for the Constitution and the nation's fundamental \nfreedoms, and I urge the Senate to approve it.\n\n\n         examples of land use restrictions on religious liberty\n\n  In February 2000, a city official in Portland, Oregon ordered a local \nUnited Methodist Church to limit attendance at its services to 70 \nworshipers and shut down a meals program for the homeless and the \nworking poor that the church had been operating for sixteen years. The \nchurch can hold up to 500 persons. The land use official announced that \nher job was ``quasi-judicial,'' and that ``she was not required to \nexplain decisions.'' After a public outcry, the Portland City Council \nunanimously rejected the attendance cap and voted to allow church \nprograms to continue, contingent on an agreement being reached among \nneighbors, neighborhood businesses and the city about the management of \nthe church programs. (``Church ordered to limit attendance,'' \nWashington Times, February 18, 2000: ``Church wins on attendance,'' The \nOregonian, March 2, 2000).\n  Officials in Arapahoe County, Colorado imposed numerical limits on \nthe number of students who could enroll in religious schools and on the \nsize of congregations of various churches, as a way of limiting their \ngrowth. These limits directly conflicted with the mission of \nevangelical churches, whose fundamental goal is to attract new \nbelievers.\n  In Douglas County, Colorado, administrative officials proposed \nlimiting the operational hours of a church in much the same way as they \nlimit commercial facilities. As Mark Chopko noted in his Congressional \ntestimony, limiting a church's operational hours means that a church \nmay not lawfully engage in certain acts of service and devotion or \novernight spiritual retreats. (Testimony of Mark Chopko before the \nHouse Subcommittee on the Constitution, March 26, 1998).\n  Congregation Etz Chaim, an Orthodox Jewish congregation in Los \nAngeles, was meeting in a rented house, or ``shul'', in Hancock Park, a \nresidential zone. The rabbi of the congregation, Chaim Baruch Rubin, \ntestified that ten to fifteen men would typically visit the house for \ndaily meetings, and forty or fifty people (many elderly and disabled) \nwould attend on the Sabbath or holidays to engage in quiet prayer and \nstudy. Orthodox Jews must walk to services on the Sabbath and on most \nholidays, because their religion does not permit them to use mechanical \nmodes of transportation on those days. When neighbors complained about \nthe effect on property values, the congregation requested a special use \npermit from the City Council to remain in the residential zone. The \nCouncil unanimously rejected the request, putting the neighborhood \neffectively off-limits for Orthodox Jews. The same Council, however, \nallowed other places of assembly in Hancock Park, including schools, \nbook clubs, recreational uses and embassy parties. Rabbi Rubin \ntestified that 84,000 cars traveled through this part of the \nneighborhood daily, and yet somehow the Council deemed a prayer meeting \nof a few who traveled by foot as harmful to the neighborhood. Rabbi \nRubin concluded his testimony by stating, what do I tell my \ncongregants--what do I tell an 84 year old survivor of Auschwitz, a man \nwho used to risk his life in the concentration camp whenever possible \nto gather together to pray? (Testimony of Rabbi Chaim Baruch Rubin \nbefore the House Subcommittee on the Constitution, February 26, 1998).\n  In the process of creating a new zoning plan covering development in \nthe city, the City of Forest Hills, Tennessee set up an ``educational \nand religious zone'' called an ``ER'' for schools and churches, but \nlimited that designation to schools and churches that already existed \nwithin the city. No other land was zoned ``ER'' under the plan, so no \nother property was available for the construction of a new religious \nbuilding. The City also established strict requirements for changing \nany zone. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints determined a \nneed for a temple in Forest Hills, and sought a zone change for \nproperty that it owned within city limits. Forest Hills rejected the \nchurch's request. The church then bought another piece of property that \nhad previously been home to a church. Churches of other denominations \nwere nearby. Forest Hills nevertheless rejected the church's second \nrequest citing concern about traffic, and a court upheld this \ndetermination, effectively precluding Mormons from temple worship \nwithin city limits. (Testimony of Von G. Keetch before the House \nSubcommittee on the Constitution, March 26, 1998; Report of the House \nJudiciary Committee on the Religious Liberty Protection Act of 1999, \n106th Congress).\n  In 1997, the City of Richmond passed an ordinance which required \nplaces of worship wishing to feed more than thirty hungry and homeless \npeople to apply for a conditional use permit at a cost of $1,000, plus \n$100 dollars per acre of affected property. The ordinance regulated \nonly places of worship, not other institutions, and only eating by \npersons who are hungry and homeless. The ordinance also limited to \nseven days, and to the period between October 1 and April 1, the times \nwhen places of worship may feed the hungry and homeless. The City had \ncomplete discretion over the granting of conditional use permits based \non its assessment of a number of subjective factors. The Rev. Patrick \nWilson of Richmond, Virginia stated in his testimony: ``A $1,000 fee is \nbeyond the means of most churches, which operate with memberships of \nless than 100 persons and is therefore prohibitive. Imagine that--a \nstatutorily imposed fee for the exercise of a basic and fundamental \ntenet of the Christian faith! . . . Health and safety issues can be and \nare addressed in less\n\n[[Page S6690]]\n\nodious ways.'' (Testimony of Rev. Patrick J. Wilson III before the \nHouse Subcommittee on the Constitution, February 26, 1998; Preliminary \nand Jurisdictional Statement in Trinity Baptist Church v. City of \nRichmond, (E.D.Va. filed August 20, 1997.)\n  Twenty-two of the twenty-nine zoning codes in the northern suburbs of \nChicago effectively exclude churches, unless they have a special use \npermit. Zoning authorities hold almost wholly discretionary power over \nwhether a house of worship may locate in these areas. John Mauck, a \nChicago attorney who serves many churches in this area, handled the \ncase of a church, His Word Ministries to All Nations, interested in \nbuying property after it outgrew its space in the basement of a home. \nWhen it sought a special use permit in 1992, an alderman delayed the \nrequest three times, resulting in months of delay in the purchase of \nthe building. After the third postponement of the hearing, the alderman \nhad the church's property re-zoned as a manufacturing district. Because \nchurches cannot locate in a manufacturing district, the church was \nforced to withdraw its application for special use after paying filing, \nattorney and appraiser fees. The church spent approximately $5,000 and \nwasted an entire year seeking the special use permit. (Testimony of \nJohn Mauck before the House Subcommittee on the Constitution, March 26, \n1998; Affidavit of Virginia Kantor in Civil Liberties for Urban \nBelievers v. City of Chicago (N.D. Ill. 1994); Testimony of Douglas \nLaycock before the House Subcommittee on the Constitution, July 14, \n1998).\n  In his testimony, Marc Stern stated that orthodox synagogues are \noften required to have a specific number of parking spaces, based on \nthe number of seats in the sanctuary--even though the sanctuary will be \nfilled with worshipers who do not drive. (Testimony of Marc Stern \nbefore the House Subcommittee on the Constitution, March 26, 1998).\n  Chicago attorney John Mauck testified about several cases of racially \nmotivated opposition to black churches, and about a case in which the \nmayor told his city manager that they didn't want Hispanics in the \ntown. He also testified about other statements of bigotry. Marc Stern \ntestified about a case in which a small congregation sought permission \nto convert a private home into a small synagogue. One council member \nconsidering the converted use ``warned that if the application was \ngranted, this nearly all white suburb would begin to resemble an \nadjoining city which was largely minority and full of storefront \nchurches.''

ADDTIONAL BUDGET RESOURCES FOR A MEDICARE \n                   PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Beneficiaries under the medicare program under title \n     XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) are \n     the only group of insured Americans without prescription drug \n     coverage.\n       (2) At any point in time, approximately 13,000,000 medicare \n     beneficiaries are without prescription drug coverage.\n       (3) Over the course of a year, nearly 20,000,000 medicare \n     beneficiaries are without prescription drug coverage for all \n     or part of the year.\n       (4) The options available to medicare beneficiaries for \n     obtaining prescription drug coverage are declining since--\n       (A) the number of employers providing employer-sponsored \n     retiree coverage is declining at a dramatic rate;\n       (B) Medicare+Choice plans that might otherwise provide \n     prescription drug coverage are pulling out of counties \n     throughout the Nation; and\n       (C) medicare supplemental policies (medigap policies) that \n     offer prescription drug coverage are so prohibitively \n     expensive that only 8 percent of medicare beneficiaries have \n     the means to purchase such policies.\n       (5) An elderly individual without prescription drug \n     coverage living on $12,525 a year (150 percent of the Federal \n     poverty line), who has diabetes, hypertension, and high \n     cholesterol, pays more than 18.3 percent of their total \n     income on the prescription drugs most commonly prescribed to \n     treat their medical conditions.\n       (6) Medicare beneficiaries should never have to make the \n     choice between having a roof over their head, having food in \n     their mouth, or having necessary prescription drugs.\n       (7) Congress must provide medicare beneficiaries with a \n     meaningful medicare prescription drug benefit that--\n       (A) is universal and affordable;\n       (B) guarantees stable coverage for medicare beneficiaries \n     receiving benefits through the original fee-for-service \n     program or through enrollment in a Medicare+Choice plan; and\n       (C) provides real low-income and stop-loss protections.\n       (8) Meaningful prescription drug coverage includes stop-\n     loss protection above $4,000 of out-of-pocket expenses for \n     prescription drugs.\n       (9) In March 2000, the Congressional Budget Office \n     estimated the on-budget surplus for the 5-year period of \n     fiscal year 2001 through fiscal year 2005 to be \n     $148,000,000,000, assuming that discretionary spending was \n     allowed to increase with inflation.\n       (10) Relying on the March 2000 estimate of the \n     Congressional Budget Office, on April 12, 2000, Congress \n     passed the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \n     year 2001 which allocated $40,000,000,000 of the estimated \n     on-budget surplus for the 5-year period described in \n     paragraph (9) to provide a prescription drug benefit for \n     medicare beneficiaries.\n       (11) Forty billion dollars over 5 years cannot ensure \n     access to a meaningful medicare prescription drug benefit \n     that--\n       (A) is universal and affordable;\n       (B) guarantees stable coverage for medicare beneficiaries \n     receiving benefits through the original fee-for-service \n     program or through enrollment in a Medicare+Choice plan; and\n       (C) provides real low-income and stop-loss protections.\n       (12) Congress should not be bound to an arbitrarily low and \n     inadequate allocation for providing a medicare prescription \n     drug benefit when the estimated on-budget surplus for the 5-\n     year period described in paragraph (9) has increased \n     dramatically since March 2000.\n       (13) The Office of Management and Budget recently has \n     revised its estimates for the on-budget surplus for the 5-\n     year period described in paragraph (9) and now estimates that \n     the on-budget surplus will be $360,000,000,000 for such \n     period.\n       (14) The Congressional Budget Office will issue its revised \n     budget estimates in the next few days and those estimates are \n     widely expected to reflect a significant increase in the on-\n     budget surplus for the 5-year period described in paragraph \n     (9) as compared to the on-budget surplus that was estimated \n     for such period in March 2000.\n       (b) 2001 Budget Resolution Amendment.--Section 213(b) of H. \n     Con. Res. 290 (106th Congress) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(b) Adjustments.--The chairman of the Committee on the \n     Budget of the House or Senate, as applicable--\n       ``(1) shall revise committee allocations and other \n     appropriate budgetary levels and limits to accommodate \n     legislation described in section 215(a) which improves access \n     to prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries in an \n     additional amount not to exceed $40,000,000,000 or the \n     difference between the on-budget surpluses in the reports \n     referred to in subsection (a), whichever is less; and\n       ``(2) may, after the adjustment in paragraph (1), make the \n     following adjustments in an amount not to exceed the \n     difference between the on-budget surpluses in the reports \n     referred to in subsection (a) minus the adjustment made \n     pursuant to paragraph (1):\n       ``(A) Reduce the on-budget revenue aggregate by that amount \n     for such fiscal year.\n       ``(B) Adjust the instruction in section 103 or 104 to--\n       ``(i) increase the reduction in revenues by that amount for \n     fiscal year 2001;\n       ``(ii) increase the reduction in revenues by the sum of the \n     amounts for the period of fiscal years 2001 through 2005; and\n       ``(iii) in the House only, increase the amount of debt \n     reduction by that amount for fiscal year 2001.\n       ``(C) Adjust such other levels in this resolution, as \n     appropriate and the Senate pay-as-you-go scorecard.''.\n       Strike all after the first word and insert:\n\n              1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n\n[[Page S6732]]\n\n       (1) One-third of all Americans have no assets available for \n     investment, and another 20 percent have only negligible \n     assets. The household savings rate of the United States lags \n     far behind other industrial nations, presenting a barrier to \n     national economic growth and preventing many Americans from \n     entering the economic mainstream by buying a house, obtaining \n     an adequate education, or starting a business.\n       (2) By building assets, Americans can improve their \n     economic independence and stability, stimulate the \n     development of human and other capital, and work toward a \n     viable and hopeful future for themselves and their children. \n     Thus, economic well-being does not come solely from income, \n     spending, and consumption, but also requires savings, \n     investment, and accumulation of assets.\n       (3) Traditional public assistance programs based on income \n     and consumption have rarely been successful in promoting and \n     supporting the transition to increased economic self-\n     sufficiency. Income-based social policies that meet \n     consumption needs (including food, child care, rent, \n     clothing, and health care) should be complemented by asset-\n     based policies that can provide the means to achieve long-\n     term independence and economic well-being.\n       (4) Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) can provide \n     working Americans with strong incentives to build assets, \n     basic financial management training, and access to secure and \n     relatively inexpensive banking services.\n       (5) There is reason to believe that Individual Development \n     Accounts would also foster greater participation in electric \n     fund transfers (EFT), generate financial returns, including \n     increased income, tax revenue, and decreased welfare cash \n     assistance, that will far exceed the cost of public \n     investment in the program.\n\n     SEC. 1002. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this title are to provide for the \n     establishment of individual development account programs that \n     will--\n       (1) provide individuals and families with limited means an \n     opportunity to accumulate assets and to enter the financial \n     mainstream;\n       (2) promote education, homeownership, and the development \n     of small businesses;\n       (3) stabilize families and build communities; and\n       (4) support continued United States economic expansion.\n\n     SEC. 1003.

Such salary is also just $1,924 more than the \n     average salary recorded in 1972, a real increase of only $75 \n     per year.\n       (4) While K-12 enrollments are steadily increasing, the \n     teacher population is aging.

Shortages, \n     if they occur, will most likely be felt in urban or rural \n     regions of the country where working conditions may be \n     difficult or compensation low.\n       (6) If students are to receive a high quality education and \n     remain competitive in the global market the United States \n     must attract talented and motivated people to the teaching \n     profession in large numbers.\n       (b) Allowance of Credit.--Subpart C of part IV of \n     subchapter A of chapter 1 (relating to refundable credits) is \n     amended by redesignating section 35 as section 36 and by \n     inserting after section 34 the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 35.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 335 submitted earlier \nby Senator Helms for himself and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 335) congratulating the people of \n     Mexico on the occasion of the democratic elections in that \n     country.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, unanimity is a rare event in the Senate \nthese days but I suspect that there may be unanimous approval of a \nresolution I am proposing commending and congratulating the people of \nMexico for their July 2 democratic elections, which shocked the experts \nwho had predicted that the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party \n(PRI) could not be defeated and driven from power. An articulate and \nsteadfast candidate named Vicente Fox Quesada thought differently--and \nhe was right.\n  With the support of millions of Mexicans across the political \nspectrum, Governor Fox won 42.5 percent of the votes cast--six points \nahead of the PRI candidate, Francisco Labistida. And since the third-\nplace candidate received nearly 17 percent of the vote, that meant that \n60 percent of the 37.6 million Mexicans who voted wanted to put an end \nto the PRI's stranglehold.\n  Thus the conventional wisdom that regarded the PRI political machine \nas being invincible avoided two facts: (1) the legendary PRI political \nmachine had never been in a fair fight; and (2) the Mexican people have \nbeen striving for decades to put an end to the one-party rule that has \nwrought corruption, poverty, and insecurity.\n  Mexico's president-elect, Vicente Fox, has pledged to root out the \ngrinding corruption that has locked 40 percent of the Mexican \npopulation into poverty and the others into insecurity. Mr. Fox has an \nagenda of free-market policies with a commitment that no Mexican will \nbe excluded from economic opportunity and development.\n  Furthermroe, president-elect Fox has a sensible plan to reform the \nMexican Government to make it accountable to the people. And, he has \nvowed to work with the United States and other countries to fight the \ndeadly gangsters who traffic in illegal drugs in Mexico with virtual \nimpunity.\n  So, this ambitious reform agenda is good news for the American people \nas well as Mexicans. For the first time, we will have a full partner in \na truly legitimate and sovereign Mexican Government--one willing to \nwork with us to make the most of shared opportunities and to confront \ncommon challenges.\n  Outgoing President Ernesto Zedillo's election-night address, in which \nhe recognized the victory of Vicente Fox and pledged to work for a \nsmooth and orderly transition, seals his place in Mexican history. From \nhis earliest days in office, President Zedillo had declared his intent \nto break the cycle of election thievery that had marked 70 years of PRI \nrule, and the gentleman kept his word.\n  A special tribute is due the men and women of the Federal Electoral \nInstitute who systematically ensured that Mexicans would get the free \nand honest elections they demanded. The IFE lived up to its mandate and \nhas shown itself to be one of the premier electoral bodies in the \nworld.\n  My resolution congratulates the Mexican people, President-elect Fox, \nand President Ernesto Zedillo. It is a new day in Mexico and for \nrelations between our two great nations.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator \nHelm's resolution that commends Mexico on the results of their \nelections. There is no doubt that this was an event of historic \nproportions. The Mexican people have, through careful consideration and \na peaceful political process, ended over seven decades of rule by a \nsingle political party. By doing so they have turned their country into \na true democracy. They deserve this recognition.\n  My colleague's resolution captures the significance of this vote to \nthe United States in terms of our national interest and our social \nwelfare. As my state sits right across the border from Mexico, New \nMexicans are well aware that the destinies of our two countries have \nbeen, and will be, intertwined. We have always shared similarities in \nheritage and language with the Mexican people, and this has established \nthe means by which cultural and economic interaction can increase \nrapidly and consistently over time.\n  It is clear that the new President of Mexico, Vincente Fox, faces a \nbroad range of tough challenges as he assumes office and plots a course \nfor the future. Expectations are high and the obstacles are great. \nPrivatization, corruption, education, economic growth, narcotics, crime \nand health--all these issues require immediate attention. It is \nencouraging to see President Ernesto Zedillo already working in tandem \nwith the new government to ensure a successful transition. This will \ninevitably benefit the Mexican people.\n  I concur with the goals of the resolution, specifically the pledge \nfor increased cooperation with the Government of Mexico so that we \nmight confront the threats that our countries face and improve the \nquality of life for our people. I wish President-elect Fox luck in his \nefforts, and I look forward to working with him in the future.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and any statements relating to the resolution be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 335) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 335\n\n       Whereas the United States and Mexico share a border of more \n     than 2,000 miles;\n       Whereas Mexico is the second largest trade partner of the \n     United States, with a two-way trade of $174,000,000,000;\n       Whereas United States companies have invested more than \n     $25,000,000,000 in Mexico from 1994-1999;\n       Whereas more than 20,000,000 people now in the United \n     States are of Mexican descent, a fact that in and of itself \n     forges profound and permanent cultural ties between our 2 \n     countries;\n       Whereas the well-being and security of the United States \n     and Mexico require governments willing and able to cooperate \n     fully to\n\n[[Page S6763]]\n\n     confront common threats, including organized crime, \n     corruption, and trafficking in illicit narcotics;\n       Whereas the people of Mexico have struggled for decades for \n     a true representative democracy, accountability, and the rule \n     of law and, in recent years, they have sought and obtained \n     significant political and electoral reforms in pursuit of \n     those objectives;\n       Whereas the Federal Electoral Institute and its regional \n     councils, now genuinely independent and representative \n     bodies, were responsible for organizing the federal elections \n     on July 2, 2000, in which nearly 1,000,000 citizens \n     participated directly in conducting the balloting for a new \n     president, a new national congress, and state or local \n     officials in Mexico City as well as 10 states;\n       Whereas the July 2nd elections were observed by \n     approximately 2,500,000 domestic monitors and 850 foreign \n     visitors, including delegations of the United States-based \n     International Republican Institute for International Affairs \n     and the National Democratic Institute;\n       Whereas in the July 2nd elections, Vicente Fox Quesada of \n     the Alliance for Change (consisting of the National Action \n     Party and the Mexican Green Party) was elected President of \n     the United Mexican States, receiving 42.5 percent of the \n     37,600,000 votes cast, according to preliminary results \n     released by the Federal Electoral Institute; and\n       Whereas, according to the Federal Electoral Institute and \n     domestic and international observers, the July 2nd elections \n     were unprecedented in their degree of fairness and \n     transparency, forming the foundation for a genuinely \n     democratic and pluralistic government that represents the \n     will and sovereignty of the people of Mexico: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. CONGRATULATING THE PEOPLE OF MEXICO ON THE \n                   OCCASION OF THE DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS HELD IN \n                   MEXICO.\n\n       (a) Congratulating the People of Mexico.--The Senate, on \n     behalf of the people of the United States, hereby--\n       (1) congratulates the people of Mexico for their long, \n     courageous, and fruitful struggle for representative \n     democracy and the rule of law;\n       (2) congratulates Vicente Fox Quesada for his electoral \n     triumph and extends to him genuine best wishes for great \n     success in his formation of a new government; and\n       (3) congratulates Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, current \n     President of the United Mexican States, for his historic \n     commitment to ensure the peaceful and stable transition of \n     power.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the United States should seek to--\n       (1) expand and intensify its cooperation with the newly \n     elected Government of Mexico to promote economic development \n     and to reduce poverty to achieve an improved quality of life \n     for citizens of both countries;\n       (2) confront common threats such as the trafficking in \n     illicit narcotics; and\n       (3) act in solidarity to actively promote representative \n     democracy and the rule of law throughout the world.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 578, H.R. 3591.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3591) to provide for the award of a gold medal \n     on behalf of the Congress to former President Ronald Reagan \n     and his wife Nancy Reagan in recognition of their service to \n     the Nation.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, tonight, we pass and clear for the \nPresident's signature a fitting tribute for a pair of American heroes, \nthe Congressional Gold Medal. I am privileged and deeply honored to \nhave been joined and supported by so many of my colleagues and others \nin this effort.\n  In his first inaugural address, President Reagan encouraged a nation \nby stating, ``Let us begin an era of national renewal. Let us renew our \ndetermination, our courage, and our strength. And let us renew our \nfaith and our hope.''\n  Former President Ronald Reagan spoke these words almost two decades \nago at his first inauguration ceremony, inspiring a generation. During \nhis 8 years as President of the United States, Ronald Reagan \nsuccessfully reshaped America's hope and sparked a national renewal, \nmarked by unprecedented global peace, economic growth, military \nsuperiority, and the spread of freedom and liberty.\n  Serving as the leader of the world's greatest superpower, President \nReagan preferred to see himself as a simple citizen who had been called \nupon to aid the Nation he so loved. He believed fervently in the \nAmerican dream and wanted the American people to realize it fully.\n  Through every historic fight and landmark decision, the ever-gracious \nFirst Lady, Nancy, was by President Reagan's side. A distinguished \nleader in her own right, she traveled tirelessly throughout the country \npromoting her famous ``Just Say No'' campaign. The project is aimed at \npreventing alcohol and drug use among our youth.\n  In his tenure, President Reagan restored America's sense of pride and \nset us squarely on the course of prosperity we still enjoy today. He \nfacilitated the collapse of the Soviet Union that brought an end to the \ncold war. Who could forget his ringing challenge from Berlin's \nBradenburg Gate, ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this Wall!'' By 1989, to \nthe amazement of the world, Germany was unified, and the Wall was a \nmemory. Reagan's character, wit, and eloquence as the ``Great \nCommunicator'' brought honor to the Office of the President and \nendeared him to all Americans and, indeed, all the world.\n  Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher once commented, ``Not \nsince Lincoln, or Winston Churchill in Britain, has there been a \nPresident who has so understood the power of words to uplift and \ninspire.'' Mr. President, I couldn't agree more.\n  His one-time rival for superpower dominance, Mikhail Gorbachev, \ndescribed honoring the Reagans with the Congressional Gold Medal as ``. \n. . a fitting tribute to the fortieth President of the United States, \nwho will go down in history as a man profoundly dedicated to his people \nand committed to the values of democracy and freedom.''\n  Together, the Reagans selflessly dedicated their lives to promoting \nnational pride and bettering the quality of life in America. Together, \nthey continue their battle with Alzheimer's disease, displaying the \ndignity for which they are famous. Mrs. Reagan remains committed to \ncommunity service. In his honor, she has become a national advocate for \nheightening Alzheimer's disease awareness. Their fight inspires hope in \nmillions of Americans who share their struggle.\n  The leadership and dedication that President and Mrs. Reagan provided \nthis Nation undeniably abides with us still. It is fitting for a \ngrateful people and Nation to say, ``Thank you.''\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nconsidered read the third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to ask unanimous consent, \nin a moment, to modify my amendment, the Feingold amendment to the \nestate tax bill. When I make this request, the purpose is to address a \nconcern the Senator from Oklahoma raised about unintended implications \nof the amendment. The amendment was supposed to be a simple amendment \nhaving to do with limiting the estate tax exemption of $100 million.\n  He has raised a legitimate point with regard to an unintended \nconsequence. In the spirit of trying to get to the core of the matter, \nI ask I be able to modify my amendment. My intent was not to impose an \nadditional capital gains tax on estates of greater than $100 million. \nMy intent was to keep the current law rule that permits a step-up in \nbasis.\n  I hope the Senator from Oklahoma in good faith will understand that \nthat was our purpose and that the amendment could be offered in that \nspirit.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, notwithstanding the fact that \nthis is not the pending business, that I be allowed to modify my \namendment and to send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I object.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/13/senate-section/article/S6764-4", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6764-S6765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
