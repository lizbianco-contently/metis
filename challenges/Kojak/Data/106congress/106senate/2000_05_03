Mr. President, let me thank the leadership of both \nparties for allowing the Senate to talk to a very dear friend, Mike \nEpstein. I want you to know, Mike, and your family, that a lot of our \nstaff are back here as well with me. I think this is a little unusual, \nthat the Senate stops its business and focuses on an individual in this \nway. But I think there are some things that many of us want to say to \nMike.\n  I want to start out this way. When I mentioned in the past couple of \ndays to Senators, but also support staff everywhere here, that my \nfriend Mike was struggling with cancer, I just could never have \nanticipated the reaction. Mike, I want you to know I can think of at \nleast four or five times where someone said to me: Mike? He's an \ninstitution.\n  I know Mike's priorities, so let me be clear about the people who \ntalk about Mike as an institution. And, Mike, I know you; this was \nreal. This was real.\n  Some of the people who said Mike is an institution were support \nstaff. People said to me: Mike just treats everybody so well. He is \nsuch a nice, good person. He is great, just because of the way he \ntreats people.\n  Mike, that is the best compliment of all.\n  Then Senators said to me: Paul, Mike Epstein is an institution in the \nSenate. Some may have been thinking about history. Some in the Senate--\nI\n\n[[Page S3276]]\n\ndo not think that many because we have had a lot of new Senators--know \nof Mike's role with the Church committee and the important \ninvestigative research he has done.\n  There are others who are familiar, Mike, with the kind of work you \nhave done with Senator Kennedy. Mike did some of the most important \ninvestigative research on HIV infection and AIDS early on when other \npeople in the country did not even want to focus on this.\n  Then other Senators said to me: Paul, we are going to come to the \nfloor and talk to Mike today because we have worked with him on the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee when he was chief counsel to the \ncommittee.\n  Then way down on the list of priorities--because I am talking to you, \nMike, about great work that you do--has been the work that Mike and I \nhave done together. Mike, I know you will not like me saying this, but \nI am going to say it anyway because it is true. I believe from the \nbottom of my heart that everything I have been able to do as a Senator \nthat has been good for Minnesota and the country is because, Mike, you \nhave been there right by my side, 1 inch away from me.\n  A lot of the people in the Senate know that. As a matter of fact, I \nsay to my colleagues on the floor, I will never forget one time when I \nfinally learned at least a little bit of the rules and I was able to \ncome to the floor and fight very hard a number of years ago for some \nassistance for victims of a tornado that hit Chandler, MN, and other \nsmall communities. Mike was there as my tutor, as my teacher, teaching \nme, as you do, Mike.\n  It worked out well, but afterwards, Alan Simpson, a former Senator \nfrom Wyoming, came up to me and said: Paul?\n  I said: Yes?\n  He said: You see those fellows on the other side of the aisle?--\npointing to the Republicans, and I think Nancy Kassebaum was there as \nwell.\n  I said: Yes.\n  He said: They have been looking at you.\n  I said: Yes.\n  Mike was a ways behind me about where Tinker is sitting right now.\n  He said: He has been right next to you the whole time. It doesn't \nlook good. It looks like you can't do it yourself. It looks like he is \ndoing it for you. Paul, the trick is this: You want to have Mike far \nenough away from you so that it looks like you are doing it yourself \nbut close enough to you in case they throw a whizzer on you, he can be \n1 inch away from your side.\n  That has basically been my methodology as a Senator. I had Mike far \nenough away so it looked like I was doing it on my own, but Mike was \nclose enough so that always when I needed the advice, I got it.\n  Mike Epstein, I speak on the floor today in the Senate, and others \nare coming out to speak, because you are an institution and I want to \nmake sure you and your family hear these words loudly and clearly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when I learned Mike was sick, I thought I \nshould come down and say a few words. I thought: What can I say? I do \nnot want to say anything that will not be appropriate. I went to my \nperson who does my floor work in the Senate, Peter Arapis. I said: Tell \nme about Mike Epstein. What do you know about Mike Epstein?\n  He said--and I made some notes--he always told us some jokes and he \nwas always funny, always had a smile, and he appears to be Senator \nWellstone's best friend. Those are the same things I felt about Mike \nEpstein.\n  The feelings about Mike are pretty well known in the Senate. He has a \ngreat sense of humor. He always had that sly grin on his face when he \nwas in the Senate, which I appreciated a lot.\n  Mike, I always appreciated your being so courteous to me. I had a lot \nof dealings with you because as we proceed in the Senate--and I say \nthis through Senator Wellstone to Mike--it seems one of my \nresponsibilities is to get the legislation moving. A lot of times \nSenator Wellstone threw a monkey wrench into legislation moving. Who \nwould I go to to find out what really was happening? I would go to the \nback row and talk to Mike and say: Mike, what is going on here? He \nwould have a grin on his face as he would tell me what was going on. He \nwas always the person I would go to to break through the Wellstone \nlogjam that was created.\n  I was looking this morning for something to describe you, Mike. I \nfound a quote by James Barrie that is pretty good. I believe it really \nsizes up what you appear to be to me. Barrie said, ``Always be a little \nkinder than necessary.''\n  Certainly with Mike Epstein, that is the case. Mike was always a \nlittle kinder than necessary to me. Always kind. A lot of times I \nthought to myself: Wow, that is really a nice person. I guess I thought \nmaybe he was a little kinder to me than was necessary.\n  I never looked at Mike's resume. My staff gave me a little background \nresume of Mike today. Here is a man who graduated from Brown \nUniversity. Brown is an Ivy League school. It is a wonderful school; \nsome say the best school in America. It is very hard to get in. It is a \nsmall school, and they only take the best people whom they think can \nacademically be a success.\n  Then, of course, he went to Boston University Law School, which is \none of the top law schools in the country.\n  He had a resume. He could have gone anyplace in the world to work in \nthe legal field. He could have gone anyplace in the legal field in \nAmerica to work. He decided very early on that he wanted a life in \npublic service, and that is what he did. As soon as he got out of law \nschool, he served in the Justice Department as staff counsel, \nprosecuting attorney, special assistant to the Attorney General, and \nworked in the Criminal Division.\n  In 1970 or 1971, Mike moved to Capitol Hill where he spent the rest \nof his career. What a career it was. I repeat, at any juncture of \nMike's career, he could have gone anyplace in Washington to make the \nbig bucks as a lobbyist, as an attorney in one of the big law firms, \nbut he decided not to do that.\n  He decided to be a counsel to the special commission to investigate \nintelligence activities--Senate counsel on the Intelligence Committee. \nHe was counsel to one of the Senate Democratic leaders. He was chief \ncounsel to the Foreign Relations Committee. And he, of course, for the \nlast 10 years or so has been the legislative director for Senator \nWellstone.\n  At any juncture of his career, including any time he worked for \nSenator Wellstone, he could have gone anyplace in town to make a lot of \nmoney. He has a great academic background, and of course his experience \nis tremendous.\n\n  So I feel very moved to say nice things about Mike Epstein, things I \nwish I had said earlier.\n  So, Mike, I certainly wish you the best. I know your health isn't as \ngood as we would like it. But I certainly hope you have some peace and \nrest in the next little bit and that you recognize how much we would \nlike to see you in this back row, helping Senator Wellstone--kind of \nthe ``Mini-Me'' of the Wellstone operation.\n  I think it is also important that Jonathan and Bob--your two \nchildren--recognize the great contributions you have made to Government \nin America. Things are better because of you. Certainly, I know the \nmany contributions Senator Wellstone has made during his career have \nbeen directly related to your expertise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am not sure what the time allocation \nis, but I will use my leader time to make a few remarks, if I may.\n  Mr. President, every day--until very recently--if you looked toward \nthe west entrance to the Senate floor, as my colleague from Nevada has \njust noted, chances are, you would see Mike Epstein--with that \nwonderful, warm smile--Senator Wellstone's learned and much-loved \nlegislative director.\n  Today, however, as so many of my colleagues have already noted, Mike \nis not with us. He is at home resting, because he is very, very sick. \nHis absence from this floor, from this Senate he loves so well, is \nconspicuous. It is being felt in the hearts of every member of the \nSenate community. Indeed, it is being felt in the very heart of this \ninstitution itself.\n  For Mike Epstein is actually an institution within an institution.\n\n[[Page S3277]]\n\n  He is a Senate staffer of the old school. He came to the Senate in \n1971--before virtually every member of the Senate staff, and before all \nbut seven sitting Senators.\n  That is not the kind of thing Mike would ever tell you. As a staffer \nof the old school, he isn't given to boasting or self-promotion. Then \nagain, he doesn't have to: his experience and his ability speak for \nthemselves.\n  During Mike's tenure here, he has served on the staffs, as I am sure \nmy colleagues have already noted, of some of our most distinguished \nSenators to serve in my lifetime, including Senator Robert C. Byrd, \nSenator Ted Kennedy, Senator Paul Sarbanes, and now--for the last 9 \nyears--our dear, dear Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Paul Wellstone.\n  He also served as a member of the staffs of the Committees on Foreign \nRelations, Ethics, Labor and Human Resources, and Judiciary.\n  He first came to Washington in 1962 as a young attorney working at \nthe Department of Justice for Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy.\n  Along the way he picked up a library full of knowledge, and a mind \nfull of wisdom.\n  He became--at the elbow of the master, Senator Robert C. Byrd--an \nexpert in Senate history, rules, and parliamentary procedure.\n  He also became a friend, teacher, and mentor to generations of Senate \nstaff.\n  And he became a valued and trusted counselor to the Senators for whom \nhe worked, and for many others--this Senator included.\n  What a career. What a remarkable achievement. But then again, what a \nremarkable man.\n  What is perhaps most remarkable about Mike is his passion.\n  Even though all those years of public service tends to wear someone \ndown, Mike is still fiercely, proudly committed to the ideals of a \nprogressive agenda, much like his boss, Senator Wellstone.\n  But ``boss'' is the wrong term to use in describing the relationship \nbetween Mike and Paul. They are more like family. In fact, Mike says \nPaul is like a brother to him. I know Paul feels exactly the same way \nabout Mike.\n  Before joining Paul's staff in 1991, Mike told a friend that his \ndream job would be to work as Senator Paul Wellstone's legislative \ndirector. That dream came true for Mike, and he and Paul have been \ninseparable ever since.\n  So, Mr. President, on behalf of the Democratic Conference, the \nDemocratic staff, and frankly, the entire Democratic Party, not to \nmention our Senate community, I thank my friend, Paul Wellstone for \nbeing here today and for telling this Senate how much Mike Epstein \nmeans to this institution and to all of us.\n  Most of all, I want to express our heartfelt gratitude to our \ngallant, courageous colleague, Mike Epstein, for his friendship--and \nfor his inspired service to the Senate and to the Nation.\n  Mike, we are keeping you and your family very much in our thoughts \nand in our prayers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday Senator Wellstone told our \ncaucus of the health challenges Mike Epstein has been facing. I am \nsomeone who knows Mike. Am I his closest friend? No. But Senator \nWellstone had his office next to mine in the Hart Building. Every day--\nduring votes, and coming and going in the Senate--I would see Mike \nEpstein and see my colleague, Senator Wellstone, moving back and forth. \nI watched, with some wonder, at the work he did for Senator Wellstone.\n  I know he is now facing a health challenge that is difficult. I know \nthere are times in this fast-paced world of ours--especially here in \nthe Senate, with the travel and the hearings and the moving about \nquickly--that it is easy to forget what makes this work and what has \nreal value in our lives.\n  This is a moment, as Mike faces this challenge, to say to Mike: Our \nthoughts and prayers are with you today as you face this serious health \nchallenge. But we also want, as we think of you, to say thanks for what \nyou have done here. The people who serve here, especially my colleague, \nSenator Wellstone, know how important personal relationships are.\n  The only thing we really have, as we try to deal with public policy, \nis our work. Personal relationships are everything. But it is not just \npersonal relationships between Senators; it is also the relationships \nthat exist around here between Senators and some talented, dedicated \npeople who help make this institution work. One of those is Mike \nEpstein.\n  Each of us aspired to serve our country in different ways. That is \nwhat persuaded us in the Senate to seek public office. It is what \ninspires some of the most talented, dedicated men and women in our \ncountry to want to come and serve and work in these Senate offices.\n  Mike Epstein has worked with Senator Wellstone for many years. I know \nSenator Reid just talked about at the end of considering pieces of \nlegislation. I say to Senator Wellstone, at the end of the \nconsideration of pieces of legislation that are long, torturous trials, \ntrying to get all the amendments in, Senator Reid and I have always \ntried to figure out, how do we get these amendments compressed? In \nalmost every case, at the end of the process, it has been Senator \nWellstone who has had three or four amendments.\n  The reason: I know Mike Epstein would be sitting behind Senator \nWellstone, and Senator Wellstone would be exhibiting this passion, \nsaying: No, we have to do these. This is important. It has been because \nhe shares Mike's commitment to give voice to the voiceless, and hope to \nthe hopeless, and to not let the big things obscure things that are \nimportant to average Americans and people who are struggling out there \nevery day.\n  That is the legacy of the service of someone such as Mike Epstein to \nthis Senate. As he struggles with this health challenge, I just wanted \nto comment, as a member of this caucus, and to say to Senator \nWellstone, and say directly to Mike Epstein, our thoughts and prayers \nare with you. This country is better because of your service in this \nSenate.\n  We wish you well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first of all, I thank my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Paul Wellstone, for having the foresight and the \nintelligence to have Mike Epstein on his staff for all the years he has \nbeen here in the Senate.\n  I say to you, Mike, you could not have picked a better person to work \nfor in the Senate. Paul is in the great tradition of those you have \nworked with before in the Senate.\n  I also want to thank you, Mike, for all of your work in the Senate \nover all these years. When I heard the other day that you were home \nbattling cancer, I said, it is impossible; I saw him right back here \njust the other day, in back of the balustrade over here. Many times I \nwould be sitting here when debate would be going on, and I would go \nover and say, ``Mike, tell me what is happening,'' or ``What is going \non here on the floor?'' or ``What is the amendment? What is our \nstrategy?''\n  Mike would fill me in. I thank you, Mike, for keeping me up to speed \nas to what was happening on the floor a lot of times. Mostly, I also \nwant to thank you, Mike, for all the times we rode back and forth on \nthe subway cars together. It seems around here that sometimes you just \nkind of meet certain people at certain times. It is unplanned and it \nsort of happens. I don't know why, but you and I, Mike, seemed to be on \nthe same schedule to ride the subway. I don't know what the subway ride \nis, a couple or 3 minutes. There was always time for me to get a 3-\nminute briefing from you, Mike, on what we were doing and what we were \nfighting for. It revolved around I think what I would like to say is \nthe liberal cause.\n  If there is one thing I would like to really thank both Mike Epstein \nand Paul Wellstone for, it is for fighting for the liberal cause. I \ncan't think of anyone who embodies more of what I believe is the real \nface of liberalism in this country than you, Mike. I think of what \nPresident Kennedy once said. I may get the words a little wrong because \nI am reaching into my memory bank now. But President Kennedy was\n\n[[Page S3278]]\n\nonce asked--I believe when he was running for President--about being a \n``liberal,'' whether he was a liberal or not. President Kennedy \nresponded by saying: Well, if by liberal you mean someone who is soft \non defense, someone who is not concerned about ethics and morals, \nsomeone who doesn't believe in responsibility and accountability--if \nthat is what you mean by liberal, that is not me. But if by liberal you \nmean someone who cares deeply about the health and the welfare and the \nhappiness of our people, and if by liberal you mean someone who fights \nfor the education of all of our kids, even the most disadvantaged, and \nif by liberal you mean someone who will fight for the elderly and their \nrights in our society, if that is what you mean by liberal, then I am \none, and I am proud to be one.\n\n  So, Mike, I think you embody exactly what President Kennedy was \ntalking about. In all the years I have known you, that has really been \nyour mantle. In all the strategies we had here in fighting for \nlegislation, I think you, Mike, really represented those who didn't \nhave a high paid lobbyist pushing for them, such as children in \npoverty, working parents who needed some help, and even my people \nliving in rural areas--a lot of times you helped them.\n  I just wanted to take this time to thank you, Mike, for always \nfighting for what I believe is in the best traditions of liberalism in \nthis country. It is the liberal attitude that I believe makes us more \ncompassionate and understanding toward one another, and you have \nembodied that during the entire time I have known you for all these \nyears.\n  Again, I thank you for that. You have been a great person, a \nremarkable person. For as long as I am here, I am always going to turn \nback to the balustrade and look for Mike Epstein to tell me what is \ngoing on and what our strategy is and to keep me focused on what really \nmatters around this place, and that is what we do to enhance the lives \nof people at the bottom of the ladder. That really is the mark of what \nwe are about and should be about as a Senate.\n  Mike, I thank you, and I thank Paul for getting us together this \nmorning to pay tribute to you. I know you are struggling right now, and \nI just want you to know that you are always in my thoughts and you are \nalways in my prayers. I can just tell you that all the things you have \nfought for and believed in so strongly in the Senate, believe me, we \nare going to keep on going with them. So take care of yourself and just \nknow that we are with you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join with my other colleagues, first of \nall, in thanking a very special friend and someone we admire and care \nso much about, our colleague, Paul Wellstone, as Tom Harkin has said, \nfor bringing us together. I thank him for persuading our leaders who \nhave responded positively that we take a few moments from the business \nof the Senate to give recognition to an individual who has given so \nmuch of his life to this institution and, really, to our country.\n  I am grateful to join with my colleagues in adding a word about this \nextraordinary individual because, in a very important way, his life has \nbeen the U.S. Senate. I was fortunate enough, along that pathway of \nhis, to have the opportunity to work with him, as several of my \ncolleagues did, those who are here now, such as Senator Sarbanes, and \nsome who are not with us, Phil Hart and Claiborne Pell, as well as \nSenator Byrd. So I welcome this chance to join with others in \nrecognizing Mike Epstein's extraordinary service.\n  Mike Epstein came to the Senate Judiciary Committee after 9 years at \nthe Department of Justice, where he served as a Federal prosecutor. He \nused those same skills that made him a top-notch prosecutor to \ninvestigate some of the most difficult issues before our country. If \nthere was a lead, he pursued it. If there was a fact to be found, he \nwould find it. He left no stone unturned. He served the committee well, \nand I am proud that he was a member of my staff.\n  It was during that period that Mike's love for this institution grew \nand matured. Though he left briefly in 1974, he couldn't stay away for \nvery long. Within months, he was back working for the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, and later for three additional committees, and \nthen for several of my colleagues.\n  It is a mark of the man that Mike worked for so many different \ncommittees and Senators. His career in the Senate reflects an \nextraordinary breadth of interests and a genuine love for this \ninstitution. He is well-versed on issues ranging from international \naffairs to education; from health care to drug treatment and \nprevention. In fact, the country owes Mike a debt of gratitude for his \ntireless work on the 1988 drug policy legislation. He was an articulate \nadvocate for a more balanced and comprehensive approach to drug policy.\n  Because of his landmark work, the country began to enhance its \nenforcement efforts by also considering the importance of drug \nprevention and treatment, as well as a fairer approach to sentencing.\n  Mike's work on each of these issues was guided by a love for national \npolicy and also for the Senate and its procedures. He understands so \nwell the relationship between the rules and the outcome of a \nlegislative debate, which is so key in being a useful and productive \nand effective Member of this body.\n  The rules form a framework that ensures the fairness of the debate \nand an outcome that can be respected. Mike knows that, and it is \nreflected in his work. In so many instances, his knowledge of the ways \nof the Senate was drawn upon by so many of our colleagues in ways to \nadvance the cause of our common humanity and decency.\n  Mike Epstein's work in the Senate will be long remembered--the \nlegislative battles he helped us win, and the losing battles he helped \nus fight so well. But his true legacy will be his commitment to public \nservice, and his dedication to the institution. He is among the ranks \nof those who choose to give deeply of themselves to make a significant \ndifference in the lives of so many people across this country. That \nachievement will stand as a shining example to everyone who works in \nthe Senate--Senators and staffers alike.\n  I grew up in a family where members of the family were taught that \nthey should and they could make a difference, and that each of them \nshould try.\n  I remember listening to the members of our family who said you do not \nhave to be a United States Senator to make a difference. All you have \nto do is give of yourself and work towards a purpose.\n  This country is a better country because of Mike Epstein. Today there \nare scores of people--there are children who are getting better \nopportunities, young people who are getting better educations, older \npeople whose lives have been enhanced--who will never know the name of \nMike Epstein. But because of Mike, their lives are more graceful and \nmore useful and more productive, and their sense of hope is realized--\nall because of the extraordinary service of an extraordinary human \nbeing.\n  We love you, Mike, and we always will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in expressing \nappreciation to Senator Wellstone for arranging for this period this \nmorning to give us a chance to send a message to Mike, and to talk with \nhim, as it were, long distance for just a few minutes.\n  I was struck as I listened to my colleagues as they spoke about \nMike's attributes. His kindness, his warmth, which I think everyone who \ncame in contact with him would subscribe to.\n  I still remember him on the staff back row here in the Chamber with, \nI guess one might call it, a mischievous smile on his face, and his \ngenerosity with his counsel.\n  Presumably Senator Wellstone was aware and gave a special \ndispensation to all of us to contact Mike, even though he was working \nfor Paul, for his counsel and advice on matters that were before the \nSenate.\n  I took advantage of that opportunity on many an occasion, and always \nbenefited from it.\n  He has been spoken about by many of my colleagues as an institution \nin the Senate, and I think that is very true.\n  But I want to make this point in talking about Mike as an \ninstitution, and the impact he had on this body. I\n\n[[Page S3279]]\n\nthink we are also paying a tribute to all of the loyal and hard-working \nstaff in the Senate who make it possible for this institution to \nfunction and to play its proper role in the American constitutional \nsystem.\n  He and Senator Wellstone developed a very close relationship. As some \nhave noted, they were like family--like brothers towards one another. \nBut Mike's family is also all of us because he was such a caring \nfriend.\n  So this is a trying time. Mike, we want you to know that you are very \nmuch in our thoughts and in our prayers, and as the Chaplain said this \nmorning when he opened the Senate and pronounced his blessing we also \nhope that you will derive some peace and harmony from this \nconversation.\n  I want to talk for a moment about Mike Epstein as a thoroughly \ncommitted fighter for progressive principles.\n  As others have noted, when he finished law school in 1961 at Boston \nUniversity where he graduated with honors and was an editor of the Law \nReview, he came to Washington and went to work for the Justice \nDepartment. That was headed at the time by another Kennedy. Mike \nenlisted in that effort and served with great distinction in the \nDepartment of Justice for almost 10 years.\n  He then came to Capitol Hill and held a number of very significant \nresponsibilities in the Senate: Counsel to Senator Kennedy; then \nCounsel to the special committee to investigate intelligence \nactivities, the Church committee. He was counsel to the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence; counsel to the Democratic leader. For more \nthan two years, he was chief counsel to the Senate Committee on Foreign \nRelations, which is where I got to know him best. I had that wonderful \nopportunity to work closely with Mike and I still treasure the close \nrelationship we developed.\n  Consistently throughout all these responsibilities, Mike reflected \nhis abiding commitment to the U.S. Constitution.\n  He understood the significance of the Constitution in our political \nsystem, and Mike, again and again in carrying out your \nresponsibilities, your determination that we should pay appropriate \nrespect and deference to the Constitution constantly came through.\n  Secondly, I was struck by Mike's commitment to American democracy. It \nis a complicated business to make American democracy work--We are a \nvery diverse, pluralistic nation. We are now getting up towards 300 \nmillion people. Mike understood the importance of opportunity and \nfairness for the workings of the American political system and was \nconstantly committed to those goals and to those objectives.\n  He had an abiding commitment to working people. As Senator Kennedy \nnoted, there are hosts of people across the country who never met Mike \nEpstein and don't know his name, but lead better lives today because of \nthe work and the commitment of Mike Epstein here in the Halls of the \nCongress for now almost three decades.\n  So Mike, we want to take this opportunity to just talk with you and \ntell you how much you have meant to all of us.\n  I want to close with one final observation. Mike, throughout all of \nthis commitment and tough fighting for principle and for causes, you \nconsistently reflected a civility and a decency and a respect for \nothers which I think, explains, why you have come so much into the \nhearts of so many people.\n  I join others in expressing my gratitude to you for all you have \nmeant to us, and in wishing you the very best now in this difficult and \ntrying time, and in saying a very heartfelt thank you for being our \nfriend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is an honor to be able to talk to Mike \nfor just a couple of minutes and to do so with my friends whom you and \nI care so much about and to say, particularly to Senator Wellstone, \nthank you for standing up in the caucus and for telling us about Mike's \nbattle and inviting us to speak with him.\n  The message I want to give you today, Mike, is that you have made a \nmark in the Senate. It is hard to do that because I am sure you know we \nhave at least 100 fairly large egos around here. To make a mark in such \na place is a tribute to you. You have made a mark among so many \nSenators--by the way, you picked some wonderful ones to work for--and \nalso among staff.\n  I don't know whether you can see the staff here, Mike, but there are \nquite a number of them here today. If they could grab a microphone away \nfrom us, I know they would. They also send their strong and best wishes \nto you and their love.\n  It is kind of unusual for someone to have that kind of amazing \nrespect and admiration from Senators and staffers alike. There is a \nreason for it. You chose this career for the right reasons--not for the \npower, not for the influence. In many ways, you have that through the \npowerful and effective people for whom you work.\n  But that is not why you decided to make your career in public \nservice. It is really because inside you, you have this burning feeling \nthat we need to make life better for all the American people. That is \nreflected in the work you do, as well as the people for whom you chose \nto work. That is reflected in making life better for families, \nchildren, and workers, regardless of who they are or what their status \nis.\n  But I want to tell you, Mike, I remember just a couple of weeks ago \nwhen I was feeling my oats because we had won an amendment on the floor \ndealing with sensible gun laws. It had been such a struggle. I found \nmyself in the subway, going back to my office with you, Mike. Boy, I \nwas feeling good because we don't win a lot around here these days. It \nwas a good feeling. You looked at me and instead of saying, good work--\nwhich is of course what I wanted to hear from you--you said: You know, \nwe really have much more to do on this. We have to build on this. We \nhave to take it the next step.\n  At first, I thought, this was not what I wanted to hear. I wanted to \nrelax and enjoy the moment. When I got back to my office I realized: He \nis right, we just have to build on our success. We have to keep on \nworking and keep pushing.\n  That gleam Mike always has in his eye really comes with this message \nof fighting. That is why I think he and Paul Wellstone are such a great \ncombination. You can't have more of a fighter for the people than Paul \nWellstone. It is a great and contagious quality. We need more of it \naround here. It is easy to give up, whatever side of the aisle you are \non, or wherever you stand on the issues. It is tough to get in some of \nthese battles. It is tough to stand and debate and fight for your point \nof view.\n  There is a lot at stake, Mike, and you always understand that. I hope \nyou can take that amazing spirit, fight, and spark with your family, \nengage in this fight you are in right now, and know that a lot of \nMembers, including staff and Senators alike, really care about you and \nrespect you so much.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased that Senator Wellstone is \non the floor at this point. I want to join my colleagues and speak \nregarding our good friend, Mike Epstein, and I send my thoughts to Mike \nas well. This is a wonderful place to work in the Senate and in this \ncommunity. But it is a tough town. Mike Epstein is one of the warmest, \nbest people I have ever met. For a while, I was a little jealous that \nhe worked for Senator Wellstone, until I found out that Senator \nWellstone, with Mike Epstein, is a team operation. Whenever I needed \nencouragement out here and Paul wasn't around, or somebody from my \noffice, all I had to do is turn back and look at Mike who would give me \na warm smile and good advice. He is a good friend. I am proud to be \nassociated with Mike and to have worked with him over the years.\n  I thank Paul very much for giving us this opportunity.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my colleague from Wisconsin sent a \nwonderful letter that was read to Mike and he loved it. I thank him for \nthat.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank all of the Senators who spoke for Mike and his \nfamily. There are other Senators who will be speaking who could not \nwork into this timeframe. It is quite amazing to have so many people \ncome down.\n  Mike, I want you to know that the Parliamentarian, staff, Republican, \nDemocrat, everybody here has a look on their face, an expression of \nlove and support for you and your family.\n\n[[Page S3280]]\n\n  I finish this way, Mike. It has not been our friendship--the \nrelationship is not like I hired somebody to be my assistant; it is \nmore like I hired somebody who has been my teacher. Maybe that is why \nwe are joined at the hip.\n  Sometimes when I come to the floor, probably I make mistakes, maybe \nget too intense, feel too strongly. I will ask Mike, how have I done? \nHe will be willing to give me quite a bit of constructive criticism. \nBut sometimes I will be down on the floor with other Senators and I \nwill go back to the office and I will go to Mike and look for approval. \nI will say: Mike, how did I do? And he will say: That was just right.\n  Mike, I hope you think this was just right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. What is the time status?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 11:15 \nis under the control of the Senator from Wyoming or his designee.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Let me first say how touching and impressive it was for \nthe Senators to come to the floor and make these comments. All of us \nhave Mike in our hearts and prayers.\n  I yield to the Senator from Idaho as much time as he desires.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/03/senate-section/article/S3280-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3280-S3284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES ACT\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to come to the \nfloor today and speak with regard to the Educational Opportunities Act \nwe will be debating later today. The Educational Opportunities Act \nrepresents an opportunity to make a striking change in education in \nAmerica. I will quickly go over what it is that this act with which we \nare dealing will do.\n  Title I of the act is dedicated to helping disadvantaged children \nmeet the high standards of education that we seek to have them achieve.\n  Title II is dedicated to improving teacher quality throughout the \nNation.\n  Title III contains enrichment initiatives for our schools, including \ninitiatives such as the gifted and talented programs; the advanced \nplacement programs; help for neglected, delinquent, and at-risk \nstudents; and help for each school to meet each child's unique \neducational needs.\n  Title IV deals with developing safe and drug-free schools.\n  Title V deals with initiatives for educational opportunities, \ninitiatives that will involve opportunities such as taking maximum \nadvantage of the technology education we need to provide for our \nchildren.\n  Title VI involves innovative education where we give flexibility and \npower to the local teachers and parents to create innovative \neducational programs in their communities that will help empower \nstudents.\n  Title VII deals with bilingual education and language enhancement \nacquisition so those who need to develop the necessary skills to speak \nEnglish can be given the assistance to do so.\n  Title VIII deals with impact aid, a form of aid critically important \nfor those areas where the Federal Government creates an additional \nburden through its use of Federal property. And Title VIII deals with \nIndians, Native Hawaiians, and Alaskan Native education, dealing with \nspecific needs throughout the Nation where we need focused efforts.\n  I thank the chairman of the HELP Committee, Senator Jeffords for his \nleadership on this bill. I also like to thank the ranking member, \nSenator Kennedy, and all the members of the committee for their time \nand efforts to bring forth a bill that invests in public schools and \noffers our children an unparalleled opportunity for education reform \nand a better education. I commend all for your endeavors in tackling \nthe tough decisions that face our schools and our children.\n  The pending ESEA bill offers students and parents a tremendous \nopportunity for better schools and a better education. Perhaps our \ngreatest accomplishment in this bill is the reduction of Federal \nregulations. While the Federal financial contribution is approximately \n7 percent of total education costs, the requirements currently placed \non States represent a disproportionate burden in redtape and Federal \ncontrol.\n  Granting waivers to States, and allowing them to bypass complex, \nconfusing, and time consuming mandates, is one of the most important \nthings S. 2 does to help schools reach their full potential.\n  In exchange for increased State and local flexibility, the Education \nOpportunities Act requires greater accountability for improving student \nperformance. By establishing high standards and demanding \naccountability, this bill represents a great step toward ensuring the \nacademic success of all students.\n  Senator Gorton's Straight A's proposal also allows interested States \nto consolidate up to twelve Federal formula grant programs in exchange \nfor flexible approaches that boost student achievement. The Straight \nA's program gives States more flexibility in the use of Federal funds, \nso long as it can be demonstrated that the flexibility is used to \nachieve higher academic results for students.\n  Senator Gregg's efforts to promote portability should also be \ncommended. This child-centered approach establishes per-pupil amounts \nto be used for supplemental services, such as tutoring. This change, \nwould for the first time, ensure that the money follows the student. No \nlonger will a school with title I students go without receiving funding \nfor the very students it is asked to educate.\n  As I have looked through this bill and reviewed the various \nprovisions, I am particularly pleased to see a number of measures I \nintroduced earlier this year in separate legislation have been \nincluded. These bills focused on the growing needs of education in our \nrural communities. Earlier this year, I introduced an education bill--\nnow title VI part B, the Rural Education Initiative--that would allow \nschool districts to combine the small amounts of funding they may \nreceive for specified programs, to accumulate a book of funds large \nenough to address local priorities. The committee recognized the unique \nchallenges facing rural school districts by incorporating this \nimportant provision into the bill before us today. The students, \nparents, teachers, and administrators in Idaho appreciate your \ncommitment to small, and sometimes poor, rural school districts.\n  Regarding title VIII and the Impact Aid Program, I am pleased to see \nlegislation I authored earlier this year included in the bill. My \nlegislation recommended changing the formulas by which Impact Aid funds \nare distributed to schools. This change, and other important changes in \nthe bill before us, reaffirm our commitment to those children in \nschools where the loss of local property taxes due to a large Federal \npresence has placed an extra burden on local taxpayers.\n  The Educational Opportunities Act also ensures that teachers are an \nintegral part of the effort to improve public education. The bill \nrecognizes that strong professional development for our teachers is the \nfoundation of our effort to facilitate improved student achievement. \nWhether professional development is emphasized through technology \ntraining, quality mentoring, or programs to recruit, hire, and train \ncertified teachers, all which I proposed in legislation earlier this \nyear, under this bill schools will have the flexibility to influence \neducation based on local principles and local successes. Nothing can \nreplace qualified teachers with high standards and a desire to teach. \nCoupled with professional development opportunities, our teachers must \nbe equipped to positively influence and inspire every child in their \nclassroom, and ultimately accelerate student achievement.\n  As I close, I would like to clarify one position that I have heard \nmisstated, not only during this debate, but in various forums on \neducation reform. Some have expressed the unwillingness of Republicans \nto adequately fund education initiatives like many of those we are \ndebating today. Some individuals have gone so far as to say that we \nhave proposed significant cuts. This is far from the truth. Last year's \nconsolidated appropriations bill included significant funding increases \nfor education. In fact, education was funded at $990 million above the \nPresident's budget request and $2.4 billion more than fiscal year 1999 \nlevels. While there is a clear disagreement on how to spend education \nfunds, I hope that we can proceed with an honest and accurate \ndiscussion about the support for adequate funding.\n\n[[Page S3281]]\n\n  If we put our differences aside and work together to pass this bill, \nESEA will be reauthorized for five years, with a price tag of nearly \n$160 billion. In 1965, the original ESEA bill was enacted to close the \nachievement gap between rich and poor students. I have yet to speak to \na Senator who is not willing to provide the funds to achieve this \nworthy goal. But, I believe there are some Senators who share my \nconcern that we will continue to fund a system where the original goal \nof this 35-year-old law is no closer to being met. Instead of narrowing \nthe achievement gap, we see the gap actually widening. Too many of our \nstudents continue to perform at low standards, with many ranking near \nthe bottom of a list of 21 industrialized nations in many subject \nareas. Continued Federal funding should be implemented with the goal of \nclosing the achievement gap, and rewarding successful schools, rather \nthan funneling money into failing programs. If our original goal \nremains--closing the achievement gap--it is not unreasonable for \nFederal funds to be tied to strict accountability standards.\n  Congress takes up the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act every 5 years. What we do now will significantly impact \nthe lives of all students. We cannot sit around any more waiting to see \nif our old programs suddenly work. In 5 years, one child will have \ncompleted his or her elementary career. Another will graduate from high \nschool and enter our increasingly demanding technological workforce. \nAre we willing to let another 5 years go by before making real changes? \nAre we willing to allow another child to be pushed through a failing \nsystem? I am not, and that is why the provisions and initiatives \nincorporated in this bill must be supported.\n  Education is the key that unlocks the future for our children, our \nState, our Nation, and there is no higher priority. I support the \nEducational Opportunities Act, which reauthorizes the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act and I urge my colleagues to work together to \npass a bill we can all take pride in supporting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about our vision \nfor the future, our vision for the future of education and why that is \nimportant for the future. We have to provide a high-quality education \nto the students of the United States in order for them to be able to \ncompete, for them to be able to grow, for them to be able to prosper \ninto our future. I think it is critical at this juncture that we in \nthis country talk about what that vision is of our future, that vision \nof education in our future.\n  We are talking about a different model. We are talking about a \ndifferent way to go. We are talking about more innovation. We are \ntalking about more individual decisionmaking. We are talking about a \nsystem which will allow students in that individual classroom, and \nteachers and local boards of education and States, to make more \ndecisions about their future than they have had the freedom to make, \nusing education dollars, at any time in the past.\n  This is a model we followed previously. I think the correct model to \nlook at is welfare reform that this Congress, in 1995 and 1996, debated \nand passed. It was major welfare reform legislation in that we went \nfrom a federalized system of one-size-fits-all rules and regulations to \na State system. We set up some parameters and guidelines at the outset. \nWe said our objective was to get people to work and have the freedom of \nthe workforce and not continue to be strapped down in a system that did \nnot allow individuals to blossom. It was a system that confined people, \nin many cases, to failure.\n  We said we were going to let the States innovate. We were going to \nlet the States work to help people more instead of having this one-\nsize-fits-all system. It has been a brilliant success in welfare \nreform. Welfare rolls are down 50 percent. People are working and \nreceiving a check in the mail, and they are happy about it; they are in \ncharge of their future rather than thanking the Federal Government for \na small subsistence payment to mire them in poverty all of their lives.\n  It was innovation, it was opportunities, it was local decisionmaking, \nand it has been wildly successful. We want to replicate that model in \neducation--local decisionmaking, innovation, individual opportunities, \nand I think this is going to be wildly successful if we are given the \nopportunity from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle in the \nDemocratic Party to allow us to move forward with this model of \neducation reform.\n  I hope we do not get hung up as we did last week on the marriage tax \npenalty saying, to pass marriage tax penalty, we want to deal with \ngermane amendments, and then we were stopped by a number of nongermane \namendments on topics that were not relevant at all to the marriage tax \npenalty. It appears we are starting down the same track.\n  We want to do something significant in education reform. We can do \nit. We have the time, we have the floor, and we have the opportunity. \nOr are we going to be stopped by things that simply do not pertain to \neducation at all?\n  The Democratic Party is going to have to decide whether we move \nforward with an education bill or this is just another chance to block \nmajor legislation and complain about a Congress that does not do \nanything when there are those on their side of the aisle who seek to \nstop us from doing anything.\n  In a vision of the future, I imagine a future in which a human being \nactually steps onto another planet in our solar system, and I imagine \nthat the coming generations will look forward and say: We do not fear \ncancer as a major threat to health. In fact, the odds may be pretty \ngood we both have a pretty accurate vision of opportunities in the \nfuture.\n  Indeed, at this point in our Nation's history, in the wee hours of a \nnew millennium, we have tremendous potential to accomplish things that \nuntil now have been unimaginable--eliminating cancer as a major health \nrisk in the country or going to other planets.\n  However, for the future to become how we envision it today, our \nNation's children must receive a first-class education. Over the next \ncouple of weeks, we will have a chance to address our visions for the \nfuture in providing that first-rate education for our children.\n  When I say visions for education, I use the plural for a reason. When \nSenators from both sides of the aisle close their eyes and envision the \nfuture of American education, they often see very different results. \nOne vision about which we have heard quite a bit in the past few weeks \nis the vision of the status quo. Some want to move into the new century \nusing the old model which spends education funds through specific \ncategories that the Department of Education sees fit. They will \ncontinue to hold school districts accountable primarily for filling out \ntheir paperwork correctly and on time.\n  In one sense, this model is very successful. This model has been \nsuccessful at creating programs. Currently, ESEA is comprised of over \n60 different programs, each one specifically tailored to address a \nproblem or problems with public education that Washington perceives. \nWith 46 million students in approximately 87,000 public schools, it is \npretty impressive that we can figure out their needs so well from \nhere--one place.\n  The status quo model has also been extremely successful at holding \nStates, school districts, and schools accountable for filling out \npaperwork. While the Government provides only 7 percent of local school \nfunding, it demands 50 percent of all school paperwork. Those are \npretty bad odds. In fact, some State education agencies devote 45 \npercent of their staff to administering the funds they receive from the \nFederal Government. Quite wasteful.\n\n  This paperwork burden demands 49 million hours each year, or the \nequivalent of 25,000 employees working full time on paper rather than \nkids. Indeed, fewer than 50 percent of the personnel employed by public \nschools are teachers today.\n  Unfortunately, with all of its success over the past 30 years, the \nstatus quo model has been a failure in one very important aspect, and \nthat is student performance. Many of the status quo programs have been \nspecifically targeted toward low-income students. Yet in the fourth \ngrade, 77 percent of the children in urban high-poverty schools are \nbelow basic on the National Assessment of Educational Progress test.\n\n[[Page S3282]]\n\n  Problems with student performance are not confined to urban \ndistricts. These problems have touched the lives of literally millions \nof Americans. Since 1983, over 10 million students have reached the \n12th grade without having learned to read. Over 20 million have reached \ntheir senior year unable to do basic math.\n  The bill before us has in it a different vision for American \neducation. This new vision is the vision of innovation versus the \nvision of status quo. Under this model of innovation, instead of \nrelying on Washington to assess the problems facing 46 million \nstudents, we rely on the parents, teachers, and principals who know the \nchildren's names. Instead of counting on the bureaucrats at the \nDepartment of Education to figure out the needs of 87,000 public \nschools, we leave it up to the school board members and State education \nofficials who can tell you about the neighborhood where the school is \nlocated.\n  Under this model, we count on these people to identify the problems \nfacing our students and schools and to be innovative in finding a \nsolution to fix these problems.\n  This model has already started to work in places such as my State of \nKansas. Over the past 3 years in Kansas, we have seen Federal education \nfunds increase by over $21 million. However, when one talks to the \npeople who deal with the Federal education funds, they want to talk \nabout the success of consolidated planning, which Kansas implemented \nunder an Ed-Flex waiver.\n  Consolidated planning was a modest step which helped eliminate some \nunnecessary bureaucracy and helped the State use Federal funds more \nefficiently. More than that, it gave Kansans a taste of what can be \naccomplished with a little innovation. I want to give Kansas and the \nrest of the Nation more room, an incentive to be innovative. That is \nwhy I support the bill before us today.\n  Under the leadership of the Senator from Vermont and other colleagues \nsuch as Senator Gregg, our committee was able to produce a piece of \nlegislation that takes very important steps toward the innovator model, \nthe first being the Straight A's proposal about which several of my \ncolleagues have already spoken.\n  In conclusion, we have had a taste of this in education, and it has \nworked. We like the taste of it, and we like what it produces. We \nexperienced it in welfare reform, and we have seen enormous success.\n  Let's move forward with this innovation. Let's allow this opportunity \nto blossom so our kids not only can envision but fulfill the dreams of \ngoing to other planets and of curing cancer, but they need a quality \neducation to fulfill those dreams. I thank the Chair. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have been listening with a great deal of \ninterest as my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have expressed \ntheir views on education. I particularly commend my neighbor and \ncolleague from Kansas and my good friend from Idaho for their very \nperceptive comments about education.\n  As I listen to the debate back and forth, it is clear we have two \nvery different approaches to education being championed. On the one \nside, we have trust of local schools; on the other side, we have \nmistrust.\n  On one side, we advocate local control; on the other side, they \nadvocate Federal control.\n  On our side, we say that parents, schools, teachers, and school \nboards know best. On the other side, they say Washington knows best.\n  For me it is not a tough choice. This is not rocket science: trust, \nlocal control, parents, schools know best. There is no question in my \nmind.\n  I come to the Senate floor today to say--and I have said it before \nand I will say it again--I spent my adult career working with parents, \nteachers, and school boards in Missouri. I have watched them work. I \nhave watched their education decisions. I spent the last 13 years in \nthis body watching Congress debate issues and watching the Federal \nbureaucracy administer programs.\n  When it comes to wasting money, it is not even close. It is not a \ncontest. It is a good thing that local schools do not operate as does \nthe Federal Government because local schools could not afford to. \nLuckily, schools are far better at applying resources to the needs of \nchildren in their schools. Unfortunately, the Federal bureaucracy has \nbeen good at creating waste, misdirected priorities, red tape, and \nunnecessary hassles and regulations.\n  As it is the case in other areas as well, our congressional zest to \nprovide assistance has become part of the problem--our good intentions. \nAnd they are good intentions. Nobody questions the intentions. When the \nCongress went about creating 765 programs, every single one of them was \na good idea. Unfortunately, it was at the wrong place. It was a good \nidea in Washington, not a good idea at the local school level.\n  Our good intentions have become burdensome regulations, unfunded \nmandates, mounds of paperwork, and unwanted meddling. We have created a \nsystem where parents, teachers, and local school officials have less \nand less control over what happens in the classroom.\n  Instead of empowering parents, teachers, and local school officials, \nwe have empowered the Federal Government and the bureaucrats. We have \nbeen slowly eroding the opportunity for creativity and innovation on \nthe local level and have put a system in place where the Olympians on \nthe hill pretend to know what is best for the peasants in the valley.\n  We need to be bold enough to stand up and admit that these good \nintentions have gone astray. Our good intentions are failing our public \nschools and, most importantly, they are failing our children. Let's \nrecognize what we do not know in Washington has become obvious. \nWashington does not always know best, especially when it comes to \nmicromanaging the education of children in local schools throughout \nthis country.\n  What is wrong with giving control of education to local schools and \nto the States? What happened to everyone saying that education is a \nnational priority but a local responsibility? I firmly believe that is \ntrue. If that were true, and the other side trusted those at the local \nlevel, this debate would not be as controversial as it is.\n  What is wrong with letting classroom teachers, principals, and school \nboards fashion plans to improve learning and achievement in their own \nschools?\n  Back in my home State of Missouri, no one thinks the answer to \nimproving public education lies within the Halls of Congress or in the \ngranite buildings in downtown Washington's Department of Education.\n  Almost everyone I have talked to will say: Stay out of the way and \ngive the local schools the opportunity.\n  Missourians know, and I know, that the real solutions--the \nlaboratories--are the local schools when they are given the opportunity \nto excel and not have to play the ``Mother, May I'' game with \nWashington, DC.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle keep talking about class \nsize, afterschool programs, and numerous other programs. These will be \nnew programs, with new mandates, and new responsibilities for schools \ndirectly controlled and regulated by Washington, smothered with reports \nand regulations and redtape. Is this the direction we want to go? I do \nnot think so. This will only exacerbate the ``Mother, May I'' game.\n  As we debate ESEA today, I hope we will keep certain things in \nperspective. One of those things is how much money the Federal \nGovernment actually provides to the local school district and what \namount of Federal involvement is appropriate with the amount of funding \nprovided.\n  I have heard over and over again that the Federal Government provides \nless than 10 percent of a local school district's budget. Yet the \nFederal Government accounts for over 50 percent of the local school \ndistrict's paperwork burden. How can any of us justify this proportion \nof Federal meddling and paperwork burden for less than 10 percent of \nthe district's funding? In my State of Missouri, on average, Federal \nfunding accounts for only 6 percent of the local school district's \nbudget.\n\n  My great State of Missouri has some wonderful teachers, principals, \nsuperintendents, and school board members--some of the best in the \ncountry. I cannot believe my colleagues are not\n\n[[Page S3283]]\n\nhearing the same thing from their constituents that I am hearing from \nmine. If you are not, I suggest you are not listening. Go back and ask \nthem. They will tell you. However, just in case you have not heard, let \nme share some of the things I have been told.\n  The Superintendent of Springfield Public Schools in Missouri said:\n\n       The amount of paperwork that the federal government causes \n     local school districts to engage in is often overwhelming. \n     That extra effort and time often reduces productive classroom \n     time and energy that could better be spent working directly \n     with children.\n\n  Mr. Berrey of the Wentzville R-IV School in Missouri said:\n\n       Limiting federal intrusion into decisions best left to \n     local communities is what I believe our founding fathers had \n     in mind.\n\n  From Neosho R-5, in Missouri:\n\n       The individuals working most closely with the students are \n     indeed the ones who can best decide how this money can be \n     spent for the benefit of students' education.\n\n  From the Superintendent of the Special School District of St. Louis \nCounty, MO:\n\n       As head of a school district specializing in special \n     education, I fully understand how my district's financial \n     needs differ from other school districts' needs. In order to \n     best utilize the limited funds that are at my disposal, I \n     need maximum flexibility in determining how to put those \n     funds to the best use.\n\n  From the Board of Education President of the Blue Springs School \nDistrict in Missouri:\n\n       Without local control, the focus is taken away from the \n     needs specific to the children in each school system.\n\n  I think the Superintendent of the Taneyville R-II School District in \nMissouri sums it up well:\n\n       I feel that the State and Federal government has tied our \n     school's hands with mandated programs and mandated uses for \n     the monies we are receiving. The schools are likened to \n     puppets on a string. Pull this string this way and the school \n     does this; pull it another way and the school does that. \n     School systems and communities are as different from one \n     another as individual people are different. What works for \n     one will not work for another.\n\n  These are the types of comments I have heard over the past couple \nyears. These comments led to the development of my Direct Check for \nEducation proposal that is S. 52.\n  As introduced, S. 52 took six Department of Education programs, \nprimarily competitive grant programs, and combined them and determined \nthat the funding would go out based on average daily attendance in \nschool districts. It would give school districts added flexibility.\n  I intend to offer an amendment that would allow us to try this as a \ndemonstration program.\n\n  I know it is hard sometimes to get Governors to support this concept. \nBut I stand here as a recovering Governor. I know that Governors and \nStates have the responsibility for welfare programs, State \ntransportation programs; but the responsibility for directly delivering \nstudent education rests in the hands of those at the local level.\n  Let's give them the opportunity to demonstrate they can deliver. \nStates can still establish standards and requirements. They still have \nthe ability to control their local school districts. What I am saying, \nwith Direct Check, is to keep their hands out of the bureaucratic maze \nthat the Federal Government imposes on them. I hope my colleagues will \ntake a look at that proposal when I offer it.\n  Another area I am looking at very carefully is having an amendment on \nImpact Aid. Impact Aid is one of the oldest Federal education programs, \ndating from the 1950s, and is meant to compensate local school \ndistricts for the ``substantial and continuing financial burdens'' \nresulting from Federal activities. These ``activities'' include Federal \nownership of land, such as military installations or Indian reservation \nlands, as well as local school enrollment of children whose parents \nwork on Federal property. It is a Federal responsibility.\n  In my State, we have two outstanding military bases: Fort Leonard \nWood and Whiteman Air Force Base. I would argue it is a quality-of-life \nissue for our military and one we must address. I look forward to \nworking on it with my colleagues. I believe the Senator from Oklahoma \nwill be working on it.\n  I also offer my support, in advance, for an amendment I have been \nworking on for some time with Senators Stevens and Jeffords, along with \na number of our other colleagues, that focuses on early childhood \neducation and development.\n  While most of the debate this week will be about elementary and \nsecondary education--the years of what we might call ``formal \nschooling''--the education and mental development of a child, however, \nbegins long before that child enters kindergarten. In fact, the \neducation and development of a child begins practically at birth. From \nthe experiences we have had in Missouri with parents and teachers, we \nknow that those first 3 years are vitally important. Giving the parents \nthe right tools to help that child get started can make a tremendously \nimportant difference in the educational achievement of that child \nthroughout that child's educational experience.\n  The amendment the Senators from Vermont and Alaska will offer \nrecognizes these basic facts; that the education and mental development \nand entire development of a child begins early in life. Through this \namendment, we hope to support families with the youngest children to \nfind the early childhood educational programs that can help those \nfamilies and parents provide the supportive, stimulating environment we \nall know their children need.\n  The amendment recognizes that if we want to do everything possible \nfor our Nation's children and their overall education, we need to focus \non the earliest years, as well as the years of formal schooling. We can \ndo this--and this amendment proposes to do this--by supporting and \nexpanding the successful early childhood programs and initiatives that \nare working right now at the local level. I invite anybody to come to \nMissouri to see how well these programs work.\n  I am pleased to say the amendment is based on the basic ideas and \nprinciples set forth in legislation that I was pleased to introduce \nseveral years ago with my good friend and colleague from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kerry.\n  Mr. President, it is my opinion that if we want to improve our public \neducation system to educate our children for a lifetime of achievement, \nwe must take the stranglehold of the Federal Government off the local \nschool districts and the States and give the resources directly to \nthose local school districts and States so they can do their job.\n  I look forward to supporting an amendment by my colleague from \nMissouri, Senator Ashcroft, which deals with some of the very serious \nproblems that the current IDEA imposes. Talk to any school official, \nany schoolteacher, any school personnel in Missouri, and they will tell \nyou they are scared because the requirements of IDEA put other \nstudents, teachers, and school personnel at risk from dangerously \nviolent students who sometimes carry guns and are sheltered by the \nFederal regulations that come with the individual education program. We \nshould not have a Federal Government program that puts people \nassociated with schools at risk. We need to change the laws to protect \nand nurture those with IEPs but not to expose those with whom they deal \nto violence and perhaps even to guns.\n  In closing, we must empower parents, teachers, school administrators, \nand school boards because education decisions can best be made by \neducators, board members, parents, teachers, and local school officials \nwho know the names and the needs of the children in their schools. I \nhope we will be spending our time debating education, not every issue \nunder the Sun that may come up as an effort to derail this vitally \nimportant reform of our education system.\n  Our children deserve the reform this bill delivers. This ESEA bill \ndeals with one of the most important national priorities, and that is \neducation. It deals with it by moving the control and the \nresponsibility out of Washington and back into the real world where the \nbest decisions can be made. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues.\n  I thank the floor manager, the chairman of the committee, for \nallowing me the extra time. I look forward to continuing the debate and \nworking with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to achieve \nsuccessful ESEA reform, with perhaps some of the bells and whistles \nadded that I have mentioned.\n\n[[Page S3284]]\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, we are now launched into that portion of \nthis vital debate on education when amendments will be proposed, \ndebated, and voted upon. Under the order, there will be first a \nRepublican amendment; second, an amendment for a Democratic \nalternative; the third, another Republican amendment; and fourth, the \nMurray amendment that was just outlined by the Senator from Vermont.\n  I hope, and I think the leadership hopes, we will vote on the first \ntwo amendments before the end of business today, but that certainly is \nnot guaranteed. At the present time, there is no time agreement.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate what the Senator said. I think we can move \nmore rapidly if we exchange the amendments. We have just received the \nGorton amendment and we want to be responsive in a timely way. We would \nbe glad to try to stay two amendments ahead so those who have the \nresponsibility to inform their colleagues, as well as to speak on these \nissues on the floor, have an opportunity to be prepared to address \nthose questions.\n  I hope, out of a spirit of comity, we could try to do that. It is \ngenerally done in areas of important policy. There is no reason not to. \nWe know what these matters are. I indicated to the chairman of the \ncommittee 2 days ago what our amendments were going to be, and they are \nthe ones we offered in committee. There are no surprises. I hope we \ncould at least try to do that as a way of moving this process forward.\n  This is related not only to the Senator from Washington. We know he \nhas spoken to other groups that he intended to offer an amendment, but \nwe will try to work with the floor managers to exchange these \namendments so we can move it forward in a way that will benefit all \nMembers.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will do all I can to make sure the \nSenator has appropriate notice.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We will provide to the leader our first amendment, as I \nindicated, the Democratic alternative, and then the Murray amendment. I \nwill be glad to give the particulars to the floor manager.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Thank you.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I think the suggestion of the Senator from \nMassachusetts is an excellent one. As I say, I hope we will debate for \nthe balance of the day on the amendment I have just submitted and on \nthe Democratic alternative. I, for one, will have no objection during \nthe course of the day if the Democratic amendment is before the body \nmore or less contemporaneously with my own. They can be debated at the \nsame time. Whether we will be able to finish today and vote on both of \nthem is uncertain. I think it is the hope of the leadership we can do \nso. The idea that the next two amendments that are already enshrined in \nthe unanimous consent agreement should be exchanged today so each side \ncan see them for debate tomorrow, in my view, is an excellent idea.\n  The subject of my amendment is one of the important and dramatic \nchanges proposed in the bill reported by the Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee. It is an amendment to the Straight A's portion \nof that bill. I will discuss Straight A's a little bit more in detail \nas we go forward today, but, fundamentally, Straight A's in the form in \nwhich it is found in this bill is a 15-State experiment available to 15 \nof the 50 States, pursuant to which roughly a dozen of the present \ncategorical education programs--including, most notably, title I--would \nbe combined and consolidated without the great bulk of the rules and \nregulations literally amounting to hundreds of pages and the forms and \nbureaucracy that accompany those rules and regulations.\n  There would, however, be one overwhelming requirement substituted for \nthe procedural rules that accompany the present programs that are \nincluded in Straight A's. Those procedural rules have literally nothing \nto do with student achievement. They have to do with eligibility. They \nhave to do with the nature in which the money coming through those \nprograms is spent. They, of course, have as their goal student \nachievement. But most notably, the 35 years of title I have not been \nmarked by any significant reduction in the difference between partially \nprivileged student achievement and those of the underprivileged \nstudents, at which title I is aimed.\n  This amendment is slightly more than a technical amendment, but it\n\n[[Page S3285]]\n\ncertainly does not change the philosophy of Straight A's. It has a more \nbinding requirement; that the 15 States which take advantage of \nStraight A's actually reduce the achievement gap between high- and low-\nperforming students by a minimum of 10 percent over the 5 years of the \ncontract under which Straight A's is offered to those 15 States.\n  S. 2, this bill, already includes a very considerable carrot that \ngives a bonus to States that close that gap by 25 percent during the \ncourse of the agreement. That is a new, novel, and vital part of \nStraight A's. However, in order to see to it that the States which take \nadvantage of Straight A's actually reduce that gap, a more modest but \nstill significant reduction is simply required as a condition of \ncontinuing to be eligible for Straight A's.\n  Second, there has been some criticism that elements in this bill \ncould be construed to be vouchers. That is not the case, in my view. It \nwas not the intention of the draftsman of Straight A's or of the bill \nas a whole, but a portion of the amendment that is before the Senate \nnow creates exactly the situation that exists under present law, where \nthe use of Federal funds for vouchers is not explicitly provided for or \ndisallowed but is essentially dependent upon the interpretation of \ncurrent law by the Department of Education.\n  A third change in this amendment requires that districts and States \nthat use Straight A's provide an assurance that Federal funds will be \nused to certain disadvantaged districts and schools. I do not think \nthat differs from Straight A's, as it was originally drafted, but it \nmakes that requirement more explicit.\n\n  Finally, it sets up a list of eligible programs in Straight A's and \nin another part of this bill, performance partnership agreements, as \nbeing identical, as matching. They were meant to match. There were a \ncouple of technical differences in the bill as reported. This corrects \nthat disparity. But the purpose of the amendment, in addition to those \nminor changes, is to focus the attention of this body on that portion \nof S. 2 that deals with Straight A's.\n  I have spoken on a number of occasions on that subject. I would like \nto do so now once again. I should like to say, to reuse an analogy I \nused in my remarks last night, we are, as is the case with every group \nthat proposes a dramatic change, threatened with all kinds of \ndisastrous consequences if somehow or another we change the status quo. \nThat is not a property exclusively belonging to members of one party or \nto the other. But it does seem to me that what we are proposing in S. 2 \ntaken as a whole, with Straight A's as a major portion, is the most \nsignificant redirection of Federal education policy since the advent of \ntitle I itself some 35 years ago.\n  Every addition to Federal education policy since then, with the \nmodest exception of Ed-Flex, has increased the control and the \ninfluence of the Department of Education here in Washington, DC, over \nthe education policies of 17,000 school districts in the 50 States \nacross the United States. Every frustration at a lack of success--and \nthere have been many such lacks and many such frustrations--has been \nmarked by a Federal statute that increases the control and the \nauthority the Federal Government has imposed over education policy. If \n100 pages of rules is not working as we desired it, maybe 200 pages of \nrules would work better.\n  At least unconsciously, if not consciously, that has been the \ndirection in which the Congress and many Presidents have led Federal \neducation policy over the course of the last 35 years, to the point at \nwhich we have a huge disparity between the modest 7 percent or 8 \npercent of the money spent on public education in this country that is \nappropriated by Congress and the blizzard of rules and regulations \ngoverning the spending of that 7 percent or 8 percent, a set of rules \nwhich has a huge impact on the way the other 93 percent that is \nsupplied by States and local communities themselves is spent.\n  This is an attempt to reverse that direction, to show far more trust \nin parents, who obviously are concerned about their children's \neducation, and trust in the men and women who dedicate their careers to \nthat education--their principals, their teachers, their school \nsuperintendents, and those civic-minded citizens who expose themselves \nto the same kind of assaults in the political world as we do as \nSenators. But in 99 percent of all cases as they run for membership on \nschool boards, they do so without compensation and close to home.\n  We believe firmly that these people, the people who, by and large, \nknow our children's names and our grandchildren's names, are better \nsuited to make many of the decisions about the quality of education and \nthe direction of education those children receive than is the Congress \nof the United States or are the bureaucrats in the U.S. Department of \nEducation. That is the goal of Straight A's, to restore some of that \nauthority on an experimental basis to States and to school districts in \n15 of the States of the United States.\n  As I said earlier, it is regarded by a number of Members of this body \nwith absolute horror that we should think of doing so. We are given a \nseries of nightmares about what might happen if we allow parents and \nthese professional educators to make decisions they have continuously \nbeen deprived of the authority to make over the years.\n  The analogy to which I referred was welfare reform. The Presiding \nOfficer can remember that debate only a few years ago. We were told if \nwe took this tremendous step in a very different direction, a different \ndirection after 50 years or more of a welfare system that was also more \nand more encrusted with rules and regulations and assumptions about \nwhat people would do under certain circumstances, we would devastate \nthe social fabric of the United States. After a debate that encompassed \nseveral years, with a number of vetoes, we did in fact dramatically \nreform our welfare system, and we have had a dramatic success in doing \nso, with only a few bitter enemies critical of the direction of that \nwelfare reform.\n  I know of no other issue during my time in this body comparable to \nthat change and to that debate until we got to this debate. We are now \nat the point at which we found ourselves, maybe 1 year into the debate \non welfare reform, here with education reform. Our view is that if more \ndecisions are made closer to our students' lives by people who know \nthose students, the quality of their education will improve and we will \nhave a greater opportunity to help the great mass of students in the \nUnited States, our young people, with the complicated challenges of the \n21st century.\n  However we do not leave it at that. We do not simply say: We think \nyou can do a better job, so here is the money. Go out and do it. We \ntell the 15 States that will be privileged to exercise the Straight A's \noption: You have to perform. We are not going to give you a whole bunch \nof rules and regulations about how you fill out forms and how you \nassure that money is spent on a narrow category of programs; we are \nsimply going to tell you that you have to do better. You are going to \nhave to come up with a way of measuring achievement in your State--as \nmost States have, at this point. You are going to have to tell the U.S. \nDepartment of Education that if you are allowed into Straight A's, in \nthe 5-year period of your contract the achievement of your students \nwill improve by a specific amount that you outline in this contract. \nAnd if you fail, you are going to lose that ability, that authority to \nspend the money as you see fit for your priorities, for your children, \nfor your States and in your communities.\n  That is the ultimate in accountability. When we deal only with \nprocess accountability--how well do you abide by the rules, how well do \nyou fill out the forms--we do nothing in particular for our children \nand for their education. We hope the results will be good, but there is \nno measurement of the actual quality of their education as reflected in \nthe way in which they deal with standardized tests in each one of these \nStates. We have an accountability, not to process but to performance. I \nwant to repeat that. Our accountability is not to process but to \nperformance. In order to succeed, in order to continue in the Straight \nA's Program, you are going to have to show that you are providing a \nhigher quality of education to the students in the school systems in \nyour State.\n  As I introduced this bill more than a year ago, it was not limited to \n15\n\n[[Page S3286]]\n\nStates, either in the House or in the Senate. I suppose it is a \ncommentary on the dramatic nature of the change, that it has been \nreduced to a significant demonstration program in this bill. The House \nof Representatives allows it in 10 States. We, in this bill, allow it \nin 15 States. I would much prefer every State have that option, but \nonly 15 are going to be able to do so. At the same time, I want to \npoint out a very important fact, not just about Straight A's but about \nall of the innovative directions in this bill. The Performance \nPartnership Act, the Teachers' Empowerment Act, other provisions of the \nbill--none of them is mandatory; they are all elective.\n  It is important for everyone in this body to recognize--it is \nimportant for all the people to recognize--that we are not requiring \nthese changes. Any State in the United States of America that believes \nthe present system of categorical aid programs and the present system \nthat has 127 at-risk and delinquent youth programs in 15 Federal \nagencies and Departments, 86 teacher training programs in 9 Federal \nagencies and Departments, and more than 90 early childhood programs in \n11 Federal agencies and Departments, not to mention the programs that \nare included in Straight A's, any State that wishes to continue under \nthat system is free to do so--any State. If they like the present \nsystem, if they are accustomed to the present system, they can continue \nto perform under it.\n  If this bill passes and becomes law, in a relatively short period of \ntime in our history, 5 years at the maximum, we will know which system \nworks best. We will know whether or not allowing our educators a far \ngreater degree of freedom to set their own priorities is, in fact, the \nway to do it. We will be able to measure objectively, by the forms of \naccountability they are required to follow in order to get into \nStraight A's, whether or not it works.\n  I may go beyond that proposition to say, of course, Straight A's is \nnot the only element in this bill that allows our local educators in \nour States to make more of the decisions that affect their children. \nThere is a Performance Partnership Act in this bill that is a \nmodification of Straight A's, supported by the National Governors' \nAssociation, an association through which many of the dramatic reforms \nin education over the last few years that are allowed by the Federal \nGovernment have, in fact, taken place.\n  That Performance Partnership Act does not have all of the flexibility \nStraight A's has, but it has a significant portion of it. All States \nunder this bill will be allowed to take that more modest step toward \nmaking their own decisions than is available in Straight A's, which is \nonly to 15 States.\n  Again, no State will be required to do so. What does that mean? That \nmeans there are at least three paths States can follow in this \nconnection: 15 States can take Straight A's, a number of other States \ncan take the Performance Partnership Act, and a number of other \nStates--and I am sure there will be some--will decide not to choose \neither of those alternatives.\n  Again, not only will our students learn more, we will learn more \nabout the best way or perhaps more than one successful way toward our \ngoal, a goal we all share, and that is a better education for our \nchildren.\n  The same thing is true for the Teacher Empowerment Act. The same \nthing is true with title I flexibility that is included in this bill. \nThese are elective with the States and sometimes with the school \ndistricts themselves.\n  How is it we can be so certain that the present system is so good \nthat we do not want anyone to use a different system? Have we been so \noverwhelmingly successful that we do not need to have this debate at \nall; that all we need to do is just reratify for another 5 years what \nwe have been doing for the last 5 years? I do not think anyone believes \nthat; everyone believes we can do better. But can't we at the very \nleast allow people to do better in a different direction rather than \nsimply saying, we have a whole bunch of programs now; all we need is \nmore rules for the existing programs and a few new ones, added on to \nthe dozens and hundreds we have at the present time that affect \nthe education of our children from prekindergarten to and through the \n12th grade?\n\n  Straight A's gives us the ability in some of the States to determine \nthe accuracy of the statement that our parents, our teachers, our \nprincipals, our superintendents, and our school board members care \ndeeply about the education of the kids admitted to their charge or in \ntheir families; that they are smart enough to make fundamental \ndecisions about the course of that education; that we want an alternate \nway of reducing the gap between underprivileged children and those in \nmore successful schools; that we have not been overwhelmingly \nsuccessful--at all successful--in reducing that gap in the last 35 \nyears, and that perhaps another way is better and at the very least we \nought to compare it with the current way in which we do business.\n  We will hear during the course of this debate: No, we just need to do \nmore of the same; if we can just do more of the same; it is just that \nwe have not done enough of what we have been doing in the past; and no, \nwe cannot allow some States to go off in a different direction from \nothers; no, we cannot repose that degree of confidence in the people in \nour school districts all across the country; we dare not do it; this \nthreatens to have this adverse consequence or that adverse consequence \nor a third adverse consequence.\n  I only ask my colleagues to reflect on the fact that this debate will \nbe, for all practical purposes, identical to that debate over welfare \nreform of a few years ago, and if we had taken counsel of our fears \nthen, this country would be far worse off than it is today, when \ninstead of taking counsel of our fears, we took counsel of our hopes \nand worked rationally toward those goals.\n  The attitudes that gave us welfare reform ought to give us this bill, \nincluding Straight A's, during the course of this debate and provide a \nbetter future for children all across the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wish to, if I may, ask my friend and \ncolleague from Washington a question. If I understand this correctly, \nthere are two essential provisions that he includes here. One is, in \nthe 15-State block grant, the Senator prohibits the use of funds for \nvouchers to private schools; is this correct?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes. I said I believe it did already, but this makes it \nmore explicit. It simply keeps the present rules with respect to \nvouchers in effect.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As the Senator knows, there are different provisions in \nthe 50-State block grant than in the 15-State block grant. During the \nexchange in our committee, the principal proponent, Senator Gregg--and \nI am sure he will speak to it--indicated that he did not dismiss the \nuse of those funds for private school vouchers.\n  Is the Senator from Washington saying--many of us have been critical \nof the overall program and the use of vouchers, that this is a block \ngrant and voucher program--with this amendment, there would be the \nelimination of the language in the 15-State block grant that would have \npermitted the voucher program for private schools?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, that is not what I say. I do not believe \nit allowed it previously, but in any event, I think we have satisfied \nthat criticism with respect to those who made it with respect to \nStraight A's. I do not think it allowed vouchers before. It clearly \ndoes not now.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate the Senator's response. I hope the Senator \nwill stay with me because usually when the proponent of a particular \nmeasure, such as Senator Gregg, says that it does and then another \nSenator says he reads the language that it does not--generally \nspeaking, the members of our committee believed that it did, whether we \nagree with it or not, for the very significant reasons that the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire pointed out--so we want to understand now, once and \nfor all, whether you believe it did or did not before.\n  Your understanding is that it eliminates the use of vouchers for the \nprivate school partnerships as part of your amendment?\n  Mr. GORTON. The amendment we have proposed essentially restates \ncurrent law, where the use of Federal funds for vouchers is neither \nexpressly provided for nor disallowed but intended upon the \ninterpretation of current law by the Department of Education.\n\n[[Page S3287]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Whatever the exchange is that we are having here between \nthe Senator from Washington and myself--I know he is reluctant to \nsomehow say now this is the effect of the amendment. It certainly is my \nunderstanding, and I think the other members of our committee would \nagree, that when it was proposed, very clearly--you can go back into \nthe Record and see--this was the intent of the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  I may stand corrected by the one who put that in, that it was to be \nan allowable use of these funds to be used under the block grant \nprogram. They were going to consolidate the programs and then turn the \nfunds over to the States, and then some would go down into the local \ncommunities. But one of the purposes that would have been legitimized \nfor the first time was a voucher program for private schools.\n  On our side, we support the use of title I funds in terms of public \nschool choice. But this was a departure from that. That is exactly the \nway we read it.\n  Under the Senator's amendment, the option of private school vouchers \nwill not be there.\n  Secondly, in the 15-State demonstration block grant, you add a \nprovision. Could the Senator tell me what the effect of the language \nfor the 15-State block grant is, on line 5, on the ``Achievement Gap \nReductions''? What does the Senator intend to achieve by that language?\n  Mr. GORTON. The language is designed to require that there be a \nreduction of 10 percent over the 5-year period between the highest and \nthe lowest performing students described in an earlier part of the act, \nwhich is basically title I.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am trying to understand. Exactly of what would the 10 \npercent reduction be? What is the Senator trying to drive at? As I \nunderstand it, the Senator is trying to deal with the provisions of the \nlegislation that relates to accountability.\n  We have the overall State accountability. Then we have the 15-State \nblock grant. The 15-State block grant is going to come under overall \nState accountability. The provisions of the overall legislation will \napply.\n  Could the Senator please clarify? We can probably move to an early \nacceptance of the Senator's amendment, but I just want to understand \nexactly what it does and what it does not do. I have difficulty in \nseeing exactly what this really means in terms of the total \naccountability.\n  Does this change the overall State requirements that are spelled out \non page 662, the ``Failure To Meet Terms.--If at the end of the 5-year \nterm of the performance agreement a State has not substantially met the \nperformance goals . . .''? Does this in any way change that?\n  Mr. GORTON. It makes it tougher.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Can the Senator tell me exactly what are the penalties \nthat will be included in here if they do not achieve that?\n  Mr. GORTON. The penalties will be the same as they are in the \noriginal form of the bill; that is to say, if a State does not meet the \ncommitments it made in getting into this 15-State Straight A's Program, \nit runs the risk, at the discretion of the Department of Education, of \nlosing the ability to continue in that program. It would revert to the \npresent system of categorical aid programs and the accountability \nprovisions contained therein.\n  What this does is add another mandatory requirement to what the State \nundertakes, a 10-percent reduction in this differential. So it makes it \nsomewhat tougher for the State to be entitled to continue in Straight \nA's after its initial 5-year period.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The reason I ask this is, I say to the Senator, he is \nnot in any way changing the ``Failure To Meet Terms'' that a State must \nmeet. As I understand it, the Senator is amending a different section, \nand that is the 15-State block grant.\n  What we find out further, on page 662, is, ``If a State has made no \nprogress toward achieving,'' there will be certain reductions of funds. \nBut that is when there is ``no progress.'' On page 662 it is: \n``substantial progress''. I do not see how your 10-percent over the 5-\nyear period of the performance agreements really does very much.\n  Mr. GORTON. I say to the Senator, given the fact that in 35 years of \ntitle I we have not reduced it at all, a requirement to reduce it by 10 \npercent in 5 years is rather substantial.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator would explain to me where--this is the \ncontrolling law. It states very clearly, on page 662, what the test is \ngoing to be. It talks about ``agreement a State has not substantially \nmet the performance. . . .'' There is no definition of what \n``substantially met the performance'' is. That has not changed by the \nSenator's addition. The penalty described on page 662 only applies when \nthere is ``no progress.''\n  I fail to see how that does very much in terms of accountability. It \ndoes not stop at the end of 2 years.\n  Does the Senator's program have the requirement of a reduction of \nfunds administratively at the end of 3 years, as the Democratic program \ndoes? It does not. Does it have a further reduction after 4 years? No, \nit does not. Does it have requirements that the State has to intervene; \nand that, if not, there could be the closing of a particular school if \nit does not achieve those kinds of reductions? It does not. The \nDemocratic program does.\n  It is basically feel-good language.\n  I would recommend, if it is going to make the Senator from Washington \nfeel good--and evidently is going to make others on that side feel \ngood--that we are not going to be able to use vouchers for private \nschools, we have been maintaining that block grants are blank checks \nfor States. We have talked about, this Republican proposal is going to \nprovide vouchers for private schools, and we have been told: Oh, no, \nthat isn't so. We have some of our Republican friends saying: Oh, no, \nthat was not even intended for part of it. We had the proponent of the \namendment saying that was so. Now the Senator from Washington wants to \neliminate that. Well, I certainly would urge our colleagues to support \nthat.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see some colleagues here who might want to address \nthis issue. The way I see it is that this language, as the Senator has \npointed out, would effectively reduce the block grant.\n  I would say, just out of comity, since this language was prepared by \nthe Senator from New Hampshire, could the Senator indicate to me \nwhether he is supporting this program--just out of comity, since it is \ndirectly related to his language?\n  Mr. GORTON. I am not sure what the question is.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The question is, since this is the amendment of the \nSenator from New Hampshire, has the Senator inquired if the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire supports him?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from New Hampshire joins me.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. He joins you. That is interesting. He gave me a \ndifferent interpretation. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. President, I think it is basically very weak language.\n  On page 662 of the legislation, in relation to the States, it does \nnot have any penalty. And, furthermore, you have to wait 5 years to \nfind out whether there is going to be any progress made.\n  I think families in this country want progress now. They want \naccountability now. They want guarantees now. Under our bill, that \nprocess of accountability begins in the second year, third year, fourth \nyear, fifth year; and it builds in terms of accountability, in terms of \nthe requirements of the States to help those particular communities, \nwhich is not being done today.\n  Does the Senate understand that it is not being done today? We have \nthe most recent surveys done by the Department of Education that polls \nunderserved title I communities. According to the surveys, more than \nhalf of the Title I communities have said that when they have asked the \nStates to help them, they have gotten virtually no response whatsoever. \nThis is very weak accountability. I will be glad to recommend that we \nmove ahead and accept this amendment and then get to the Democratic \nalternative so that the Members of the Senate and the American people \nwill understand and be able to compare and contrast the accountability \nprovisions because this is still woefully inadequate and woefully weak.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, I am glad to yield.\n\n[[Page S3288]]\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Massachusetts and I both sit on the \nLabor Committee, which went through the entire progress of this issue. \nI came to the floor and was trying to understand what the amendment \nactually accomplishes. Does the Senator recall that during the \ncommittee hearing we asked the author of the amendment specifically if \nfunds could be used for private schools, and his response to us was \nyes?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, that is absolutely my recollection of it.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. And that the portability for title I could also be used \nfor private schools.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. If the Senator will permit, does \nthe Senator's language affect the portability provisions?\n  Mr. GORTON. It affects only the Straight A's title of this bill at \nthis point.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That's fine. He has indicated we could not use vouchers \nfor private schools. Now we are asking, ``Are you going to be able to \nuse funds for private school vouchers under the portability \nprovision?'' Under the portability provision, there is every indication \nthat you could use funds for private schools and religious schools as \nwell. I am trying to understand whether we are addressing both of these \nconcerns or just part of them.\n  Mr. GORTON. That question would be more properly directed to the \nSenator from New Hampshire who, I may say, I think disagrees with the \nSenator from Massachusetts as to his interpretation of the provisions \nof the Senator from New Hampshire. This provision, the 10 percent, \napplies to the Straight A's provision of the bill which, in turn, \nallows 15 States to have that degree of flexibility. It is very easy to \ntalk about accountability from the point of view of punishing States \nand school districts by taking money away from them so that will \nincrease, somehow or another, their performance. Part of our bill, in \nmy view, is that the States who succeed will get a bonus, which is not \nincluded in the Democratic bill or in any previous education bill.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. If the Senator will yield further, does the Senator \nunderstand, as I do, that this amendment would not apply to title I \nportability? And we, again, asked the author of this amendment in \ncommittee if the title I portability funds could be used for private \neducation institutions, and his answer was yes. This amendment doesn't \nfix that. I am glad it fixes the first part of it, but it doesn't--and \nthe Senator can respond--fix the portability.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate the Senator's attention to this matter \nbecause it shows something enormously interesting that is happening \nhere. On one hand, this amendment addresses the issue of voucher \nprograms for private schools under the 15-State block grant program. On \nthe other, it doesn't affect private school vouchers that are \npermissible under the title I portability program. It seems to me that \nif you are going to fix it in one program, you ought to fix it in both.\n  If you look at the portability provisions on page 127, it states:\n\n       . . . an eligible child, for which a per pupil amount shall \n     be used for supplemental education services for the eligible \n     child that are (A) subject to subparagraph (B)--\n\n  And this deals with the portability provisions--\n\n       provided by the school directly or through the provisions \n     of supplemental education services with any governmental or \n     nongovernmental agency, school, postsecondary educational \n     institution, or other entity, including a private \n     organization or business\n\n  So you are striking one section, but leaving the other section. Well, \nthat will have to remain there until we address that in our \nalternative. I, for one, want to move ahead in the debate on this, and \nI would be glad to urge acceptance of this amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. If the Senator will yield for one other point, because I \nhave continually heard that with title I funds, for over 35 years kids \nhave not increased their abilities, and test scores don't show that, it \nis my understanding that we test title I students, or analyze their \nperformances, and as kids do better, they move out of the program. So \neach year, we have new kids coming into the program who need the extra \nservices for reading, writing, and basic instruction. So we are not \ntesting the same kids year after year. When we hear the comments that \nstudent achievement has not increased under title I, we essentially \nhaven't been testing the same group of students, and we cannot show \nthat because they have moved out and we are testing new kids. Am I \ncorrect?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is entirely correct. It is one of those \nimportant facts that one has to understand in order to be able to \nrespond to those who say, look, there hasn't been any change for 2 or 3 \nyears. We can demonstrate there has been academic progress made in \nterms of classes in a number of areas.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. I don't think \nany of us disagree with the goal of reducing by 10 percent over 5 years \nthe term of performance agreements--the difference between the highest \nand lowest achieving students. But I think to rhetorically say that we \ncan do it through a test is very difficult. I think we all want \nstudents to achieve better. Here on the Democratic side, we believe \nthat by providing high-quality teachers and class sizes that are \nreduced, where a teacher has time to teach math and English, where we \nare in classrooms and where students can actually learn and they are \nnot there in overcoats because there is no heating, or there are holes \nin the roof, and that we continue to put Federal resources into \nprograms that have been shown to work those achievement gaps will \ndecrease. I hope our colleagues understand this as we move forward. I \nthank the Senator from Massachusetts for yielding.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are prepared to accept the amendment.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am going to ask for a rollcall vote on \nmy amendment. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second.\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. There are Members on our side who wish to speak to that \namendment, I hope, with the consent of the manager of the bill because \nwe are debating education as a whole. We would be happy to allow the \nSenator from Massachusetts to propose the Democratic alternative now, \nand we can debate them jointly for the balance of the time in the time \navailable. Any time the Senator from Massachusetts wishes to introduce \nan amendment, there will be no objection on this side to allowing that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, there have been a number of representations \nthat have been inaccurate from the other side, and I regret that. I \nthink that maybe they are concerned that the substance of this bill \nworks so well, they have to mischaracterize the actual process in order \nto attack it. The representation that there are voucher proposals in \nthis bill is inaccurate. The senior Senator from Washington has offered \nan amendment which would make this absolutely clear. He put the status \nof the Straight A's proposal in this bill in the same position as the \npresent law under the ESEA of 1965, which law does not limit the \nability to use the funds for public entities. So that law, as viewed, \nis a chilling event on school systems from using it for private \nentities which would create the voucher issue.\n\n  The amendment of the senior Senator from Washington clarifies that \npoint, which was a point raised in committee and which was the language \nreported out of committee. If a State such as Florida has a private \nvoucher system--I guess the issue now is whether they have one or not--\nthose funds can be used in this manner. But as a practical matter, what \nthe Senator from Washington is making clear is that they can't--that \nthey will be subject to the chilling event that presently exists for \nany title I money. That chilling event has basically made it virtually \nimpossible for vouchers to be used by any State. This was the concern \nof the Senator from Maine.\n  That is why I have agreed wholeheartedly with the amendment of the \nSenator from Washington, as I believe we should not allow the bogeyman \nvouchers--it has been used as a bogeyman by the other side--to be used \nto try to undermine what is a really good idea, which is the concept of \nStraight A's.\n  The basic theme of Straight A's doesn't need vouchers in order to \nwork\n\n[[Page S3289]]\n\nwell, and we don't have to get in the voucher debate in order for \nStraight A's to work well. I am perfectly happy to have the voucher \nissue taken off the table. I don't think it was really on the table to \nbegin with because I don't think many States have a system to make it \navailable. But even if it was on the table, the Senator from Washington \nis taking it off the table.\n  I heard about this attempt this morning from a number of people on a \ncouple of talk shows. Representatives of the educational lobby are here \nin Washington in full charge against any idea of changing the status \nquo because they basically are the beneficiaries of the status quo. \nThey are also trying to use the term ``vouchers'' to stigmatize this \npiece of legislation, which I suppose is the defense of folks who \nreally can't defend their positions in opposition to this language on \nsubstance.\n  The fact is that Straight A's, as put forward, is an optional \nprogram. It is up to each State whether they want to pursue it.\n  If a State pursues Straight A's, the achievement obligations in the \narea of increasing the educational success of our low-income children \nis very strict. Straight A's is an attempt to give low-income children \na better education and to require that better education actually be \nproved to have occurred, something that has not happened under title I \nover the last 35 years after $130 billion has been spent.\n  Also, one of the Senators came out and said it is also about \nportability. There is no voucher program for portability. Portability \nis not a voucher program. All the money under portability stays with \nthe public school systems. The public school systems write the check. \nThe public school systems control the dollars.\n  This is once again a bogeyman attempt to try to mischaracterize the \nbill and, as a result of using mischaracterization, to try to, \ntherefore, tune up opposition to it.\n  I think we ought to stick to the substance of the actual language \nversus those types of presentations which I don't think are \nconstructive to the debate.\n\n  I yield to the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Just a clarification: I thought I distinctly \nunderstood the Senator from Washington comment that it was represented \nin committee that portability was indeed a voucher.\n  Mr. GREGG. No. Under no circumstance was portability ever represented \nas a voucher, or ever represented as a voucher in committee. What I \nsaid was Straight A's could have been used by a State to qualify that \nit had set up a voucher program such as Florida had. Yes, in those \ninstances Straight A's could have been used. The Senator from \nWashington was making it very clear that is not going to happen.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield to the Senator from Maine for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senators suspend for a second.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire has the floor. Does he yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes. I yield to the Senator from Maine for a question.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator for \nyielding for a question.\n  I thank the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from \nWashington State for their terrific, truly extraordinary leadership on \nthis entire bill.\n  As the Senator from New Hampshire knows, the issue of whether or not \nStraight A's authorizes Federal funds for private school vouchers was \nmost important to me. I have worked with him and with the Senator from \nWashington. Indeed, I am the author of the provisions in the Gorton \namendment which makes it crystal clear that Federal funds could not be \nused for vouchers under the Straight A's proposal.\n  Will the Senator from New Hampshire agree with me that while there is \nnothing in this legislation that prohibits a State from using also its \nown funds for some sort of voucher proposal, that the Gorton amendment \nnow makes clear that Federal funds under the Straight A's proposal \ncould not be used for private school vouchers?\n  Mr. GREGG. It makes that as clear as it is under present law relative \nto other title I moneys.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for his \nclarification on this.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask to be a cosponsor of the Gorton amendment. I am \npleased to have contributed to it in this area in clarifying the law \nsince I think it was ambiguous as to whether we were changing current \nlaw, and that ambiguity has now been eliminated.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we can talk about this all we like, but I \ndraw attention--and I congratulate the Senator from Maine--to the \nadditional views of Senator Collins, which say, I am opposed to using \nFederal funds for private school vouchers. I believe the language about \nacademic achievement for all programs must be modified to prevent \nhaving diversion of Federal funds to private schools.\n  That is exactly our position.\n  The Senator from Washington can deny that is his understanding, and \nthe Senator from New Hampshire said this isn't really a voucher debate. \nIt isn't just on our side, it is on their side too.\n  I am glad the position of the Senator from Maine has prevailed on \nthis issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Maine \nalso for working on this issue.\n  My amendment, I think, fixes one problem with which many of us were \nconcerned. However, regarding the title I portability funds in the \nbill, I am reading the language of the bill on page 127. It says:\n\n       Subparagraph (b): Provided by the schools directly or \n     through the provision of supplemental education services with \n     any governmental or nongovernmental agency, school, post-\n     secondary educational institution, or other entity, including \n     a private organization or business.\n\n  The language in the bill allows title I portability funds to go to a \npublic or private school.\n  In committee, we asked if it could go to a private school. We didn't \nuse the word ``vouchers.'' We said: Could this portability money go to \na private school? The answer is yes. That is what the language does. \nThe amendment before us fixes the Straight A's question, but it does \nnot fix title I portability.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield for a question, is the Senator \naware that under title I, if a public school wishes to contract with a \nprivate entity, such as a Sylvan Learning Center, it can do that?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yes. But the school is in control of those funds.\n  Mr. GREGG. Is the Senator aware that under this proposal the dollars \nwill still flow through the public school if it goes to a Sylvan \nLearning Center?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Under title I portability provisions that are in the \nbill before us, it will allow families to take the title I funds they \nreceive to any institution, school, or private--I just read all of it. \nThey can choose.\n  Mr. GREGG. No. The Senator is incorrect in her characterization. The \nfamily does not have possession of the funds. The funds go to the \npublic school. The public school, at the request of the family, may \nthen and should then take the money and use it to support that child in \nan additional learning activity. In other words, the child has to go to \nthe public school. The child cannot go to a private school under \nportability and use funds for the purpose of going to a private school. \nThe child must attend the public school. If they decide to do so under \nthe plan as presented to the Secretary of Education, under their \nportability plan as designed by the public school system, the public \nschool may use those dollars as it does today for the purpose of giving \nadditional support to the low-income child in assisted learning.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I reclaim my time.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator doesn't want me to clarify the point.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from New Hampshire has made a statement and \nI am looking at the language of the bill. It says.\n\n       (B) if directed by the parent of an eligible child, \n     provided by the school or local educational agency through a \n     school-based program . . . that a parent directs that the \n     services be provided through a tutorial assistance provided.\n\n  It is not directed by the school but directed by the parent.\n  I think that is one of the underlying flaws and concerns we have. As \na\n\n[[Page S3290]]\n\nformer school board member, I do not know how a school district is \ngoing to manage this when parents come to the school indicating they \nhave the right to this money, and you figure, as a school, how you do \nyour accounting, how you determine whether that child actually gets the \nmoney, how you hire teachers. And, frankly, the parent is in control. \nIt is very clear in the language of this bill.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire made a very specific case that he \nthought it was the school. If the language reflected that, I would \nbelieve it. But the language says very clearly that the parent can take \ntheir title I money and take it to another school. We interpret that, \nand everyone else will, as private or public because it is not defined \nas public.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I regret the Senator will not yield to debate this issue \nin a forum-like manner. Let me answer the question on my own time \nbecause I guess the Senator isn't making her point because she \nrecognizes her point is inaccurate.\n  If the language is as they stated, the school has the control over \nthe dollars. The parent has the right to direct the school to pursue an \nassisted learning activity. But the child is in the public school and \nthe public school controls the dollars for that assisted learning \nactivity.\n  The only difference between the present law and what this does \nrelative to that assisted learning activity, in this case the parent \ngets involved. Under present law, the parent is not involved in the \nassisted learning activity. If they want to bring in the Sylvan \nLearning Center or any tutorial service to help the low-income child, \nthey can do that, but the parent does not have the right to say do it \nor not do it. Under this proposal, the parent has the right to say, \nyes, please send my child to an assisted learning facility.\n  The school, however, has the right to say they don't think that an \nassisted learning activity qualifies as being a quality educational \nactivity and is applicable to this child's needs. If the school \noverrules it because they say that the assisted learning activity is \nnot a qualified activity, then the parent can't direct the funds to go \nin that area.\n  Essentially, what we are proposing is a system which already exists \nin Arizona--in fact, I think Seattle may have some form of this \nsystem--where parents actually get involved in the process of educating \nlow-income kids. Parents actually have something to say about it.\n  We all know from history and from study after study after study that \npertinent for improving the quality of education of the child is \nparental involvement. We also know that the single biggest problem we \nhave with low-income children is the fact that parents are not \ninvolved. This is an opportunity to draw the parent into the process \nand have the parent have a role in the process. That is very important.\n  Equally important, this is an opportunity to make sure the dollars \nactually benefit the low-income child. Under the present law, there are \nlots of low-income children who don't get any benefit from the title I \ndollars, which are low-income dollars theoretically. Why is that? \nBecause if a school does not have a threshold number of children, does \nnot have the 35 percent, or in some States it is up to 65 percent of \nthe kids in the school who qualify as low income, in other words, kids \nwho meet the School Lunch Program, then no dollars go to that school.\n  If you are a low-income child attending a school where you don't have \n35 percent of the other kids in the school as low-income children, you \ndon't get any title I assistance. Does that make any sense? Of course, \nit doesn't make any sense.\n  We are saying, instead of having the dollars go to the school systems \nand to the administration and to the bureaucracy, let's have the \ndollars follow the child. Let's have the dollars actually follow the \nchild to different public schools so every child who is a low-income \nchild actually gets funded, actually gets dollars benefiting that \nchild.\n  That is a pretty good idea because that means we are actually going \nto point the dollars at the kids who we allegedly are trying to help, \nthe low-income kids. The dollars never leave the public school system \nin the sense that all dollars must go to the public school. In other \nwords, the parent does not have the control over those dollars. He \ndoesn't get a check.\n\n  If John Jones goes to public school A, the dollars go to public \nschool A. If the parent says they don't think public school A is doing \nthe best job for their child, and then moves John Jones to public \nschool B, the dollars go to public school B. When John Jones gets to \npublic school B, if the parent says they think John Jones needs some \nassisted learning outside of his schoolday--remember, his whole \nschoolday is dominated by the public school system and he cannot go to \na private school with these dollars--then the dollars go to the \nassisted learning to the extent it is required in order to pay for that \nassisted learning subject to the public school system, and subject to \nthe public school system saying that the assisted learning is actually \nsomething that is qualified and will do the job as they deem it \nappropriate, recognizing that under present law we already allow this \nto occur. We allow assisted learning which is a private activity.\n  To characterize this as a voucher is an inexcusable attempt to try to \nstigmatize this with a term that is being used for the purposes of \ncreating an irrational response from folks, especially teachers and the \neducational community. It is simply hyperbole for the purposes of \ntrying to beat this for political reasons. It is not a substantive or \nan accurate response to what this proposal involves.\n  Remember, this proposal--whether it is portability or whether it is \nthe Senator from Washington's Straight A's proposal--is an option. No \nState has to pursue this. No community has to use this. If they decide \nto pursue this, if the State decides it wants to use portability, it is \nthe educational community in that State that has come together, that \nhas thought about the issue, that has said: Title I isn't working in \nits presents form; let's try a portability initiative.\n  It will be the educators who write the portability initiative in the \nState and who apply for it. They will have the say in how it is \nstructured. They don't have to do it if they don't want to do it.\n  If the State of New Hampshire decides they like the way they are \ndoing title I, they don't care about trying this new idea of \nportability or this Straight A's idea, they can walk away from the \nproposal. They don't have to do it. They can keep the law the way it \nis.\n  Why is there such fear on the other side of the aisle of putting on \nthe table a bunch of different options, having a cafeteria line that \nStates and communities can go through? I don't understand it. They have \nbeen stratified, iced into the status quo, petrified into the status \nquo to the point they are not willing to adjust in any way or give the \nStates any opportunity for adjustment. It is regrettable. It is \nregrettable because it means we basically, as we know for 35 years, are \nlocking our low-income kids into generation after generation of \nfailure. We know for a fact our low-income kids simply have not \nachieved. We ought to try some other ideas. We ought to let our States \ntry some other ideas.\n\n  There are a lot of States out there that want to try other ideas, and \nwe should not lock them out of that opportunity with Federal dollars.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have not had the opportunity to \nparticipate in this debate over the last couple of days. This is the \nfirst chance I have had. I would like to make a statement, and at the \nend of my statement I will be introducing the Democratic substitute \nwhich, under the agreed-upon order, will be the second amendment to be \nconsidered during the debate on this legislation.\n  I think, as everyone has already noted, this is an important debate \nfor a lot of reasons. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act is \ntruly the blueprint that guides all Federal education policy from \nprekindergarten through high school. So this is the big one. This is \nthe one that really counts when it comes to the Federal policy \nframework under which we will work for the next 6 years. Every 5 or 6 \nyears,\n\n[[Page S3291]]\n\nCongress has the responsibility to do what we are doing now, to decide \nwhat is working, to fix what is not.\n  In the past, this debate on ESEA has always been vigorous, but it has \nalways been bipartisan. In the end, the votes have always been \nbipartisan. Unfortunately, that is not the way things have shaped up so \nfar this year.\n  Two months ago, Republican leaders in the Senate stunned us by \nannouncing that they were abandoning efforts to develop the bipartisan \napproach we have used now for 35 years. Instead, they put forward \nlegislation so sharply partisan that even the Republican chair voted \n``present'' on two major Republican amendments in committee.\n  The truth is, this bill does not redefine the Federal role in \neducation, it abandons it. It essentially repeals the role of the \nFederal Government in education. Instead of targeting Federal education \ndollars where they can do the most good, the bill takes money from \nFederal education programs and puts it in block grants. All the Federal \nGovernment would do is sign blank checks. Governors and State \nlegislators would decide how the money is spent. Block grants eliminate \nany guarantee the funds will be spent where they are most needed or on \nreforms that are most effective.\n  Our Republican colleagues claim to hold States accountable for the \nresults. They require states to have a plan in this legislation, but in \nthat plan the State sets their own performance goals and the goals be \nbased on State averages. If children from well-off families made all \nthe gains, that would be good enough. This bill does nothing to make \nsure the children in disadvantaged communities have access to good \nteachers and strong academic programs.\n  If States fail to achieve their goals, nothing happens for 5 years. \nAfter 5 years, the only penalty for failure to comply is that a State \ncannot participate in the block grant program for the next year.\n  It is also ironic that they are claiming to ``do something new.'' \nWhat new suggestion they are proposing is to take the block grant idea \nthat goes all the way back, at least to 1981, to repeat it again now in \nthe year 2000. That is their new idea. They take an idea that was \nproposed and passed in 1981, to convert several Federal education \nprograms into a block grant, and to do now what we did then.\n  It is important, as my Democratic colleagues have noted, to look at \nwhat has happened to that new idea back in 1981. Since then, the \nfunding for that new idea, funding for that blank check, that block \ngrant, has been cut in half, largely because it is difficult to \nadvocate for a blank check.\n  Republicans have made clear their highest priority is enacting huge \ntax cuts. Those irresponsible policies would leave absolutely no room \nfor critical investments in education. So this cutting in half of the \nblank check might fit that scenario.\n  Perhaps we should not be so surprised at their interest in creating \nnew education block grants. This new, revolutionary reform idea of the \nyear 2000, similar to the one in 1981 might be the design: Let's create \na block grant, let's sign a blank check, let's cut that blank check in \nhalf in 20 years, and let's provide more in tax cuts. What we need is a \nbipartisan commitment to maintain the national commitment to education \nand invest in solutions that we know work.\n  One of our great leaders in South Dakota history has been the Indian \nleader Sitting Bull. More than a century ago, he actually came to \nWashington and noted in a speech to policymakers at the time that if we \nput our minds together and see what life can make for our children, we \nwill all be the beneficiaries.\n  Today, we make that same request of all of our colleagues. For the \nsake of our children, let's put aside these extraordinary partisan \ndifferences, put our minds together, and see what we can do for our \nchildren's future. That, in essence, is what Democrats are providing \nwith this comprehensive plan to improve America's public schools. Our \nentire caucus has worked hard on this plan. I am very gratified that \nour entire caucus supports it.\n  Our plan is a substitute for the Republican block grant proposal that \nis now on the Senate floor. It actually includes many pieces of the \nbipartisan plan our Republican colleagues abandoned in March. It is not \na blank check. It sets high standards for students and teachers. It \ngives communities the resources and tools to meet those standards. It \nholds them accountable for results. It targets Federal education \ndollars where they will do the most good.\n  We do this by helping communities reduce class size, by recruiting \nand training qualified teachers, by helping to rebuild and replace \novercrowded and crumbling schools and helping close the digital divide \nso all children can compete in the new economy, and by strengthening \nparents' involvement in their children's education, through report \ncards and other information, so they can hold schools accountable.\n  It also helps create opportunities for safe before- and afterschool \nprograms where children can receive responsible adult supervision. It \nis troubling to many of us that every afternoon in America, 5 million \nkids go home after school to empty houses while their parents sit at \nwork and worry about their safety. Our Democratic colleagues believe we \ncan do better than that.\n  Improving public education must be our top priority.\n  State and local governments clearly have the responsibility for \nfunding and running our Nation's public school programs. Federal \nprograms should be the catalyst for change. We need to focus our \nefforts on fundamental changes that work to make sure every child has \nthe opportunity to learn.\n  We took important steps in 1994 by requiring States to set high \nstandards for learning and to assess student performance, and we are \nstarting already to see some results in some areas, as some of my \ncolleagues have noted.\n  Student performance is rising in reading, math, and science. Why? \nBecause we took action in 1994.\n  SAT scores are rising. Why? Because we took action in 1994. Why? \nBecause the Federal Government created the incentives. Why? Because we \nhave been the catalyst to move these programs in the right direction.\n  More students are taking rigorous courses and doing better in them. \nThe percentage of students taking biology, chemistry, and physics has \ndoubled. Why? Because we took action in 1994. Why? Because the Federal \nGovernment has been directly involved, not in decisionmaking but in \nincentivizing.\n  More students are passing AP exams. Fewer students are dropping out. \nWhy? Because we took action.\n  What we are saying now is that it is time for us to continue to build \non those success stories at the national level that worked then, that \nare working now, and that provide us with the opportunity to do even \nmore.\n  There is much more to do. Not all schools and not all students are \nreaching their potential. The achievement gap between rich and poor, \nbetween whites and minorities, is unacceptable. Students from \ndisadvantaged communities have significantly less access today to \ntechnology. We cannot afford to leave any child behind, and we have to \ndo better.\n  Schools face many challenges that must be addressed if all students \nare challenged to achieve high standards. School enrollments are at \nrecord levels and continuing to rise. A large part of the teaching \ncorps is getting ready to retire.\n  Diversity is increasing, bringing new languages and cultures into the \nclassroom.\n  Family structures are changing. More women are in the workplace \ncreating the need for quality afterschool and summer school activities.\n  We are learning how important good development in early childhood is \nin determining success in school.\n  The importance of higher education has never been greater. Our public \nschools need to make sure that all students are prepared to continue to \nlearn in college or in technical training or on the job.\n  These are national changes, and the Federal Government, as we have \nbeen, must be a partner in addressing them.\n  My State of South Dakota has many small rural school districts. These \nschools face a particular set of challenges and limited resources to \naddress them. Many have a hard time attracting qualified teachers, and \nteachers often have to teach more than one subject. Course offerings \nmay be limited. Because students can come from long distances, many \nrural schools have\n\n[[Page S3292]]\n\nhigh transportation costs. In many rural communities, the tax base is \nactually shrinking. The crisis in the farm economy is making it \ndifficult to modernize schools and meet all of these student needs.\n  Federal resources are important for these schools, but they do not \neven get enough funding to make effective programs in the first place.\n  The Democratic alternative includes a provision to provide \nsupplemental payments to qualifying rural schools that they can use to \nhire and train teachers, reduce class size, improve school safety, and \nupgrade technology.\n\n  For more than 50 years, and going all the way back prior to that \nperiod 50 years ago when the first baby boomers were born, our parents \ncommitted themselves to the most ambitious school construction program \nin our Nation's history. They had just fought the Second World War, and \nthey could have said: We have sacrificed enough for a while. We fought \nthe war; we won the war. Now it is somebody else's responsibility.\n  Instead, they said: We love this country; we love our children; we \nwant them to have at least as good a life as we have had, and we are \nwilling to work to give them that chance.\n  Most of us who now serve in Congress attended those schools. We have \nbenefited greatly from the decisions and sacrifices they made. The \nquestion facing us now is pretty simple, but awfully important: Are we \nwilling to give our own children, are we willing to give our own \ngrandchildren, the same chance we were given? Are we willing to work \nwith each other, with parents, teachers, and community and business \nleaders to strengthen our schools? Or are we going to turn our backs?\n  The answer to that question is going to be decided in part by the \ndecisions we make over the next several days on the education bill and, \nfrankly, on this amendment.\n  If one visits London, they will see the work of Christopher Wren \neverywhere. He was the 17th century architect whose work defines \nLondon's skyline today. He built 51 churches. He built palaces, \nhospitals, and libraries. His most famous work, of course, is St. \nPaul's Cathedral. If one goes to the crypt at St. Paul's and looks \nhard, he will see a small black stone marking the architect's final \nresting place. It is written in Latin. It simply says: If you seek his \nmonument, look around.\n  The blueprint we are drafting today is like a cathedral. It is like a \nblueprint that will help shape our children's education and, thus, \ntheir future. If we do it well, it will inspire them to find the best \nin themselves.\n  The monuments we are creating are for our children, and we need to \nask ourselves what will our monuments say about us and what we value.\n  Twelve years ago, America's Governors were able to do just that. All \n50 Governors, Republicans and Democrats, agreed on eight national \ngoals:\n  No. 1, all children will start school ready to learn.\n  No. 2, graduation rates will increase by 90 percent.\n  No. 3, all children will demonstrate competency in challenging \nsubject matter.\n  No. 4, teachers will have access to programs to improve their \nprofessional skills.\n  No. 5, U.S. students will be first in the world in math and science \nachievement.\n  No. 6, every American adult will be literate.\n  No. 7, every school will be disciplined, safe, and drug free.\n  And finally, No. 8, every school will promote parental involvement \nand participation.\n  In a few weeks, the children who were in the first grade when those \ngoals were written will graduate from high school. Children grow up \nquickly. Instead of abandoning our Federal commitment to education, we \nneed to work together to build that monument so one day we, too, can \nsay: If you want to see what this great country did on education, look \naround. If you want to see how good we are, go into the schools where \neight goals were pronounced and now are reality. If you want to see \nwhether or not we as Senators have succeeded and achieved our goals \nrepresenting the great legacy left to us by others, look around.\n  Let us do this right. Let us pass good comprehensive elementary and \nsecondary education today so that we can provide the kind of incentive, \nthe kind of commitment, the kind of investments, the kind of direct, \nresponsible approach that is so warranted if, indeed, we say that our \nchildren are important and our future is really what it is all about.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3111\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nGorton amendment be laid aside, and that I be permitted to call up my \namendment, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3111.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to thank our \nminority leader, Senator Tom Daschle, for the tremendous effort he has \nmade in helping us craft the Democratic alternative to the underlying \nbill that we are considering today, the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. This amendment the minority leader has put forward is \ngoing to make very important corrections to the Republican bill that \nwill help all students in this country and their schools get the help \nthey really need.\n  On Monday on the Senate floor, I, along with a lot of my colleagues \non this side, outlined the many ways that this Republican bill is going \nto hurt our students. I outlined our positive agenda that will help all \nstudents reach their potential by investing in the things we know work.\n  Today, I have come back to the Senate floor to support this \nalternative which sets the right priorities for our students. This is a \npositive agenda for making improvements to the role the Federal \nGovernment plays in helping our local districts provide education.\n  Across this country, schools are making remarkable progress, but none \nof us can remain satisfied with the status quo.\n  As Americans, we believe every child should be able to meet high \nstandards and reach his or her full potential. This debate in this \nSenate is our chance--our only chance, perhaps in 6 years--to make sure \nevery child has the tools to succeed.\n  As a parent, as someone who has fought for our students on the PTA, \nas a school board member, I have seen what works in our schools. \nParents and educators have told me we need to invest in smaller class \nsizes. We need to invest in teacher quality. We need to help to have \nmore parental involvement in our schools. We need to invest in safe and \nmodern schools for all of our kids. Those are proven strategies that \nare transforming schools across the country. We should invest in those \npowerful approaches.\n  Unfortunately, the Republican proposal before us goes in the exact \nopposite direction. Instead of making a commitment to what works, and \nto what we know works, it experiments with things that have no record \nof producing results for students.\n  Today, surprisingly, the Federal Government only provides 7 percent \nof all education funding. But those dollars are very importantly \ntargeted to help America's most vulnerable students meet their critical \nneeds. It is a responsible, accountable way to meet the needs in \nAmerica's classrooms.\n  The Republican approach would take the things that are working and \nturn them into a block grant. Their block grant does not go to the \nclassroom. It goes to State legislatures and adds a new layer of \nbureaucracy between the education dollars and the students who are so \nimportant.\n  The Republican approach puts all of its faith in block grants. I am \nhere to tell you that students will lose out because, as I have said \nbefore, a block grant cannot teach a single child to read. A block \ngrant cannot teach a single child the basics. But investing in teacher \nquality and reducing our class\n\n[[Page S3293]]\n\nsizes can help teach children the basics. That is what we should be \ndoing in the Senate.\n  The Republican block grant proposal is a reckless, giant step \nbackwards. First of all, the Republican bill is going to hurt \ndisadvantaged students. Today, education dollars are targeted at the \nFederal level to America's most vulnerable students, ensuring that \nchildren who are homeless or children of migrant workers get the \nresources they need. They travel from school to school, from State to \nState; and we need to make sure, no matter what school or State they \nare in, they get the help they need. Under block grants, there would be \nno assurance that the education dollars intended for these very \nvulnerable students will actually go to those vulnerable students.\n  Educationally disadvantaged students have very few advocates. Believe \nme, as a former school board member, I know they do not show up at \nschool board meetings. They do not show up in State legislatures. They \ncertainly do not travel here to the Congress to stand up for the \nprograms that serve their children. We have the responsibility to do \nthat for them. By eliminating the targeting that helps poor students, \nblock grants would simply cut the lifelines that run to disadvantaged \nstudents. We cannot let that happen.\n  Secondly, block grants reduce accountability. Under block grants, we \ndo not know where our tax dollars are going. We will not know if that \nmoney is being used for critical needs. We will not know if public \ntaxpayer dollars are staying in our public schools.\n  Block grants have little or no accountability for \nstudent achievement. In this bill, we let 3 to 5 years pass before any \naccountability kicks in. We are going to lose kids in that amount of \ntime. The Republican bill simply is a 3-year experiment that breaks our \ncommitment to the things we know work, and it risks having students \nfall behind. Under the current bill, block grants would even allow \npublic taxpayer dollars to be used for private schools.\n\n  The amendment that was previously offered supposedly fixes that, but \nit does not fix the fact that, under the title I portability \nrequirements, public tax dollars will still be able to be used in \nprivate schools.\n  Finally, block grants mean less money for the classroom. Pure and \nsimple, block grants will mean less money from the Federal Government \nto our classrooms.\n  By the way, block grants are not new. They do have a history here. \nThat history shows us, very clearly, that when a specific program is \nturned into a block grant, inevitably the funding will get cut.\n  For example, an education program that we call title VI, which funds \ninnovative education efforts, was turned into a block grant in 1982. \nGuess what happened between 1982 and 1999. The funding for that program \nwas cut in half.\n  The effects of putting our education budget today into a block grant \nwould be felt in every school across this country. We would see more \novercrowded classrooms with fewer resources dedicated to improving \nteacher quality. That will be the result of block grants.\n  The Republican agenda is made up of block grants and vouchers, \ncutting lifelines to vulnerable students, having less money for our \nclassrooms, and less accountability for taxpayers.\n  There is no reason to experiment with block grants and risk leaving \nstudents behind. We know how to improve education, and we should be \ndoing that on the Senate floor. That is why I support the Democratic \nalternative that is now before the Senate.\n  We believe we must keep our commitment to vulnerable students. We \nbelieve we should keep our schools accountable. We believe we should \nnot let block grants shortchange students. That is why we are fighting \nthese block grants and standing up for the strategies that make a \npositive difference in the classroom. That is why we are working very \nhard to pass this Democratic alternative.\n  This alternative makes a real commitment to reducing classroom \novercrowding. It keeps our commitment to help local school districts \nhire 100,000 new teachers to reduce classroom overcrowding, an approach \nthat we know works--parents know it works, teachers know it works. \nStudies are showing that reducing class size in the first, second, and \nthird grades makes a difference in our student's ability to read, to \nwrite, and to reduce discipline problems in our classrooms. That is in \nthe Democratic alternative.\n  Over the past 2 years, Congress has provided more than $2.5 billion \nfor the specific purpose of recruiting, hiring, and training teachers \nto reduce class size. Unfortunately, the underlying Republican bill \nwalks away from that commitment. The Democratic substitute will \nauthorize the Class Size Reduction Program, and provide $1.75 billion \nto help districts hire new, fully qualified teachers.\n  In addition to keeping that commitment, this alternative will address \nthe need for a qualified teacher in every classroom. I assure you, when \nthey send their child off to school on the first day of school in \nSeptember, every parent wants to know two things: how many kids are in \ntheir classroom, and who is their teacher?\n\n  Why do parents ask those questions? Because they know if their child \nis in a classroom that is small enough, where they get individual \nattention, and if they have the best teacher, that child is going to \nlearn.\n  We want to make sure every child has a qualified teacher in their \nclassroom. This Democratic alternative makes a move in the right \ndirection.\n  The amendment will hold schools accountable for better student \nperformance. It will expand and strengthen afterschool opportunities \nfor students, which Senator Boxer has been so strong on, knowing that \nit makes a difference in the educational lives of thousands of students \nacross this country.\n  We will repair and modernize America's aging schools. I can't tell \nyou how many times I have been in a school where we have seen kids with \ncoats on because the heat didn't work, where water was dripping through \nthe classrooms, where they were in portables. We send first, second, \nand third graders out across schools to use restrooms because there \nisn't any running water in their building. We believe our children can \nlearn if we pay attention to what they are learning in.\n  Our underlying Democratic alternative increases parental involvement. \nEvery parent knows intuitively if they participate with their child in \ntheir school, their child will learn better. We make sure that happens \nin the Democratic alternative.\n  Finally, we work to close the digital divide. As Senator Mikulski so \neloquently speaks about, we have to make sure every child is on the \nright side of the digital divide. This Democratic alternative makes \nthat happen.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this alternative. Clearly, the \nRepublican proposal before us will leave students behind. By passing \nthis amendment, we will show parents, teachers, and students across the \ncountry that we understand the challenges they face, and that we are \ngoing to be good partners at the Federal level to make sure all of our \nkids, no matter who they are or from where they come, will have the \nopportunity to reach their full potential.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Democratic \nalternative because I believe it inadequately addresses the issues and \nthe things which we feel so strongly about--flexibility, innovation, \nand creativity at the local level; strong accountability; a child-\ncentered education program, focusing on the child, not the system in \nWashington DC; flexibility, accountability, high standards, and, again, \nchild-centeredness.\n  We have an opportunity, over the course of the next several days, to \ncontinue to build on themes that we debated, I believe, very \neffectively, last year on the Education Flexibility Partnership Act--\nEd-Flex, as it came to be known. Ed-Flex was a bill that was signed by \nthe President, which stresses flexibility, accountability, local \ncontrol, and stripping away the Washington redtape. Over the last \nseveral days, we have heard statistics quoted again and again about how \nwe are doing better in education today and citing new programs that \nhave been introduced and new money spent in the\n\n[[Page S3294]]\n\ntraditional old ways, to explain that we are doing better.\n  I think it is absolutely critical that we in this body and people \naround the United States recognize we are not doing better. American \n12th graders rank 19th out of 21 industrialized countries in \nmathematics achievement. In science, my own field--remember, math and \nscience serve so much as the foundation of what is going to occur in \nour economy, in job creation and global competitiveness, as we work to \nthe future. In science, we are not 1st, or 5th, or 10th, or 15th in the \nworld; we are 16th out of 21 nations. If you look at physics or \nadvanced physics, we are dead last when we compare ourselves to other \nnations.\n  If we look at 12th graders, those people you would think were best \npositioned to enter the world of this new economy, since 1983 over 10 \nmillion Americans reached the 12th grade without having learned to read \nat a basic level. Over 20 million have reached their senior year unable \nto do basic math. We have heard that in the fourth grade--although we \nhave made slight improvements--77 percent of children in urban, high-\npoverty schools are reading below the basic level on the National \nAssessment of Educational Progress.\n  So as we hear the debate unfold, basically saying that progress is \nbeing made, this is the foundation, these are the facts, and this is \nwhere we are today: Little or no progress has been made. If you look \nlongitudinally at how we are doing in various fields in the last 30 \nyears, when you compare us internationally, that flat curve of not \ndoing better has to be compared to the fact that other countries around \nthe world, competitors, other members of the global economy, are doing \nmuch better. That lack of achievement, that lack of accountability, \nthat lack of progress is really what we are debating today. For whom? \nFor our children. For that next generation.\n  I mentioned Ed-Flex. The purpose of Ed-Flex was basically to begin \nthat process, that debate, of getting rid of the Washington redtape. We \nheard again that the Federal programs account for about 50 percent of \nthe bureaucratic redtape that our teachers at the local levels, back in \nall of our local communities, suffer under each day. They want to \nteach, and they want to have that individual child become better \neducated. Yet in another Federal program, we have another set of \nregulations and we layer more and more redtape on their activities each \nday.\n  It is time for us to cut the redtape and remove these overly \nprescriptive--yes, well intentioned--programs that we see in the \nDemocratic alternative just presented. It is well intended, but there \nare more programs, more of the same, cutting out that opportunity to \ncapture an educational reform movement that is going on around the \ncountry today. If we look at what our schools and principals and \nteachers want to do, the opportunity we have today in the underlying \nbill is to promote that innovation, that creativity, to take off those \nhandcuffs, and capture that innovation of educational reform.\n\n  The bill that was just laid down--the Democratic alternative--is \nsimply more of the same: more programs which cut out and reject the \ninnovation and creativity which has the opportunity of accomplishing \nwhat the real goal must be, which is to take care of that individual \nchild in a way that he becomes better educated.\n  Flexibility, combined with accountability, has to be our objective. \nThe end result of the debate on education modernization, I call it, \nabsolutely must and should be innovation--rewarding what works, and \nwhat doesn't work, putting it aside. That is captured in the underlying \nbill.\n  I had the opportunity on the Budget Committee--I serve on the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee from which this bill has been \ndebated and has emerged. I have had the opportunity also to serve on \nthe Budget Committee, where we had a task force on education. For 6 to \n8 months, we had a whole range of hearings and witnesses, both \nDemocrats and Republicans, who came forward with a pretty uniform, \nsimple, well-understood message after about the third or fourth \nwitness, and that is that we have today in education, Federal education \nprograms, almost a spider web of duplicative programs, oftentimes \nconflicting, each with their own bureaucracies, all trying to do \nsomething good, but resulting in this sprawling--like a spider web, \nbehemoth, and it is hard to decipher what the incentives are to do \nbetter.\n  There has been no streamlining, no coordination over all these \nprograms, which have been layered one on top of the other over the last \n30 years. We have heard it again and again. This sort of spider web of \nresponsibilities and conflicting programs--some people say there are \n280 programs; some say there are 750 programs. The point is, there are \na lot of programs, all aimed at that individual child, resulting in \ninefficiencies and waste and loss of focus on student achievement that \nis so apparent.\n  The sad part about that is, it ultimately gets translated into \npunishing our children today instead of helping our children today. \nThere is a lack of educational progress, resulting in the international \ndata I mentioned. Once again, instead of truly developing the full \npotential of the individual students, thousands, tens of thousands, are \nnot being well educated in our schools today.\n  We filed a report based on our task force, and the No. 1 \nrecommendation--because we heard so much again and again about the \nredtape, the burdensome regulations, tying hands of the individual \nteachers--the No. 1 recommendation out of the Budget Committee Task \nForce on Education was:\n\n       In light of the continuing proliferation of Federal \n     categorical programs, the task force recommends that Federal \n     education programs be consolidated. This effort should \n     include reorganization at the Federal level and block grants \n     for the States. The task force particularly favors providing \n     States flexibility to consolidate all Federal funds into an \n     integrated State strategic plan to achieve national \n     educational objectives for which the State would be held \n     accountable.\n\n  That is the No. 1 recommendation that came from this Senate Budget \nCommittee Task Force on Education.\n  This need for consolidation really could not be more clear. We had \nthis backdrop of stagnant student performance, in spite of different \nstatistics and studies that have been brought forward and purport to \nshow minimal progress. We have to come to the general agreement that \nstudent performance has been stagnant--because it has been stagnant. In \nspite of that, we find not what you would think would be a very \nstreamlined focus to the Federal effort, but a sprawling, unfocused \neffort that really is driven by a lack of the question, What works?\n  Let's support what works, and what doesn't work. Let's no longer \nfeed, as we have done over the last 20 or 30 years and would continue \nin this Democratic alternative bill, things that do not work. The \nDemocratic alternative unfortunately feeds, yes, some good things that \nwork but also continues this institutionalization of things that do not \nwork.\n  Our bill, we have heard, contains a very important demonstration \nproject called Straight A's. It is a demonstration program. Earlier, \nSenator Gregg, again, drove home a very important point on the floor, \nwithin the last hour, that we are not in this demonstration program and \nin our underlying bill forcing anybody to do anything; that they have a \nchoice. If a local school district or a State is unsatisfied with this \nduplicative Federal effort and the categorical programs that have \nredtape tied to them, under our bill they can, if they want to but \ndon't have to, continue with the same programs. But they have other \noptions.\n  In Straight A's, we give schools in school districts the flexibility \nif they want it. I can tell you that many of them want it based on the \nhearings we have had in our committee, or based on the budget task \nforce. Their goal is to increase achievement. If they say it can be \nbest achieved in a local community in Nashville, TN, or Alamo, TN, or \nSoddy-Daisy, TN, requiring them to make decisions and giving them the \nflexibility to accomplish that achievement to educate the children, \nthen they, for the first time, will have choice under our bill. But \nunder the Democratic alternative they will not have that flexibility to \ninnovate and to create.\n  Under our bill, States don't have to, but they may elect to partner \nwith the Federal Government to consolidate those elementary and \nsecondary education funding sources. A State may\n\n[[Page S3295]]\n\nchoose to remain just where they are today under our bill in the \ncategorical program, but they will have a choice for the first time.\n  Under the Straight A's demonstration project, States that participate \ncould choose to spend that Federal money in the way that is best for \nthem. The contrast will be the Democratic approach that says: No, we in \nWashington, DC, can best judge what works best. In Soddy-Daisy, TN, at \nthe school that is serving the hundreds of kids in Soddy-Daisy, \nbasically Republicans say no; that the school should be able to make \nthe choice on how to use those funds. Why? Because, in Soddy-Daisy, \nthey might need textbooks and not another teacher, for example. They \nhave already reduced class size, per se. They may need to hook up that \ncomputer to the T-1 line, to the fiber-optic cable, that comes a block \naway so they can take advantage of that access. Or they may need an \nafterschool program. They are the ones--not us in Washington, DC, and \nnot those of us in this Chamber--who are in the best position to make \nthose decisions.\n  State and local school districts, I mentioned earlier, are attempting \nto be innovative today. They recognize that things are not working. I \nthink it is, without question, based on the data we have listened to as \nwe go back to our districts and in our various hearings, that it is the \nlocal school districts and the States that are the real engines for \nchange, that recognize the needs, and are responding to those needs \nwith innovative programs. They are yelling and crying out to take away \nthese regulatory handcuffs and this excessive regulatory burden and \nredtape that strangles them and keeps that innovation from bursting \nforth.\n  It is teachers, it is parents, it is principals, and it is local \ncommunities who are demonstrating on a daily basis their enthusiasm and \ndesire calling for this choice and increased flexibility.\n  Although the Federal Government--both the Congress and the \nPresident--is prepared to assist in improving America's schools, I \nthink it is for all of us to remember that there are limitations. We \nhave heard it on this floor. There are limitations in terms of the \nFederal role in education. In Tennessee, funding for education in our \nlocal schools is about 9-percent Federal funding and 91-percent local, \ncommunity, and State.\n\n  There are not Federal teachers. There are not Federal classrooms. \nThere are not Federal principals. Virtually all learning in America is \noccurring in classrooms and in homes outside of the purview of the \nFederal Government. But the Federal Government, tied to that 9 percent \nin Tennessee or 7 percent nationally, has this excessive regulatory \nburden which strips resources out of our local communities.\n  The Federal Government clearly plays an important role. Since we are \nfailing so miserably, I argue, nationally, and thus, we are failing \ninternationally in this increasingly global world, I believe the \nFederal Government must provide the leadership to identify the problems \nof education in K through 12 in this country as one that is clearly \nworthy of the collected energy and the attention of all Americans.\n  Yes, incremental resources both at the local and the national level \nare likely to be required and to be increased over time. But it is \nabsolutely essential, along with the resources we provide today, that \nwe give the States and the local communities the freedom to pursue \ntheir own strategies for implementation in how to identify the needs \nand thoughts of local communities.\n  State strategic plans are something that we, as a Federal Government, \nshould support. It is allowed under our bill. It is encouraged under \nour bill. In fact, under such a plan the States would establish \nconcrete, specific educational goals.\n  As we address this whole issue of accountability of what they do in \nreturn for this flexibility, they would also establish at the State \nlevel or at the local level very specific standards for accountability, \nand timetables for achievement. In return, they would be allowed to \npool the Federal funds from all of the categorical programs that we \nbuilt here in Washington, DC, and spend those consolidated resources in \nStates on locally established priorities. Accountability is absolutely \ncritical. Traditionally, accountability in the Federal perspective has \nbeen very much on quantitative measures rather than qualitative ones.\n  We talk about how many students are being served by title I. \nEverybody knows by now that title I is the Federal program with $8 \nbillion aimed at disadvantaged students. But we have not asked how well \nthose students are doing. Again, is it child-centered? That is so \nimportant in the underlying bill. Is it child-centered and focused on \nhow well that student is doing? How much is that student learning? How \nmuch is that achievement gap narrowing? We haven't asked that question. \nNow is the time. The underlying bill links that flexibility to \naccountability and to asking those fundamental questions.\n  The issue of partisanship comes forward again and again. Although \nboth sides of the aisle say, yes, education is important, and, yes, we \nneed to do better, the partisanship is interesting because people are \npainting the Straight A's component as partisan.\n  Again, the Straight A's demonstration project, flexibility, \naccountability, local control, choice--not forced choice but the free \nchoice, is a partisan measure.\n  During a budget education task force meeting, it was fascinating for \nme to hear from the Democratic officials from the Chicago school \nsystem, who said the most important thing is flexibility. They credit \nmuch of their progress in reforming the system which they adopted to \nthe so-called block grants, the block grants which the other side is \nattempting to vilify. If you talk to Chicago, which is really a model \nin terms of flexibility and accountability, they attribute much of \ntheir success to the use of block grants that allow flexibility to rise \nforth to capture the innovation and the creativity that emerges once \nyou take away these regulatory handcuffs.\n  The Chicago officials were clear:\n\n       We know the system and we believe we know the things that \n     it needs to have in order to improve. So, the more \n     flexibility we have with Federal and State funds, the easier \n     it is to make those changes.\n\n  The partisanship we should put aside. Effective education policy \nabsolutely should not be bound by party lines. We can have \ndisagreements. We will say more flexibility, more local controls, \nchild-centeredness. The other side may say another government program \nis the answer. That is a legitimate debate. But let's set the \npartisanship aside.\n  The Florida Commissioner of Education said:\n\n       We, at the State and local level, feel the crushing burden \n     caused by too many Federal regulations, procedures and \n     mandates. Florida spends millions of dollars every year to \n     administer inflexible categorical Federal programs that \n     divert precious dollars away from raising student \n     achievement. Many of these Federal programs typify the \n     misguided one size fits all command and control approach.\n\n  The concept of command and control clearly is one that we believe and \nbelieve strongly has not worked in the past and is something we should \nno longer rely upon as we march into the next century, recognizing the \nimportance of a foundation of strong education for our children.\n  The Department of Education, when they testified before our task \nforce, in many ways agreed there needs to be simplification. We have so \nmany categorical programs. Testifying before the task force, Secretary \nRiley said the Department had eliminated 64 programs. Then just several \nweeks later, we had the General Accounting Office tell us the \nDepartment still oversees 244 programs.\n  Seeing the Department recognizes the importance of streamlining and \nconsolidation leaves me a bit perplexed as to why the Department \nopposes the principles in our underlying bill. Under our bill, we allow \nchoice between the current system and a more consolidated approach--not \nforcing consolidation, but a choice for consolidation.\n  If we were doing so well today, as we have heard again and again from \nthe other side, I do wonder why they fear all the States will choose to \nparticipate in our Straight A's demonstration program, if they really \nthink the categorical system is working so well.\n  I understand why the administration opposes our proposal. We do say \nwe should not be micromanaging K-through-12 education for all of the \n80,000 public schools out there out of Washington, DC. It means, for \nexample,\n\n[[Page S3296]]\n\nif the administration has an agenda item, it would be increasingly \ndifficult to impose that on a local community if the local community \nsays you are wrong. That is not what is needed. That does not meet the \nneeds we have identified based on our experience in a local community.\n  In the last several days, many of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle suggest that Straight A's does not have any guarantee that \nthe money will be spent the way ``it is intended.'' We have heard it \nagain and again. I ask that fundamental question, the way ``who'' \nintended it be spent? Do we really think we in the Senate with the \nrange of issues that we deal with, with the distance of being in \nWashington, DC, can speak for each individual school and the individual \nneeds identified by that local school? Or is it the local teachers and \nadministrators and educators who have been in the education business \nfor years. Do we really think we know better than they what schools \nneed to be successful? Are we so arrogant and think so much of our own \nthoughts to believe that without our individual programs that are \ntargeted for specific purposes, our schools would not undertake \nspecific efforts to reduce class size, to recruit quality teachers to \nthe classroom, or to modernize their schools?\n\n  We have heard in the last several days from Democrats who have called \nthe Straight A's demonstration project a blank check. Anybody who has \nread the bill or who has studied what Straight A's is all about simply \ncannot call it a blank check. For the first time, we are actually \nrequiring States to show results. This bill looks at results, student \nachievement. It must be documented. We are requiring States to show for \nthe first time how they are helping disadvantaged students reduce the \nachievement gap.\n  An editorial today in the Washington Post was interesting. It decries \nStraight A's for removing targeting requirements on Federal dollars. \nThe editorial says:\n\n       It makes no sense that States somehow need the right to \n     shift funds away from low-income schools in order to narrow \n     the achievement gap between the lowest and highest achieving \n     students.\n\n  Apparently, the editorial board encourages us to vote Straight A's \ndown to protect the flow of money to the poorest schools.\n  It misses the point. The point is this Federal flow of money has done \nnothing for children in the poorest schools except to make us feel \ngood; to say, yes, we are doing something. If you look at the objective \nresults, we have done nothing. Report after report shows our poorest \nstudents are getting further and further behind. If you go back to our \nbill, you will see why we stress measurable results in reducing the \nachievement gap, linking it to the devotion and the investment of \nresources.\n  It requires you send the money to poor schools. In the underlying \nbill, S. 2, we have infused the fact that new responsibilities must be \ncoupled with ensuring that students are actually learning, that \nstandards are increasing, that we are doing what education is all \nabout, and that is educating those individual students.\n  States must have measures in place to ensure that all children, poor \nand nonpoor, meet proficient levels of achievement within 10 years. \nWhat better catalyst for reform is there? What better way to ensure \nthat poor children receive the same quality of education as their \nwealthier counterparts than requiring--which is what our bill does--\nthat States demonstrate their poor children are achieving?\n  School districts should be allowed to use the Federal funds in the \nmost effective way to reverse the trends I opened my comments with, \ntrends which show us falling further and further behind as we compare \nour students in the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades internationally.\n  In the First in the World Consortium schools located outside of \nChicago, administrators poured significant amounts of money into \nimproving teacher quality through intensive professional development. \nThe results, unlike the rest of America in the statistics which I \nquoted from the Third International Math and Science Study, which show \nwe are falling behind, were just the opposite in the consortium than \nwhat we are seeing nationally. They saw improvement.\n  Last week, I heard from innovative State superintendents from Texas \nand Georgia that several of their school districts discovered that \ntheir reading teachers did not know how to teach children to read so \nthey invested significant dollars in retraining all of them in the \nresearch-proven, the documented methods of reading instruction. This is \nlocal control, local flexibility, local identification of needs; not \nmandating what districts need out of Washington, DC. It is reinforced \nwhen you think some districts may want to offer programs on a district-\nwide scale to entice better teachers into the school system and into \nsome of the poorest performing schools. The funds might not be sent \ndirectly to those poor schools, but the quality teachers would. Because \nwe know a high-quality teacher is the most important determinant of a \nstudent's achievement level, that would be good. It would be a wise use \nof those funds. Our bill allows the use of funds in those ways.\n  Isn't it possible that this approach might just be more effective \nthan simply throwing money at a poor school? Demanding that \naccountability while giving the flexibility to use those funds in that \nway?\n  Radical changes in flexibility and accountability, I believe, are \nprecursors to the sort of reforms we are witnessing at the local level \nin selected pockets. I mentioned Chicago. Many of us have quoted the \nreforms that have gone on in Texas. In 1988 and 1995, the Illinois \nState Legislature enacted sweeping reforms. The 1988 law gave \nunprecedented discretion to individual Chicago schools. The 1995 law \ngave the mayor an unprecedented role. In addition, the State \nlegislature in Illinois has allowed the use of block grants for much of \nthe funding for Chicago's schools.\n  According to Chicago school officials:\n\n       Most of our initiatives are locally-based, locally-funded, \n     locally-developed by people who have been working in Chicago \n     for many years. We know the system and we believe we know the \n     things it needs to have happen in order to improve. So, the \n     more flexibility we have with Federal and State funds, the \n     easier it is for us to make those changes.\n\n  Remember, Straight A's is a demonstration project. It is not being \nforced on anybody. The school district, the State, can choose whether \nor not they want that increased flexibility or accountability. That is \nthe beauty of the underlying Republican bill.\n  For the first time, Straight A's focuses on what matters most--the \naccountability, the achievement levels of the children who need the \nhelp the most. Under Straight A's, a State may do almost anything with \nthe Federal money but--and the ``but'' is what you don't hear from the \nother side--but it has to prove it has increased the academic \nachievement of all of its students in the end. Poor kids, clearly, will \nbe better served under this proposal.\n  Again, for the first time the object of the Straight A's Program is \nfor States to focus on closing the achievement gap between those \nstudents who excel and those who do not, between rich and poor, between \nblack and white; the achievement gap is to be closed.\n  The debate centers on flexibility, accountability, on child-\ncenteredness, on local control. I have risen today to speak in \nopposition to the Democratic alternative which basically says those are \nnot the principles, those are not the themes for the American people. \nThe themes are another Federal program to add to the 760 programs that \nare out there.\n  The theme on the Democratic side is: We know what is best in \nWashington, DC. Republicans are basically saying: No, we do not know \nwhat is best. The people who know best are the people who are closest \nto our children, who do know their names and their faces, who are at \nthe head of the classroom every day, teaching; those with the \ncommitment, the teachers and the principals and the school \nsuperintendents and the parents--the parents, again, who understand, \nwho see, whose input is so necessary as we answer that question of what \nworks and what does not.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \nbefore us, the Democrat substitute. In that it is a total proposal, it \ngives us a chance to talk about the context of the total debate. I have \nto say I am appalled, looking at the scope of the data\n\n[[Page S3297]]\n\nover the last 30 years, that anybody could defend the status quo. It is \njust mind-boggling to think about it.\n  It does remind me of the welfare debate. I never could understand how \nanybody could look at that system and look at the number of people who \nwere being damaged by it and not recognize that something had to be \ndone to change it and we had to look to newer ideas. Not all the new \nideas work, but we know the old ideas did not.\n  Today in America, 41 million adults are not effective readers. They \nhave trouble with a phone book or a prescription drug label, reading a \nletter from a family member. That is a staggering number. I am going to \nget into some of these statistics, but I want to step back just for a \nmoment to say I think everybody inherently knows education is an \nexceedingly important subject for all of us in the country. But from \ntime to time, I think we need to step back and recognize that education \nand an educated mind are a cornerstone of American liberty.\n  Let's try to frame this for a moment. From our very founding, we have \nunderstood that a core component of maintaining a free society is that \nthe population is educated. To the extent that any among us who are \ncitizens do not have the fundamental skills, the basic education, they \nare truly not free. They cannot enjoy the full benefits of American \ncitizenship because they are denied the ability to participate. They \nare inhibited in the ability to think for themselves, for their \nfamilies, for their communities, for the Nation.\n  There have been a couple of assertions made here. One was made by the \nmajority leader. The other I think was made by the Senator from \nConnecticut. I would like to talk about those for a minute.\n  The suggestion is that these deplorable statistics, that two out of \nevery three African American students and Hispanic fourth graders can \nbarely read, 70 percent of children in high-poverty schools score below \nthe most basic level of reading, and on and on and on--the assertion by \nthe Senator from Connecticut was: But the Federal Government only deals \nwith 7 percent of the funding for schools and 93 percent comes from \nsomewhere else so this blame cannot be directed at Federal policy.\n  That is a little misleading because for the 7 percent of these funds \nthat go to the various States, about 50 percent of the bureaucratic \noverhead is associated with that 7 percent.\n  All the regulations, all the mandates, and all the forms associated \nwith this Federal investment in education carry with them an enormous \nand staggering burden. There are hundreds upon hundreds of Federal \nemployees in every State of the Union endeavoring to carry out the \nprograms associated with the 7 percent.\n  Since 1994, by and large, the growth of employment in the public \nschool system has been for administrators, not teachers. We are arguing \nabout how to get the appropriate number of teachers, and a system-\noriented program is driving up administrators. I want to make the point \nthat one cannot simply say it is just 7 percent of the money. That is \njust not the case. It is 7 percent of the money, it is 50 percent of \nthe overhead, and it is mandate after mandate. It has local systems \ngnarled up.\n  On more than one occasion, there has been an inference that the \nStates do not have the moxie or the know-how to get in there and get \nthis done. Frankly, it is in the States where I see the most \ninnovation. In my State of Georgia, a Democratic Governor is turning \nthe system upside down. Or one can go to Wisconsin or Arizona. Why are \nthey so energized? Why are they asking us for more flexibility and more \noptions? Because they know what we have been doing is ineffective and \nnot getting the job done and damaging our democracy because it is \nputting out on the street millions of Americans who cannot function \nproperly in our society.\n  The minority leader earlier said that since 1994, we have been doing \na whole lot better. First of all, we were doing so badly that it did \nnot take a lot to improve. The point is, there really is no basic \nimprovement. The data is atrocious. In mathematics, American 12th \ngraders ranked 19th of 21 industrialized countries and in science 16th \nof 21 nations. Our advanced physics students ranked last. Who would \never have thought this to be the case in the United States of America?\n  Since 1983, 6 million Americans dropped out of high school. In 1996, \n44 percent of Hispanic immigrants aged 16 through 24 were not in school \nand did not hold a diploma.\n  In the fourth grade, 77 percent of children in urban high-poverty \nschools are reading below basic on the National Assessment of \nEducational Progress.\n  In 1995, nearly 30 percent of all first-time college freshmen \nenrolled in at least one remedial course, and 80 percent of all public \n4-year universities offered remedial courses.\n  According to U.S. manufacturers, 40 percent of all 17-year-olds do \nnot have the math skills and 60 percent lack the reading skills to hold \ndown a production job at a manufacturing company.\n  Seventy-six percent of college professors and 63 percent of employers \nbelieve a high school diploma is no guarantee that a typical student \nhas learned the basics.\n  Maybe this is one of the statistics that is thought to have improved: \nThe dropout rate for 9th and 12th graders in 1995 was 3.9 million--\nrounded off, 12 percent. In 1998, this period for which we were \nsupposed to have seen significant improvement, the dropout rate was 3.9 \nmillion or 11.8 percent, or perhaps two-tenths of 1 percent--hardly \nanything about which to get excited.\n  In grade 4, according to the National Association of Education \nProgress, poor students lag behind their more affluent peers by 20 \npercent. The results show no change--I repeat, no change--over the \nthree assessments from 1992 to 1998. From where are we drawing any \nconclusions that somehow things have turned around?\n\n  In grade 8, 38 percent are below basic in mathematics; 48 percent of \nfourth grade students scored below basic.\n  In reading, there are more 12th graders scoring below the basic \nlevel; 20 percent in 1992 and 23 percent, up 1 percent, in 1998.\n  One has to be an eternal optimist beyond any description or \ndefinition that I can understand to think that somehow this \nincorrigible data we have received shows that we have a tourniquet on \nthe problem and circumstances are improving.\n  Seventy percent of children in high-poverty schools scored below even \nthe most basic level of reading.\n  Half of the students from urban school districts failed to graduate \non time, if at all.\n  Forty-two percent of students in the highest poverty schools scored \nat or above the NAEP basic level for reading; 62 percent of students in \nall public schools met the standard.\n  We have been at this for 35 years and have spent approximately $130 \nbillion. In virtually every category, those students who were the \ntargets of this program are not better off.\n  I want to talk about that for a moment. What does ``not better off'' \nmean? I said 42 percent, 13 percent, 30 percent, 6 million of those, 5 \nmillion of these. What does that mean? What if it is a person we know \nliving in one of our cities? It means, to use a figurative name, Billy \nSmith cannot get a job because he cannot read. He has dropped out of \nschool. He is pushed into probably a very poor environment. The \nlikelihood of Billy Smith going to prison is three times that of a \nstudent who stays in school. The chances Billy is going to be the \nfather of a child born out of wedlock are in huge multiples. The \naverage annual income is virtually poverty line or below. Pushed to \ncrime, Billy Smith, one of these millions about whom we talk, one of \nthese percentage points or numbers, one of these people we have turned \na blind eye toward for these many years, is just likely, more than \nanything else, to end up in trouble, end up in prison, end up on drugs, \nnot be a productive element of society, and probably create a family of \nwhom he cannot take care.\n  That is the picture that gets repeated by these millions and millions \nof people about whom we talk. There are 41 million American adults who \ncannot read. Look at the prison population and find out their reading \nskills. Of course, it is not that it is nonexistent, but it is not \nthere. Every one of these children who falls out, and through, this \nsystem is being condemned to a very unpleasant and nonproductive future \nin our society.\n  Now comes this bill that we are considering. I am not a member of the\n\n[[Page S3298]]\n\ncommittee. But it talks about giving local school systems options, \nperformance agreements. It talks about more flexibility. It talks about \naccountability. It makes it all optional. Nobody has to do it. If \neverybody is real comfortable with the status quo, with the abysmal \ndata we see every other week, they can stay right where they are. I \nthink they will find that the constituencies--the public--are going to \ndemand that changes start to occur, which is why so many Governors are \nin the middle of all of this and why they are asking for flexibility \nand new options.\n  But even the opportunity to try different concepts is repulsed by the \nother side: No. We can't do that. We have to set the standard right \nhere. We have to tell every one of those Governors they are not capable \nof knowing exactly what we should do anyway, so we have to tell them \nexactly what they need to do.\n  This is a classic debate between those who want to go to a new place \nand those who want to stay in the old, between the status quo and the \nnew, between those who have confidence in the emerging effectiveness of \nlocal governments and State governments and those who don't.\n  In the early 1960s, there were a number of critiques written about \nState governments. You would not recognize any of them today. I think \nfor us to assert that those folks on the ground, in the community, have \nto be told what to do is uncharacteristic of the American way.\n  I think that the substitute which says, no, let's keep things the way \nthey are--they have bells and whistles in there; but essentially it is \na defense of the status quo; let's just keep on looking at this data; \nlet's not try anything different; let's not give some flexibility to \nthese localities and States--ought to be defeated.\n  I compliment the chairman of the committee, who is not here at the \nmoment, and also Senator Frist of Tennessee, and all the others on the \ncommittee who worked so hard to produce the underlying bill we are \nconsidering, that does move to a new day, that does offer flexibility \nand accountability, that does offer new options. I commend them for \ntheir work.\n  I hope we will defeat this substitute and move on ultimately to \npassage of the underlying bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will take a few moments to respond to \nthese general comments that have been made over the period of the past \nfew days by those who are opposed to our proposal in terms of education \nreform. The proposed bill basically gives a block grant, a blank check, \nto the Governors to make these decisions.\n  It is always interesting to me to hear my friends on the other side \nof the aisle when they say: We are interested in local control, local \ndecisionmaking.\n  That isn't what this is about. This is about giving a blank check--a \nblock grant--to the States. Read the legislation. The States are the \nones that are accountable to the Secretary of Education at the end of \nthe day, after 5 years. They get the block grant. They can go out and \ndo whatever they want for another 5 years. Then they can come back and \nsay, look, we have had substantial compliance in what we originally \nproposed. Then the Secretary is either going to say, no, you have not; \nor yes, you have. The idea that the Secretary is going to cut off the \nStates on any program is preposterous--anyone who thinks that will \nhappen has not been around for any period of time under Democratic or \nRepublican administrations.\n  But let's get back to some of the facts. First of all, if we are \ngoing to provide this money, why allow this money to be taken by the \nStates before the money gets down to the local level?\n  The fact is, various GAO reports indicate that school districts \nreceived anywhere from 95 to 100 percent of the federal funds \nappropriated. This was true in 1995, for the title I programs, the \nbilingual education programs, the emergency immigrant education \nprogram, the safe and drug-free schools program. Specifically, for the \nGoals 2000 program, 93 percent of federal funds went to the local \nlevel; for the Eisenhower program, 91 percent; for IDEA, 91 percent; \nfor the preschool programs, 88 percent. Ninety-five percent to 100 \npercent of federal funds get to the local community. That is where it \nis happening at the present time.\n  So the other side of the aisle says: All right. What we need to do is \nto have more flexibility. The Federal Government and its mandates are \ndenying local flexibility.\n  Let's look at the GAO report dated January 25, 2000: ``Elementary and \nSecondary Education, Flexibility Initiatives Do Not Address Districts' \nKey Concerns About Federal Requirements.''\n  Do we hear that? We specifically asked the General Accounting Office \nto look into local communities to find out if we are effectively \nrestricting them in their ability to use money effectively to enhance \nlocal decisions. The GAO report, on page 9, says, that what the local \ncommunities want, No. 1, are resources, funding. No. 2, they want to \nhave management technology and techniques and training for the local \nschools. And third, they want information about what is working in \nother communities.\n  That isn't only the Democrats speaking. That is what the General \nAccounting Office reported. Local school districts have enough \nflexibility at the present time.\n  What does the other side say? They say: We do not want to do business \nas usual. We just want to send the money out there.\n  It is interesting when we look at what the situation is at the local \nlevel. Let's look at the IG's report from March 2000. It reviewed State \neducation agency officials in 15 States. They received complete \nresponses back from 10 States. Of the 10 States that responded, 6 \nStates do not permit any combining of funds whatsoever--no combining of \nlocal, State, or Federal funds; that is, 6 of the States prohibit that.\n  When we provide flexibility, we say, if that decision is going to be \nmade, it has to be done there at the State level. Two States, of the 10 \nStates reporting, allow combining of Federal funds only. One State \nallows combining of State and local. Only one State out of the 15 \nStates looked at by the IG of the Department of Education permits the \ncombining of funds at the State, Federal, and local levels.\n  (Mr. GREGG assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the problem isn't the Federal Government, \nthe problem is the States. That is the contention. Let's hear the \nargument from the other side on that during this debate. You say those \nare interesting reports, Senator, but is this really the case? All you \nhave to do is take the national assessment of title I that was done \nlast year. In 1999, the national assessment of title I says:\n\n       Among the schools that reported in the 1998 survey that \n     they had been identified as in need of improvement, less than \n     half reported that they could receive additional professional \n     development or technical assistance as a result of being \n     identified for improvement from the States.\n\n  Here you have communities that are trying to ask for help, and only \nhalf are receiving any. States are not responding to half of those \ncommunities. What is the other side's answer? Send more money to the \nStates. This is the wrong answer. States didn't care prior to the time \nwe passed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in 1965. They \ndidn't care about ensuring that the most disadvantaged children were \nserved. Then we gave them federal funds from 1965 to 1970 and they \nstill didn't take care of disadvantaged children. We have learned that \nlesson. And now, we want to give States blank checks. Haven't we \nalready learned from the past? States will allocate federal funds \naccording to what the Governor wants to look out after, and there are \nno guarantees that it'll be targeted to the poorest or most \ndisadvantaged children--the States aren't using their own dollars to do \nthis now.\n  If Members on the other side could say: Senator Kennedy, let me show \nyou where we have 25, 35 States pinpointing as a matter of State \npriority in education what they are trying to do for the neediest kids \nand they are showing results, saying give us more help, they would have \na strong argument. They can't do it. They don't answer that. You won't \nhear that. You will hear all the cliches such as, ``What has happened \nin the past isn't working,'' and ``They want more of the status quo.''\n  Now, in contrast, let's look at what I have said is happening out \nthere.\n\n[[Page S3299]]\n\n Needy children are the responsibility of the States. In 1986, the \nNational Governors report said, ``It's Time For Results.'' The task \nforce urged Governors to intervene in low-performing States and school \ndistricts and take over closed-down, academically bankrupt school \ndistricts. Let's see what happened.\n  In 1987, 9 States were authorized to take over--9 States out of the \n50. In 1990, the NGA report on educating America outlined strategies \nfor achieving the national education goals. The task force, cochaired \nby Governors Clinton and Campbell, recommended States provide rewards, \nsanctions, linked to school academic performance, including assistance \nand support for low-performing schools. Take over if those do not \nimprove.\n  In 1990, eighteen States offered technical assistance or intervened \nin the management of low-performing schools. In 1998, NGA policy \nsupported the State focus on schools. In 1999, 19 States complied. It \nwill take another 50 years to get all the States to take care of poor \nchildren. Now the Republicans want to send all that money out there, \nwith virtually no accountability, virtually none. Five years, and then \nunless the Secretary of Education can demonstrate that they haven't \nsubstantially complied with it, States can get another chance at it for \nfive more years.\n  That is what this is all about. Are we going to just send the money \nout to the States, or are we going to have some real accountability? \nNow, let me take one area and present our side's alternative.\n  In regard to teacher quality, we maintain in our alternative that \nthere are new, important, tried and tested, and demonstrably effective \npolicies that can enhance academic achievement. As we have pointed out, \nthese policies are: smaller class size, afterschool programs, teacher \nquality, accountability, technology provisions, and others. These are \nvirtually new. The other side may say that ``they just want to do \nbusiness as usual,'' but we didn't have technology 10 years ago or 30 \nyears ago. We didn't have the documentation of the importance of small \nclass sizes.\n\n  We assumed that all States were focused on ensuring that all \nclassrooms were going to have certified teachers. That hasn't been the \ncase. We stand on this side of the aisle to guarantee a well-trained \nand fully qualified teacher in every classroom in America after 4 years \nof the date of enactment of this Act. That is our side.\n  Let's hear what the other side has. First of all, on the issue of \nteacher training, recruitment and empowerment, they have the Republican \nTeacher Empowerment Act, which gives so much flexibility, States really \ndon't have to do anything to change their current practices. They can \ncontinue hiring uncertified teachers, continue to provide low-quality, \nineffective professional development and mentoring. In States, they \ncould use most of the funds for a large variety of purposes that dilute \nthe focus and attention on improving the recruitment and mentoring and \nprofessional development of teachers.\n  The question is, Does the underlying bill guarantee substantial funds \nfor professional development? No. All the underlying bill says is there \nwill be ``a portion of the funds''; it doesn't say how much will be \nthere. Our amendment guarantees professional development. The \nunderlying bill doesn't guarantee funds for mentoring programs. It just \nallows the use of funds for those programs. Our amendment absolutely \nguarantees mentoring.\n  Thirdly, the underlying bill does not guarantee funds for recruitment \nprograms. It just allows the use of funds for recruitment programs. \nOurs guarantees a recruitment program and gives priority for that. \nTheir bill does not guarantee that teachers are trained to address the \nneeds of children with disabilities or other students with special \nneeds. It just allows the use of funds for such training.\n  Our amendment guarantees that teachers will learn how to teach these \nchildren. Their bill does not hold States accountable for having a \nqualified teacher in every classroom. It doesn't even require teachers \nto be certified. If you look carefully at the Republican program, it \ndoes not really guarantee much. In contrast, we clearly spell out what \nour bill accomplishes.\n  Their bill does not require a substantial priority for math and \nscience training.\n  If you go and talk to any schoolteacher, any school superintendent, \nanyone that is involved in educating needy children in this country, \nand you ask them is: Do you have enough good math and science teachers? \nThey will say that one of their top priorities is getting good math and \nscience teachers in high-poverty areas.\n  Everyone says that.\n  I can give the various reports of what matters most in teaching for \nAmerica's future. The report of the National Commission on Teaching on \nAmerica's future was made up of Republicans and Democrats alike. One of \ntheir key findings was that if you are going to do anything about \nteaching, make sure you do something about math and science--there is \nno mention of a Republican block grant program.\n  Finally, their bill does not require accountability. Instead, it \npromotes ineffective professional development activities through \nTeacher Opportunity Payment Programs, what they call TOPS. TOPS \nsupports individually selected strategies that aren't necessarily \nproven effective practices. Effectively, it says that if you are a \nteacher and you want professional development, you can go out and find \nany program, anywhere, and it will be paid for. Having the Federal \nGovernment reimburse for this untested and untried program as matter of \nlocal control makes no sense.\n  Our amendment contains tough and high standards of accountability. \nOur amendment says if you do not make progress in student achievement, \nwhich is the bottom line, with better teachers after 3 years, you \ncannot continue to receive funding for this program.\n  There it is. We are prepared to say this is the challenge and this \nthe way we ought to go and this is the way it ought to be tried and \ntested.\n  We are effectively guaranteeing parents in this country good, fully \nqualified teachers. The other side can't say that because their program \ndoesn't justify that.\n  In addition, I want to look at the existing programs and the proposal \nthat is before us. This is what I consider the ``education report \ncard.''\n  They certainly get the F in terms of qualified teachers for the \nreasons that I have outlined.\n  We are talking about secure and gun-free schools and trying to make \nthem safe.\n  We are talking about safe schools.\n  We are talking about small and orderly class sizes.\n  We are talking about afterschool programs.\n  We are talking about strong parental involvement.\n  And, we are talking about, most of all, accountability for better \nresults.\n  This is the heart and soul of what we believe is necessary in order \nto enhance and strengthen the quality of education for children in this \ncountry.\n  These are the various areas of policy that we have to take action on. \nThe existing bill grade is an F.\n  We have a program that we are prepared to debate and discuss, and to \nbe challenged on. I hope we are going to escape the cliches and the \nslogans in this debate. We have heard the cliches. We have heard the \nslogans. We are prepared to deal with the real policy issues and the \nreal policy questions because we believe this is a way that we can \nreally respond to children's needs.\n  We need a guarantee. We don't need a blank check. We want to make \nsure the money is going to get to where it is needed and not go to the \nGovernors' pet programs and pet projects in local communities in their \nStates. That is what has been happening. That continues today.\n  You don't have to get a lot of reports to see what happens when we \ngive Governors a blank check. What happened has been demonstrated in \nthe tobacco bill. We sent money back to the States with the idea that \nmoney was going to be used for children in terms of smoking and \nchildren's health. We are finding out that it is instead being used to \nbuild sidewalks, and cut taxes.\n  We need to take responsibility for helping our neediest children with \nour scarce federal resources. The democratic alternative allows us to \nmake a difference for children in this country.\n\n  Finally, I want to mention what has been happening in recent times. I\n\n[[Page S3300]]\n\nheard, with great interest, my friend from Georgia talk about all the \nchallenges we are facing. We understand that every child who goes to \nschool in America today is facing additional complexities and problems \nthan they were facing 2 or 3 years ago or 5 years ago. It is very \nchallenging for a variety of different reasons that we can talk about. \nBut the fact is that there has been some progress made. Primarily it \nhas been made since 1994.\n  Let me mention the National Association of Educational Progress. \nTheir reports show that there have been significant increases in math \nscores in the fourth through eighth grades, and reading and math \nperformance among 9-year-olds in high-poverty public schools. Among the \nlowest achieving, the fourth graders have improved significantly. The \nachievement gap between blacks and Hispanics and white students has \nnarrowed since 1982. The greatest gains in science were made by black \nand Hispanic students. Average SAT scores in math and verbal were \nhigher in 1999 than the average for 1983 or 1989.\n  These improvements came at the same time that the proportion of test \ntakers with native languages other than English have been increasing.\n  The dropout rates are lower today than in the 1970s and 1980s, and \nparticularly lower for black youth.\n  In 1972, 21 percent of black youth dropped out of school.\n  In 1979, the rate was 13 percent. The dropout rate for Hispanics fell \nfrom 34 percent to 25 percent during that same period, and from 12 \npercent to 8 percent for whites.\n  In 1997, 89 percent of persons age 16 to 24 completed high school or \nattained a GED.\n  The number of students taking advanced courses has increased, \nespecially those taking advanced placement courses.\n  No one is saying that we have this challenge solved. We are not \nsaying that. But what we are saying is, we reject the statement made \nthat our alternative is merely the status quo.\n  The programs we are talking about are dramatically different. They \nare innovative. They are responsive. They have a solid record of \nachievement. We are making some progress.\n  With this substitute, we believe we will be able to come back in 5 or \n6 years and say we have made gains and that we made the right \ninvestment for the neediest children in America.\n  Finally, I want to put in a word for those children who are going to \nbe wiped out under the Republican program--the migrant children, the \nimmigrant children, and homeless children.\n  I read in the Record the other day the report that was given in 1987 \nwhen we were considering the McKinney Act. We asked States how many \nhomeless children were being educated in their respective State. We had \nvirtually no response to that particular question.\n  In March of 1987, the Center for Law and Education sent the \nquestionnaire regarding State practices and policies for homeless \nstudents to the chief State school offices in the 50 States and \nWashington, DC, and received 23 responses. The majority of the \nrespondents had no statewide data on the number of homeless children \nwithin their jurisdiction or whether the children were able to go to \nschool. The majority of States had no plan for ensuring that homeless \nstudents received an education.\n  That was prior to the McKinney Act, prior to the time of identifying \nhomeless children, migrant children, and immigrant children.\n  Now our friends on the other side are saying we don't have to deal \nwith those populations anymore, the Governors will know best.\n  They didn't up until 1987. They don't today, without these kinds of \nprogram. We are going to be back here, if their program is passed, \nmourning the day that we have essentially abdicated our responsibility \nto those children in our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent, after my presentation, \nSenator Hutchinson follow me. We will rotate. Senator Dodd could not \nstay. He will be allowed to follow Senator Hutchinson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have had a chance to come to the \nfloor the last couple of days. My colleague from Arkansas has been on \nthe floor, as well. We will go back and forth in this discussion. I \nsupport some of what my colleague, Senator Kennedy, had to say about \nthe differences between the Democrat proposal now on the floor and the \nRepublican proposal. The differences between our alternative proposal \nand the Republican bill make a huge difference.\n  I have loved being a Senator. It is quite an honor. I don't think I \nwill ever feel otherwise. I only mean this in the spirit of a twinkle \nin my eye. Honest to goodness, Washington, DC, and this Congress is the \nonly place I have ever been where people say: Let's hear from the grass \nroots, the Governors are here.\n  Governors are not what I know to be grass roots. There could be good \nGovernors, bad Governors, average Governors, but my colleagues have a \nbit of tunnel vision thinking of Governors as grass roots. Grass roots \nis community, neighborhood, school district level.\n  This is a tough point, but it is a point that needs to be made. There \nis a reason, going back over 30 years, that we as a Congress \nrepresenting the Federal Government, representing the United States of \nAmerica, have made it clear we don't just do block granting without \nsome major accountability when it comes to the question of whether or \nnot we are going to invest in poor children in America. That is why we \nhave a migrant children program. That is why we have a program for \nhomeless children. I think this legislation, S. 2, rather than \nrepresenting a great step forward, and change, is a great leap \nbackwards.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, will the Senator yield with regard to a \nunanimous consent about everybody's time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That will be fine.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The Senator from Arkansas has to go to a markup in \nabout 15 minutes. His remarks will take 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator \nfrom Arkansas be able to proceed right now. I will be pleased to follow \nthe Senator from Arkansas. I think I might get done, but I will defer \nto my colleague, not because I think he is right but because I think he \nis a good Senator.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I appreciate very much the comity extended by the \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Minnesota, \nfor his gracious comity, his willingness to afford me this opportunity \non the very limited schedule. We are all fighting the schedule. I \nappreciate that very much.\n  I thank Senator Coverdell for his continued management of this \nlegislation.\n  I have spoken several times on the Educational Opportunities Act, the \nlegislation that the HELP Committee on which I serve and Senator \nWellstone serves has brought to the floor of the Senate. I will take a \nfew moments to respond to the substitute proposal that has been offered \nby the Democrats under the leadership of Senator Kennedy.\n  Senator Kennedy stressed that what he is offering is a break from the \nstatus quo. He is trying to distance himself from this inevitable and \nunavoidable label that has been attached to the Democratic approach \nwhich is, in fact, the defense of the status quo. While you can run \nfrom the label of status quo and try to say no, this is not the status \nquo, you cannot run from your own words. It was Senator Kennedy who \nsaid we have to stick with the tried and the tested. That is clearly an \nidentification and defense of the existing model, the existing \nstrategy, the existing approach we have used in this country for the \nlast 35 years and one that has brought us to the current situation in \nAmerican education and a situation that no one can, with a straight \nface, truly defend.\n  It is the status quo in the alternative, the option that has been \noffered. It speaks on behalf of the Washington-based establishment. It \nthrows more money at a broken system rather than focusing upon \nchildren. The strategy is to claim the underlying bill is a blank \ncheck. It seems pretty clear this strategy is going to bounce.\n\n  This substitute amendment before us again presents more of the same \nprograms that have been around for 35\n\n[[Page S3301]]\n\nyears, a plethora of new programs to try to solve some nationally \nrecognized problems, loads of new bureaucracy and paperwork for \nteachers and principals. Of the more than 60 programs that are in the \nsubstitute amendment--60 programs in the substitute amendment--there is \nno emphasis upon rewarding States and school districts that do well. \nThere is no emphasis upon sanctioning or punishing those that do \npoorly.\n  The bottom line is that is more of the same. That is more of the same \napproach we have had where, if you fill out the forms correctly and you \nreceive the funding and you spend it in the way that is prescribed by \nWashington, that is the end of so-called accountability. That is a \ndefense of the old way. We are suggesting the real accountability is in \nwhether kids are learning, whether the performance gap between the \nadvantaged and disadvantaged is narrowing.\n  The emphasis in this substitute is on the status quo. I will quote in \njust a moment from an April 13 editorial that appeared in the Wall \nStreet Journal regarding Al Gore's education agenda because I think it \nis reflected in this substitute.\n\n       So what's left in the Gore teaching plan? Hire more \n     teachers. Smaller class sizes (hire more teachers). Pay more \n     teachers more. Sounds like a textbook definition of more of \n     the same . . . One of Democratic liberalism's underlying, \n     decades-old premises of using highly controlled federal funds \n     is that Washington's moral intentions always trump those of \n     the untrustworthy states. After 40 years this theory is \n     fairly shopworn, but the core of the Democratic Party will \n     never let go of it.\n\n  This substitute is clinging to the shopworn formula of the last 35 \nyears. The idea that Washington's moral intentions trump those of the \nuntrustworthy States is being rejected on this floor and rejected in \nthis country. Democrats keep mentioning that we need to continue our \ncurrent commitments. This amendment not only will continue to support \nthe status quo, it will continue to add on to the piles of programs \ncreated at the Federal level and the piles of paperwork that we require \nschool districts to fill out. That is not the way to help students.\n  Yesterday, Senator Harkin, very dramatically--I was watching it--held \nup a four-page application for class size reduction funds. He \nemphasized the point that all of this stuff about paperwork from \nWashington was blown out of proportion, there was nothing all that \nburdensome, nothing that onerous being placed upon local school \nadministrators because it was only a four-page grant application on the \nclass size reduction from one of his districts there in Iowa.\n  That might have been what was in the original application. But \ncomplying with Federal requirements usually imposes a much larger \nburden. Lisa Graham Keegan, Superintendent of Public Instruction for \nthe State of Arizona, recently talked about the paperwork burden that \nFederal programs impose on her State:\n\n       Their end (meaning the grant application sent by the \n     Federal Government) may be five pages--\n\n  That is Washington's end--\n\n       but ours certainly isn't. We have to send in a hideous \n     amount of justification. Plus they ask for \n     ``assurances'' that we will align our state laws, \n     policies, procedures, (thoughts, actions, desires . . . ) \n     to the federal program. Home loan applications also start \n     out as one to two pages . . . by the time you are done \n     with justifications, you have killed a forest. Same with \n     federal applications.\n\n  That is the point. So Senator Harkin may hold up a four-page \napplication. This is the 110-page end result of what the States have to \ndo. This is the 1999 IASA Program Data Checklist. There is, in fact, \n110 pages in the application. That is much more typical of what ends up \nhaving to come back to Washington.\n  In her home State of Arizona, 45 percent of the staff of her State \neducation department is responsible for managing Federal programs that \naccount for 6 percent of the State's education program. As I pointed \nout the other day, in Florida, it takes six times as many people to \nadminister Federal education dollars as State dollars--six times as \nmany. So something is wrong.\n  What the substitute before us would do is create more programs, more \npaperwork, and reinforce more of the same without any of the focus upon \nchildren's academic performance and narrowing the gap that is the focus \nof the underlying bill.\n  I know most Members of the Senate want to do what is right for \nchildren. I ask them to consider where the focus really is in this \nsubstitute. If every school district in Arkansas--there are over 300 of \nthem--applied for this one grant, the result would be over 30,000 pages \nof paperwork for those 300 school districts, for just one grant.\n  I know of two teachers in my home State of Arkansas who had to take 1 \nweek out of the classroom to apply for a Federal grant. It is not easy \nfor many small districts in Arkansas to find a person knowledgeable in \nthe intricacies of the Federal grant process to locate funding that \noriginally came out of their own pocketbooks, and there are no \nrequirements in the substitute amendment for improvements in student \nachievement--no requirements. Instead, they are funding systems, not \nstudents, as we have done for 35 years. If we are to change the course \nof education in this country, it is time to realize that funding must \nsupport each and every child, not each and every program.\n  Senator Daschle charged that the underlying bill would replace \nfederal targeting of funds and hand it over to the states to set their \nown performance criteria. I think this ``blank check'' strategy breeds \ncontradiction. I am reminded of past bills that are now law where we \nvoted to do just what the underlying bill requires. Let me give an \nexample.\n  In August, 1998, the Senate HELP Committee--at that time it was the \nSenate Labor and Human Resources Committee--passed and sent to the \nfloor the Workforce Investment Act--a bipartisan job training bill. \nLike our existing education system, the nation's job training programs \nwere top-down, Washington-controlled and funded programs infested with \nbureaucratic redtape. The WIA gutted the longstanding 1982 Job Training \nand Partnership Act, JTPA, and handed over years of federally \ncontrolled, prescriptive requirements to the states and localities. The \nStates were given the green light by us to create their own plans to \nadminister their own job training--teaching people the skills they need \nto make a living right on the local level.\n  I did not hear folks make the claims that this was a ``blank check'' \n2 years ago. Where were they then? How can we have a bipartisan bill \nthat overwhelmingly passed the Senate and handed the bulk of discretion \nover to States and local boards for teaching people job skills, but we \ncannot even think of doing the same for education. I will tell you why. \nIt is because the Washington establishment for job training does not \nhave Congress in a head-lock like the education establishment does. \nThat is why.\n  Theold adage, ``you can't teach an old dog new tricks'' sure has \nmeaning when the Washington establishment weighs in. Sure enough, \ncreativity and innovative means to education get chucked out the \nwindow. I will not allow such unfounded charges that mischaracterize \nthe underlying bill to go unchallenged.\n  There can be a legitimate debate, and should be, but my constituents \noverwhelmingly believe local control and local flexibility is a better \ncourse for American education.\n  I am very pleased with the underlying legislation with which the \nPresiding Officer had so much to do in the drafting, and Chairman \nJeffords showed such leadership in the committee. It is a bill on which \nwe can stand with pride. I do not want to trade in or exchange the \nfuture for the past. That is what this debate is coming down to.\n  The substitute that is being offered is a return to the past. The \nunderlying bill takes us in a new direction and pioneers new \nopportunities for American children. The vote on this substitute will \nbe: Do my colleagues want to turn back to the past or do they want to \ngo a new route or new direction for American education--a plethora of \nnew programs or a new way? That is the question before us.\n  I look forward, as we continue this debate, for the Senate, following \nthe lead of the American people, to say enough is enough; let's chart a \nnew path; let's put trust in those laboratories of democracy in the \nStates that have done such a marvelous job on welfare; let's give them \nthe same opportunities in education. We will look back,\n\n[[Page S3302]]\n\nas we look back on welfare, in a few years and say we did right by the \nAmerican people and, more importantly, the children of this country.\n  I again thank Senator Wellstone for his willingness to allow me to \nprecede him. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, it is amazing, I say with a twinkle in \nmy eye. I actually agree with my colleague from Arkansas on one thing: \nThis really is a debate about the future and the past. I just think he \nhas it mixed up as to which bill represents which.\n  I am looking at the people who are opposed to S. 2. I see the \nAmerican Association of School Administrators, American Federation of \nTeachers, Antidefamation League, Council of Great Cities Schools, \nLeadership Conference on Civil Rights, Mexican American Legal Defense \nFund, National Alliance of Black School Educators, National Asian \nPacific American Legal Consortium, National Association for the \nAdvancement of Colored People Legal Defense Fund, National Association \nof Elementary School Principals, National Association of Secondary \nSchool Principals, National Parent Teachers Association, National \nSchool Board Association.\n  What occurs to me--and I will try to say it differently than I said \nyesterday--is what we have is not bureaucratic or some top-down \nGovernment program, we have school board members; we have the PTA, \nparents, elementary school principals; we have high school principals; \nwe have teachers.\n  One can argue that all these organizations do not represent all of \nthe principals, all of the teachers, all of the school board members, \nand all of the parents in the country, but, with all due respect, they \nrepresent many of them. The reason my colleagues do not have any such \nsupport from the parents, the teachers, the school board members, and \nthe principals at the local level is because S. 2 is not connected to \nwhat it is people are asking us to do.\n  I will again talk about what my colleague from Arkansas was talking \nabout, which is past versus future. This is what they have for \naccountability. This is the sum total of the Republicans' \naccountability provision:\n\n       The Secretary shall renew the agreement for an additional \n     5-year term if, at the end of the 5-year term described in \n     subsection (a), or soon after the term is practicable, the \n     State submits the data required under the agreement and (2) \n     the Secretary determines on the basis of the data that the \n     State has made substantial progress--\n\n  Whatever in the world that is.\n  We turn back the clock 35 years. We abandon our commitment to poor \nchildren, to vulnerable children. We no longer have the specific \ncommitment to migrant children and homeless children. Then the \naccountability provision is we wait for 5 years to see what has \nhappened to these kids, and then the Secretary determines, on the basis \nof the data, whether or not the State has made ``substantial \nprogress,'' which is not defined. This is hardly what I call a very \nrigorous accountability standard.\n  My colleague from Arkansas talked about the Workforce Investment Act. \nI wrote that bill with Senator DeWine. I know something about that \nbill. Actually, it is a good example, but my colleague from Arkansas \nhas made the mistake of assuming this was just a crude block grant \nprogram. That is not what we passed. It was a good compromise. Yes, we \nwere able to go after some of the duplication and some of the \nbureaucracy. We also made sure there was a targeting and separate \nstream of funding for youth programs, for adult training programs, for \ndislocated worker programs, and I also think for veterans' programs.\n  When my colleague cites the Workforce Investment Act as an example of \nwhat we should be doing, it is precisely the opposite of what the \nmajority party has presented. I will say it one more time, and then I \nwill move on to a couple of other points in the positive. I first have \nto talk about what I am against, and then I have to talk about what I \nam for.\n  I am, as a Senator from the State of Minnesota, in agreement with the \nprincipals, school board members, the teachers, and the parents all \nacross the country who oppose this legislation, S. 2, in part because \nit is an abandonment of the good commitment we made as a nation to our \nmost vulnerable children. That, in and of itself, invites my \nopposition, and I believe it invites the opposition of most of the \npeople in the country.\n  Secondly, when I look at the accountability language in S. 2, with \nall due respect, it is inadequate at best. Frankly, there is nothing \nthere.\n\n  Now, my colleague is not on the floor now. Senator Brownback is \nsomeone I am working together with on a good bill that is going to be \ndealing with the trafficking of women and children for the purposes of \nforcing women and children into prostitution and forced labor. It is an \noutrage. We are working together. But my colleague and other colleagues \nhave said S. 2 is patterned after the welfare bill. He said: It has \nbeen a brilliant success, with the mothers working. And they are happy. \nPeople are working and happy.\n  For 2 years I have been trying to get a policy evaluation of what in \nfact is happening with the welfare bill. We do not know.\n  We know this. We have reduced the rolls by 50 percent.\n  We know this. We have barely reduced the poverty.\n  We know this. The vast majority of these mothers who are working have \njobs barely above the minimum wage.\n  We know this. Mr. President, 670,000 more American citizens, many of \nthem women and children, no longer have any medical coverage.\n  We know this. There has been a dramatic decline in food stamp \nparticipation.\n  We know this. The child care situation is dangerous. Many of these 2-\nyear-olds and 3-year-olds, with their single parent working, are at \nhome with someone who really should not be taking care of them or there \nare inadequate or downright dangerous child care situations.\n  We know all that. Can someone please give me the evidence for this \nbeing a great success?\n  We also know the Governors in the States are sitting on top of $7 \nbillion of TANF money, while the child care needs of these children--\npoor children--are not being met.\n  I have colleagues out here who are telling me that on the basis of \nwhat we don't know--and then on the basis of what we do know, which is \nthat it has been really quite brutal what has been happening--we should \nuse the TANF experience as the basis for moving toward this crude block \ngrant approach. It does not make a lot of sense.\n  As a matter of fact, some of our Governors have actually used the \nTANF money with a little bit of a budget gimmickry for tax cuts. Some \nof the States are being called on the carpet.\n  Would it surprise anybody here that not all this money is going to \npoor women and poor children? That is the point, colleagues. Please do \nnot bring that piece of legislation out here and say it is a brilliant \nsuccess and that people are working and happy when there is no \nempirical evidence to support that at all.\n  So my first point is, it is a great leap backwards.\n  My second point is, the accountability provision of the Republican \nplan is pathetic.\n  My third point is, when we talk about block granting and patterning \nit after the welfare bill, the TANF experience, there is not a shred of \nevidence to support that. Whatever evidence we have would make us very \nweary of doing so, especially if we are concerned about how poor and \nvulnerable children might fare.\n  My fourth point is, the Workforce Investment Act is a great example \nof a bipartisan approach. I was proud to write that bill with Senator \nDeWine. Why didn't we get an elementary and secondary education piece \nof legislation out here which was bipartisan? We would not have to have \nany of this debate.\n  Certainly, with the Workforce Investment Act, we did not abandon the \nidea that when it comes to certain groups of citizens, we make a \ncommitment, and we do not just go straight to a block grant with no \nstandards, no accountability, and no national priorities.\n  What will work is our alternative. My colleague from Arkansas took \noff after the Senator from Massachusetts--in a civil way; it is just a \ngood debate--and said: Clearly, the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKennedy, is\n\n[[Page S3303]]\n\nfor the status quo because he says we should focus on what works.\n\n  Honest to goodness, this is getting pretty nutty. That is what we \nshould do. If we know that good teachers make for good education, we \nhad better, I say to Senator Kennedy, focus on what works. If we know \nthat smaller class sizes make a real difference, we had better focus on \nwhat works. If we know that investing in crumbling schools makes a \ndifference in terms of building the morale of our children, we had \nbetter invest in what works. If we know that programs such as the \nEisenhower program for math and science, and other professional \ndevelopment programs, lead to good teachers and good teaching, then we \nhad better be investing our resources in this area.\n  Are my colleagues suggesting that actually we should invest in what \nwe don't know? Are they saying our priorities should reflect what we \ndon't know? Are they saying that because we have an alternative out \nhere which focuses on teacher quality, professional development, a \nteacher corps to get more teachers in low-income school districts and \nlow-income schools, class size reduction--I am sorry, I forgot parental \ninvolvement and investing in dilapidated schools, with some school \nconstruction money--all of which are priorities that the people in our \nStates ask us to please focus on, all of which are programs that have a \nproven record and work, all of which is the direction in which our \nconstituents tell us they want us to go, all of which is about good \neducation for children in our country--that we represent the status \nquo? If so, I want to be called the ``Status Quo Senator.''\n  But I will tell you something. If this is just a cute semantics \ndebate, I would rather be on the side of programs that work, I would \nrather be on the side of good policy, good public policy, than on the \nside of turning the clock back 35, 40 years to some crude block grant \nprogram where all of a sudden we abandon some key national commitments \nto the most vulnerable citizens and where we are, frankly, unwilling to \nmake the investment in the very decisive priorities and programs that \nwork and really make a positive difference in children's lives. That, \nto me, colleagues, is what this debate is all about.\n  Because my colleague from Wisconsin is out here, I will just take a \ncouple more minutes.\n  On the parental involvement, I have worked on this. We have been \ndoing some preliminary discussion. One of the things I have worked on \nis ways in which we can creatively use some of the nongovernmental \norganizations, community groups that have credibility with parents, to \nget them more involved. I am excited about that.\n  As long as we talk about welfare, I promise my colleagues, if this \nbill is out here for a while, I will have this policy evaluation. I am \ntelling you--I say this to Senator Jeffords from Vermont--we have to \nhave some honest policy evaluation of what, in fact, is happening \nbecause pretty soon we are going to be pushing everybody off the cliff. \nBy the year 2002 there isn't going to be any of this welfare assistance \nto any families. Let's know what is going on.\n  I will have an amendment that deals with counselors--if it is not \n100,000, then 50,000 more counselors--in the country. I tell you that \nwe can do a much better job. The ratio is about 1 counselor per 1,000 \nstudents. That does not work. We can do a much better job of having an \ninfrastructure of good counselors in our country that can make a real \ndifference for kids, especially kids who are at risk, especially kids \nwho are struggling with mental health problems. It is terribly \nimportant.\n  I will have an amendment that provides some support services for kids \nwho witness violence in their homes. If my wife Sheila were out here on \nthe floor, she would say: Paul, repeat the statistic again that every \n13 seconds a woman is battered in her home. Home should be a safe \nplace. These children see it. They come to school. They have not slept \nthrough the night. They are depressed. They act out. They are really \nstruggling.\n  I say to some of the pages, you can imagine what it would be like. I \npray it never happens to you. We need to get some support services to \nthose students.\n  I have several amendments that deal with the dicey and tricky \nquestion about whether or not we are just going to have standardized \ntests that hold kids back, as young as age 8, or whether or not we are \ngoing to: A, make sure these children have the same opportunities to \nsucceed and pass these tests; B, to take into account learning \ndisabilities or limited English proficiency before we start flunking 8-\nyear-olds in the country; and, C, whether or not we are going to take \ninto account the fact that everybody who works in this field says it is \nan abuse to rely just on one single standardized test.\n  Then finally, also, I am going to have an amendment that deals with \nurban education, Ed-plus, which is the counterpart to the rural \neducation initiative, all of which I am for. But we want to make sure--\nthis is what the Democratic alternative includes in it--this recognizes \nthe challenge facing urban schools and enables the urban schools to \nbuild on some of these programs with more resources. We need to do \nthat.\n\n  Mr. President, I conclude with what I think, frankly, is the \nstrongest part of my presentation. This is the accountability provision \nof S. 2. Wait 5 years and then the Secretary determines, on the basis \nof the data, that the State has made substantial progress. Substantial \nprogress is not even defined. We do a lot better.\n  Mr. President, the cargo in those yellow school buses is much more \nprecious than all the gold in Fort Knox. We can do better. We can do \nmuch better for our children, and our alternative does better for our \nchildren.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, Senator Dodd is to \nbe recognized at this time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, Senator Dodd is not present. I ask \nunanimous consent that I be recognized at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, following Senator Wellstone's excellent \nremarks on education, I want to speak on the bill before us. I rise to \nadd my thoughts to this important debate about the future of the \nFederal role in the education of America's children.\n  The Elementary and Secondary Education Act has shaped the Federal \nrole in public elementary and secondary education for 35 years. \nYesterday, we began the debate on a new 5-year reauthorization of this \nvital set of programs. This debate will also set the tone for the \nFederal role in education for the next 5 years and beyond.\n  The legislation that this Congress passes this year will affect \ntoday's first graders well into their middle school years, and will \ncarry today's eighth graders through to their high school \ncommencements.\n  We hold the future in our hands, Mr. President. It is our \nresponsibility to find the right balance between local control and \nFederal targeting and accountability guidelines for the federal dollars \nthat are so crucial to local school districts throughout the United \nStates.\n  Ninety percent of American children attend public schools. During the \n1998-1999 school year, the most recent year for which statistics are \navailable, more than 879,000 young people in my home State of Wisconsin \nwere enrolled in public education, from pre-school through grade \ntwelve. I am a graduate of the Wisconsin public schools, and my \nchildren have also attended them.\n  Mr. President, just a few short years ago the members of the other \nbody considered eliminating the federal Department of Education all \ntogether. Some tried to evoke the specter of a federal takeover of one \nof the basic responsibilities of local governments--the education of \nour children. But those voices have faded in recent years as the \nDepartment of Education, under the dedicated leadership of Secretary \nRichard Riley, has regained the confidence of the American people and \ndispelled the charge that it was out to usurp the authority of the \nlocal school districts and the states.\n  I am deeply concerned by the persistent calls by some in Congress and \nelsewhere for a drastically limited federal involvement in our \nchildren's education. While I strongly support maintaining local \ncontrol over decisions affecting our children's day-to-day classroom \nexperiences, I am concerned\n\n[[Page S3304]]\n\nabout the lack of appropriated targeting of funds and accountability \nfor results in the bill that is currently before the Senate.\n  Mr. President, the legislation before us today has generated vigorous \ndebate in my home state of Wisconsin. I have heard from parents, \nteachers, school board members, school administrators, school \ncounselors and social workers, state officials, and other interested \nobservers. And there is one central theme in their comments: The United \nStates Congress must not undermine the targeting and accountability \nmeasures that currently exist at the Federal level. These provisions \nare paramount to ensuring that no students are left behind and that all \nschools perform up to the standards set by the states and by local \nschool districts.\n  I have also heard from a number of my constituents that this Congress \nshould do nothing that would undermine all the good that the federal \ngovernment's support has helped the states and local school districts \nachieve in public education over the last several years, in areas \nincluding smaller class sizes, technology education, standards-based \nreform, and accountability for results.\n  The education community in my state is also deeply concerned--and I \nshare this concern--about provisions in this legislation that would \nshift scarce Federal dollars away from the public schools they are \nintended to support.\n  I fear that this disturbing trend toward block granting and vouchers \nwill further widen the educational divide in which too many of our \nstudents are caught. We need to focus our scarce resources on \nrebuilding and reforming our public schools, not on tearing them down.\n  I worry that this block grant and voucher-driven weeding-out process \nwill leave behind the most vulnerable students--those from low-income \nfamilies, those with special needs, those at-risk for dropping out, and \nthose with behavioral problems--those very students that title I was \ncreated to help. We cannot and must not abandon our most at-risk \nstudents in dilapidated schools with outdated textbooks and few \nresources. We can and must do better for all of our children. The \nanswer is not to funnel scarce resources away from the public school \nsystems that have served this country so well for so long.\n  And those who think vouchers will lead to real school choice are \nsadly mistaken. Private schools are already full to capacity and many \nhave extensive waiting lists. We cannot simply shift students from \npublic schools to private schools and think that all of the problems \nwill magically disappear.\n  Mr. President, we will hear a lot of terms batted back and forth \nduring this debate.--Accountability. Flexibility. Targeting. Parental \ninvolvement. Class size. Construction and maintenance. Teacher quality. \nProfessional development. After-school programs. Education technology. \nSchool choice. School reform.--These concepts are at the heart of this \ndebate. The question lies in how these terms are defined. I sincerely \nhope that the members of this body will be able to leave behind the \npartisan rancor that unfortunately pervaded the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee's consideration of this bill and come \ntogether to do what is best for all of our Nation's children.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to discuss some of my own \npriorities--and those of my constituents--for this important piece of \nlegislation: class size, targeting, professional development, music and \nthe arts, and the impact of this bill on preparation for post-secondary \neducation and entrance into the job market.\n  I regret that this bill as reported by the HELP Committee does not \ncontain the authorization for the funds necessary to implement the \nthird year of the President's initiative to reduce class size in the \nearliest grades. And I particularly regret that this commonsense \nproposal was defeated in committee on a straight party-line vote.\n  My home State of Wisconsin is a leader in the effort to reduce class \nsize in kindergarten through third grade. The Student Achievement \nGuarantee in Education program is a statewide effort to reduce class \nsize in kindergarten through third grade to 15 students.\n  The SAGE program began during the 1996-1997 school year with 30 \nparticipating schools in 21 school districts. Now in the program's \nfourth year, there are 78 participating schools in 46 school districts.\n  According to the recently-released program evaluation for the 1998-\n1999 school year, conducted by the SAGE Evaluation Team at the \nUniversity of Wisconsin--Milwaukee:\n  First grade students in SAGE classrooms statistically outperformed \ntheir peers in comparison schools in language arts, math, and total \nscores on the post-tests administered in May of 1999. And twenty-nine \nof the thirty top-performing classrooms for which two years of data \nwere available are SAGE classrooms.\n  Case studies conducted at three SAGE schools during the 1998-1999 \nschool year found that, ``individualization is made possible because \nhaving fewer students enables teachers to know students better, it \nreduces the need for teachers to discipline students, which results in \nmore time for instruction, and it increases teacher enthusiasm for \nteaching.''\n  The case study also found that: ``A product of individualization in \nreduced size classes in addition to academic development is student \nindependence, thinking, and responsibility.''\n  The results speak for themselves, Mr. President. Smaller classes \ntranslate to better instruction and better achievement.\n  I will support efforts to include this important program in this \nbill.\n  As I noted earlier, one of the things that my constituents have \nrepeatedly told me is that the targeting mechanisms that ensure that \nvital federal dollars reach those students who need them most are a \ncrucial part of any ESEA reauthorization. Time and time again, my \nconstituents have expressed opposition to any effort to block grant \ntitle I and other programs under ESEA.\n  Title I pays for supplementary educational services for economically \ndisadvantaged students, and those funds are targeted to the schools \nwith the highest concentrations of eligible students. During the \ncurrent school year, local school districts in my home State of \nWisconsin will receive more than $125 million in title I funding. \nAccording to the Department of Education, ninety-five percent of the \nnation's highest-poverty schools receive this vital title I funding.\n  I am deeply concerned about the so-called ``portability'' provisions \nin this bill, which would allow ten states and twenty local education \nagencies in other states to distribute their Title I money on a per-\npupil basis rather than to the schools with the greatest need. This \nfunding formula would allow parents to choose to use their child's \nshare of these ``portable grants'' for supplementary services at their \npublic school or for private tutoring services, which could be provided \nby private or religious schools.\n  This formula will all but ensure that those schools with the highest \nconcentration of poor children in the ten states and twenty districts \nusing the portable grants will no longer be able to count on this \ncrucial Title I support.\n  And this provision also raises serious constitutional questions about \nthe use of public funds for tutoring provided by non-public sources.\n  In addition, there is no clear way to determine accountability for \nthe success of those children whose parents opt for non-public tutoring \nservices.\n  I will support efforts to eliminate the portability language and \nensure that Title I funding continues to be targeted to the schools \nwith the highest concentrations of low-income students.\n  I have also heard a great deal about the importance of federal \ndollars for professional development for teachers, administrators, \nprincipals, and school counselors and social workers. We must do \neverything we can to ensure that teachers and other school \nprofessionals have access to the resources they need to continue their \nprofessional development. We often hear people say that we should \nencourage our children to become ``lifetime learners.'' We must also \nensure that those who educate our children have access to quality \nprofessional development programs that enhance their effectiveness and \ngive them access to the latest methods in teaching, administration, and \ncounseling.\n  In that same regard, we must ensure that our children have the \nopportunity to receive a well-rounded education\n\n[[Page S3305]]\n\nthat is both academically challenging and rich in opportunities to \nstudy music and the arts. I am deeply concerned that many school \nsystems around the country have decided to eliminate, or to severely \nscale back, their arts education programs. Research has shown that arts \neducation can help students to become better learners in all subject \nareas.\n  The arts given students the opportunity to express themselves in ways \nthat are distinct from those provided by the academic subjects. \nStudents learn valuable lessons including cooperation, hard work, \ndedication, and the desire to strive for excellence--lessons that will \nhelp them in other areas of their education and in other aspects of \ntheir lives.\n  We must do all we can to prevent local school systems from having to \nchoose between maintaining the arts as a vital part of their curriculum \nor building a new science lab. Both are important for our students, and \none should not have to be sacrificed to have the other.\n  Finally, Mr. President, we must ensure that high school graduates \nhave the skills they need to be successful adults, whether they choose \nto go on to college, technical school, the military, or into the job \nmarket.\n  I am pleased that the HELP Committee adopted an amendment offered by \nthe Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, which authorizes additional \nfunding to expand a very successful existing program which increases \naccess to Advanced Placement classes and exams. It is extremely \nimportant that we continue to strive to give all students, regardless \nof their economic status, access to these challenging academic courses.\n  And it is important that the Congress also help to provide the \nfinancial assistance that so many students need to continue their \neducation. For that reason, I will continue my efforts, along with the \nSenator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, and others, to increase the \nindividual maximum Pell Grant award by $400.\n  Mr. President, I wish to again remind my colleagues that this bill \ncurrently before us will affect 90 percent of the school-aged children \nin this country. While many of them have never even heard of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, they will feel the \nimpact of its pending reauthorization in their classrooms beginning \nnext fall. I welcome this important debate. I hope that we can produce \na truly bipartisan bill that will provide the financial assistance that \nour children deserve and the appropriate targeting and accountability \nmeasures that our states and local school districts continue to call \nfor. And I hope we will do this without creating a system of block \ngrants and back-door vouchers that will leave our most vulnerable \nchildren behind.\n  I thank the chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nof recognition be Senator Gorton, followed by Senator Dodd and Senator \nAshcroft, and then Senator Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, may we amend that for this side? The \norder on this side would be Senators Dodd, Kerry, Schumer, Harkin, and \nDorgan.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. We are trying to alternate.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. We will alternate, obviously, between the sides. But \nthat will be the Democratic speakers.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. That is fine.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The order on the Democratic side, obviously alternating \nwith the Republican side, would be Senators Dodd, Kerry, Schumer, \nHarkin, and Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. With the understanding that we will be intersecting in \nbetween with a Republican as announced.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair's understanding is that the speakers \nwill alternate starting with Senator Gorton in the order listed.\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this has been already a remarkably \nsubstantive debate, with, I think, a clear delineation of education \nphilosophies on each side.\n  The nature of the debate and the degree of heat that accompanies it \nhas, I think, obscured one overwhelmingly important factor; that is, \nwithout exception, the Members on either side of the aisle have \ngenuinely desired to improve the education system of the United States \nand desire a Federal participation that enhances that growth and that \nimprovement. This, of course, is a wonderful characteristic of the \ndebate where we are debating means and not ends.\n  As well, I hope, before the debate has concluded next week, or \nwhenever we complete it, there will have been a reaching across the \naisle that divides the two parties on proposals that do not unite \neveryone on both sides but at least will unite a sufficient number of \nRepublicans and Democrats so that the last vote we take will be a vote \non final passage of an education-related bill that can take the next \nstep toward reaching the goals in which all Members join. That is not \nto underestimate the differences between us.\n\n  I found the statement made by the Senator from Wisconsin to be \nparticularly eloquent, even as I disagreed with almost all of its \nparticulars. If I may be permitted to do so, I think I characterize the \ndifference as being a difference which relates primarily to our degree \nof trust and confidence in men and women for whom education is both a \nprofession and an avocation, men and women who spend their lives as \neducators, as teachers, as principals, and superintendents.\n  This debate also expresses a difference with respect to our trust and \nconfidence in parents to seek the best possible education for their \nchildren, and in those men and women who share with Members of the \nSenate the willingness to suffer the slings and arrows of political \ncampaigns often hotly contested but, in their case, running for \nmembership on school boards across the United States, most of whom, \nunlike us, are not compensated or paid for the job they undertake.\n  The real difference--and it is a difference--illustrated by the \nrelatively narrow two amendments before the Senate at the present time, \none relating to Straight A's and the Democratic alternative, is the \ndegree of trust and confidence we have in allowing those decisions to \nbe made by people who know the names of the children they teach.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin has set out in detail his priorities, the \nclear implication being in every single case that if we don't set these \nrequirements, the arts will be overlooked, underprivileged children \nwill be overlooked, teacher training will be overlooked; that some \namorphous blank check somehow or another will not be used for primary \neducation purposes.\n  I find it difficult to understand this kind of difference. After all, \nthe men and women who are voters in the United States, who voted for \nus, are the same voters who vote for these elected school board members \nwho, in turn, employ the professionals in education. Why is it they \nelect Senators who are sensitive to all of these needs and school board \nmembers who are not?\n  One of the two subjects before the Senate now is Straight A's. It \nisn't the Straight A's that I started out with, by any stretch of the \nimagination, either when I introduced it under that name more than a \nyear ago or when its precursor was voted on in this body some 3 years \nago. It is, among other things, only an experiment limited to 15 of the \n50 States in the United States of America. But for those 15 States, it \nsays essentially, we trust you. We trust the education authorities in \neach one of these 15 States not only to use the money as wisely as we \ndo in our categorical aid programs but more wisely.\n  However, in spite of the use of the phrase ``blank check,'' the check \nby no means is blank because in order to take advantage of Straight \nA's, in order to be one of these 15 States, the State must set up a \ntesting system, an achievement system that measures how well its \nstudents are doing, must propose and sign a contract that the \nachievement level will rise as a result of their being allowed to use \nthis experiment and that they risk losing this additional authority and \ntrust if they do not meet the commitments they make in that original \ncontract.\n\n[[Page S3306]]\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a few questions to explore what \nthe Senator has just said?\n  Mr. GORTON. For a brief period, yes. I do want to finish my remarks, \nbut go ahead.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator, and I will not be too long.\n  We have come here for several years in a row with this impasse. The \nSenator from Washington and I have met privately trying to have a \ndiscussion about how we could find a meeting of the minds. I certainly \ndon't question his desire to have kids in the United States educated.\n  Obviously, there is a difference between us, as he has said, in our \nconfidence in what may occur. As the Senator from Washington knows, \nwhen title I began back in 1965, for instance, it was a block grant. \nIndeed, in Memphis, TN, moneys were used to pay for swimming pools. In \nOxford, MS, moneys were used for cheerleading uniforms. In Macon \nCounty, AL, moneys were used for football uniforms. In Attala County, \nMS, two lagoons for sewage disposal were constructed with title I \nmoney.\n  The record of States not choosing to reduce class size or have \nafterschool programs or improve teacher quality is already there.\n  The question I ask the Senator, If everyone on his side is so willing \nto pass this bill with the notion there is a level of accountability \nthat they will put in place for improving education, why would they not \nbe willing to adopt a series of areas which we could all agree on to \nrepresent the top priorities in America for education, such as getting \nbetter teachers, improving teacher quality, having afterschool \nprograms? Isn't it possible to agree on a broad categorization that \ndoes not tell local districts how to do it, doesn't tie their hands to \none particular choice, but gives them a sufficient range of options? At \nleast we know the Federal dollar will not be subject to the kind of \nabuse it was once subjected.\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from Massachusetts could not have asked a \nbetter question. He does remind me of the fact that he and I, with a \nnumber of other Senators in both parties, have had, over the course of \nlast 2 or 3 years, a number of meetings in private to discuss whether \nor not we could reach just such an agreement.\n  We haven't reached it yet. That is obvious from our place on the \nfloor of the Senate at this point. As I think he knows, negotiations \ninvolving at least some Republicans and some Democrats with that goal \nin mind continue at the present time.\n  I think it is the nature of our common humanity that we don't usually \nreach agreements on controversial issues until we are at the point of \nhaving to make final votes on these issues. I have every hope that we \ncan.\n  In connection with the two proposals on the floor today, however, \nthey state our dramatically opposing philosophies. My answer to the \nspecifics of the question asked by the Senator from Massachusetts is \nvery simple. He, it seems to me, is examining a beetle stuck in amber, \na fossil from 35 years ago, with five examples out of 17,000 school \ndistricts today that he believes did not use money properly when they \ncould use it as they desired.\n  But we have had 35 years of experience since then, with increased \nFederal controls, increased Federal mandates, increased numbers of \nforms to be filled out. And they have not succeeded, in title I, in \nreducing the disparity between underprivileged students and the common \nrun of students who do not fall into that category. Yet we see the \nproposal on which we will vote later this afternoon, that side of the \naisle saying the problem is not that we have too many rules, we have \ntoo few, and, where we had 100 pages of regulations, we need 200 pages \nof regulations.\n  While we can all say we wish for our schools better teachers, more \nteachers, more computers, and a number of other items, what we see in a \nproposal of categorical aid is each school district needs so many more \nteachers, each school district needs so many more teacher training \nprograms, each district needs so many more hours of art instruction, \nfor example, rather than saying within these broad categories each \nschool district ought to be able to decide the balance among each of \nthose primary needs.\n  We also see, obviously, that there should be some form of \naccountability. We believe we have the ultimate form of accountability, \nthat in Straight A's, in that portion of this bill at least, we say the \nbottom line is: How well educated are your students after they finish \nthis program? Is there an objective measurement of their educational \nachievement? Has that improved? That seems to me to be a policy \naccountability against the process accountability we have required, \nincreasingly, in the course of the last several years.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I appreciate the answer.\n  I do not want to abuse the time because I know my colleagues are \nlined up to speak, but if I may ask further, I hear what the Senator is \nsaying, but the examples I chose are examples of when it was a block \ngrant. We changed the block grant precisely in order to obviate those \nkinds of examples. Bringing it to modern times, I know the Senator will \nagree with me that everyone in the Senate is not debating education \nbecause it is a nonissue in America.\n  No one would suggest that every Governor in this country is doing as \nwell as some other Governors in the country. No one would suggest--I am \nnot going to name States here--there are not some States that are light \nyears behind other States in what they are willing to adopt.\n  So even measured against the modern system, I agree with the Senator \nfrom Washington. Let's tear apart some of the bureaucracy. Let's rip \naway some of the layers and tiers, let's minimize the paperwork. But \nlet's guarantee we are working together in a more genuine fashion. The \nfact that we have bills on the floor that are, frankly, as far apart--\nthis is the first time in the eight times this bill has been to the \nfloor that there is as little bipartisan effort at this stage as there \nis this year, a time when education is far more important than it has \never been in the history of the country.\n  So I ask my colleague if it is not possible, if we somehow cannot \nfind a more reasonable middle ground where we achieve goals of both \nsides which are essentially to provide the best opportunities for our \nkids.\n  It seems to me, when you are looking at a 5-year period before you, \nin effect, measure what is happening, I am constrained to ask the \nSenator how that 5-year period helps a kid who goes into that \nfoundational stage of education, or even a high school student? You go \ninto freshman year and you are gone from high school before anybody has \nevaluated the program at the Federal level to make a judgment whether \nor not the Federal dollar is being well spent.\n\n  Surely the accountability mechanism in the Democratic alternative \ncannot be that unappealing to those on the other side who want to give \nlocal administrators power but at the same time be more responsible for \nthe Federal dollar. I wonder why it is, in fact, so unacceptable, \nmeasured against a 5-year block of time where nothing takes place.\n  Mr. GORTON. I repeat the first half of my answer to the Senator from \nMassachusetts. I believe there are efforts--I hope he is a part of \nthose efforts; I can assure him this Senator is--to reach just such an \nagreement in which each side would accommodate to some of the highest \npriorities of the other side, whether they are substantive or \nprocedural with respect to accountability.\n  But I think the reason the differences are so great as against what \nthey were 5 years ago, or 10 years ago, is that, if I may say so, on \nthis side of the aisle there is a greater recognition that we are on a \ndead-end street, that 35 years of the kind of programs with increasing \nrules and regulations that have led us to this point simply have not \nworked. There is a greater disposition over here to say, at least in \nsome States we ought to allow people to do something radically \ndifferent from what they have before them.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is 100-percent correct. Some States \nare far ahead of others, even with the degree to which their hands are \ntied by present Federal regulations. My profound fear is, if we allow \neven more differentiation, the next time we come to renew this act, we \nwill have a far better understanding of what works in the real world \nand what does not work in the real world.\n  What I wanted to say, not only in connection with Straight A's but in\n\n[[Page S3307]]\n\nconnection with title I portability, in connection with the Teachers' \nEmpowerment Act, in connection with the Performance Partnership Act \nthat comes to us from the Governors, that is a part of this bill, and \nof course in connection with Straight A's, none of these experiments, \nor these changes of direction, is mandated on any State of the 50 \nStates in the United States of America. Any State education authority, \nany State legislature that does believe it is making more progress or \nwill make more progress with essentially the present system--tweaked a \nlittle bit--is completely free to do so. Only 15 States can take \nStraight A's. I think at present only 10 States can take title I \nportability, plus a few other school districts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will have more to say. I thank the \nSenator for interrupting his remarks. My colleague has been waiting a \nlong time. My only comment is that Ed-Flex was passed. It allows \nradical departures. And very few Governors have even taken advantage of \nthe Ed-Flex that we passed. We need to look at the reality of what is \nhappening. I thank the Senator very much for his engaging in this \ndialog and thank my other colleagues for their patience.\n  Mr. GORTON. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from \nMassachusetts. I do think they lent clarity to the debate in which we \nare engaged at the present time. I am fairly close to the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  Again, it is essential for both Members and the public to understand \nthat we are not mandating a change in the Federal system. We are \nenabling a change in the Federal system. We are enabling a combination \nof three or four or five changes in the Federal system. If I find any \nproposition difficult to understand, it is the proposition that somehow \nor another we know so much more about the subject than do the Governors \nand legislators of the various States, the elected school board \nmembers, and the full-time school authorities in 50 States and 17,000 \nschool districts across the United States of America.\n  It is true that the virtue of humility is more highly praised than \npracticed. No place is that more true than it is here in the Senate. \nBut it does seem to me that a little bit of humility about these \neducation policies is very much in order here, a little bit more trust \nand confidence reposed in the people who devote their entire lives to \nthis field of education--something that we do not.\n  The comments of the Senator from Massachusetts were very well placed \nand very thoughtfully stated. By the time we reach the end of this \ndebate, I hope we will be in a position that we simply will not have \nall members of one party voting one way and all the members of the \nother party voting the other way. I hold that to be a very real \npossibility.\n  In the meantime, it is vitally important to make clear the \ndistinction between those with all the eloquence of the previous \nspeaker from Wisconsin whose goals I totally share but whose means I do \nnot share at all, who sets out what he thinks are priorities the \nCongress is better able to set, not in general terms but in very \nspecific terms, for every school district across America.\n  Our view is that we seek a better educated populace in the 21st \ncentury, children better prepared to deal with the marvelously complex \nchallenges of that century by allowing our schools the greater right to \ninnovate, a greater right to meet these challenges than we grant them \nat the present time.\n  The current manager of the bill and I represent the same State. While \nwe disagree on these issues, we agree on the wonderful innovative \nthings going on in the State of Washington at the present time. I \nsimply wish to grant more scope to that innovation. I hope my State \nwill be among the 15 because I trust the educators in my State and \nschool board members in my State to make the right decisions about \ntheir children and about their schools.\n  I must say, I have no less confidence than the people who hold those \npositions in the State of the Presiding Officer across my eastern \nborders, or, in that case, the State of Massachusetts represented by my \ngood friend. There at least is the debate. For tomorrow, I hope we have \na greater degree of accommodation which does and must retain this \ndegree of added authority, added trust, and added confidence in our \nschool authorities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I see a number of my colleagues. I know time \nis running along before the first vote will occur. I will try to move \nalong and not delay my remarks or be repetitive.\n  Unfortunately, there are some significant distinctions between the \nalternative and what is being proposed in S. 2. I always think it is \nworthwhile to lay some basic facts before our colleagues, which I have \ndone in the past, but I believe it deserves repeating.\n  Fifty-three million children every day go to an elementary school or \nhigh school in America. About 48 or 49 million of the 53 million walk \nthrough the doors of public schools in all 50 States and territories of \nthe United States; about 4 to 5 million go to a nonpublic school in \nAmerica. Our principal responsibility is how do we improve the quality \nof public education in the United States.\n  We spend less than one-half of 1 percent of the entire Federal budget \non elementary and secondary education. I expect that comes somewhat as \na surprise to the majority of Americans that we spend even less on the \neducation of 90 to 95 percent of all children in the United States than \nwe do on foreign aid, and more speeches are given on education on a \nweekly basis than any other subject matter. Most of those speeches \nbegin with how nothing is more important to the well-being and future \nof our Nation than the education of our children. Yet less than one-\nhalf of 1 percent of the entire Federal budget is spent on improving \nthe quality of education for America's children. The rest of the \neducation money comes from our local communities and States.\n  We are not much of a partner when it comes to the education of \nAmerica's children. I do not think the question is whether we are doing \ntoo much. I happen to subscribe to the notion we are not doing much at \nall. Of the entire education budget, the Federal government provides 7 \npercent--a little less--of the total dollars spent on education. \nNinety-three percent comes from our States and communities. We are \ninvolved with 7 percent of that education budget, less than one-half of \n1 percent of the entire Federal budget of the United States.\n  We really do not do much for education. We decided 35 years ago that \nit would make sense to at least try to do something about the poorer \nschools in America. Why? Simply, we came to the realization that on a \nState-by-State basis, there was not a great allocation of resources to \nthe poorest schools, both urban and rural. In fact, States were \nspending about 60 cents, 63 cents on poor children. With our 7 cents on \nthe dollar, we spend about $4.50 on poor children as opposed to the \nGovernors across the country.\n  We tried to target these resources to those areas, a rifle shot into \nthe areas we thought might do the most good to make a difference. It \nhas been said over and over this afternoon that, in 1965, they began \nwith the idea of turning over a bunch of money--basically a block grant \nto the States--and said: Get this money back to those poor communities.\n  As my colleagues just heard from our colleague from Massachusetts and \nothers, the track record of what happened to those dollars was abysmal, \nit was embarrassing, it was scandalous. Money that was supposed to go \nto these poorer schools to improve the quality of education went, in \ncase after case, to anything but that. So we decided collectively--\nagain not in any partisan way--that we ought to come up with a better \nidea of getting the resources into these tough nonperforming schools in \nrural America and urban America.\n  We began the process targeting dollars. That is where we are today. \nWhat is the difference between what has been offered by the \ndistinguished minority leader, Senator Daschle, and others and what is \nthe underlying bill?\n  First and foremost is this notion of block grants. It is a big \ndifference, unfortunately. I wish it were not. I wish we could work out \nsome differences, but apparently that is not possible, despite efforts \nover weeks and weeks to iron out the differences.\n  What is the difference? A block grant is turning a large sum of money \nover to\n\n[[Page S3308]]\n\nthe Governors, which is what the underlying bill does, with the hopes \nthe Governors are then going to transfer those resources to the local \ncommunities.\n  We, on the other hand, think that we are better off targeting those \ndollars directly back to the local community. Why? We happen to know--\nmy good friend from Missouri is a former Governor--too often when the \npolitical debates occur in the State legislatures, it is hard. \nSometimes the poorest areas do not have the political muscle to get the \nnecessary resources. It is basically a revenue sharing program. They \nfight over scarce dollars even at the State level. They end up not \ndoing what I know my colleagues who advocate block grants want to \nhappen.\n  The fact is, in too many States, those dollars end up going off in \ndifferent directions. As a result, we do not have any accountability. \nWe are the ones who said you do it at the State level, you identify the \nneeds, you come up with a plan, and at the end of 5 years, we will \ndetermine whether or not, based on your criteria, you have done it. \nThat is hardly what I call a tough accountability standard when it \ncomes to tracking the 7 cents on the dollar that we are providing for \nelementary and secondary education.\n  We came up with an alternative to S. 2, the underlying bill. Who \nopposes the underlying bill? We do, the Senator from Massachusetts, \nmyself, and the Senator from Washington, but that is not terribly \nrelevant. Also opposing it is the Council of Chief State School \nOfficers, the National Association of Elementary School Principals, the \nNational Association of Secondary School Principals, the National \nParent-Teachers Association, and the National School Board Association.\n  Who do my colleagues think these people are? Put aside the teachers' \nunions everybody gets fired up about. What about the locally elected \nschool boards? Does anyone think they know anything about education?\n  Are they blind to all of this? Are parent-teacher associations some \nlittle special interest groups off in a corner that are trying to \nsqueeze out some dollars for themselves? These are the people we \nrepresent. These principals, these school boards, these PTAs, they are \nsaying this underlying bill is a bad idea. We are just giving voice to \ntheir concerns, identifying what they have said are the reasons to \noppose this, and finding the common ground that will allow us to \ndevelop a program. We try to do this with the alternative which we will \nvote on shortly. It will get these scarce dollars to the areas that \nneed them the most.\n  In a sense, what we are doing with S. 2 is walking away from the \npartnership, as limited a partnership as it is, with the scarce dollars \nwe provide. We are now going to walk away from that. We are saying to \nthese local communities: You do not know what you are talking about, \nthe things you told us that you thought would work that we tried to \nincorporate.\n  Our good friends on the other side of the aisle are saying: Those \nschool board members, those PTA members, those school principals, they \ndo not know what they are talking about. We know best. I respectfully \nsuggest that is a certain sort of arrogance.\n  Our bill requires and depends upon what we are getting from the local \nofficials who know what they are taking about and have asked us to \napproach this problem in the way we have offered here today.\n  Under the plan offered by our colleagues on the other side, as I \nmentioned a moment ago, the Governors would identify ``educational \npriorities''--that is a quote from the bill--and over the next 5 years \nspend Federal funds on those ``priorities\" without any accountability \nfor results. We go 5 years? And then we get some sort of accountability \nback?\n  Governors would also be able to reallocate dollars. There would be no \ntargeting of resources. This is ludicrous. Given what we know from the \nGeneral Accounting Office, States provide an additional 63 cents, I \nmentioned earlier, for each poor student. That is the history--63 cents \nfor every poor child in the State. The Federal Government provides \n$4.70 or more. So we block grant a lot of what we are talking about \nhere. Again, given the track record of our States in reaching these \npoor communities, it does not happen.\n  Block grants also weaken the focus on key areas of national \npriorities and obligations. Does anyone really think--we have all been \naround politics long enough. How vibrant a constituency do you think \nhomeless children are? Tell me about the lawyers they hire. What \npolitical action committee do homeless or migrant children have? Does \nanyone know of a political action committee that raises money for \nhomeless kids or migrant kids or title I kids? I do not know of any. \nYet we are saying we are going to block grant these dollars for migrant \nchildren and homeless children, and we will leave it there in the State \ncapitals. And don't worry, it is going to get to them. There is no \ntrack record of that at all. In fact, the track record tells us a \ncompletely different story. The track record says it does not get to \nthem.\n  If we truly care about what our mayors and our school boards and our \nPTAs are saying in these communities where these kids live, they have \nasked us to follow a pattern that allows these dollars to go directly \nto them. This shouldn't be any great revelation.\n  I do not claim any one State is necessarily better than another. The \nfact is, if you are a homeless kid or a migrant kid or a poor kid or a \ntitle I kid, the likelihood that you are going to end up getting your \nshare of the $1 is pretty small. We recognize that here. The school \nboards recognize it. The PTAs recognize it. That is why they oppose \nwhat is in S. 2.\n  Don't believe me. Don't believe my colleagues who have stood up and \nargued for this. Listen to the voices of the people who come from your \nStates. It is the PTAs and the school boards that are saying: Get this \nmoney directly back to us.\n\n  Our bill acknowledges and supports key national priorities and \npriorities for parents. We know our involvement is limited; as I said, \n7 cents out of a dollar that is spent on education. But we try to \nleverage those dollars to national needs. So our 7 cents actually, in \nmany cases, leverages a bit more of local or State dollars in these \nareas.\n  National priorities: We do not make up the list of national \npriorities. This was not somehow drafted in a back room here or in the \nDemocratic National Committee or the office of the minority leader.\n  Class size, school infrastructure, educational technology: go back to \nany community you reside in in America and ask whether or not those are \nimportant issues. You will hear your constituents say that they are. \nFor the millions of kids who go to public school every day, the \nteachers will tell you, particularly in serving disadvantaged kids \nwhere these problems are huge, that class size, technology and the key \nissues.\n  I have often cited to my colleagues in my home State of Connecticut--\nwe are a small State. I look around the room. There are a lot bigger \nStates geographically represented here. Our State is 110 miles by 60 \nmiles. San Diego County is bigger than my State graphically. We are \nalso the most affluent State in the United States on a per capita \nincome basis. I could take you to communities in my State that are just \namazing in terms of what my local communities provide for in terms of \nan educational opportunity for children. Public schools, almost compete \nwith college campuses in terms of language labs, computers, and the \nlike.\n  I know of one such community that ought to be a model for what every \npublic high school ought to look like in America. In 16 minutes or \nless, I can drive you from that school to an inner-city school in \nBridgeport, CT, Fairfield County--for those familiar with my State, \nthey know Fairfield County is a very affluent corner of my State. But \nin 16 minutes, I can take you from that school to a school where there \nare about four computers for the entire student body, cops on every \ncorner, and teachers that have 20, 25, 30 students in a classroom.\n  So I have two constituents--high school students--living 16 minutes \napart from each other with hugely varied educational opportunities, and \nmy State does a pretty good job.\n  We provide the exact same salaries for teachers who teach in \nBridgeport or some other area. But there is a great disparity. We \nwrestle with that in my State.\n  What we are saying with this bill, or trying to say, is that back in \nthat community--I am not going to be able to\n\n[[Page S3309]]\n\nmake it absolutely equal, but I would like to get some resources into \nthat school.\n  You have to trust your good Governors. The Governor of my State and I \nare friends, who are in different parties. I like John, and my State \nlegislature. But too often I know what happens. When it comes down to \nmy inner cities, they just do not do quite as well. Those homeless and \nmigrant kids, those poor kids, do not have the clout, and, too often, \nthey do not get the resources.\n  So what we are saying with our alternative is we want to get those \nresources back into those communities to leverage those dollars.\n  Let me just briefly touch on teachers, if I can, and then wrap up. \nThere are a lot of other areas to talk about. I know my colleagues want \nto talk about them.\n  Teachers are critical, we all know that, for success in schools. I \ncome from a family of teachers. My father's three sisters taught for 40 \nyears apiece in the public schools of Connecticut, one of them a \nFulbright scholar. My own sister has taught for almost 30 years, \nteaching in the largest inner-city elementary school in my State--Fox \nElementary School. My brother was a professor at the university level. \nI hear from him.\n\n  Teacher quality is critical. I think all of us agree on that. There \nis no debate about the importance of teacher quality. But consider, if \nyou will, what these two proposals provide. I have already explained \nthe difference in the block grants and how to get direct funding back \ninto our communities in a targeted way. Let me just point out the \ndifference on teacher quality programs in these two proposals that are \nbefore us.\n  The Democratic alternative which has been offered, provides $2 \nbillion to help schools recruit and retain high-quality teachers and \nincludes an accountability provision to make sure all teachers are \nfully qualified.\n  Specifically, we require States to have a qualified teacher in every \nclassroom by the fourth year after enactment of this bill--a specific \nrequirement, an accountability standard. We will be able to see whether \nor not we have achieved it. The alternative that we propose would \nguarantee that communities receive substantial funds to recruit \nqualified teachers, provide qualified mentors for new teachers, provide \nprofessional development for teachers, and hold schools accountable for \nthe results in that area.\n  We currently spend $330 million on professional development. The \nRepublican proposal to the alternative ignores this and only requires a \nportion of the $330 million be spent on these activities. If you want \nto have teacher quality, you have to invest in it. It does not happen \nmiraculously. Our bill takes funds directly to $2 billion.\n  Under the committee proposal, you cut back on the $330 million we \nalready have, and provide only a portion of those dollars to go for \nteacher quality. To contrast our proposal with the underlying plan in \nS. 2, they block grant all of the funds for teacher quality. And then \non top of that, it block grants the block grant by making it subject to \nthe Straight A's--a block grant on top of a block grant for teacher \nquality. Again, you are going to write a check for the Governors and \nyou are going to say to get teacher quality up in these areas. We all \nknow what happens. Too often, those dollars don't end up going where \nthey ought to go in these communities--targeted dollars, focusing on \nteacher recruitment and professional development or a block grant on a \nblock grant for teacher quality.\n\n  We say you have to have a school with qualified teachers in each \nclassroom in the fourth year of this bill. There is nothing in S. 2 \nrequiring that at all--nothing. How do you get accountability following \na block grant on a block grant? Where do I go to get the answer for \nthat?\n  The amendment we are proposing--the substitute--offers real \naccountability. Our bill requires States to adopt tough accountability \nstandards for all schools--one system, not separate systems. The \nunderlying bill says you have accountability standards for title I \nschools and another accountability standard for non-title I schools. \nThat is a nightmare. Talk about creating some inherent discrimination \nin the process where you have accountability standards for one set of \nschools and then a separate one for others. That doesn't make sense. \nOur bill requires States to adopt tough accountability standards. If \nall children are going to learn to high standards, as required, then \nlet's subject all schools to the same high expectations.\n  We also call for a real step toward accountability requiring school \nreport cards. This will give the public and parents the information \nthey need to hold schools accountable. Where those schools fail, we \nsend in a new staff, new people to operate them at the first \nopportunity. If that doesn't work, we create charter schools, and if \nthat doesn't work, we shut them down. What does S. 2 do? S. 2 says at \nthe end of 5 years you have to sort of report back to us and let us \nknow whether or not the schools have met the State standard and what \nthey consider to be a high degree of performance. Under the Republican \nproposal, you wait 5 years for accountability. I don't know how, with a \nstraight face, you call that accountability. That is not what the \nAmerican public expects with accountability. They want a higher \nstandard than that.\n  Lastly, our amendment responds to calls made by parents for help \nafter school. The provision in this bill that calls for the 21st \ncentury learning community centers started out as a $1 million program \n5 or 6 years ago. As a result of demand from our school districts, that \nprogram has gone to a $500 million afterschool program in 5 years.\n  Our proposal has schools working with community-based organizations, \nsuch as the Boys and Girls Clubs and other organizations, to develop an \nafterschool program for an additional 2.5 million kids in this country. \nFive million children every day, right about at this time--on the east \ncoast at least--parents go through the anxiety of wondering where their \nkids are. Ask a local police chief what hours they worry the most about \nwhere kids are involved, and they will tell you between 2:30 and 6:30 \nin the afternoon, not after 11 o'clock at night. This is the dangerous \nperiod.\n  We have an afterschool period here where we put a billion dollars \ninto after school--up from a $500 million--to expand that idea, so \npeople have some security or a sense of confidence that their children \nare being taken care of. The Republican proposal is status quo on after \nschool. We have to do better than that. This is one of the ways we can \nimprove the quality and the safety of children, which parents worry \nabout.\n  The two words ``status quo'' have been tossed around a lot in the \nlast few days. I happen to think that is where the big difference is. \nWe offer an alternative which is anything but the status quo. It is \nanything but that. I am so saddened, Mr. President. I have been on this \ncommittee for 20 years. I have never been in a situation where we \ndidn't work out amendments together and craft a bill that was still \nsubject to amendment on the floor. It was a bipartisan approach.\n\n  Education ought not to be an ideological debate. It is turning into \nthat. My constituents don't walk up to me and talk to me about block \ngrants and categorical programs, or about all these fancy formula \nissues that people talk about. They want to know whether or not you are \nworking together with local people and trying to make a difference. \nNone of us have a silver bullet here. None of us can say with total \ncertainty what works or doesn't work. But we know, based on experience, \nparticularly the experience of those who, day in and day out, dedicate \ntheir lives to the education of children, those who serve on our local \nschool boards, those who serve on the Parent-Teacher Associations, \nthose people who have become principals and teachers in schools.\n  Are we trying to demonize these people. These teachers are ``evil'' \nsomehow, or they don't care about the kids. In the 30 years my sister \nhas taught--she is blind, by the way, from birth--she has dedicated her \nlife to education, when other options were available to her. She cares \ndeeply about what happens to the kids she teaches. She tries to come up \nwith better ideas each year on how to make it work better. Her \nexperience is duplicated over and over again in community after \ncommunity. To suggest somehow that school boards and PTAs and \nprincipals and teachers such as my sister don't give a damn about the \nkids is just wrong.\n  Our bill reflects their priorities, their ideas, and it is anything \nbut status\n\n[[Page S3310]]\n\nquo. I am saddened that we haven't been able to find common ground to \nlisten to them and craft a piece of legislation here in the waning days \nof this session of the Congress--a bill that will have to survive for \nthe next 6 years and will address these concerns.\n  Our schools are in trouble, and we ought not allow this to become so \npoliticized that we can't come up with some common answers on how to \naddress their needs. I urge adoption of the alternative and of some \namendments that will be offered later on. Listen to the PTAs and the \nschool boards. Listen to the principals. We give voice to their agenda. \nThat is why they oppose the underlying bill. They oppose it. I oppose \nit but, more important, they oppose it. That is why the alternative is \na far better idea. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to address \nthe important issues we are facing today regarding education. I admire \nthe passion with which my colleague from Connecticut has spoken. I \nsimply come to a different conclusion. I think that if we really admire \nthose individuals who work at the local level, we won't distrust them \nto allocate the resources for their children in their communities, to \nmake good decisions about how the moneys are spent. That is a real \ncontrast to what we have had for quite some time.\n  I wish to give a few examples about how Federal education program \nrequirements eat up resources and they consume a disproportionate \namount of the time that States and schools spend on administration. You \nsee, when my constituents come to talk to me, they don't ask me about \nthe process. They are asking me about the product. They are asking me \ncan the students read? Can they spell? Can they compute? Can they \nreason? They want to be focused on student achievement. They don't want \nto be focused on whether the money is going to the State or whether the \nmoney is going to the Federal bureaucracy. They want something to \nhappen at the end of the process that changes the lives of individuals.\n  As we get into a culture that is more and more technically oriented, \nthe need for education is elevated more and more. In fact, we need to \nmake sure that the money not only gets to the local level, but when it \ngets there, it can do something of value. And we have a couple of big \nproblems with our current situation. They are primarily these:\n  No. 1, we may get the money to the local level, but only what is left \nof it after the Federal government and the State bureaucracies consume \nit with their bureaucratic redtape. So there is a small stream, a very \nanemic flow, that goes to the local community.\n  No. 2, when we finally get it there, we are frequently telling people \nat the local community that they have to spend it for something the \nlocal community knows isn't really very important.\n  Very few of us would want to get our help, for instance, medically, \nfrom someone who was 1,000 miles away and who didn't know anything \nabout our condition. We would want someone who could examine us to find \nwhere our problems are and direct a therapy to address those problems. \nFederal programs from 1,000 miles away designed to make things uniform \nfrequently don't work, and it is because the conditions are different \nin each community.\n  My colleague from Connecticut boasted of Connecticut's ability to \nprovide uniform salaries for teachers. Then he talked about how \nunsuccessful it was to have the same salary in one place that you have \nin another place because the conditions are different. Maybe we should \nconclude something based on that--that uniformity may not be the \nanswer. Maybe we should conclude that we should give individuals an \nopportunity to tailor, to adjust, to refine, and to define the resource \nand its application so that we could have a cause and effect, which is \nwhat we are looking for.\n  What is it we are looking for? We are looking for an elevated \nclassroom capacity. We are looking for an elevated human capacity. We \nare looking for students who can read, write, spell, decipher, add, \nsubtract, multiply, and divide. That is what we want from our schools. \nThat isn't really different from the culture at large.\n  We have passed the century of mass products. Henry Ford was the \nmaster of mass production in the 1930s. He said, ``You can have your \nFord any color you want it so long as it is black.'' He had the best \nidea, and a centrally driven idea that everybody would drive the same \ncolor car. The problem was that 10 years later, after he had 75 percent \nof the automotive market, he had 50 percent of the automotive market, \nand he began to understand that it wasn't appropriate to try to tell \neverybody what they wanted or what their needs were. He changed his \nslogan. Instead of, ``You can have your Ford any color you want it so \nlong as it is black,'' he just shortened it to say, ``You can have your \nFord any color you want it''--because he knew he had better meet the \nneed.\n  It is time for us to stop saying you can have your education any \ncolor you want it so long as it is bureaucratic. It is time for us to \nsay we want to help you elevate the capacity of students. We are not \ninterested in bureaucracy. We are not interested even in bureaucracy at \nthe State level. We are interested in students. We are interested in \nclassrooms. We are not interested in interest groups. We want to \nelevate the capacity of students.\n  Listen to what has happened in the Federal Government. The Federal \nDepartment of Education requires over 48.6 million hours worth of \npaperwork every year in order for people to receive Federal dollars. \nThat is the equivalent of 25,000 employees working full time. That is a \nreal cost--25,000 full-time equivalents just processing Federal \npaperwork. There are more than 20,000 pages of applications States must \nfill out to receive Federal education funds each year.\n  The Department of Education brags that its staff is one of the \nsmallest Federal Government agencies with only 4,637 people. State \nagencies, however, have to employ nearly 13,400 FTEs, full-time \nequivalents with Federal dollars to administer the myriad of Federal \nprograms. That doesn't always reflect the total that is necessary at \nthe local level. Hence, there are nearly three times as many federally \nfunded employees at State education agencies administering Federal \nprograms as there are U.S. Department of Education employees.\n\n  I think we need to be thinking carefully about getting the resources \nto the students. We are facing a situation today in the United States \nof America where more than half of all the employees in public \neducation are outside the classroom. No wonder people are wondering \nwhether or not we are getting a return on our investment.\n  Where do we want to focus our investment? Do we want to feed the \nbureaucracy and build the bureaucracy, or do we want to fund the \nclassroom and elevate student performance? We have to look carefully at \nthat.\n  In the State of Florida, it takes 374 employees to administer $8 \nbillion in State funds. It takes almost 400 to do $8 billion in State \nfunds. For the $1 billion in Federal funds, it takes almost 300 \nemployees. Basically, there are six times as many hours required to \nadminister one dollar of Federal funds as there are hours required to \nadminister one dollar of State funds. That puts us in a situation where \nthere is a lot of money being spent on administration trying to make \nsure we have complied with all of the Federal requirements and working \nto satisfy the Federal mandate instead of working to educate the \nchildren.\n  I submit that we ought to look at these statistics. We find that it \nis not surprising that the Federal bureaucratic maze consumes up to 35 \npercent of Federal education dollars. These Federal programs and their \nrequirements take away not only precious dollars, but they take up \nvaluable teacher time.\n  I don't think there is much question about what we want. I don't \nthink this is a partisan issue. All of us in the end want students to \nbe able to achieve. The educational system is not for the bureaucracy. \nIt is not for Washington. It is not for the State capitals. It is not \nfor making people fill out forms to comply with Federal rules. Clearly, \nwe can't afford for this trend to continue. We need to change our \nFederal policies to ensure a more efficient use of our Federal \nresources.\n\n[[Page S3311]]\n\n  I would be pleased to yield to the manager on my side for a comment \nor unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the votes \noccur on or in relation to the amendments in the order in which they \nwere offered beginning at 6 p.m., with the time between now and then to \nbe equally divided in the usual form. I further ask unanimous consent \nthat no second-degree amendments be in order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, a recent example of an inflexible \nmandate is the $1.2 billion earmarked exclusively for classroom size \nreduction for early elementary grades. That is a noble aspiration--\nlower classroom size. You can pursue a noble aspiration into a dead end \nor make a noble aspiration a financial misallocation.\n  Last year, Governor Davis of California described how the \ninflexibility of this initiative is hindering his State's ability to \ndirect Federal funds to areas where the need is the greatest. While the \nFederal initiative requires funds to be used to reduce class size to 18 \nin the first three grades, in California they have already reduced \nclass size to near that target in grades K through 4.\n  Governor Davis put it this way. He said of those Federal funds which \nare earmarked for an area where he has pretty much achieved the desired \ngoal, that the goal to best serve the State's needs is to reduce class \nsize in math and English in the 10th grade.\n  Of course, it is kind of hard to see that from Washington DC. But the \nGovernor has a pretty good shot at understanding that if he has the \nclass size problem under control in grades K through 4, and he really \nhas a desperate need to reduce class size in the different area, he \nshould be able to allocate those funds in that direction.\n  He put it this way: We need to have the flexibility to apply those \nresources where we think they could best be used.\n  A lot has been made about the potential for politics at the State \nlevel.\n  The eloquent speaker, the Senator from Connecticut, talked about how \nthat might contaminate decisionmaking. Frankly, I think that the \nability to hit the target from close up is usually far better than the \nability to hit the target from long range.\n  When we talk about helping our children learn and helping them \nachieve elevated capacities in terms of the fundamentals necessary, \nStates and local schools need the flexibility to spend money in the way \nthey see fit to improve education.\n  Knowing the kinds of misallocations that have come, up to 35 percent \nof the resource being lost in the bureaucratic nightmare of \nregulations, the tens of thousands of full-time equivalents designed to \nsupervise to make sure you spend the money in the way the Federal \nGovernment says it should be spent, in spite of the fact that might \ntotally miss the needs of the student, we need to change things. We \ncan't keep going in the same direction.\n  They used to joke when I was a kid when someone asked for directions. \nSomeone else would say: Any road will get you there so long as you \ndon't care where you are going. My grandfather used to say: I have \nsawed this board off four times, and it is still too short. If you are \nnot succeeding, think about changing. The industrialist put it this \nway: Your system is perfectly designed to give you what you are \ngetting. If you don't like what you are getting, think about changing \nit.\n  What are we getting? We are getting a poor return on our investment. \nIt is wrong for America to have an output from its educational effort \nthat is at the bottom of the industrialized nations. We can't keep \nsawing this board off. It is too short. We can't just take any road to \nget us there because we know we have a destination that is important. \nWe can't afford to be taking the wrong road.\n  It is important to put people who are there on the spot, to see what \nthe needs are. I say it this way: I want someone who knows the names of \nthe students and the needs of the schools making the decisions. That is \nwhat is important. I want people who will live or die by the decisions, \nnot someone from 1,000 miles away.\n  I believe there is a lot of common ground here. People talk about \ngetting money to the local level. It doesn't do any good to get it \nthere and then tie the hands of the people at the local level, or send \nthe money to the school district so they can only spend it for things \nthat are not priorities. That doesn't make much sense. Send the money \nto the school district and allow the school district to devote the \nresource to those things which are important to the achievement of \nstudents.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Can the Senator tell me precisely what priorities \nresources are required to be spent on?\n  Title I is the biggest expenditure of Federal money; it is for poor, \ndisadvantaged children. Is that a priority?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes.\n  May I answer the question?\n  Mr. KERRY. I asked the question.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. First you said, could I respond by saying what \npriorities people are being required to spend resources on, or what \nthings are not a priority.\n  Governor Davis of California said: You are requiring me to spend \nmoney on reduced class size in grades K through 4 when the priority is \nfor reducing class size in grade 10 and English.\n  I quoted the Governor a few moments ago to that effect.\n  I believe it is very important that we be able to devote resources in \nways to improve the ultimate performance.\n  We know class size is a priority in some settings. And other kinds of \npriorities exist for other settings. But I think we should allow \nindividuals who know what the students need for our ultimate priority, \nwhich is student achievement. I think they should be able to look at \nthat ultimate priority and see how we are going to elevate the \nperformance of students.\n  Mr. KERRY. If the Senator will yield, is the Senator aware--and maybe \nthe Governor is not; I think he is--that it is an option, but, \nsecondly, that the Senator joined with all of us in voting for Ed-Flex \nunder which any Governor basically can do whatever they want?\n\n  Is the Senator aware of that? That is what we passed last year, \ncomplete flexibility to Governors. We are not required to spend that. \nIf they want to seek a waiver, they can get a waiver.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I ask the Senator to restate his question.\n  Mr. KERRY. Is the Senator aware under Ed-Flex the Governors have full \nflexibility for a waiver for any kind of onerous regulation? We voted \nfor that last year precisely for this purpose. It is, in fact, \nvoluntary as to whether or not they make the decision to which he \nreferred.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I believe the correct interpretation of Ed-Flex is that \nthere is substantial flexibility accorded to Governors for certain \nprograms--not for all programs--and I believe it would be a \nmisstatement to characterize it in the way it was characterized in the \nquestion. But there is additional flexibility, and I voted for Ed-Flex \nbecause it was a step in the right direction.\n  I don't purport to say the Governors should be the last word on this. \nFrom my perspective, we would be well served to push more of the \ndecisionmaking authority down to the local level where the people who \nknow the names of the students and the needs of the schools can make \nthe determination.\n  I have visited three or four dozen school districts in my State in \nthe last 3 or 4 months. I have been very intensive in my examination. \nIt is very important we understand that tailoring the resource to meet \nthe needs of students to elevate student performance is very important.\n  Sending money to feed the bureaucracy isn't important. The ultimate \nthing we need to determine is, are we doing those things that will \nelevate student performance? It may not even be the same thing in every \ncase. There may be things needed in one area in one setting, in one \ncultural venue, that are different from in another. The presumption \nthat Washington can know a\n\n[[Page S3312]]\n\nsingle solution is as foolish as the idea that there is a single \nproduct that would suit everyone.\n  Look at the march of industry in our country. We don't try to sell \neverybody the same computer. Look at the future. The future tells us if \nyou call a fellow named Dell down in Texas, he doesn't tell you what \ncomputers he has to offer, he asks you what your needs are. They tailor \nthat computer to meet your specific needs.\n  It is called mass customization, not mass production. Mass production \nis a thing of the past. Mass customization is a thing of the future. \nLet's allow our school districts to tailor the resources we provide to \nmeet their needs and to elevate their students' capacity. Let's not try \nto impose on those students some sort of template from Washington that \npushes them into a program or something that is not in their best \ninterests and not according to their needs. The idea of Washington \nimposing and distorting education is an idea whose time has past.\n  In my State, there is a designation that is a result of a Federal \nprogram called IDEA. One in seven students in my State--and one in \neight nationally--are designated as disabled. As a result of this \ndesignation, those students are not subject to discipline in the same \nway other students are. For example, if a disabled student brings a gun \nto school, the maximum time you can keep him out of the regular \nclassroom is generally 45 days. Some of these disabilities, a good \nnumber of them, are behavioral disabilities, so they are students whose \nproblem is in controlling themselves. Instead of having the 1-year \nsuspension from class because they brought a weapon to school, they \nonly have a 45-day suspension from class because they brought a weapon \nto school.\n  It is very difficult for local school administrators to have a \nsituation where they can't discipline students effectively to maintain \norder and control. I believe we ought to adjust that. We ought to get \ndecisions about resource allocation down to the local level, to moms \nand dads, community leaders, school board members, to decide how to \nspend the resources to best elevate student performance. I think that \nis what they want to do with the money. That is what they want school \nresources for.\n  I think we ought to also say to those people at the local and State \nlevel, you can make the kinds of decisions regarding discipline that \nare necessary in your culture and in your community and in your setting \nto secure the classroom and secure teachers. It is very important that \nbe done, and be done in ways that will help students.\n  The Missouri School Boards Association has talked to me recently \nabout these kinds of circumstances. They have given me some examples of \nwhat has happened in their school districts in the area of IDEA, \ndiscipline, and safety. Here is one, ``Teacher Assault.''\n\n       High school student with disabilities was placed in an \n     alternative school after repeatedly assaulting her high \n     school teachers. Recently aggravated, she approached the \n     office. The secretary was talking with a person outside the \n     office and did not see the student approach. The student hit \n     the secretary in the side of the head, knocking her glasses \n     off her face and causing personal injuries. This year the \n     student has broken her teacher's glasses four times by \n     hitting him in the face or pulling them from his face and \n     breaking them. This behavior continues in spite of multiple \n     years of interventions by mental health professionals, \n     behavioral specialists and disability experts at school. The \n     parents continue to meet on a regular basis with the school \n     personnel. However, assaults are frequent and cause injury at \n     home, at school and in the community. No agencies within the \n     community or State will provide comprehensive treatment or \n     services as she is considered too aggressive. She remains in \n     public school.\n\n  Not subject to the kind of discipline there ought to be.\n  I can go through case after case of teacher assault. I can talk about \nstudents who have been shot by other students, students who were \ninjured, whether it is with a knife or with a gun, and the absence of \nthe capacity of our school administrators to deal with students who \npose threats to the learning environment of our classrooms. It is a \ntragic absence of capacity. We ought to return that capacity to the \nlocal level. I believe it is possible for us to do so when we think \ncarefully about our school; whether it be assaults on teachers, whether \nit be the possession of weapons, whether it be the importation of drugs \ninto the schools.\n  So it is with this in mind that I think trusting local school \nofficials is the way for us to respond. We need to adopt the kind of \nphilosophy that moves decisionmaking as well as resources to the local \nlevel. Just moving resources to the local level with an administrative \nburden and a direction to spend the resources in ways that are not \nneeded at the local level is nonsense. Move the resources to the local \nlevel and move the decisionmaking capacity to people who know the names \nof the students and the needs of those students and the needs of the \ninstitution. Let them make decisions.\n  Second, allow individuals who are running our schools at the State \nand local level to have the kind of rules and disciplinary procedures \nwhich provide a safe learning environment. If we do those things, we \nget to our ultimate accountability. The accountability is in student \nperformance. Accountability is not in answering to Washington. \nAccountability is not answering to a bureaucracy. It is not filing tens \nof thousands of papers. Accountability is whether our students can read \nand write, add, subtract, multiply, and divide. It is whether our \nstudents are prepared for a technically demanding world, a workplace \nwhere, if they succeed with the right education, it will provide them \nwith a chance to be world leaders; where, if we do not succeed and our \neducational skills languish, our days are numbered as a leader of the \nworld.\n  It is with that in mind I want to say how important it is for us to \nnot only have the right ability to send resources but decisionmaking as \nwell to the local level, and then to provide a basis for maintaining a \nsafe school environment by simply saying that school districts have the \nability to discipline all children who bring weapons to school or use \nillegal drugs at school or possess them at school or children who \nassault school district personnel.\n  I will close by just remarking that this is not something that is \nagainst the best interests of schools or of teachers or of groups of \nindividuals. The Education Roundtable of Missouri, which is comprised \nof all the major education associations in Missouri, including the PTA, \nincluding the MNEA, including the AFT, including the Missouri State \nTeachers Association and the Missouri School Boards Association--all of \nthose endorse this idea that we need to have the capacity to discipline \nappropriately all students who bring weapons to schools, who assault \nteachers, who threaten and assault teachers and provide drugs in the \nschool. They should be subject to appropriate discipline measures.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter from the Missouri \nEducation Roundtable be printed in the Record and I thank the Chair for \nthis opportunity to express myself on this important issue.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            The Missouri Education Roundtable,\n\n                                        Columbia, MO, May 1, 2000.\n     Hon. John Ashcroft,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Ashcroft: The Education Roundtable, comprised \n     of all the major education associations in Missouri, strongly \n     supports your proposed amendments to the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act regarding discipline of students. \n     It is absolutely essential that school district officials \n     have the ability to discipline any child that brings a weapon \n     to school, possesses or uses illegal drugs at school, or \n     assaults school district personnel. This conduct must not be \n     tolerated in our public schools.\n       School safety is a top priority for teachers, \n     administrators, and school board members in Missouri. Our \n     children must be guaranteed a safe environment if effective \n     learning is to take place. We are committed to providing such \n     an environment but currently our hands are tied in certain \n     circumstances due to restrictive federal law. We commend you \n     for offering this important amendment and we urge your \n     colleagues in the Senate to approve it.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Carter D. Ward,\n\n                                               Executive Director,\n                               Missouri School Boards Association.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Missouri, who I \nhave\n\n[[Page S3313]]\n\nlistened to carefully--and I regret with only 10 minutes, I do not have \ntime to yield and enter into a dialog, which I would enjoy doing--first \nof all, I agree with what he just said about the capacity of people to \ndiscipline. In fact, I have proposed what we call Second Chance \nSchools. In the legislation that Senator Gordon Smith and I proposed, \nthere is a component of it that would help provide the capacity for \nthat kind of discipline. But once again, because this is not a \nbipartisan process or one that has been open to anything except the \npoint of view of the Straight A's plan, we do not have the ability to \ndebate that or other things.\n  I will also say to my friend from Missouri, one has to ask a \nquestion. He is talking about getting the capacity to the local people \nto be able to make the choices. If the local people were so thrilled \nwith the proposal by the other side, why are they not supporting it? \nThe only entity that I know of that is supporting the legislation \nproposed by the Republicans is the Heritage Foundation.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERRY. I do not have time. Unfortunately, I am limited to 10 \nminutes now because of the time.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. When the Senator asks a question of me, I would like to \nbe able to respond.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am actually informing him at this point \nin time, not asking him a question. I am going to ask a rhetorical \nquestion because, again, I do not have the time. But the fact is, the \nlocal entities that make the decisions, the State school officers, the \nsecondary and elementary school principals, the teachers, the education \nassociations--all of those folks are the ones who are supportive of the \nDemocratic alternative.\n  Second, I heard the Senator from Missouri say why is it that--I guess \nit was more than 50 percent of the people who work in schools are \noutside of the classroom?\n  That is because we do not have enough teachers for the numbers of \nkids in the classroom. When you have one teacher teaching 35 kids, you \nbegin to change the proportion of who is working in the school system. \nI am confident my friend from Missouri does not intend to have a school \nsystem that does not have custodians, does not have janitors, does not \nhave schoolbus drivers, does not have people working in the cafeterias. \nThese are the people ``outside of the classroom.''\n  What we really need to face is the reason the proportion is out of \nwhack, which is that we will need 2 million new teachers in America in \nthe next 10 years. We will need a million of those teachers in the next \n5 years. At the current pay level, without the capacity of the Federal \nGovernment to assist in reducing class size, it is going to be \nexceedingly difficult for the very districts in which the Federal \nGovernment got involved in education in the first place, which are poor \ndistricts, to ever be able to catch up.\n  I will ask another rhetorical question. If we are supposed to be \ngiving control to the people who effectively have had control for all \nof these years, why is the school system in America doing so badly? We \ndo not run it at the Federal level. We have never run it, nor are we \nasking to run it. We are trying to provide an incentive for \ncommunities, which have never bought into real reform, to buy into \nreform. If you look at the 1994 ESEA that we passed in a bipartisan \nfashion, you will see, as a result of that legislation, standards now \nbeing put in place across the country, whole school reforms being put \ninto effect, a whole series of measures with respect to testing and \nimprovements that are beginning to take hold.\n  Have they reached the level that everybody would like? The answer is \nno. But we would never have had to try to make that kind of broad-based \neffort at reform if, indeed, everything was working so well because the \nlocal decisionmakers were making the decisions that needed to be made.\n  Equally important, the Senator from Missouri was talking about \nraising the standards of schools.\n  I know in St. Louis or Kansas City, MO, there are poor schools. I \nknow in Atlanta there are schools that depend on title I money to \nadequately provide a cushion for what their lack of a tax base \nprovides. Poor communities do not have a big tax base. Since schools \nare funded by the property tax, they do not have the ability to put the \nmoney into the school system. That is precisely why the Federal \nGovernment became involved in 1965 in title I in the first place. The \nreason was to address the problems of communities that were \ndisadvantaged.\n  Along comes this Republican bill with a provision called portability. \nI know the sponsors have spent a lot of time saying this is not a \nvoucher, and the reason this is not a voucher is there is not a piece \nof paper that goes to the parent which they take to another school. The \nschool district manages the money. But it is effectively a credit \nvoucher. It is effectively an indirect voucher where a parent gets $400 \nto $600 of value for their child if they want to take them somewhere \nelse for a different kind of schooling.\n  It sounds good and appealing, but it directly undermines the very \nconcept that brought the Federal Government in the first place to help \neducation, which is, if a school has a group of disadvantaged kids, by \nproviding assistance based on the number of kids, on the conglomerate \nneed of that community, we can help lift the school so the school can \nbecome a great school and teach those kids.\n  If we provide a per-disadvantaged-pupil stipend, what we will do is, \nin fact, reward kids who may be poor themselves but who go to a good \nschool, a school that is not disadvantaged, that has an adequate tax \nbase and does not at all need to have additional funding from the \nFederal Government. We will simultaneously have stripped away from a \nschool that is struggling to be good the very heart of the money they \nneed to make the difference and improve.\n  If we really wanted to help make a difference today, we would fully \nfund title I. That is the way we make a difference in what is happening \nto the schools that are not making it. We would do so in a way that set \nan order of priorities with respect to the key things we wanted to do.\n  I heard from the Senator from Missouri the mirror reflection of what \nwe keep hearing from the other side. They keep saying: We do not want \nthe Federal Government dictating how to approach this. The fact is, the \nFederal Government does not dictate that. It offers a specific menu. \nThe schools can apply for the menu of money or not apply, as the case \nmay be. If they think they need money for smaller class size, they can \napply for that money, but nothing in the Federal budget orders a school \nto do that--nothing.\n  It is a concept completely out of any reality whatsoever for people \nto suggest there is somehow this long arm that is telling them \nprecisely what to do. It is only suggesting the guidelines and \nconstraints of what they have to do if they choose to do what has been \nestablished as a priority.\n  Surely we can all agree that afterschool programs are a priority. \nGetting guns out of schools is a priority. Drug-free schools is a \npriority. Having adequate class size is a priority. Having better \nteachers is a priority. I do not understand why the Senate is incapable \nof agreeing on a set of top priorities that every school district in \nthis country can name and then say we are going to find a way to hold \nthem accountable, not after 5 years but next year, to see precisely how \nthere is funding money with respect to that priority.\n\n  We are not going to tell them how to spend the money. We are not \ngoing to order them to spend the money. They can choose to do it or not \ndo it, but we are going to at least guarantee that the country is going \nto spend its Federal dollars on those things that represent priorities \nof education.\n  This is hard for me to understand. The bill proposed by the \nRepublicans has no accountability for 5 years at all, and for all this \ntalk of telling us that we want the local people to make the decision, \nit plunks the entire pot of money in the hands of the Governors. That \nis not local decisionmaking; that is just playing to the politics of \nthe State, and the people most powerful and with the greatest lobbying \ncapacity will go back to the old order and the Federal priorities will \nbe by the wayside.\n  We are somehow not connecting. It is the first time in all the years \nof this bill that there has been such a partisan bill and such a \ndisconnect in an effort to meet the needs of our Nation.\n\n[[Page S3314]]\n\n  I close by saying there was a terrific ex-general who was the \nsuperintendent of schools for 3 or 4 years in Seattle, from where the \nSenator from Washington came. He did an extraordinary job and was \nbeloved by all. He said: There are no libertarians, no Republicans, no \nDemocrats, no conservatives or liberals among the kids in our schools. \nWe ought to get the ideology out of this process and put the kids \nfirst. If we do that, I am confidant we can have a solution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield the Senator from Wyoming as much time as he may \nconsume within our limits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today I rise in strong support of the \noriginal committee bill, the Educational Opportunities Act of 2000, \nwhich will reauthorize for another 5 years the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act of 1965. We now call it ESEA.\n  I especially applaud my fellow members of the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee, particularly Senator Jeffords, and also \nSenator Gregg, Senator Frist, Senator Hutchinson, and Senator Collins \nfor their unusual dedication and the hours they spent working on this \nbill and working with every single member of the committee.\n  I congratulate the committee for constructing a bill that contains a \nnew recipe of support for our children as they embark on their \neducational journey. I am very interested in this educational journey. \nMy oldest daughter is a teacher in Gillette, WY, an outstanding teacher \nof English for seventh and ninth graders. She goes the extra mile every \nday to make a difference in these kids' lives. I want to do everything \nI can to help.\n  We are an education family. My wife has been involved in education. \nShe just received her master's degree in adult education from the \nUniversity of Wyoming by Internet while she was here in Washington with \nme. That is a major challenge, using some of the new technology in \neducation in Wyoming today. It is what we can do to help kids, wherever \nthey might be, to get a good education. That is the goal, and we do \nunderstand that goal, and we do work toward that goal.\n  Unfortunately, the pending amendment offered by the minority leader \non behalf of his Democratic colleagues does not seek to address the \nreal academic needs of our children. The amendment is virtually a \nmirror image of the status quo.\n  Earlier today, somebody said if the Republicans could not use the \nwords ``status quo,'' we could not debate. In this instance, that would \nbe true. The proposal does not reflect an investment in understanding \nwhere the Federal role in education has failed our children; therefore, \nthe proposal lacks the payoff our children and parents are demanding, \nand that is a better education.\n  In fact, one of the only and certainly the most notable change \nincluded in the Democratic proposal eliminates funding for many small \nand rural schools under title IV, the safe and drug-free school section \nof ESEA--simply writing off communities that under current law receive \ngrants that I have to admit are too small to fund any meaningful \ninitiatives. It is not a productive solution. Our bill fixes that \nproblem, instead of dismissing it, with a new rural flexibility \ninitiative.\n  The other side of the aisle talks about their desire to get the money \nto the poor kids. On behalf of the Governors of this country, I have to \nobject to some of the accusations made against them today. Education \ninnovation has come from the Governors of this country. Their States \nhave been the laboratories for this country.\n  We have used some of the things they have suggested, and they have \nworked. They are light years ahead of the Federal ESEA. They are the \nones on which we rely. And we are saying, do not trust those Governors \nwith any money?\n  In my State, we have State equalization that takes a whole bunch of \nthese problems that have been laid out here and forces the rich \ndistricts to provide for the poor districts so every kid has an equal \nchance. We provide for that to be taken to court regularly to make sure \nit still meets all the guidelines of an equal education.\n  I have to tell you, ``equal'' refers to buildings, too. So when I \nhear some of these things about needing school construction, that is \nsomething that is being forced to happen in Wyoming so all kids have a \ngood place to go to school. That was a Republican initiative by a \nGovernor.\n  State accountability. Our State believes in measuring the achievement \nof the kids, knowing how the kids are doing. It isn't important for the \ndistrict to know how the kids are doing; it is important for the \nparents to know how the kids are doing, so the parents can be more \ninvolved in the education of their kids. They even have report cards \nthey send home that evaluate the whole school to see how the school is \ndoing.\n  This substitute that has been laid down again is an unfortunate \nexample of resistance to acknowledging and accommodating the differing \nneeds among communities and schools.\n  Wyoming cannot be the only State that has a unique way of doing \nthings, which is why I am so pleased that the underlying bill does \nreflect a fresh look at the Federal role in education. This is a \npriority issue for voters because they are concerned with our historic \nlack of concern for their specific needs. With this bill before us, we \nfinally have the opportunity to honestly say we have listened and have \nmoved away from the stalemate of entrenched Washington to the solutions \nof the future.\n  While the Federal Government does not hold all the answers, and \ncertainly does not hold the purse strings for the bulk of education \nspending, there is a clear role for leadership and technical assistance \nas schools lead the way toward academic improvement for all children.\n  Right now, the Federal Government provides 7 percent of the money--\njust 7 percent of the money--in education and requires over 50 percent \nof the paperwork. Yes, to check on those funds that we give away, we \ninundate principals and teachers with tons of unproductive proof. Our \nbill requires less paperwork and makes it count. More could and should \nbe done to reduce paperwork.\n  On this reauthorization we are talking about, everybody seems to \nagree we have a failed system out there, or at least one that \ndefinitely needs improvement. I hear that from the other side of the \naisle. I have to say, the other side of the aisle was in the majority \nthe last five times this bill was authorized. They settled for less \nthan 7 percent of the funds and 50 percent of the paperwork. We tried \nit their way. Everyone has said we need change. The committee bill is \nchange. Let's try it our way once.\n  Our bill essentially provides three options of Federal support for \nState and local education initiatives, as decided by local communities. \nThe variation between States' economies, geography, student-body \ncomposition, and position on the ``academic achievement'' spectrum \nwarrants an improvement in how the Federal Government can be most \nhelpful to each State's unique needs.\n\n  For example, States that have a self-sufficient internal \ninfrastructure through which they are able to provide local schools \nwith high-quality technical assistance are not dependent on the Federal \nDepartment of Education for that kind of support. Those States have \nbeen wrestling with the regimented requirements the Federal programs \ncurrently demand, despite their ability to not only do it themselves, \nbut for the States to do it better.\n  As a good-faith act of Federal leadership on education improvement, \nwe need to accommodate and support the progress of States that has \noutgrown the 35-year-old model of ESEA. This is new and, therefore, \nuntested ground. But isn't that what learning is? It is time for all of \nus to get educated and to make room for improvements and innovations in \nour kids' education.\n  So the first piece of the underlying bill is a demonstration program \nfor up to 15 States to break from the title-by-title categorical \nprograms under ESEA and develop new proposals for executing excellence \nin education.\n  While the 1994 reauthorization of ESEA tacked sharply in the \ndirection of measuring what kids learn through the end of the day \nthrough standards and assessments rather than solely concentrating on \nhow they are learning, this demonstration program,\n\n[[Page S3315]]\n\ncalled Straight A's, tests that model by allowing States to implement \nan education plan completely outside the current input requirements of \nESEA. Again, though, the sharp distinction is that those States will be \nheld accountable for high standards of student achievement in exchange \nfor such freedom with Federal tax dollars.\n  The second option under the bill was developed in partnership with \nthe National Governors' Association. In another new proposal for \nimproving education, States will now be able to enter into education \nperformance partnerships with the Federal Government. This program will \nrequire States to develop a plan similar to the Straight A's education \nand achievement plan to significantly increase student performance over \na period of 5 years. The difference between this option and Straight \nA's, however, is that States will be required to maintain the targeting \nof title I to specifically serve the low-income and disadvantaged \nchildren those dollars were historically intended to help.\n  While I support the innovation, flexibility, and commitment to \nmeaningful accountability those two new options represent, my home \nState of Wyoming is actually best served by the third piece of the \nbill. Under the third option, States can choose to remain under the \nexisting categorical and title structure of the current law.\n  Make no mistake, there have been modernizations to the current law \nwhich are intended to make categorical programs do a better job of \nserving the unique needs of States. That is an improvement in the \ncommittee bill. I am sorry more was not done in further reducing the \nadministrative burden associated with the Federal education funds, but \nI believe we did make substantial progress in leveling the playing \nfield for small States and rural communities; their education needs are \njust as important as urban needs.\n  Most notably, the supercategorical program known as the Class Size \nReduction Program--or 100,000 new teachers--was evaluating and \nappropriately authorized by the committee.\n  I need not remind everyone that the program, while funded over the \nlast 2 years, was essentially an appropriations rider and had never \nbeen considered before the HELP Committee. Now the committee has \nassigned this program to its rightful place in ESEA. It is part of \ntitle VI, the innovative education title. This is the funding source \nStates can use to accommodate existing needs for which there are no \nother or insufficient resources as well as to innovate outside the box \nof the other categorical titles under ESEA. If it is more professional \ndevelopment, more reading excellence initiatives, or a new teacher that \na school needs, this is where they can fund it. If you cannot pay \nteachers enough to retain them, what good is another slot? We have a \nteacher shortage in this country. We have a shortage among many \nprofessionals, but the shortage that will affect our future the most is \nthat of teachers.\n  For a small State such as Wyoming, which in the first year of the \nClass Size Reduction Program required a waiver because we could not \neven meet the consortia title--we had already met the requirements for \nclass size reduction. We had provided another amendment that would \nallow you to group some of that under a waiver. We could not even meet \nthat requirement for eligibility, so the committee version of ESEA \nmakes good sense.\n  Also, a notable modernization of the current law approach is the new \nRural Flex Initiative. To quote from the committee report:\n\n       The purpose of this part is to provide adequate funding to \n     rural school districts to enhance their ability to recruit \n     and retain teachers, strengthen the quality of instruction, \n     and improve student achievement.\n\n  The provision would allow rural school districts with enrollments of \nfewer than 600 kids to pull funds from titles II, IV, and VI to spend \non local improvement initiatives that--and this is important--would \nenable the small schools to offer their kids programs and activities of \nsufficient size, scope, and quality to have a significant impact upon \nstudent and overall school performance.\n  In Wyoming, there is such a thing as qualifying for a $200 grant, \nbased on current formulas, to run a drug prevention program. Well, $200 \nis not meaningful and it is not fair. So I applaud my fellow rural \nSenator from Maine, Susan Collins, for initiating this provision on \nbehalf of all the kids in rural schools.\n  I have to spend just a moment explaining why, despite how good \nStraight A's and performance partnerships might be for some States, \nthey are not quite the right fit for Wyoming. It is actually quite \nsimple. Wyoming is small in population. We are the smallest population \nState in the Union, with the second largest relative land mass per \nperson. My county is the same size as the State of Connecticut. That is \njust my county in Wyoming. The last census in that county, which is 110 \nmiles by 60 miles, recorded a total of 33,000 people--two towns. The \nbiggest one, which we call a city, had 22,000 people. The rest were \nspread over that huge geographical area.\n  Resources are scarce, and therefore we focus on the basics of \neducation. Simply, there isn't the money, the infrastructure, or, \nnecessarily, the inclination to get fancy. We even have single-child \nschools. We have driving compensation for parents willing to drive \ntheir kids to school because they are the only child on a bus route 60 \nmiles one way. We have school districts with so few kids that the \ndistrict superintendent teaches classes.\n  We are pioneers in compressed video classes to provide some variety \nin class offerings--but no teacher is in the room with the student. \nThat is part of the State's charm and its integrity, but it also means \nthat Wyoming utilizes and, in fact, relies upon technical assistance \nprovided by the Federal Department of Education. That is still in here. \nWe don't want the same kind of education that Massachusetts provides. \nWe know our kids can be as well educated but not the same way as the \nkids in California. I can assure you we don't want somebody in \nWashington, DC, deciding how we will do things. When you take away the \ntitles under current law, you also take away the technical assistance \nthat goes with them. To be clear, Wyoming hates the paperwork and the \nbureaucracy as much as I do. But while we are making progress on \ngetting that in check, we cannot throw out the baby with the bath \nwater. Whether it be manuals, guidelines, protocols, research-based \nmodels on teaching methods, or the human resources that are the good \nside of Federal assistance in educating our kids, Wyoming is using it.\n  About 5 years ago, Wyoming gathered its stakeholders in education, \nfrom parents and teachers to administrators and legislators, and they \ndeveloped a plan to bring our kids to the top of the charts. A new \nsystem for reporting to parents on statewide, school-by-school progress \nis up and running. While it is a rocky road, new, challenging, State \ncontent standards are near completion with assessment mechanisms soon \nto follow. It takes a while to develop those, particularly in a small \nState. You can't say: Wyoming, have it next month or next year, without \nproviding unusually large dollars to do it. It has been no small task \nto get where we are and it has been, in part, predicated on Federal \nresources available through the current structure of ESEA. I am not \nwilling to pull the rug out from under my constituents when the light \nis right there at the end of the tunnel.\n  That is why I am enthusiastic about the options this bill contains. \nIt is a different way for everybody to do different things and make \nsure their kids are educated. While I don't want to set back Wyoming's \nefforts by ignoring current law--with improvements--as a viable option \nfor States, I also don't want to impose on States that can do it better \nanother way the structured method of current law.\n\n  Earlier, there were some comments about Ed-Flex. I have to take on a \ncouple of those. I have heard a number of my colleagues contend that \nsince only a few States have applied for Ed-Flex so far, additional \nflexibility is not needed or wanted.\n  Fifty Governors signed a letter asking for Ed-Flex. Now, with regard \nto Ed-Flex guidance, it wasn't even issued by the Department of \nEducation and sent to the States until November of 1999. The bill, as \npassed, was only 17 pages when the President signed it into law on \nApril 29, 1999.\n\n[[Page S3316]]\n\n  According to State education agencies, the Federal Government has \ncomplete control over the application process and the State must tailor \nits application to the Department's guidelines and expectations. Even \nthe Department of Education wrote in a May 1999 memo:\n\n       States are strongly encouraged to refer to the guidance \n     before submitting their Ed-Flex applications to the \n     Department.\n\n  In addition to the guidance issue, officials at the Department of \nEducation have informed the Nation's Governors that contrary to both \ntheir own guidance and the Ed-Flex law, written along with Senator Ron \nWyden of Oregon, they will only approve applications for States that \nare in compliance with title I requirements. The law, and the \nDepartment's guidance, allow a State to participate if it has made \nsubstantial progress toward meeting the requirements under title I--\nsubstantial progress.\n  Despite these rather significant hurdles, a number of States, \nincluding Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and others, have been \nworking on their applications for months. Tennessee submitted its \napplication in early April. North Carolina has also submitted its \napplication.\n  When Congress passed Ed-Flex, we did not expect every State to take \nadvantage of the new law, but we did think it was important that every \nState be afforded the opportunity to utilize the flexibility available \nunder the law to support innovation and cut through Federal redtape.\n  The Senate is currently considering several other proposals for \nincreased flexibility that will be available to States, at their \noption. Because every State will not choose to participate, however, \ndoes not mean the policy is unnecessary or a failure. Some States will \nchoose to utilize the new authorities and some will not, but all States \nshould have the opportunity. The Federal Government should not stand in \nthe way of States that want to innovate and reform to meet the specific \nneeds of their own children.\n  I remind you again that the States have been the laboratories for \ninnovation, not the Federal Government. The bottom line here is \naccommodating success in every State for every child. I think that is a \ntall order, but I think we have filled it with the committee bill. The \nopponents of choice and innovation do not have a healthy understanding \nof our role. I suggest that everyone look out across the country, and \nthen look in their backyard and, only then, come here and argue that \nthere is no variation needed for our children. I won't assume to argue \nagainst the needs of any other community. I simply ask the same of my \ncolleagues. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I come, first, to say how I am strongly in \nsupport of the Democratic alternative. It does represent what is the \nappropriate response by the Federal Government to educational policy in \nthe United States; that is, to find specific ways in which we can help \nlocal schools and State systems improve education, with a particular \nconcentration on low-income students. That has been the emphasis in \nFederal education policy since 1965. It is an emphasis that is being \nseverely diluted by the Republican proposal.\n  In this substitute, there are provisions for strong parental \ninvolvement. In contrast, the Republican bill says very little about \nparental involvement and again leaves it to the States. It provides \nfunds for specific programs that used to be part and parcel of Federal \neducation policy, such as funds for libraries. But because of the \ninclusion of block grants, we have seen those funds withered away. As a \nresult, our library selections in schools are abysmal and \nanachronistic. It also provides real accountability for results.\n  This is another issue that I think distinguishes our proposal from \nthe Republican proposal. There is talk about accountability in the \nRepublican proposal but no real accountability. It states that the \nGovernors get to select the standards they want to use to measure their \nprogress. It is only after 3 or 4 or 5 years that there is any real \nexamination of what is going on.\n  At the end of that time, the idea that a Secretary of Education--any \nSecretary of Education--would take away all the funds or a significant \nnumber of funds from a State is, to me, somewhat attenuated. But, in \naddition, because the criteria for such Secretarial action is so vague \nand amorphous, there would be very little legal justification to do \nsomething such as that.\n  In effect, the accountability provisions are really not \naccountability provisions. In the last reauthorization in 1994, and in \nGoals 2000 of that same year, I fought for very tough accountability \nstandards--accountability not only for the student performance but also \nfor the resources going into schools. We fought back and forth, and the \nopposition, particularly of the Republicans, was vehement. We managed \nthrough compromise to come up with provisions that were included in the \nlegislation. But in 1995, with the advent of the Republican Congress, \nthose tough accountability provisions were quickly stricken from the \nlegislative record. As a result, this accountability issue suggests, \nwith respect to the Republican proposals, that it is more superficial \nthan substantive.\n  We, alternatively, also have provisions to help professional \ndevelopment because we recognize that this is not only a local problem; \nthis is a national problem, and we want to help States and localities. \nThey are the key guardians of access to the classrooms and teachers. We \nwant to help them improve professional development.\n  We have language with respect to safe schools and afterschool \nprograms that are targeted to specific programs that are going to aid \nthe overall mission of States and localities.\n  The proposals that are emanating from the Republican side move away \nfrom the core principle of involving the Federal Government in the \nfirst place in elementary and secondary education, and to help \ndisadvantaged children who were systematically and consciously \nneglected by States and localities. That was the record up to 1965. \nThey moved away from that. Now the approach is that we want to give the \nStates the money to do that without respect, really, to an emphasis on \neducation, and we want to give the States this money because the school \nsystems of America are failing.\n\n  Frankly, if the school systems of America are failing, if that is the \npremise of the legislation, you have to ask yourself who is in charge \nof this failing school system? Frankly, it is the Governors, the \nmayors, and the schools throughout this country. The Federal Government \ncontributes about 7 percent of resources; 93 percent of the resources \nare provided by States and localities.\n  One of the most decisive factors of educational policy in the United \nStates has nothing to do with Washington. It is reliance on the \nproperty taxes, exclusively a local idea. It is exclusively a local \ninitiative. Teachers who go into the classroom are not certified by any \nFederal agency. They are certified by States and localities. School \nconstruction is controlled by States and localities. These are decisive \nfactors that influence policy in the country. If you presume that we \nare here today changing our system because education is failing, why in \nGod's name are you simply going to give the money without conditions to \nthe people who are presiding over this?\n  I don't think we are speaking about educational failure. We are \nspeaking about some limited progress over the last several years as a \nresult of some Federal initiatives. But, frankly, because of lots of \nlocal initiatives, because there is a partnership now between States, \nlocalities, and the Federal Government with respect to many programs of \ninnovation, starting with Goals 2000 and embedded in the 1994 \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act--in fact, \nsearching for a metaphor to try to capture what I think the other side \nis suggesting, it seems to me, if you were a police officer proceeding \non a highway and you saw an automobile careening out of control, \nrecklessly driven, violating the rules, failing to abide by the \nstandards we expect for driving, and you pulled that car over, went up, \nlooked in, and saw a driver and someone in the backseat, then you \nturned to the backseat driver, and said, you caused of all of this, \nthat is essentially what the Federal Government has been doing in some \nrespects.\n\n[[Page S3317]]\n\n  Yes, we are part of this voyage, if you will, of educational policy. \nBut with 7 percent of the effort, with a limited role, we are, at best, \nbackseat drivers. No one would suggest that the reason the car is \nfailing to operate properly is because of who is in the backseat. It is \nwho is doing the driving; that is, the States and localities.\n  Our approach is to recognize that they are, in fact, in control; that \nwe can collaborate with them; that we can, in fact, provide resources \nin areas where they either don't do it or do it insufficiently.\n  That is the heart of what we are talking about today--to build on the \nvery real progress we have made over the last several years but \nrecognizing that this progress is insufficient.\n  I urge that we get back to the business of proper Federal educational \npolicy, supporting innovation where it works, overcoming inertia where \nit hobbles education reform, specifically targeted ways in which we can \nhelp localities improve the quality of education for all of our systems \nwith a particular emphasis on disadvantaged American students who need \nmore than what they get without the Federal support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the one thing that is certain is that \nevery Member of this Chamber is committed to improving public education \nin America. In America, we differ on how to accomplish that goal.\n  Over the years, we have enacted Federal program after Federal \nprogram. There are dozens of Federal programs on the books, all in the \nhope of narrowing the gap in achievement between low-income students \nand high-income students. All of us want to narrow that achievement \ngap.\n  Each and every person here is committed to providing an equal \neducational opportunity to every child in America. But we have to look \nat the record. We have to look at the facts. When we evaluate in what \ndirection we should go, we have to look at from where we have come.\n  The fact is that after 35 years and $120 billion spent on Federal \neducation programs aimed at the disadvantaged, we have not achieved the \ngoal of ensuring that children in high-poverty schools receive a good \neducation. We know that children from poor families have just as many \nbrains as children from wealthier families. We know that they have all \nthe ability in the world. This is not about aptitude. It is not about \nthe ability of these children. The debate is whether or not our current \neducation system has served them well. The evidence suggests \noverwhelmingly that in too many cases our schools are failing these \nchildren.\n  Let's look at the statistics. Seventy percent of children in high-\npoverty schools scored below even the most basic level of reading. \nSeventy percent have disadvantaged children that are unlikely to \ngraduate from high school if they are in high-poverty schools in the \ninner cities. Children in high-poverty schools score two grade levels \nbelow their peers in high-income schools when it comes to math and \nthree grade levels when it comes to reading.\n  Again, the problem is not a lack of ability. These children have all \nthe ability in the world. The problem is that we are not meeting their \nneeds.\n  We can continue down the path we followed during the past 35 years--a \npath paved with good intentions but not producing good results.\n  We can try a new approach. We can try to be innovative. We can get \naway from the ``Washington knows best'' approach, and empower local \nschool boards, teachers, and parents to work together with State \neducation officials to make a real difference in the lives of these \nchildren. That is what our Republican bill would do.\n  I point out again that no State is forced to accept the increased \nflexibility in designing programs using Federal funds. If a State is \ncontent with the status quo, if a State believes that its schools are \ndelivering the best education possible, it can continue with the status \nquo. It can continue along the path of receiving Federal funds, \nattached with Federal strings, attached with paperwork, and tied up \nwith redtape. If that works fine with a State, then a State can \ncontinue with that system.\n  But a second alternative is for a State to enter into what is known \nas a performance partnership.\n  Under this approach, a State would have more flexibility in spending \nFederal dollars and can consolidate some Federal programs as long as \nthe State can show improved student achievement.\n  Under the third and most innovative approach, 15 States would be \nallowed to participate in what is known as the Straight A's Program. \nUnder Straight A's, a State would have great flexibility in combining \nFederal funds to meet whatever is the greatest need of that community.\n  The needs differ from community to community. One community may need \nto hire more math teachers. Another may need to concentrate on \nimproving reading skills. Still a third may need to upgrade the science \nlabs. The needs are not identical from community to community. Straight \nA's recognizes this and would allow a State to choose to consolidate \nFederal funds to meet the greatest need of that community. That is what \nthis debate is about. It is about trying a new approach that could help \nensure a brighter future for the disadvantaged children of America. \nThat is our goal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 32 minutes and \nthe Senator from Georgia has 6 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nNew York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington not \nonly for yielding the time but for her leadership on this issue. I am \nso proud of the package that she and the Senator from Massachusetts \nhave put together under the sponsorship of our minority leader, the \nSenator from South Dakota.\n  I think this debate is one of the most important debates we will have \non the floor of the Senate. It is the issue of education about which we \nprobably need to do the most. America is in very good shape overall, \nbut the greatest trouble spot on the horizon is the fact our \neducational system is not up to snuff. You can't be the No. 1 economy \nwith the No. 15 educational system in the world.\n  This debate presents two stark choices. The Republican bill, S. 2, \nbasically revolves--and I use the word advisedly--around block grants, \nvouchers, and an alternative approach, which I am proud to have worked \non with my colleagues on this side of the aisle. Again, I want to \nparticularly salute my colleague from Massachusetts and my colleague \nfrom Washington for their leadership, as well as my colleagues from New \nMexico, Iowa, and Connecticut, who worked on this so diligently.\n  The block grant approach is a two-way street of folly. From the \ncongressional standpoint, it is an abdication of responsibility. We \nsend blank checks to the State and wash our hands of the educational \ncrisis. Waste always accompanies block grants. We learned this in area \nafter area when we gave the money to local politicians who had not done \na good job. It is also enthusiastically contradictory. My colleagues on \nthe other side say our system isn't good enough. It has been in the \ncontrol of local school boards.\n\n  What are we doing? We are giving more money to local school boards, \nno strings attached.\n  If you think our educational situation is in great shape and needs a \nlittle more money, you do a block grant. I, for one, don't think just \ngiving a little bit more money to the status quo is going to improve \nour system. Block grants are an abdication of our responsibility to set \nnational goals and figure out what programs work. When we separate the \ntaxing authority from the spending authority, as in a block grant, \nunless you have some restrictions, it is a formula for waste because it \nis free money.\n  I am utterly amazed my conservative friends on that side of the aisle \nare for a fundamentally profligate concept--free money, no taxing \nauthority, no strings attached, do what you want.\n  The issue is not the Federal Government dictating in a block grant \nbecause we are not dictating. If you don't\n\n[[Page S3318]]\n\nwant the money, you don't have to take it. If you don't want to improve \nteacher quality, don't take the money. I agree with some on the other \nside that we have had too many mandates. But we are not mandating here. \nThere is not a mandate at all.\n  To say the National Government, which has the responsibility of \nleading us into the 21st century, should not set any goals--and again, \ngive money to the very local districts we are criticizing for not doing \na good enough job--no strings attached, to me is utterly devoid of \nreason.\n  I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and some on this \nside of the aisle to examine the principle of block grant. Don't let \nyour anger at Federal control, which in some cases, in my judgment, is \njustified, mar your ability to see that a block grant makes no sense. \nIt is an abdication of accountability.\n  My colleagues have talked very well about the 5 years of complete \nfreedom to do what you want. The result is flawed because States only \nhave to demonstrate statewide performance, effectively allowing States \nto ignore failing schools. We focus on a few schools that excel and \nbolster the State average.\n  Under this proposal, States could use Federal funds for any \neducational purpose under State law. As we discussed during yesterday's \ndebate, what was then a title I State block grant of 1965, studies \ndemonstrate educational purposes can be band uniforms, swimming pools, \nsewage disposal. I talked about that last night and won't go through \nthose arguments again.\n  If my colleagues like block grants, they would be better off going by \nconservative principles and not having the block grant but reducing \ntaxes by that amount. I, for one, don't like separating the taxing \nauthority from the spending authority. That is as conservative a \nprinciple as we are going to get.\n  Fortunately, we don't have to go down the path of a block grant. The \nDemocratic alternative targets scarce Federal dollars to the Nation's \nmost important priorities: Teacher quality, high standards for our \nchildren, accountability for students in school performance, safe and \nmodernized schools, smaller class size, technology, and parental \ninvolvement. Under our proposal, schools would be required to ensure \nthat all students meet or exceed State proficiency standards within 10 \nyears. We prevent States from masking an achievement gap by requiring \nschools to determine academic progress by using disaggregated student \nperformance data.\n\n  Under our proposal, we build 6,000 new centers, giving 1.6 million \nschool-age children access to before-school and after-school programs. \nUnder our proposal--this is the part I will dwell on because the \nSenator from Massachusetts has enabled me to play a little bit of a \nrole in this, along with the other proposals--we recognize the urgent \nand vital need to have a qualified teacher in every classroom. We \nguarantee funds to communities to recruit qualified teachers. That is \nthe greatest crisis, in my judgment, that education faces.\n  Last night, I mentioned on the floor more than half the teachers will \nretire in the next 15 years. For math and science, even in affluent \ndistricts, we have a great deal of trouble finding teachers now. If we \ncould only accomplish one thing, if we could make only one change to \nour schools to raise quality, in my judgment, it would be to improve \nthe quality of our teachers, make the teaching profession more \nattractive to young people and mid-career professionals alike.\n  In the past, we were able to attract teachers of high quality because \nwe had set cohorts of people who went into teaching. Depression babies \nin the 1930s and 1940s wanted a secure, if not a well-paying job; women \nin the 1950s and 1960s who had no other opportunities, and in the late \n1960s and early 1970s, my generation, had young men who went into \nteaching because they were given draft preference.\n  Today, however, to choose to teach is to choose to sacrifice, at \nleast economically, as fulfilling a job as teaching is. Teacher \nsalaries could not compare with other possible options facing college \ngraduates. Over the past 4 years, salary offers for college graduates \nin all fields have grown at twice the rate of those for new teachers. \nComputer programming, $44,000; accounting, $37,000--these are starting \nsalaries--market research, $34,000; a paralegal, $45,000; teaching, \n$26,769.\n  For the millions of young men and women who would consider the \nidealistic profession of teaching young people--I have done it, not as \na professional, but when I have been invited as an elected professional \nto teach eighth grade social studies in Cunningham Junior High school \nor 12th grade American History in Madison.\n  Just one other point on the teacher crisis. We face a teacher \nshortage of 750,000 teachers. One-third of the Nation's teachers are \neligible to retire in the next 5 years. The largest number of teachers \nis about 49 years old through 55 years old. We desperately need new \nteachers.\n  I have been working on a program, which is included in this \nalternative, to address the shortage and quality concerns through a \nteacher scholarship program: Inviting New Scholars to Participate In \nRenewing Education, called INSPIRE, a brilliant work of an acronym by \nmy staff.\n  Under this proposal, the federal government would pay 80 percent of \nthe costs of awarding annual INSPIRE scholarships to highly qualified \nhigh school seniors, undergraduate students and college graduates/mid \ncareers interested in committing to teach.\n  In exchange for having educational expenses (either college, graduate \nschool or an alternative certification program) paid for, awardees \nwould commit to obtain teacher licensing and agree to teach in a ``high \nneed'' area--those regions with high poverty and a high number of \nuncertified teachers.\n  My proposal would require new teachers to have an academic or work \nrelated concentration in the subject in which they intend to teach. \nWhen so much is riding on a teacher's ability and mastery, it is \nunacceptable that one-fourth of the math and science teachers in 1998 \nhad not majored in the field they were teaching.\n  The deal would be one year for every $5,000 in assistance received. \nThe awards would not exceed $20,000 and a portion of the scholarships \nwould be reserved for shortage subject areas, such as math, science and \nspecial education. The total federal contribution would be $500 million \nover five years.\n  Some states are already leading the way; Massachusetts runs a \nTomorrow Teachers Scholarship Program, Mississippi supports a Critical \nNeeds Scholarship Program. States are innovating in a time of great \nneed. Federal dollars should be used to replicate this on a broader \nscale.\n  In addition, my amendment also provides local districts money to set \nup mentoring programs for new teachers. $250 million over five years to \nensure that the best local teachers will be trained to evaluate and \nguide new teachers during their first critical years in the classroom.\n  We want to attract qualified, motivated, committed new teachers and \nprovide them the resources to stay teaching.\n  Currently, only 12 states pay veteran teachers to be mentors. We've \njust got to do better than that.\n  So, the choice seems to me to be simple. Do we provide federal \ndollars to do the hard work of ensuring quality, standards, \naccountability? Or do we just walk away? I think the answer is just as \nsimple.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time remains on the Democratic \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from \nIowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the issue before us really is whether or \nnot we are going to change gears on education. The Republican bill \nchanges gears in reverse. It puts us in reverse. The Democratic \nalternative offered by Senator Daschle puts us in a forward gear and \nmoves us ahead into the 21st century.\n  I want to cover basically one issue that is encompassed in the \nDemocratic alternative. If that alternative is not adopted--I assume by \nthe party-line votes that are being held on education this year it \nprobably will not be--I will be offering an amendment, hopefully \ntomorrow or the day thereafter, on an issue about which the American \npeople are really concerned when it comes to\n\n[[Page S3319]]\n\nelementary and secondary education. That is the issue of our crumbling \nschools and what is going to be done about them. USA Today the other \nday pointed out that 89 percent of the American people ranked education \nas the most important issue. That is why this debate is so important \nand why the elementary and secondary education bill is so important.\n  When you talk to the American people about what their concerns are, \nthey talk about things such as smaller class sizes, better qualified \nteachers, better paid teachers, better accountability--all the issues \nwe talk about in our alternative. But the one that comes up every \nsingle time is the state of our schools, how bad they are and how they \nare crumbling down around us.\n  Two years ago, in 1998, the American Society of Civil Engineers--not \na political body--issued a report card on the status of our physical \ninfrastructure in this country: The roads, the bridges, mass transit, \naviation, waste water, dams, solid waste, and schools. Schools was the \nonly one to receive an F. It is the worst part of our physical \ninfrastructure in America according to the American Society of Civil \nEngineers. Three out of four, 74 percent, of our schools were built \nbefore 1970. Here it is right here; 74 percent were built before 1970. \nHalf our schools were built over 40 years ago.\n  You have to wonder. When the nicest things our kids see as they are \ngrowing up are shopping malls, movie theaters, and sports arenas, and \nthe worst things they see are the public schools, you have to wonder \nwhat kind of message we are sending to them about the value we really \nplace on their education.\n  We have had, in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, since \n1994, title XII. That was put in with bipartisan support, I might add, \nin 1994, to provide for grants to local school districts to repair, \nrebuild, and modernize their schools. I have been fighting on this \nissue for 7 years. Finally we had gotten the attention that this was a \nnational problem--not just a local problem, a national problem. It is \nnational because in some of the poorest school districts where they do \nnot have the tax base to raise the local revenues, that is where you \nhave the real problems. So it is a national issue, not just a local \nissue.\n  It is one where we can help local school districts without being \ninvolved in curriculum or taking over local control. This has nothing \nto do with that. I will tell you this: If you talk to local property \ntaxpayers in any school district, talk about how burdened they are, and \nask them if they want another increase in their property taxes to \nrebuild and modernize their crumbling schools, they will tell you they \ncannot do it. That is why it is a national problem and needs a national \nanswer.\n\n  We had title XII and guess what. When we finally got the bill to our \ncommittee, title XII had been struck, just done away with. That is what \nwe were faced with--no more title XII, no more authorization to provide \ngrants to schools, while at the same time President Clinton sends the \nbudget down earlier this year and there is $1.3 billion in the \nPresident's budget for grants to our local schools to rebuild and \nmodernize.\n  The President requested $1.3 billion, and the Republican bill we have \nbefore us strikes the authorization to allow us to do that.\n  So I will tell you, at about this time President Clinton is in \nDavenport, IA, to continue his push for legislation to modernize our \ncrumbling schools. But the pending bill cuts that effort off at the \nknees by repealing title XII. The amendment we have before us, the \nDaschle amendment, reauthorizes and amends title XII. It authorizes \n$1.3 billion to make grants and zero-interest loans to enable public \nschools to make urgent repairs, to fix the leaking roofs, repair the \nelectrical wiring, or fix fire code violations.\n  What I am about to tell you has happened in the State of Iowa I am \nsure is true in almost every State in this Nation. The Iowa State Fire \nMarshal reported that fires in Iowa schools have increased fivefold \nover the past several years. Why is that? Because they are old schools. \nThe wiring is old. They are catching on fire. It is true in every State \nin the country.\n  Here is something else. I say this to my friend from New York. Most \npeople say this cannot be so, but it is so. Twenty-five percent of the \nschools in New York City are still heated by coal. One out of every \nfour public schools in New York City is heated by coal. Talk about old \nfashioned. Talk about the need to modernize and upgrade.\n  In closing, we have a lot of needs for elementary and secondary \neducation, but one need that must be met on a national basis is fixing, \nrepairing, and modernizing our crumbling schools. The Daschle amendment \ndoes that. That is why it needs to be supported.\n  If the substitute amendment is not adopted, I will be back with an \namendment to amend title XII to provide the $1.3 billion President \nClinton asked for in his budget. Our local school districts need this \nnational help.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts. As I do so, I thank him for his tremendous leadership on \nour side on the issue of education and making sure all children, no \nmatter where they are in this country, have the opportunity to learn. \nIt is represented in this amendment which he has had such an incredible \npart in drafting. I thank him for that. I yield him 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my good friend, the Senator from \nWashington, for her comments. I yield myself 8 minutes. We are going to \nhave two votes in about 20 minutes.\n  In closing this debate, I want to ensure my colleagues in the Senate \nfully understand the amendment offered by the Senator from Washington, \nMr. Gorton. I certainly understand it was written to ensure that the \nStraight A's provision cannot be used to divert funds for private \nschool vouchers. The Office of General Counsel at the Department of \nEducation has reviewed the language and informs me they are concerned \nthat, because of the convoluted approach this language takes, it would \nbe very difficult to sustain in court an interpretation that vouchers \nare prohibited by the amendment.\n  Quite frankly, a direct prohibition in this amendment could have \nresolved that concern. For that same reason, the author of the \namendment chose not to do so. The underlying bill, through its child-\ncentered program, also known as portability, clearly authorizes the use \nof funds for what are, in effect, private school vouchers.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Washington does not purport \nto change that program at all. Therefore, notwithstanding any \ninterpretation of the amendment on which we are about to vote, we would \ncontinue, according to the general counsel's belief, to have a private \nschool voucher program.\n  I believe it is probably marginally better in terms of reducing the \npossibilities of a voucher than exists in the bill. I urge my \ncolleagues, even with this hesitation, to support the amendment.\n  For the last few minutes, I will go back to the comparison of the \naccountability provisions of S. 2 and the Daschle bill. I will mention \nseven different areas. I want the attention of those on the other side \nso they can address it, which they did not do over the course of this \nday.\n\n  Must States dedicate funds specifically for turning around failing \nschools?\n  Under S. 2, the answer is no. Under the Daschle proposal, the answer \nis yes. Under title I, they have to allocate 3 percent in the years \n2001 and 2002 and 5 percent for every year after so there will be funds \navailable in the States to turn around failing schools. Our answer is \nyes; their answer is no.\n  Must schools show annual gains in student performance?\n  The answer for S. 2 is no. In our legislation, the answer is yes, \nStates have a period of time to reach proficiency in 10 years for all \nchildren, but they have to define how they are going to get there. We \nlet them do it, but they must meet the benchmarks along the way. We \ndefine it and hold States accountable; they do not.\n  Is there any assurance of real accountability? Do failing schools \nface any real consequences?\n  As we have pointed out time and again, there is virtually no \naccountability for the first 5 years under S. 2. The answer to that is \nno. Under the Daschle bill, after 2 years, there has to be changes that \nthe schools will take part in or otherwise, after the 4 years,\n\n[[Page S3320]]\n\nthe whole governance of that school will be replaced. There are funds \nfor that, and there is the commitment spelled out in our legislation to \ndo it.\n  Is accountability based on the performance of all students, including \npoor children and limited-English-proficient children? The answer under \nS. 2 is no. The State can choose what children--this is the \nunbelievable part. I reviewed this in the Record yesterday. Under S. 2 \nrequirements, they can select or choose which children they are going \nto put in the aggregation to report back to the Secretary of Education. \nIt is a shell game.\n  Under the Daschle bill, there is a requirement for disaggregation not \nonly in school districts but in schools on race and income, so we will \nknow actually what school, not what school district, not just a general \narea, but we will know that every single year this legislation is in \nplace.\n  Do schools and districts face consequences if they fail to help poor \nchildren, minority children, and limited-English-proficient children \nlearn to high standards?\n  The answer under the Republican bill is no; under ours it is yes, for \nthe reasons I have identified.\n  Is there a sensible requirement enabling students in failing schools \nto transfer to higher-quality schools?\n  The answer in the Republican bill is virtually no. They can use the \nwhole amount of money for transportation. We challenge them. Show us \nwhere the limitation is. It is not there. We put the limitation cap at \n10 percent.\n  Finally, must States help migrant children, delinquent or neglected \nchildren or homeless children reach high standards?\n  Under S. 2, no, they effectively abolish the homeless program, the \nimmigrant program, and the migratory programs. We protect those.\n  If they are looking for accountability--and we have heard those words \nfrom the other side all day long today, ``We want accountability''--\nthey have to answer those questions. They have not answered them. They \ndid not answer them in their opening statements when they presented \nthis issue, and they refuse to respond to the challenges that Senator \nBingaman and everyone on this side has posed to them.\n\n  Republicans want a blank check that is a stamp of approval on the \nstatus quo. It gives a blank check to the Governors and does not \nrequire anything to change. The Democrat's substitute cancels the blank \ncheck and instead provides parents a guarantee of better results for \nkids. It guarantees accountability for results, as I have spelled out--\na qualified teacher in every classroom, as was pointed out earlier in \nthe debate, smaller class size, as Senator Murray has pointed out, \nmodern and safe schools, as Senator Harkin and others have pointed out, \nand strong parental involvement, as Senator Reed from Rhode Island has \npointed out. All of this has been included in our alternative. That is \na Marshall Plan for change, and I urge my colleagues to support it. I \nyield back the remainder of the time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, how much time does the majority have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 6 minutes, and the minority \nhas 4 minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Massachusetts \nin urging everyone to vote for the Gorton amendment. However, I urge \nthem to vote no on the Daschle amendment. The distinguished minority \nleader has offered objections to S. 2, and we agree that it is not \nperfect, but S. 2 does ensure that the Federal Government provides \nleadership and support in areas where there is a critical need for \nhelp.\n  These areas include title I, education for the disadvantaged; safe \nand drug-free schools; bilingual education; and education technology, \nto name a few.\n  S. 2 maintains and strengthens the title I reform process begun in \n1994 with the enactment of the last ESEA reauthorization which required \nthe establishment of high standards and the development and \nimplementation of assessments designed to measure progress towards \nthose standards.\n  The deadline for adopting standards was 1998, and the deadline for \nadopting assessments is in the school year 2001-2002.\n  A bipartisan group of educators, known as the Independent Review \nPanel, which was created under the 1994 law to review federally funded \nelementary and secondary education programs, said in their report, \nreleased last year, that standards driven reform should be given a \nchance to fully take hold while the Nation continues to assess progress \nin student performance.\n  S. 2 enhances the title I reform process by providing a separate \nfunding stream within title I which will provide dollars to those \nschools that need improvement and also provides funding to States so \nthat States may develop the assessments they need to have in place by \nnext year.\n  Title II of the bill provides clear Federal leadership and support \nfor investments in teacher quality. It builds upon our national \ncommitment to professional development. Yet, it does so in a \ncommonsense way that allows school districts to create the recipe that \nworks for their schools and their communities to improve opportunities \nfor teachers. It provides a list of activities that school districts \ncan choose from in an effort to improve the quality of the teachers in \nthe classroom. The bill encourages funds to be used for recruiting and \nhiring teachers, mentoring programs, programs and partnerships to keep \ngood teachers in the profession, and professional development programs \nthat will have a positive impact on teaching and learning in the \nclassroom.\n  In addition, S. 2 includes a new program to develop and strengthen \nthe leadership skills of teachers, principals, and superintendents.\n  This bill also improves the Safe and Drug Free Schools Program by \nincreasing accountability. While requiring that Safe and Drug Free \nmoney be used for effective programs, S. 2 also gives States and local \nschool districts enough flexibility to design programs that will \nprevent violence and drug use.\n  The bill provides Federal leadership and significant Federal funding \nfor education technology. The current education technology programs \nhave made a significant difference in fostering the effective \nintegration of technology into the curriculum. The programs authorized \nunder S. 2 build upon the strengths of the current law and enhance the \neducational opportunities in technology available to teachers and \nstudents across the country. S. 2 preserves an important role for the \nFederal Government in education technology. It includes a number of \nchanges offered by Senators from the other side of the aisle which, in \nmy view, improve and strengthen the education technology provisions in \nthe underlying bill. The education technology program is a good one--it \nshould not be abandoned by adopting the Senator Daschle amendment.\n  This bill also improves bilingual education. Recently, rural \ncommunities throughout this Nation have seen tremendous growth in the \nbilingual student population. S. 2 includes provisions that will enable \nthese rural communities to receive funds from this program. At the same \ntime, ensuring that the large urban centers continue to be eligible for \nBilingual Program grants.\n  S. 2 includes a new flexibility initiative included in Title VI which \nis based on Senator Collins' Rural Education Initiative Act. The \npurpose of this program is to provide adequate funding to rural schools \nto enhance their ability to strengthen the quality of instruction and \nimprove student achievement and student performance. Through \nflexibility provisions and a supplemental grant program, rural school \ndistricts will have the ability to maximize their resources for \nimplementation of education reform strategies. The amendment offered by \nmy colleagues on the other side does not have this authority and it is \na provision that will provide a significant benefit to the rural \ncommunities of this Nation.\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to reject the substitute and work \ntogether to make improvements to S. 2 in an effort to arrive at a \nbipartisan product that will make a positive difference in the lives of \nall of our Nation's students and educators.\n  I urge Senators to vote yes on the Gorton amendment and no on the \nDaschle substitute.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The remaining time is under the control of the \nSenator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n\n[[Page S3321]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not been ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield the remaining debate time to the \nDemocratic leader, who has done an outstanding job in putting together \nan amendment that really reflects the values of the Democrats and \nensures that all of our children, no matter who they are, get a quality \neducation.\n  I thank the Democratic leader and yield him our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank my colleague from Washington for her leadership \non this issue, and particularly on the issue of class size, and all of \nthe work that she has done to get us to this point.\n  Mr. President, I will use whatever additional time I need out of my \nleader allotment to finish my remarks.\n  Let me begin by complimenting the distinguished chairman and manager \non the other side for the manner in which he has closed the debate.\n  There is no one who has worked on a more bipartisan basis on so many \nissues than has he. I respect him and appreciate the tone that he has \nset, once again, in calling for bipartisanship. I guess the irony is \nthat we find ourselves, in spite of his desire for bipartisanship, at a \npoint where we have very little of it.\n  I am as disappointed as he is that in committee, after more than a \nyear's worth of work, the document the committee had been using, the \nwork they had been constructing was shelved in favor of a very partisan \napproach to the Federal role in education for the next 6 years through \nESEA.\n  I know, I am sure--I do not know--I am sure that he shares my \ndisappointment that the kind of bipartisan tradition we have had in \ndrafting this legislation over 35 years was not represented in the \nfinal vote during the markup of the ESEA in committee. So his call for \nbipartisanship, I know, on his part is genuine.\n  I am disappointed it was not reflected in the actions taken by the \ncommittee. I am disappointed that it does not reflect our current \nstatus on the Senate floor. As a result, I am really disappointed that \nwe are relegated now to offering a Democratic substitute, when we could \nhave worked on a bipartisan bill that would have allowed both parties \nto claim achievement and some success, and the confidence that we are \ndoing the right thing in addressing education at the Federal level.\n  I thank all of my colleagues for the extraordinary effort they have \nmade to bring us to this point within my caucus. I have mentioned \nSenator Murray. I thank, first and foremost, Senator Kennedy, for all \nthe work he has done as our ranking member. I thank Senator Dodd and \nall of the members of the HELP Committee. But I must say, all of our \ncolleagues--Senator Lieberman, and others--have joined with us in an \neffort to make this the very best proposal we could make.\n  I believe we have achieved that. I believe there is a lot more we can \ndo. But given our circumstances, given where we are, I believe this \nrepresents the finest opportunity that we will be able to construct to \nensure that for the next 6 years, during this ESEA authorization, we \nbuild upon the things that have worked, change the things that have \nnot. We as we acknowledge the report card that still stands in the back \nof this Chamber--the report card by the American Society of Civil \nEngineers issued just a little more than a year ago--as we look at our \ninfrastructure, in all of its different facets, as we determine what is \nworking and what is not, we can say, with some authority and with some \nabsolute certainty that too many of our schools are failing when it \ncomes to the infrastructure.\n\n  We are getting poor results. We are not doing what we should in large \nmeasure because we have not made the commitment in infrastructure that \nwe must make in education. So they gave schools an F. So we are faced \nwith that reality, that we can do a better job.\n  We are faced really with two choices. One choice is to say: Let's \ntake those tools. Let's assure that those things we know are working \ncan be built upon, and that we can provide the kind of leadership and \nbe the catalyst we know we can be in improving teacher quality, in \nimproving accountability, in reducing class size, in ensuring there is \nmore technology in all schools, and to make sure there is more parental \ninvolvement--taking all of those things that school boards and parents \nand teachers and school officials tell us we have to do a better job \non. We can work to improve those specific areas with the knowledge it \nis going to take resources. We can do that. That is what the Democratic \nsubstitute does do.\n  On the other hand, we can do what we attempted to do back in 1981, in \nthe name of flexibility, in the name of local control. Ironically, we \ncreated a blank-check approach that, I believe, has been an abysmal \nfailure--a failure in terms of the kind of commitment to that approach, \nrepresented in real dollars, now cut by more than half since the \nlegislation was passed, an approach that probably is far more \nbureaucratic, when you think about it. We go from the people \nadministering the program at the Federal level through the people \nadministering the program at the State level, to the people \nadministering the program at the city or school district level, to the \npeople administering the program in the schools themselves. That is the \nRepublican approach. That is the blank check. If that isn't \nbureaucratic, I don't know what is.\n\n  What we say is, if you really want local control, if you want to \nensure that the maximum number of dollars get right into the school, \nbypass all of that and you will directly affect the school and provide \nthe resources. That is what we say you should do. That is what our \nsubstitute does. That is real local control. That is providing the \nresources in the place where it can do the most good, without all of \nthe bureaucratic hurdles, without all of the money going from here to \nthe State capital, to the county, to the city, to the school district, \nto the school. We should not have to do that.\n  So I find a real irony in this local control argument used by some on \nthe other side. I will say that I am hopeful, in spite of the history \nover the last several days--a somewhat partisan approach to this \ndebate--we can actually reach some sort of a bipartisan consensus \nbefore the end of the debate. I am hopeful, as the chairman has \nindicated, that there is yet some opportunity for us to reach across \nthe aisle. This is our best hope in doing that. We know all of the \nthings that we are suggesting have enjoyed bipartisan support in the \npast. These have not been partisan issues. There is no reason why now \nit must be. So we offer this amendment in good faith, hoping that our \nRepublican colleagues will join us in building on the success of the \npast and ensuring that we really have local control, in recognizing the \neducational tools that can be of extraordinary benefit to students and \nteachers all over this country. That is what this amendment is about, \nand I urge its adoption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nNo. 3110.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to address once again the \neducation of our children. This week we have been debating S. 2, the \nEducational Opportunities Act. More importantly, we have been debating \na difference in philosophy between Democrats and Republicans.\n  The Democrats have stood before us and proclaimed that Republicans \nwant to weaken the Federal stranglehold on our education system.\n  The Democrats have stood before us and accused us of wanting to turn \npower from the beltway to parents and teachers.\n  Well, Mr. President, I plead guilty.\n  In fact, let us examine exactly what Republicans want to do.\n  We want to reduce overhead costs to put more money into the \nclassroom, make States and local districts more accountable, and \nprovide greater flexibility for teachers and parents to make the \ndecisions which affect their children.\n  Anyone who has itemized taxes, applied for an FAH loan, been in the \nmilitary, or just dealt with the Federal Government knows how stifling \nthe paperwork can be. People all across this country make a fine living \nhelping people deal with Federal bureaucracy.\n  So, it is easy to imagine how a school district can devote half of \nits administrative staff to administer the 7 percent of its budget that \ncomes from the Federal Government.\n  Just imagine how much paperwork you have to do to send money to the \nFederal Government.\n  Now imagine how much that would increase if they were giving you \nmoney--and then imagine if you were receiving millions of dollars a \nyear.\n  It is easy to see how money and staff can be siphoned off to \nadminister Federal funds--money and staff that could go to teaching our \nchildren.\n  Our bill reduces Federal paperwork in order to put more money into \nthe classroom.\n  Every student knows that grades--a measure of your accomplishment--\nare important. Every day parents and teachers hold them accountable for \ntheir grades.\n  These same students may find it surprising that school districts and \nStates are not held accountable for their achievements with the \nbillions of Federal tax dollars they receive.\n  Our bill says enough is enough. It is time to hold States accountable \nfor student achievement.\n  Our bill offers an opportunity for 15 willing States to consolidate \nup to 12 Federal grant programs and free themselves from Federal \nredtape. However, the States must use that flexibility to boost student \nachievement--which they will be held accountable for. A noble concept.\n  The pillar of our public school system is to allow everyone free and \nopen access to a high quality education. And, generally, it works.\n  Unfortunately, there are schools out there that are denying our \nstudents the basic education they need. And, students who can't afford \nprivate education, are stuck in the schools where they live.\n  That should not be the case. Our bill says that if a school that \ngenerally reaches disadvantaged students is designated as failing for 2 \nyears, the district would be required to offer any child enrolled in \nthe failing school the option to transfer to a higher performing public \nschool.\n  If a school continues to fail for another 2 years, the district would \nalso have to cover the students' transportation costs.\n  If all public schools within a district were identified as failing, \nthen the district would be directed to form a cooperative agreement \nwith another district to allow students to transfer.\n  And, finally, students attending these schools who either have been a \nvictim of a violent crime on school grounds or whose school has been \ndesignated unsafe may also transfer to another public school.\n  This puts many decisions about a students education in the hands of \ntheir parents, forces schools to be accountable for their achievement, \nand allows all students access to a quality education.\n  Mr. President, as I close today I want to ask every parent out there \none question. Do you know better than a Federal bureaucrat in \nWashington what is best for your child? If the answer is yes, you \nshould support our bill.\n  I also want to ask every school administrator and teacher out there \none question. Do you know better than a Federal bureaucrat in \nWashington what is best for your students? If the answer is yes, you \nshould support our bill.\n  After all, it is all about increased accountability, greater local \nand parental control, and more money in the classroom.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/03/senate-section/article/S3322-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3322-S3324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             DAVID MAHONEY\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, our Nation has lost one of the great and \nmodest men of our time, David Mahoney. A man who will receive \nposthumously one of the highest awards the medical community can bestow \non a layman--the first Mary Woodard Lasker leadership in Philanthropy \nAward for ``visionary leadership'' from the Albert and Mary Lasker \nFoundation on May 9.\n  David, through his generosity, with both his time and his money, \ngreatly expanded knowledge about the human brain, neuroscience, and the \nconnection between body and brain which is helping people lead longer, \nhealthier lives.\n  He led us through the ``Decade of the Brain'' and used his \nextraordinary marketing and public relations skills to foster awareness \nin Congress and our people of the importance of medical research and \nbrain research in particular.\n  From his humble beginnings in the Bronx, my friend served as an \ninfantry captain in World War II and then attended the Wharton School \nat the University of Pennsylvania while working full time in the mail \nroom of an advertising agency.\n  David's talents did not stay hidden for long; by the time he was 25, \nhe had become the youngest vice president of an advertising agency on \nMadison Avenue.\n  He went on from there to form his own agency in New York and then\n\n[[Page S3323]]\n\nbegan his climb through the corporate world, first running the good \nHuman Ice Cream Co., and rising to chief operating officer of Norton \nSimon's various corporate holdings.\n  It was during his stewardship of Norton Simon, Inc., that I first met \nDavid. My friend Norton Simon retired as president and CEO of Norton \nSimon, Inc., in 1969 and selected David Mahoney to be the new leader of \nhis company.\n  He chose David because ``David was inspirational, tough, visionary, \nand dangerous.'' David expanded the company and helped Norton Simon \nbuild the world famous Norton Simon art collection, the greatest \npersonal art collection west of the Mississippi.\n  David wrote a book about his own life in business called Confessions \nof a Street Smart Manager. David was a wonderful combination of street \nsmarts garnered from growing up in the Bronx, an education from the \nWharton School, and the Irish charm that could convince people to share \na dream and work to realize its value.\n  Just 2 years ago David authored another book, along with Dr. Richard \nRestak, ``The Longevity Strategy--How To Live To 100 Using the Brain-\nBody Connection.''\n  David once said that ``God gave you intelligence so you could build \nyour intuition about what lies ahead.''\n  David Mahoney's second career and perhaps most lasting legacy was \nwith the Charles A. Dana Foundation where he served as its chairman \nsince 1977.\n  After leaving Norton Simon, he focused the attention of the Dana \nFoundation on neuroscience research and helped the world's top \nneuroscientists and researchers explain the importance of their \nresearch to the general public and to funding agencies in the executive \nbranch and the Congress.\n  In 1992, he and Nobel Laureate Dr. James Watson launched the ``Decade \nof the Brain'' with 10 specific objectives they believed might be \nachievable by the end of the decade. That effort focused attention \nbetter than ever before on understanding the basis for diseases of the \nbrain like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's and generated an unprecedented \nlevel of support for neuroscience research.\n  David has become widely and justifiably credited as our foremost lay \nadvocate for neuroscience. While David had recently expressed some \nfrustration to me that those 10 ambitious goals had not yet been fully \nachieved, through his efforts remarkable progress has been made in \nunderstanding the human brain and the diseases that afflict it. I know \nthose goals will ultimately be met, and David Mahoney will be forever \nremembered as the driving force behind this effort.\n  My friend David Mahoney and his wife Hillie have been close friends \nof ours for many years. David and I celebrated our 75th birthdays, \nwhich fell in the same year, and shared many memorable times. Catherine \nand I will miss his wit and his wisdom and his leadership, but I will \ncontinue to enjoy personal memories of our friendship and to be \ngrateful for his legacy of exploration into the workings of the human \nbrain.\n  Mr. President, the May 2, 2000, New York Times contained an excellent \nobituary of David Mahoney, and I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the New York Times, May 2, 2000]\n\nDavid Mahoney, a Business Executive and Neuroscience Advocate, Dies at \n                                   76\n\n                          (By Eric Nagourney)\n\n       David Mahoney, a business leader who left behind the world \n     of Good Humor, Canada Dry and Avis and threw himself behind a \n     decidedly less conventional marketing campaign, promoting \n     research into the brain, died yesterday at his home in Palm \n     Beach, Fla. He was 76.\n       The cause was heart disease, friends said.\n       Mr. Mahoney, who believed that the study of the brain and \n     its diseases had been shortchanged for far too long, was \n     sometimes described as the foremost lay advocate of \n     neuroscience. As chief executive of the Charles A. Dana \n     Foundation, a medical philanthropic organization based in \n     Manhattan, he prodded brain researchers to join forces, shed \n     their traditional caution and reclusivity and engage the \n     public imagination.\n       To achieve his goals, he brought to bear the power of \n     philanthropy, personal persuasion and the connections he had \n     made at the top of the corporate world.\n       Using his skills as a marketing executive, he worked \n     closely with some of the world's top neuroscientists to teach \n     them how to sell government officials holding the purse \n     strings, as well as the average voter, on the value of their \n     research. He pressed them to make specific public commitments \n     to find treatments for diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's \n     and depression, rather than conduct just ``pure'' research.\n       ``People don't buy science solely,'' Mr. Mahoney said this \n     year. ``They buy the results of, and the hope of, science.''\n       In 1992, aided by Dr. James D. Watson, who won the Nobel \n     Prize as a co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, Mr. Mahoney \n     founded the Dana Alliance for Brain Initiatives, a foundation \n     organization of about 190 neuroscientists, including Dr. \n     Watson and six other Nobel laureates, that works to educate \n     the public about their field.\n       The same year, after taking over the 50-year-old Dana \n     Foundation as chief executive, Mr. Mahoney began shifting it \n     away from its traditional mission of supporting broader \n     health and educational programs, and focused its grants \n     almost exclusively on neuroscience. Since then, the \n     foundation has given some $34 million to scientists working \n     on brain research at more than 45 institutions.\n       Mr. Mahoney also dipped into his own fortune, giving \n     millions of dollars to endow programs in neuroscience at \n     Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania. Later this month, \n     the Albert and Mary Lassker Foundation, which traditionally \n     honors the most accomplished researchers, was to give him a \n     newly created award for philanthropy.\n       ``He put his money where his mouth was,'' said Dr. Kay \n     Redfield Jamison, a professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins \n     University.\n       Mr. Mahoney's journey from businessman to devotee of one of \n     the most esoteric fields of health was as unusual as it was \n     unexpected.\n       David Joseph Mahoney Jr. was born in the Bronx on May 17, \n     1923, the son of David J. Mahoney, a construction worker, and \n     the former Loretta Cahill.\n       After serving as an infantry captain in the Pacific during \n     World War II, he enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania's \n     Wharton School. He studied at night, and during the day he \n     worked 90 miles away in the mail room of a Manhattan \n     advertising agency, Ruthrauff & Ryan. By the time he was 25, \n     he had become a vice president of the agency--by some \n     accounts, the youngest vice president on Madison Avenue at \n     the time.\n       Then in 1951, in a move in keeping with the restlessness \n     that characterized his business career, he left Ruthrauff & \n     Ryan to form his own agency. Four years later, when his \n     business was worth $2 million, he moved on again, selling it \n     to run Good Humor, the ice-cream company that his small \n     agency had managed to snare as a client.\n       Five years later, when Good Humor was sold, Mr. Mahoney \n     became executive vice president of Colgate-Palmolive, then \n     president of Canada Dry, and then, in 1969, president and \n     chief operating officer of Norton Simon, formed from Canada \n     Dry, Hunt Food and McCall's. Under Mr. Mahoney, Norton Simon \n     grew into a $3 billion conglomerate that included Avis Rent A \n     Car, Halston, Max Factor and the United Can Company.\n       Despite his charm, associates said, he had a short temper \n     and an impatient manner that often sent subordinates packing. \n     ``I burn people out,'' he once said in an interview, ``I'm \n     intense, and I think that intensity is sometimes taken for \n     anger.''\n       The public knew him as one of the first chief executives to \n     go in front of the camera to promote his product, in this \n     case, in the early 1980's for Avis rental cars, which Norton \n     Simon had acquired under his tenure.\n       By all accounts, including his own, Mr. Mahoney was living \n     on top of the world. He was one of the nation's top paid \n     executives, receiving $1.85 million in compensation in 1982--\n     a fact that did not always endear him to some Norton Simon \n     shareholders, who filed lawsuits charging excessive \n     compensation, given that his company's performance did not \n     always keep pace with his raises.\n       Tall and trim, he moved among society's elite and was \n     friends with Henry A. Kissinger, Vernon E. Jordon, Jr. and \n     Barbara Walters. He was reported to have advised Presidents \n     Richard M. Nixon, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, and to have \n     met with Mr. Carter at Camp David.\n       But his fortunes changed late in 1983. True to form, the \n     restless Mr. Mahoney was seeking change, putting into motion \n     a plan to take Norton Simon private. But this time, he \n     stumbled; a rival suitor, the Esmark Corporation, bettered \n     his offer and walked away with his company.\n       Mr. Mahoney was left a lot richer--as much as $40 million \n     or so, by some accounts--but, for the first time in his life, \n     he was out of a job and at loose ends. He described the \n     period as a low point.\n       ``You stop being on the `A' list,'' he said some years \n     later, ``Your calls don't get returned. It's not just less \n     fawning; people could care less about you in some cases. The \n     king is dead. Long live the king.''\n       It look some years for Mr. Mahoney to regain his focus. \n     Gradually, he turned his attention to public health, in which \n     he had already shown some interest. In the 1970's, he had \n     been chairman of the board of Phoenix House, the residential \n     drug-treatment program. By 1977, while still at Norton, he \n     became chairman of the Dana Foundation, a largely advisory \n     position.\n       Mr. Mahoney increasingly devoted his time to the \n     foundation. In 1982, he also because its chief executive, and \n     soon began shifting the\n\n[[Page S3324]]\n\n     organization's focus to the brain. In part, the reason came \n     from his own experience. In an acceptance speech that he has \n     prepared for the Lasker Award, he wrote of having seen first-\n     hand the effects of stress and the mental health needs of \n     people in the business world.\n       But associates recalled, and Mr. Mahoney seemed to say as \n     much in his speech, that he appeared to have arrived at the \n     brain much the way a marketing executive would think up a new \n     product. ``Some of the great minds in the world told me that \n     this generation's greater action would be in brain science--\n     if only the public would invest the needed resources,'' he \n     wrote.\n       In 1992, Mr. Mahoney and Dr. Watson gathered a group of \n     neuroscientsts at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long \n     Island. There, encouraged by Mr. Mahoney, the scientists \n     agreed on 10 research objectives that might be reached by the \n     end of the decade, among them finding the genetic basis for \n     manic-depression and identifying chemicals that can block the \n     action of cocaine and other addictive substances.\n       ``We've gotten somewhere on about four of them--but what's \n     life,'' Dr. Watson said recently.\n       In recent years, Mr. Mahoney became convinced that a true \n     understanding of the brain-body connection might also lead to \n     cures for diseases in other parts of the body, like cancer \n     and heart disease.\n       He believed that it would soon be commonplace for people to \n     live to 100. For the quality of life to be high at that age, \n     he believed, people would have to learn to take better care \n     of their brains.\n       In 1998, along with Dr. Richard Restak, a \n     neuropsychiatrist, Mr. Mahoney wrote ``The Longevity \n     Strategy: How to Live to 100: Using the Brain-Body \n     Connection'' (John Wiley & Sons).\n       Mr. Mahoney's first wife, Barbara Ann Moore, died in 1975. \n     He is survived by his wife, the former Hildegarde Merrill, \n     with whom he also had a home in Lausanne, Switzerland; a son, \n     David, of Royal Palm Beach, Fla.; two stepsons, Arthur \n     Merrill of Muttontown, N.Y., and Robert Merrill of Locust \n     Valley, N.Y., and a brother, Robert, of Bridgehampton, N.Y.\n       Associates said Mr. Mahoney's temperament in his second \n     career was not all that different from what it had been in \n     his first. It was not uncommon, said Edward Rover, vice \n     chairman of the Dana Foundation's board of trustees, for his \n     phone to ring late at night, and for Mr. Mahoney to sail into \n     a pointed critique of their latest endeavors.\n       One researcher spoke of his ``kind of charge-up-San-Juan-\n     Hill style.'' Dr. Jamison, of Johns Hopkins, called him \n     ``impatient in the best possible sense of the word.''\n       As in his first career, Mr. Mahoney never lost the good \n     salesman's unwavering belief in this product, ``If you can't \n     sell the brain,'' he told friends, ``then you've got a real \n     problem.''\n\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield, I thank our colleague from \nAlaska for his comments about David Mahoney. I didn't know him as well \nas my good friend from Alaska but had the opportunity to be with him on \nnumerous occasions. All the things the Senator from Alaska said about \nDavid Mahoney are true, and even more so. It is a great loss to the \ncountry.\n  In fact, I point out our good friend from Alaska has lost a couple of \ngood friends in the last few months.\n  A man of significant contributions, a man who appreciated the arts, \nhad a great love of this country and history--David Mahoney was all of \nthose.\n  Suffice it to say, I want to be associated with the comments of the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska on his comments about David Mahoney.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/03/senate-section/article/S3324-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3324-S3325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MARKING THE ARRIVAL OF TAX FREEDOM DAY\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today is Tax Freedom Day, the day on which \nworking Americans stop working just to pay their State, Federal, and \nlocal taxes and actually begin keeping their earnings for themselves.\n  This is an important day for American taxpayers, but it is certainly \nnot a happy occasion because every year--since 1913--Tax Freedom Day \nhas arrived later and later. This means that Americans are working more \nhours and more days every year just to pay their tax bill. This year, \nAmericans had to work 124 days for their local, State and Federal \ngovernments before they could finally start working for themselves and \ntheir families on May 3.\n  What is even more troubling is that in 13 States--including my home \nState of Minnesota--Tax Freedom Day will arrive 2 or more days later \nthan the rest of the Nation. That means Minnesota taxpayers have to \nwait longer before they can start working for themselves, not for the \nGovernment.\n  Despite the fact that Americans work so long for the Government, we \nhave recently heard a lot of talk on the Senate floor and in the media \nthat the Federal tax bite is the smallest in 40 years and that the era \nof big government and high taxes is over. If that is true, why hasn't \nTax Freedom Day arrived earlier than last year?\n  The stark truth is that the Federal Government's tax collecting--and \nspending--are still too high.\n  The facts speak for themselves. Although the total Federal tax burden \nis slightly lower thanks to our tax-relief initiatives, particularly \nthe bill I authored to provide a $500 per-child tax credit, the \ncombined burden of Federal personal income and payroll taxes is well \nabove the figures of both World War II and 1980 prior to the Reagan tax \ncut. Federal taxes consume 20.4 percent of GDP, compared to 17.5 \npercent of GDP when President Clinton took office. Since 1993, federal \ntaxes have increased by 54%, which for the average taxpayer translates \ninto a $2,000 tax hike.\n  The combined personal income and payroll tax soared to 16.3% of GDP \nin 1999, up from 14.2% in 1992. Measured as a share of GDP, the \npersonal income tax rose from 8% in 1981 to 9.6% in 1999. The payroll \ntax now takes 6.8% of GDP, up from 4.5% in 1970.\n  On average, each American is paying $10,298 this year in Federal, \nState, and local taxes. A typical family now pays more of its income in \ntotal taxes than it spends on food, clothing, transportation, and \nhousing combined. More and more middle-income families are being pushed \ninto higher tax brackets each year.\n  Even for most low- and middle-income families, federal payroll taxes \ntake a huge bite of their income, and it keeps growing. For example, in \n1965, a family earning wages of $10,000 paid $348 in payroll taxes. \nToday, that family would pay $1,530 in payroll taxes--an increase of \n340 percent.\n  According to the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan group that tracks the \ngovernment tax bite at all levels, the total tax burden has grown \nsignificantly since 1992. While State and local taxes have grown \nsomewhat, Federal taxes account for the largest share of the increase.\n  Federal, State and local taxes claim 39.0 percent of a median two-\nincome family's total income and 37.6 percent for a median one-income \nfamily, according to a Tax Foundation study.\n  During the Clinton administration, Tax Freedom Day has leap frogged \nalmost 2 weeks from April 20 in 1992 to May 3 this year. The Clinton \nPresidency means working Americans have to spend an extra 13 days \nworking for Government. Not since the era of the Vietnam War and \nPresident Johnson's ``Great Society'' programs has Tax Freedom Day been \npushed back so far in such a short period of time--and this is from an \nadministration that claims it has put an end to ``big government.''\n  The Government is getting bigger, not smaller. Some people claim that \nbig Government is over because Government spending as a percentage of \nGDP is shrinking. The real question is how do we measure the size of \nthe Government? Is it the number of employees, the number of dollars \nspent, the tax burden, the hidden costs of regulations, or all of the \nabove? I believe it should be all of the above. The growth of the \neconomy does not have to be linked to the growth of Government. In \nfact, I have always said that we can streamline the Government and \nstill provide all the Government services we need.\n  A more meaningful way to measure Government spending is to look at \nthe number of dollars spent. Since President Clinton took office in \n1993, Government spending has increased from $1.40 trillion to $1.83 \ntrillion in 2000, a 30-percent rise. During the same period, Government \nrevenue increased from $1.15 trillion to $2.08 trillion, a 75-percent \nincrease.\n  The growth for domestic nondefense spending was 6.3 percent between \n1990 and 1995. In the last 2 years alone, nondefense spending grew by \n5.3 and 6.8 percent. President Clinton has proposed a 14-percent \nincrease in his last budget. If this is not big Government, what is?\n  If President Clinton's spending frenzy continues, it will wipe out \nthe entire $1.9 trillion non-Social Security surplus in less than 3 \nyears, leaving none of these tax overpayments to return to taxpayers in \nthe form of debt reduction, tax relief and Social Security reform. But \nour colleagues on the other\n\n[[Page S3325]]\n\nside of the aisle do not say this increased spending is risky. They \ninstead claim that our tax relief efforts to let the people keep a \nlittle more of their own money is risky.\n  People today work hard, and then are penalized for their work. With \npunitive taxes, Washington makes the American dream of working hard for \na better life more difficult, and for some, impossible. How can anyone \ncall the elimination of the marriage tax penalty for 21 million \nAmerican families risky?\n  It is clear that the American people are still overtaxed despite the \nprogress we have made to reduce taxes. Congress must provide meaningful \ntax relief to help alleviate the tax burden on working Americans.\n  But the only way we can effectively push back Tax Freedom Day is to \nterminate the tax code and replace it with one that promotes tax \nfreedom and economic opportunity. We must repeal the 16th amendment and \nabolish the IRS. We must create a new tax system that's fairer, \nsimpler, and friendlier to taxpayers.\n  Tax Freedom Day--it should be more than just another reminder of the \nhigh cost of Government. We owe it to the American taxpayers to work \ntogether to fix the system. Only when we begin to shorten the number of \ndays that Americans work for Government, and allow them to own the \nfruits of their labor, can we truly celebrate Tax Freedom Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/03/senate-section/article/S3325-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL FOR PRESIDENT AND MRS.

Mr. President, as you may know, on April 25, 2000, \nmany of my colleagues and I introduced S. 2459, legislation that would \naward President and Mrs. Ronald Reagan with the Congressional Gold \nMedal.\n  The bill has been received warmly in my home State as well. The \nPress-Sentinel of Jesup, GA, recently ran an editorial supporting my \nbill. I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Jesup, GA, Press-Sentinel, Apr. 26, 2000]\n\n                      A Fitting Tribute to Reagan\n\n       If Sen. Paul Coverdell has his way, former President Ronald \n     Reagan and his wife, Nancy, will become the 118th recipient \n     of the Congressional Gold Medal.\n       Tuesday, the Georgia senator introduced legislation that \n     would award the president and his wife the medal.\n       Said the senator, ``I am proud to sponsor this effort. \n     President and Mrs. Reagan are a constant source of \n     inspiration for me, as they are for many Americans. President \n     Reagan led us to the economic prosperity that we still enjoy \n     today and was instrumental in ending the Cold War. Mrs. \n     Reagan lent her grace and commitment to fighting the war on \n     drugs. Now as they battle the President's Alzheimer's Disease \n     together, it is fitting for this nation to thank them for \n     their leadership and for the role they played in shaping \n     American history.''\n       During his eight years in the White House, Reagan's role in \n     ending the Cold War will go down in history as perhaps his \n     greatest accomplishment.\n       Who can forget the challenge he hurled to his counterpart \n     in Moscow, Mikhail Gorbachev, when he stood at Berlin's \n     Brandenburg Gate and said, ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this \n     wall!''\n       In 1989, near the end of his term, the Berlin Wall came \n     down and a year later Germany was again reunited.\n       When told of plans to award the Reagans the medal, \n     Gorbachev said, ``The award of the Gold Medal of U.S. \n     Congress to Ronald Reagan is a fitting tribute to the 40th \n     president of the United States, who will go down in history \n     as a man profoundly dedicated to his people and committed to \n     the values of democracy and freedom.\n       ``Together with Ronald Reagan, we took the first, the most \n     important steps to end the cold war and start real nuclear \n     disarmament. . . .

As some of you \nmay know, I am a strong supporter of federal, state, and local efforts \nto create and enhance awareness of asthma and to improve asthma care \nthroughout this country and indeed throughout the world. I would also \nlike to extend sincere thanks to the many thousands of Americans and \nothers who work day after day to try to improve the way asthma is \ndiagnosed and treated.\n  In the last 15 years, the prevalence of asthma has doubled throughout \nthe world. More than 10 percent of children have asthma symptoms, and \nin some countries, as many as 30 percent are affected. In this country, \nasthma ranks among the most common chronic conditions, affecting more \nthan 15 million Americans, including 5 million children, and causing \nmore than 1.5 million emergency department visits, approximately \n500,000 hospitalizations, and more than 5,500 deaths. The estimated \ndirect and indirect monetary costs for this disease totaled $11.3 \nbillion in 1998, in the United States alone.\n  World Asthma Day 2000 is being marked by more than 80 countries \nthroughout the world. It is a partnership between health care groups \nand asthma educators organized by the Global Initiative for Asthma, \nGNA, which is a collaboration between the National Heart, Lung, and \nBlood Institute, NHLBI, of the National Institutes of Health and the \nWorld Health Organization. On this day, thousands of people throughout \nthe world will work together to create greater awareness of the need \nfor every person with asthma to obtain a timely diagnosis, receive \nappropriate treatment, learn to manage their asthma in partnership with \na health professional, and reduce exposure to environmental factors \nthat make their asthma worse.\n  Among those participating in World Asthma Day, via a special World \nAsthma Day Internet site (www.Webvention.org), will be Dr. David \nSatcher, Surgeon General of the United States, and Mr. Nelson Mandela, \nformer President of the Republic of South Africa and currently Chairman \nof the South African National Asthma Campaign. Ministers of Health from \nJapan, Turkey, Malaysia and other countries will also be available on \nthe Internet to answer questions about how the implementation of \ninternational asthma treatment guidelines can benefit patients and \nreduce health care costs.\n  In the U.S., local World Asthma Day activities are being coordinated \nby the NHLBI's National Asthma Education and Prevention Program and are \nlisted on its Web site (www.nhlbi.nih.gov). These activities range from \nlocal press conferences to school poster contests, and health fairs to \nscience museum education programs.\n  The NAEPP, along with the National Library of Medicine, Howard \nUniversity, the Office of the Mayor of the District of Columbia, the \nAmerican Lung\n\n[[Page S3326]]\n\nAssociation of the District of Columbia, and the D.C. public school \nsystem, will hold the official U.S. press conference to report on the \nstate of asthma in the United States and what is being done to combat \nthe problem.

A bill to extend the deadline for commencement of \nconstruction of a hydroelectric project in the State of Pennsylvania; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n         LEGISLATION PROVIDING FOR A PROJECT DEADLINE EXTENSION\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would reinstate and extend the deadline for construction of a \nPennsylvania hydroelectric power project. This extension is necessary \nbecause the Potter Township Power Authority (Project No. 7041) will \nlose their license from the Federal Regulatory Commission under Section \n13 of the Power Act. On many occasions, the Congress has granted \nsimilar noncontroversial extensions to licensees for projects in other \nstates. This legislation would provide additional time for the \nmunicipal licensees to conclude their negotiations with the potential \npower purchasers. In introducing this legislation, I am not expressing \nany personal views on whether the projects should go forward or on how \nthe projects should be funded; that is clearly the responsibility of \nthe municipal licensees and the residents of the township.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2499\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF DEADLINE AND REINSTATEMENT OF \n                   LICENSE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding the time period specified \n     in section 13 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 806) that \n     would otherwise apply to the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission project numbered 7041, the Commission shall, at \n     the request of the licensee for the project, extend the \n     period required for commencement of construction of the \n     project until December 31, 2001.\n       (b) Effective Date.--Subsection (a) takes effect on the \n     expiration of the period required for commencement of \n     construction of the project described in subsection (a).\n       (c) Reinstatement of Expired License.--If the license for \n     the project described in subsection (a) has expired before \n     the date of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall \n     reinstate the license effective as of the date of its \n     expiration and extend the time required for commencement of \n     construction as provided in subsection (a).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 2500. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to issue \na certificate of documentation with appropriate endorsement for \nemployment in the coastwise trade for the vessel Puffin; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                  JONES ACT WAIVER FOR THE ``PUFFIN''\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto waive the 1920 Merchant Marine Act, the so-called Jones Act, to \nallow Mr. Thomas Brooks Brener of Norwalk, Connecticut to commercially \noperate the Puffin, a sailing sloop built in the Netherlands in 1985.\n  Mr. Brener seeks the Jones Act waiver in order to reclassify the \nPuffin from a strictly recreational vessel to a charter or commercial \nvessel documented to operate with six or fewer paying passengers. If \ngranted this waiver, Mr. Brener intends to provide private sailing \ninstruction and captained private and charitable charters out of \nNorwalk, Connecticut.\n  The operating plan proposed by Mr. Brener is quite modest and limited \nin scale. With a total length of just under 36 feet and carrying six or \nfewer passengers, the Puffin  is not the foreign built challenge to \nAmerican shipyards and shipping envisioned by the drafters of the \nMerchant Marine Act of 1920. Indeed, it poses no threat to larger U.S. \ncoastal shipping interests. On the contrary, instead of being a threat \nto the local coastal trade, reclassification of the Puffin will provide \na beneficial service to the community of Norwalk and the people of \nsouthwestern Connecticut by creating an additional recreational and \nsmall business opportunity.\n  I believe it is altogether appropriate to grant a Jones Act waiver \nfor the sailing sloop Puffin and I urge the Senate to do so. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2500\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CERTIFICATE OF DOCUMENTATION.\n\n       Notwithstanding section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920 \n     (46 U.S.C. App. 883), section 8 of the Act of June 19, 1886 \n     (24 Stat. 81, chapter 421; 46 U.S.C. App. 289), and sections \n     12106 and 12108 of title 46, United States Code, the \n     Secretary of Transportation may issue a certificate of \n     documentation with appropriate endorsement for employment in \n     the coastwise trade for the vessel PUFFIN, United States \n     official number 697029.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON:\n  S. 1501. A bill to provide access and choice for use of generic drugs \ninstead of nongeneric drugs under Federal health care program, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n   GENERIC PHARMACEUTICAL ACCESS AND CHOICE FOR CONSUMERS ACT OF 2000\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today, I am introducing \nlegislation as one more step in my fight to combat rising prescription \ndrug prices and reduce the cost of medication for consumers in this \ncountry. My legislation, called the Generic Pharmaceutical Access and \nChoice For Consumers Act of 2000, aims to reduce the cost of \nprescription medication to American taxpayers and the U.S. government \nby encouraging the use of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, \ntherapeutically equivalent generic prescription drugs within the \nfederal health care programs, except if the non-generic form is either \nordered by the prescribing physician or requested by the patient.\n  The Generic Pharmaceutical Access and Choice For Consumers Act of \n2000 establishes a straightforward and cost-effective means of \nincreasing consumers' access and choice to safe, affordable generic \nprescription drugs\n\n[[Page S3329]]\n\nunder federal health care programs which could result in savings of \nmillions of dollars.\n  The Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), which last year \nspent $18.2 billion providing health insurance coverage to its \nestimated 4.12 million enrollees, spent nearly twenty percent, $3.6 \nbillion, of their insurance program costs on pharmaceutical benefits \nalone. This year brought little relief when the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) announced that FEHBP premium increases for the year \n2000 were about 9.3 percent, mostly attributable to the cost increase \nin prescription drug claims.\n  In 1997, about one-third of all prescriptions under the FEHBP were \nfor generic drugs. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which \nadministers the FEHBP, estimated that total costs for prescription \ndrugs would drop by about fifteen percent if half of all prescriptions \nwere for generic drugs.\n  A 1998 study conducted by the Congressional Budget Office estimates \nthat generic pharmaceutical substitution saves consumers nationwide \napproximately eight to ten billion dollars a year.\n  Some FEHBP plans and other federal health care programs do to some \nextent encourage the use of generic prescription drugs but the practice \nis not mandatory or universally incorporated into all programs. The \nGeneric Pharmaceutical Access and Choice For Consumers Act simply \ndirects all federal health care programs that provide prescription drug \nplans to fill prescriptions with FDA approved, therapeutically \nequivalent generic prescription drugs, except if the non-generic form \nis either ordered by the prescribing physician or requested by the \npatient.\n  I believe we can take greater steps to increase the utilization of \nhigh-quality, FDA approved generic pharmaceutical which cost between \ntwenty-five and sixty percent less than brand-name pharmaceutical, \nresulting in an estimated average savings of fifteen to thirty dollars \non each prescription filled.\n  Generic pharmaceutical are widely accepted by both consumers and the \nmedical profession, as the market share held by generic pharmaceutical \ncompared to brand-name prescription drugs has more than doubled during \nthe last decade, from approximately nineteen to forty-three percent, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office. Yet, despite accounting \nfor just over forty percent of the prescriptions drugs dispensed, \ngeneric pharmaceutical represent only 8 percent of the total dollar \nvolume spent on drugs.\n  Since there exists no current coverage for outpatient prescription \ndrugs under the Medicare program, a second component of my bill \nincludes a Sense of the Senate that legislative language requiring, to \nthe extent feasible, a preference for the safe and cost-effective use \nof generic pharmaceutical be considered in conjunction with any \nlegislation that adds a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare \nprogram. I strongly believe that the utilization of high-quality \ngeneric pharmaceutical in a Medicare prescription drug benefit would \nprovide a built in cost control mechanism that would help ensure the \neconomic feasibility and sustainability of any new benefit.\n  And third, the bill I am introducing today works to prevent a tactic \nused by the brand drug industry to prevent generics from reaching the \nconsumers by convincing state legislatures to pass unwarranted \nrestrictions to the substitution of generic versions of brand name \ndrugs. The campaign that some brand name drug companies lobby in some \nstates is nothing more than an attempt by the brand name companies to \nprotect their market share. The Generic Pharmaceutical Access and \nChoice For Consumers Act increases the level playing field for generic \npharmaceutical by requiring the Food and Drug Administration, where \nappropriate, to determine that a generic pharmaceutical is the \ntherapeutic equivalent of its brand-name counterpart, and affording \nnational uniformity to that determination.\n  The legislation would also prevent a State from establishing or \ncontinuing any requirement that keeps generic pharmaceutical off the \nmarket once FDA has determined that a generic drug is ``therapeutically \nequivalent'' to a brand name drug. This provision will ensure that \ngeneric prescription drugs get to the market in a timely fashion and \nprovide consumers with access and choice to low cost, high-quality \nalternatives.\n  As the year continues, we will see more discussion about how we \nprovide Medicare coverage of prescription drugs and I hope that \nultimately that's where we'll wind up some day. However, I believe that \nminimizing cost through full access to generic drugs must be part of \nany effort to address the prescription drug pricing issue. I introduced \nthe Generic Pharmaceutical Access and Choice For Consumers Act of 2000 \nto lay the ground work early in these discussions and take some \nconstructive steps in the right direction so that the American public \ncan get the full benefit of safe, affordable generic prescription drugs \nand taxpayers are treated right at the same time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2501\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Generic pharmaceuticals are approved by the Food and \n     Drug Administration on the basis of testing and other \n     information establishing that such pharmaceuticals are \n     therapeutically equivalent to brand-name pharmaceuticals, \n     ensuring consumers a safe, efficacious, and cost-effective \n     alternative to brand-name pharmaceuticals.\n       (2) The pharmaceutical market has become increasingly \n     competitive during the last decade because of the increasing \n     availability and accessibility of generic pharmaceuticals.\n       (3) The Congressional Budget Office estimates that--\n       (A) the substitution of generic pharmaceuticals for brand-\n     name pharmaceuticals will save purchasers of pharmaceuticals \n     between $8,000,000,000 and $10,000,000,000 each year; and\n       (B) quality generic pharmaceuticals cost between 25 percent \n     and 60 percent less than brand-name pharmaceuticals, \n     resulting in an estimated average savings of $15 to $30 on \n     each prescription filled.\n       (4) Generic pharmaceuticals are widely accepted by both \n     consumers and the medical profession, as the market share \n     held by generic pharmaceuticals compared to brand-name \n     pharmaceuticals has more than doubled during the last decade, \n     from approximately 19 percent to 43 percent, according to the \n     Congressional Budget Office.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to reduce the cost of prescription drugs to the United \n     States Government and to beneficiaries under Federal health \n     care programs while maintaining the quality of health care by \n     encouraging the use of generic drugs rather than nongeneric \n     drugs under those programs whenever feasible; and\n       (2) to increase the utilization of generic pharmaceuticals \n     by requiring the Food and Drug Administration, where \n     appropriate, to determine that a generic pharmaceutical is \n     the therapeutic equivalent of its brand-name counterpart, and \n     by affording national uniformity to that determination.\n\n           TITLE I--ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE USE OF GENERIC DRUGS\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to establish in the Office of the Architect of the \nCapitol the position of Director of Fire Safety and Protection to \nassume responsibility for fire safety and protection activities of the \nArchitect of the Capitol, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nRules and Administration.\n\n\n               UNITED STATES CAPITOL FIRE PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, \ntogether with my colleague, Senator Mikulski, to enhance fire safety \nand protection in the United States Capitol and the buildings within \nthe Capitol Complex.\n  Last year, in response to a request made by congressional employees \nunder the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, the General Counsel \nof the Office of Compliance conducted a fire safety inspection of the \nCapitol Complex. The resulting report, the Report on Fire Safety \nInspections of Congressional Buildings, outlined an alarming number of \nfire code violations in the U.S. Capitol, as well as the House and \nSenate Office Buildings. The report identified significant fire code \nviolations existing throughout every one of these buildings, including, \nbut not limited to, ``lack of fire barriers to retard the spread of \nfire and smoke, inadequate exit signs and exit capacity, deficient \nemergency lighting, limited sprinkler coverage, and dangerous storage \nof flammable and toxic materials.'' Furthermore, in March, the Office \nof Compliance issued eight citations ordering the Architect of the \nCapitol, who is responsible for fire safety and protection within the \nComplex, to take action to increase fire alarm and sprinkler systems \ntesting and improve the training of staff in the handling of hazardous \nmaterials.\n  My legislation seeks to address these fire code violations by \nimproving upon the expertise and accountability of the Office of the \nArchitect of the Capitol with regard to fire safety. The measure \nestablishes a position to be appointed by and responsible to the \nArchitect to meet his responsibility for fire safety and protection \nwithin the Capitol Complex. The Director of Fire Safety and Protection \nwill work to ensure that all properties under the jurisdiction of the \nArchitect, including the U.S. Capitol, House and Senate Office \nBuildings, Library of Congress, U.S. Botanical Gardens, and the Capitol \nPower Plant, meet the applicable codes and standards established by the \nNational Fire Protection Association. The Director will be responsible \nfor conducting regular inspections of the properties, as well as their \nfire alarm and protection systems, and training employees of the \nArchitect of the Capitol in the proper use and maintenance of these \nsystems and the storage of hazardous chemicals and materials. This \nlegislation would also require the Director to make semiannual reports \nto the Congress on the progress of his or her efforts in making the \nCapitol Complex fire-safe.\n  As a longtime advocate for historic preservation, I want to stress \nthat this legislation recognizes the historic nature of the buildings \nunder the jurisdiction of the Architect and provides the Director with \nthe flexibility necessary to ensure that the properties are preserved \nand rehabilitated in such a manner to retain their historical and \narchitectural significance.\n  Mr. President, the United States Capitol Fire Protection Act is an \nimportant step in addressing a critical situation. I urge my colleagues \nto support its passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url":

Res. 302\n\n       Whereas the State of New Jersey developed and implemented a \n     unique 2-tiered emergency medical services system nearly 25 \n     years ago as a result of studies conducted in New Jersey \n     about the best way to provide services to State residents;\n       Whereas the 2-tiered system established in New Jersey \n     includes volunteer and for-profit emergency medical \n     technicians who provide basic life support and hospital-based \n     paramedics who provide advanced life support;\n       Whereas the New Jersey system has provided universal access \n     for all New Jersey residents to affordable emergency \n     services, while simultaneously ensuring that those persons in \n     need of the most advanced care receive such care from the \n     proper authorities; \n       Whereas the New Jersey system currently has an estimated \n     20,000 emergency medical technicians providing ambulance \n     transportation for basic life support and advanced life \n     support emergencies, over 80 percent of which are handled by \n     volunteers who are not reimbursed under the medicare program \n     under title XVIII of the Social Security Act; \n       Whereas the hospital-based paramedics, also known as mobile \n     intensive care units, are reimbursed under the medicare \n     program when they respond to advanced life support \n     emergencies;\n       Whereas the New Jersey system saves the lives of thousands \n     of New Jersey residents each year, while saving the medicare \n     program an estimated $39,000,000 in reimbursement fees;\n       Whereas when Congress requested that the Health Care \n     Financing Administration enact changes to the emergency \n     medical services fee schedule as a result of the Balanced \n     Budget Act of 1997, including a general overhaul of \n     reimbursement rates and administrative costs, it was in the \n     spirit of streamlining the agency, controlling skyrocketing \n     healthcare costs, and lengthening the solvency of the \n     medicare program;\n       Whereas the Health Care Financing Administration is \n     considering implementing new emergency medical services \n     reimbursement guidelines that would destabilize or eliminate \n     the 2-tier system that has developed in the State of New \n     Jersey: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     Health Care Financing Administration should--\n       (1) consider the unique nature of the emergency medical \n     services delivery system in New Jersey when implementing new \n     reimbursement guidelines for paramedics and hospitals under \n     the medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security \n     Act; and\n       (2) promote innovative emergency medical service systems \n     enacted by States that reduce reimbursement costs to the \n     medicare program while ensuring that all residents receive \n     quick and appropriate emergency care when needed.\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nthat would greatly improve the lives of thousands of New Jersey \nresidents.\n  Healthcare in New Jersey has a long history of innovation and \nadvancement. From the large number of pharmaceutical companies that \ncreate new medicines, to the hospitals and facilities where innovative \ntherapies are develop, New Jersey remains one of the most progressive \nhealthcare States in the country. This State was one of the first to \nintroduce and pass a comprehensive patient's bill of rights, and one of \nthe first to recognize the importance of expanding access to healthcare \nto children and low income families.\n  One of New Jersey's greatest innovations, and one which truly \ndemonstrates the community based approach which has been so successful, \nis the development of our Emergency Medical Services (EMS) system. The \ncurrent EMS system in New Jersey, which has been in place for roughly \n25 years, was designed as a modern remedy to the age old problem of \nguaranteeing access to emergency transport, while at the same time \npreserving local involvement in the delivery of services and preventing \nskyrocketing costs.\n  The New Jersey EMS system accomplished all three goals by \nestablishing a two-tiered approach to emergency transport. This two-\ntiered system includes volunteer and for-profit Emergency Medical \nTechnicians (EMTs) who provide basic life support (BLS), and hospital-\nbased paramedics, who provide advanced life support (ALS). Basic and \nadvanced life support are differentiated by the status of the victim, \nwith the most serious injuries, such as heart attacks, treated by ALS \nparamedics.\n  The two-tiered system has been an unqualified success in New Jersey, \nproviding universal access for all residents to affordable emergency \nservices, while simultaneously ensuring that those persons in need of \nthe most advanced care receive it from the proper authorities. The \nsystem allows almost 500 local volunteer emergency medical technician \n(EMT) squads to blanket the entire State with quick and effective \ninitial responses to emergencies. In the case of more serious \nemergencies, paramedics are strategically stationed at various \nhospitals throughout the State to provide secondary assistance. In \neither case, the EMTs will generally transport patients to the hospital \nwith the paramedics, if necessary, along to provide care.\n  There are currently an estimated 20,000 EMTs providing ambulance \ntransportation for virtually all BLS and ALS emergencies, close to \n400,000 calls each year. It is estimated that over 80 percent of these \ncalls are handled by volunteers who are not reimbursed by Medicare. In \ncontrast, the hospital-based paramedics, also known as mobile intensive \ncare units (MICUs), are reimbursed by Medicare when they respond to ALS \nemergencies, just as all other paramedics.\n  Unfortunately, the great success of this system would be jeopardized \nif the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) finalizes plans to \nimplement new rules regarding the reimbursement of EMS services. The \nnew HCFA EMS guidelines propose to only provide reimbursement to \nhospital-based paramedics. This would have the effect of requiring them \nto be the only responders to provide transport for all victims in order \nto be reimbursed by Medicare. This, in turn, would eliminate the two-\ntier structure by solely recognizing MICUs, and thus also eliminate the \nneed for volunteer EMS units, which currently provide the bulk of the \ntransport. Under the new rules, there would be no incentive for EMS \nunits to respond to calls of they know their mission has been given to \nMICUs.\n  While I applaud HCFAs intentions in releasing the new rules, which \nare designed to control costs by enforcing one, standardized, system \nthroughout the country, I am dismayed by the impact this will have on \nNew Jersey. Our system, when compared to the system HCFA is set to \napprove, would save an estimated $39 million annually, due to the \npreponderance of BLS calls and the large number of EMS volunteers who \nrespond to these calls. But beyond the cost savings, the elimination of \nEMS units would jeopardize the prompt service that New Jersey residents \nhave come to rely on.\n  The resolution I am submitting today seeks to emphasize the benefits \nof two-tiered EMS in my State, and request that HCFA do its best to \npreserve this highly beneficial and cost effective system. HCFA has \nalways been a strong supporter of measures that improve the delivery of \nhealthcare services, while lowering the cost to taxpayers. I believe \nthat once they have been made fully aware of the importance of this \nissue, the agency will act responsibly and include an exemption for New \nJersey.\n  It is my hope that the Senate will see the importance of supporting \nmy resolution, not just for the impact it will have on the residents of \nmy State, by also for the statement it will make about the Heath Care \nFinancing Administration's mission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/03/senate-section/article/S3333-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3333-S3449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 GORTON (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3110\n\n  Mr. GORTON (for himself, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Lott, Mr. Coverdell, Ms. \nCollins, and Mr. Voinovich) proposed an amendment to the bill (S. 2) to \nextend programs and activities under the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act of 1965, as follows:\n\n       On page 630, strike lines 24 and 25.\n       On page 653, strike lines 12 through 22.\n       On page 654, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n       ``(12) Achievement gap reductions.--An assurance that the \n     State will reduce by 10 percent over the 5-year term of the \n     performance agreement, the difference between the highest and \n     lowest performing groups of students described in section \n     6803(d)(5)(C) that meet the State's proficient and advanced \n     level of performance.\n       ``(13) Serving disadvantaged schools and school \n     districts.--An assurance that the State will use funds made \n     available under this part to serve disadvantaged schools and \n     school districts.\n       On page 656, beginning with line 22, strike all through \n     page 657, line 5, and insert the following:\n       ``(9) Section 1502.\n       ``(10) Any other provision of this Act that is not in \n     effect on the date of enactment of\n\n[[Page S3334]]\n\n     the Educational Opportunities Act under which the Secretary \n     provides grants to States on the basis of a formula.\n       ``(11) Section 310 of the Department of Education \n     Appropriations Act, 2000.\n       On page 657, line 6, strike ``(11)'' and insert ``(12)''.\n       On page 657, line 9, strike ``(12)'' and insert ``(13)''.\n       On page 657, line 21, insert ``that are consistent with \n     part A of title X and'' after ``purposes''.\n       On page 665, strike lines 16 through 18, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``To the extent that the provisions of this part are \n     inconsistent with part A of title X, part A of title X shall \n     be construed as superseding such provisions.\n       On page 846, line 15, strike ``and''.\n       On page 846, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n       ``(E) part H of title VI; and\n       On page 846, line 16, strike ``(E)'' and insert ``(F)''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                DASCHLE (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3111\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Harkin, Mrs. \nMurray, Mr. Reed, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. Durbin) proposed \nan amendment to the bill, S. 2, supra; as follows:\n\n       In the committee substitute strike all after ``section 1'' \n     on page 4 line 14 and insert the following:\n\n     1.

Areas in which the Nation has made progress toward \n     these Goals during the last decade include:\n       (A) On Goal #1, that all children will start school ready \n     to learn, there has been an increase in the percentages of--\n       (i) preschool children whose parents read to them or tell \n     them stories; and\n       (ii) 2-year-old children who have been fully immunized \n     against preventable childhood diseases.\n       (B) On Goal #3, that all students demonstrate competency \n     over challenging subject matter, the percentage of fourth, \n     eighth, and twelfth grade students who meet the Goals Panel's \n     performance standard in mathematics has increased.\n       (C) On Goal #5, that United States students become first in \n     the world in mathematics and science achievement, the \n     percentage of all college degrees awarded that are in \n     mathematics and science has increased for all students.\n       (D) On Goal #7, that every school in the United States will \n     be free of drugs, violence, and the unauthorized presence of \n     firearms and alcohol, the percentage of students who report \n     that they have been threatened or injured at school has \n     decreased.\n       (4) Areas in which the Nation has been unsuccessful in \n     making progress toward these Goals during the last decade \n     include:\n       (A) On Goal #4, that all teachers have access to programs \n     for the continued improvement of their professional skills, \n     the percentage of secondary school teachers who hold a degree \n     in the subject that is their main teaching assignment has \n     decreased.\n       (B) On Goal #6, that every adult will be literate and \n     prepared to compete in the global economy and exercise the \n     rights of citizenship--\n       (i) fewer adults with a high school diploma or less, and \n     who need additional training, are participating in adult \n     education than individuals who have a postsecondary \n     education; and\n       (ii) the difference between the percentage of Black high \n     school graduates who complete a college degree and the \n     percentage of white high school graduates who complete a \n     college degree has increased.\n       (C) On Goal #7, that every school in the United States will \n     be free of drugs, violence, and the unauthorized presence of \n     firearms and alcohol--\n       (i) the percentage of students reporting that they have \n     used an illicit drug, or that someone offered to sell or give \n     them drugs, has increased;\n       (ii) the percentage of public school teachers who report \n     that they were threatened or injured at school has increased; \n     and\n       (iii) a higher percentage of secondary school teachers \n     report that student disruptions in their classrooms interfere \n     with their teaching.\n       (5) Because States began the 1990s at various levels of \n     achievement with respect to each of the Goals, the time and \n     effort needed to reach the Goals will vary from State to \n     State and from Goal to Goal.\n       (6) Individual States have made significant progress toward \n     the Goals, and some States have made progress in multiple \n     areas. Areas in which States have made progress toward the \n     Goals during the last decade include:\n       (A) With respect to Goal #1, that all children will start \n     school ready to learn--\n       (i) 35 States have reduced the percentage of infants born \n     with one or more of four health risks;\n       (ii) 50 States have increased the percentage of mothers \n     receiving early prenatal care; and\n       (iii) 47 States have increased the percentage of children \n     with disabilities participating in preschool.\n       (B) With respect to Goal #2, that at least 90 percent of \n     all students graduate from high school--\n       (i) 10 States have increased the percentage of young adults \n     who have a high school diploma; and\n       (ii) 3 States have reduced the percentage of students in \n     grades 9 through 12 who leave school without completing a \n     recognized program of secondary education.\n       (C) With respect to Goal #3, that all students demonstrate \n     competency over subject matter--\n       (i) 27 States have increased the percentage of 8th-grade \n     students who achieved to at least the ``proficient'' standard \n     on the 1996 National Assessment of Educational Progress \n     (NAEP) in mathematics; and\n       (ii) 50 States have increased the percentage of students \n     that received a score on an Advanced Placement examination \n     that permitted the students to earn college credits in the \n     subject area tested.\n       (D) With respect to Goal #4, that all teachers have access \n     to programs for the continued improvement of their \n     professional skills, 17 States have increased the percentage \n     of public school teachers who received support from a master \n     or mentor teacher during their first year of teaching.\n       (E) With respect to Goal #5, that United States students \n     become first in the world in mathematics and science \n     achievement--\n       (i) 47 States have increased the percentage of all degrees \n     that were awarded in mathematics and science;\n       (ii) 33 States have increased the percentage of all degrees \n     in mathematics and science that were awarded to minority \n     students; and\n       (iii) 42 States have increased the percentage of all \n     degrees in mathematics and science that were awarded to \n     female students.\n       (F) With respect to Goal #6, that every adult will be \n     literate and prepared to compete in the global economy and \n     exercise the rights of citizenship--\n       (i) 39 States have increased the percentage of high school \n     graduates who immediately enroll in an institution of higher \n     education; and\n       (ii) 10 States have increased the percentage of their \n     citizens who registered to vote.\n       (G) With respect to Goal #8, that every school will promote \n     partnerships that increase parental involvement, 17 States \n     have increased the influence of parent associations in \n     setting public school policies.\n       (7) Areas in which States have been unsuccessful in making \n     progress toward these Goals during the 1990s include:\n       (A) On Goal #1, that all children will start school ready \n     to learn, the percentage of infants born at low birthweight \n     has increased in 32 States.\n       (B) On Goal #2, that at least 90 percent of all students \n     graduate from high school, the high school dropout rate has \n     increased in 10 States.\n       (C) On Goal #6, that every adult will be literate and \n     prepared to compete in the global economy and exercise the \n     rights of citizenship, lower percentages of students are \n     enrolling in college immediately after high school in 11 \n     States.\n       (D) On Goal #7, that every school in the United States will \n     be free of drugs, violence, and the unauthorized presence of \n     firearms and alcohol--\n       (i) student use of marijuana has increased in 16 States;\n       (ii) the percentage of students who report that drugs are \n     available on school property has increased in 15 States; and\n       (iii) the percentage of public school teachers reporting \n     that student disruptions in class interfere with their \n     teaching has increased in 37 States.\n\n[[Page S3336]]\n\n       (8) The continued pursuit of these Goals is necessary to \n     ensure continued, and more evenly distributed, progress \n     across our Nation.\n       (9) Federal programs and policies have contributed to \n     States' ability to offer high-quality education to all \n     students and have helped States to implement reforms intended \n     to raise the achievement level of every child.\n       (10) Even though all the Goals have not been reached, nor \n     accomplished to equal degrees, there is a continued need to \n     reaffirm these Goals as a benchmark to which all students can \n     strive and attain.\n       (b) America's Education Goals.--The Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) is \n     amended--\n       (1) by amending the heading for section 1 to read as \n     follows: ``SHORT TITLE.'';

Consequently, teachers in rural schools are \n     almost twice as likely to provide instruction in 3 or more \n     subjects than teachers in urban schools. Rural schools also \n     face other tough challenges, such as shrinking local tax \n     bases, high transportation costs, aging buildings, limited \n     course offerings, and limited resources.\n       ``(4) Small school districts with fewer than 600 students \n     often cannot use Federal grant funds distributed by formula \n     because the formula allocation does not provide enough \n     revenue to carry out the program the grant is intended to \n     fund.\n       ``(5) The ability of the Nation's major urban public school \n     systems to meet the Nation's educational goals will \n     substantially determine the country's economic \n     competitiveness and academic standing in the world community.\n       ``(6) The quality of public education in the Nation's major \n     urban areas has a direct effect on the economic development \n     of the Nation's cities.\n       ``(7) The success of urban public schools in accelerating \n     the achievement of the youth attending such schools will \n     determine the ability of the Nation to close the gap between \n     the `haves and the have-nots' in society.\n       ``(8) The cost to America's businesses to provide remedial \n     education to high school graduates is approximately \n     $21,000,000,000 per year.\n       ``(9) Approximately \\1/3\\ of the Nation's workforce are \n     members of minority groups.\n       ``(10) Urban schools enroll a disproportionately large \n     share of the Nation's poor and `at-risk' youth.\n       ``(11) Urban schools enroll over \\1/3\\ of the Nation's \n     poor, 40 percent of the Nation's African-American children, \n     and 30 percent of the Nation's Hispanic youth.\n       ``(12) Nearly 40 percent of the Nation's limited-English-\n     proficient children and 15 percent of the Nation's disabled \n     youth are enrolled in urban public schools.\n       ``(13) The National Assessment of Educational Progress (in \n     this section referred to as `NAEP') shows substantial \n     achievement gaps between urban and non-urban students, \n     whether enrolled in high poverty or low poverty schools.\n       ``(14) Urban school children have begun to narrow the \n     achievement gap in reading according to the recent NAEP \n     Reading Report Card.\n       ``(15) The NAEP shows substantial achievement gaps between \n     white students, and African-American and Hispanic students.\n       ``(16) African-American and Hispanic school children have \n     begun to narrow the achievement gap in reading according to \n     the recent NAEP Reading Report Card.\n       ``(17) The dropout rate for urban students is more than 50 \n     percent higher than the national dropout rate.\n       ``(18) Urban preschoolers have \\1/2\\ the access to early \n     childhood development programs as do other children.\n       ``(19) Teacher shortages and teacher turnover in urban \n     public school systems are substantially greater than in non-\n     urban school systems, particularly in math and science.\n       ``(20) Urban public school systems have less parental \n     involvement, and greater problems with health care, teenage \n     pregnancy, truancy and discipline, drug abuse, and gangs than \n     do other kinds of school systems.\n       ``(21) Urban school buildings are in more serious disrepair \n     according to the General Accounting Office than facilities in \n     other kinds of school systems, with 75 percent of urban \n     public school buildings being over 25 years old, 33 percent \n     of such buildings being over 50 years old, thus creating poor \n     and demoralizing working and learning conditions.\n       ``(22) Solving the challenges facing our Nation's urban \n     schools will require the concerted and collaborative efforts \n     of all levels of government and all sectors of the community.\n       ``(23) Federal and State funding of urban public schools \n     has not adequately reflected need.\n       ``(24) Federal funding that is well-targeted, flexible, and \n     accountable would contribute significantly to addressing the \n     comprehensive needs of inner-city public schools and school \n     children.\n\n     ``SEC. 6204.

FINDINGS.\n\n       ``Congress makes the following findings:\n       ``(1) While there are rural education initiatives at the \n     State and local levels, no Federal education policy focuses \n     on the specific needs of rural school districts and schools, \n     especially those that serve poor students.\n       ``(2) The National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) \n     reports that 46 percent of our Nation's public schools serve \n     rural areas.\n       ``(3) A critical problem for rural school districts \n     involves the hiring and retention of qualified administrators \n     and certified teachers (especially in science and \n     mathematics). Consequently, teachers in rural schools are \n     almost twice as likely to provide instruction in 3 or more \n     subjects than teachers in urban schools. Rural schools also \n     face other tough challenges, such as shrinking local tax \n     bases, high transportation costs, aging buildings, limited \n     course offerings, and limited resources.\n\n     ``SEC. 6214.

IMMIGRANTS TO NEW AMERICANS MODEL PROGRAMS.\n\n       Title VII (20 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), as amended by section \n     706, in amended by inserting after section 7114 the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 7115. IMMIGRANTS TO NEW AMERICANS MODEL PROGRAMS.\n\n       ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       ``(1) In 1997, there were an estimated 25,800,000 foreign-\n     born individuals residing in the United States. That number \n     is the largest number of such foreign-born individuals ever \n     in United States history and represents a 6,000,000, or 30 \n     percent, increase over the 1990 census figure of 19,800,000 \n     of such foreign-born individuals. The Bureau of the Census \n     estimates that the recently arrived immigrant population \n     (including the refugee population) currently residing in the \n     Nation will account for 75 percent of the population growth \n     in the United States over the next 50 years.\n       ``(2) For millions of immigrants settling into the Nation's \n     hamlets, towns, and cities, the dream of ``life, liberty, and \n     the pursuit of happiness'' has become a reality. The wave of \n     immigrants, from various nationalities, who have chosen the \n     United States as their home, has positively influenced the \n     Nation's image and relationship with other nations. The \n     diverse cultural heritage of the Nation's immigrants has \n     helped define the Nation's culture, customs, economy, and \n     communities. By better understanding the people who have \n     immigrated to the Nation, individuals in the United States \n     better understand what it means to be an American.\n       ``(3) There is a critical shortage of teachers with the \n     skills needed to educate immigrant students and their \n     families in nonconcentrated, nontraditional, immigrant \n     communities as well as communities with large immigrant \n     populations. The large influx of immigrant families over the \n     last decade presents a national dilemma: The number of such \n     families with school-age children, requiring assistance to \n     successfully participate in elementary schools, secondary \n     schools, and communities in the United States, is increasing \n     without a corresponding increase in the number of teachers \n     with skills to accommodate their needs.\n       ``(4) Immigrants arriving in communities across the Nation \n     generally settle into high-poverty areas, where funding for \n     programs to\n\n[[Page S3401]]\n\n     provide immigrant students and their families with the \n     services the students and families need to successfully \n     participate in elementary schools, secondary schools, and \n     communities in the United States is inadequate.\n       ``(5) The influx of immigrant families settling into many \n     United States communities is often the result of concerted \n     efforts by local employers who value immigrant labor. Those \n     employers realize that helping immigrants to become \n     productive, prosperous members of a community is beneficial \n     for the local businesses involved, the immigrants, and the \n     community. Further, local businesses benefit from the \n     presence of the immigrant families because the families \n     present businesses with a committed and effective workforce \n     and help to open up new market opportunities. However, many \n     of the communities into which the immigrants have settled \n     need assistance in order to give immigrant students and their \n     families the services the students and families need to \n     successfully participate in elementary schools, secondary \n     schools, and communities, in the United States.\n       ``(b) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to establish \n     a grant program, within the Department of Education, that \n     provides funding to partnerships of local educational \n     agencies and community-based organizations for the \n     development of model programs to provide to immigrant \n     students and their families the services the students and \n     families need to successfully participate in elementary \n     schools, secondary schools, and communities, in the United \n     States.\n       ``(c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       ``(1) Community-based organization; elementary school; \n     local educational agency; secondary school.--The terms \n     `community-based organization', `elementary school', `local \n     educational agency', and `secondary school' have the meanings \n     given the terms in section 14101 of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 8801).\n       ``(2) Immigrant.--The term `immigrant' has the meaning \n     given the term in section 101 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101).\n       ``(d) Program Authorized.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The Secretary is authorized to award not \n     more than 10 grants in a fiscal year to eligible partnerships \n     for the design and implementation of model programs to--\n       ``(A) assist immigrant students to achieve in elementary \n     schools and secondary schools in the United States by \n     offering such educational services as English as a second \n     language classes, literacy programs, programs for \n     introduction to the education system, and civics education; \n     and\n       ``(B) assist parents of immigrant students by offering such \n     services as parent education and literacy development \n     services and by coordinating activities with other entities \n     to provide comprehensive community social services such as \n     health care, job training, child care, and transportation \n     services.\n       ``(2) Duration.--Each grant awarded under this section \n     shall be awarded for a period of not more than 5 years.

FINDINGS.\n\n       ``Congress finds the following:\n       ``(1) Native Hawaiians are a distinct and unique indigenous \n     people with a historical continuity to the original \n     inhabitants of the Hawaiian archipelago, whose society was \n     organized as a nation and internationally recognized as a \n     nation by the United States, Britain, France, and Japan, as \n     evidenced by treaties governing friendship, commerce, and \n     navigation.\n       ``(2) At the time of the arrival of the first non-\n     indigenous people in Hawai'i in 1778, the Native Hawaiian \n     people lived in a highly organized, self-sufficient \n     subsistence social system based on a communal land tenure \n     system with a sophisticated language, culture, and religion.\n       ``(3) A unified monarchal government of the Hawaiian \n     Islands was established in 1810 under Kamehameha I, the first \n     King of Hawai`i.\n       ``(4) From 1826 until 1893, the United States recognized \n     the sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom of Hawai`i, \n     which was established in 1810 under Kamehameha I, extended \n     full and complete diplomatic recognition to the Kingdom of \n     Hawai`i, and entered into treaties and conventions with the \n     Kingdom of Hawai`i to govern friendship, commerce and \n     navigation in 1826, 1842, 1849, 1875, and 1887.\n       ``(5) In 1893, the sovereign, independent, internationally \n     recognized, and indigenous government of Hawai`i, the Kingdom \n     of Hawai`i, was overthrown by a small group of non-Hawaiians, \n     including United States citizens, who were assisted in their \n     efforts by the United States Minister, a United States naval \n     representative, and armed naval forces of the United States. \n     Because of the participation of United States agents and \n     citizens in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai`i, in 1993 \n     the United States apologized to Native Hawaiians for the \n     overthrow and the deprivation of the rights of Native \n     Hawaiians\n\n[[Page S3416]]\n\n     to self-determination through Public Law 103-150 (107 Stat. \n     1510).\n       ``(6) In 1898, the joint resolution entitled `Joint \n     Resolution to provide for annexing the Hawaiian Islands to \n     the United States', approved July 7, 1898 (30 Stat. 750), \n     ceded absolute title of all lands held by the Republic of \n     Hawai`i, including the government and crown lands of the \n     former Kingdom of Hawai`i, to the United States, but mandated \n     that revenue generated from the lands be used `solely for the \n     benefit of the inhabitants of the Hawaiian Islands for \n     educational and other public purposes'.\n       ``(7) By 1919, the Native Hawaiian population had declined \n     from an estimated 1,000,000 in 1778 to an alarming 22,600, \n     and in recognition of this severe decline, Congress enacted \n     the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108), which \n     designated approximately 200,000 acres of ceded public lands \n     for homesteading by Native Hawaiians.\n       ``(8) Through the enactment of the Hawaiian Homes \n     Commission Act, 1920, Congress affirmed the special \n     relationship between the United States and the Native \n     Hawaiians, which was described by then Secretary of the \n     Interior Franklin K. Lane, who said: `One thing that \n     impressed me . . . was the fact that the natives of the \n     island who are our wards, I should say, and for whom in a \n     sense we are trustees, are falling off rapidly in numbers and \n     many of them are in poverty.'.\n       ``(9) In 1938, Congress again acknowledged the unique \n     status of the Hawaiian people by including in the Act of June \n     20, 1938 (52 Stat. 781, chapter 530; 16 U.S.C. 391b, 391b-1, \n     392b, 392c, 396, 396a), a provision to lease lands within the \n     National Parks extension to Native Hawaiians and to permit \n     fishing in the area `only by native Hawaiian residents of \n     said area or of adjacent villages and by visitors under their \n     guidance.'.\n       ``(10) Under the Act entitled `An Act to provide for the \n     admission of the State of Hawai`i into the Union', approved \n     March 18, 1959 (73 Stat. 4), the United States transferred \n     responsibility for the administration of the Hawaiian Home \n     Lands to the State of Hawai`i but reaffirmed the trust \n     relationship between the United States and the Hawaiian \n     people by retaining the exclusive power to enforce the trust, \n     including the power to approve land exchanges and amendments \n     to such Act affecting the rights of beneficiaries under such \n     Act.\n       ``(11) In 1959, under the Act entitled `An Act to provide \n     for the admission of the State of Hawai`i into the Union', \n     the United States also ceded to the State of Hawai`i title to \n     the public lands formerly held by the United States, but \n     mandated that such lands be held by the State `in public \n     trust' and reaffirmed the special relationship that existed \n     between the United States and the Hawaiian people by \n     retaining the legal responsibility to enforce the public \n     trust responsibility of the State of Hawai`i for the \n     betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians, as defined \n     in section 201(a) of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920.\n       ``(12) The United States has recognized and reaffirmed \n     that--\n       ``(A) Native Hawaiians have a cultural, historic, and land-\n     based link to the indigenous people who exercised sovereignty \n     over the Hawaiian Islands, and that group has never \n     relinquished its claims to sovereignty or its sovereign \n     lands;\n       ``(B) Congress does not extend services to Native Hawaiians \n     because of their race, but because of their unique status as \n     the indigenous people of a once sovereign nation as to whom \n     the United States has established a trust relationship;\n       ``(C) Congress has also delegated broad authority to \n     administer a portion of the Federal trust responsibility to \n     the State of Hawai`i;\n       ``(D) the political status of Native Hawaiians is \n     comparable to that of American Indians and Alaska Natives; \n     and\n       ``(E) the aboriginal, indigenous people of the United \n     States have--\n       ``(i) a continuing right to autonomy in their internal \n     affairs; and\n       ``(ii) an ongoing right of self-determination and self-\n     governance that has never been extinguished.\n       ``(13) The political relationship between the United States \n     and the Native Hawaiian people has been recognized and \n     reaffirmed by the United States, as evidenced by the \n     inclusion of Native Hawaiians in--\n       ``(A) the Native American Programs Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. \n     2991 et seq.);\n       ``(B) the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1996);\n       ``(C) the National Museum of the American Indian Act (20 \n     U.S.C. 80q et seq.);\n       ``(D) the Native American Graves Protection and \n     Repatriation Act (25 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.);\n       ``(E) the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 \n     et seq.);\n       ``(F) the Native American Languages Act (25 U.S.C. 2901 et \n     seq.);\n       ``(G) the American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n     Hawaiian Culture and Art Development Act (20 U.S.C. 4401 et \n     seq.);\n       ``(H) the Job Training Partnership Act (29 U.S.C. 1501 et \n     seq.) and the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (29 U.S.C. \n     2801 et seq.); and\n       ``(I) the Older Americans Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3001 et \n     seq.).\n       ``(14) In 1981, Congress instructed the Office of Education \n     to submit to Congress a comprehensive report on Native \n     Hawaiian education. The report, entitled the `Native Hawaiian \n     Educational Assessment Project', was released in 1983 and \n     documented that Native Hawaiians scored below parity with \n     regard to national norms on standardized achievement tests, \n     were disproportionately represented in many negative social \n     and physical statistics indicative of special educational \n     needs, and had educational needs that were related to their \n     unique cultural situation, such as different learning styles \n     and low self-image.\n       ``(15) In recognition of the educational needs of Native \n     Hawaiians, in 1988, Congress enacted title IV of the Augustus \n     F. Hawkins-Robert T. Stafford Elementary and Secondary School \n     Improvement Amendments of 1988 (102 Stat. 130) to authorize \n     and develop supplemental educational programs to address the \n     unique conditions of Native Hawaiians.\n       ``(16) In 1993, the Kamehameha Schools Bishop Estate \n     released a 10-year update of findings of the Native Hawaiian \n     Educational Assessment Project, which found that despite the \n     successes of the programs established under title IV of the \n     Augustus F. Hawkins-Robert T. Stafford Elementary and \n     Secondary School Improvement Amendments of 1988, many of the \n     same educational needs still existed for Native Hawaiians. \n     Subsequent reports by the Kamehameha Schools Bishop Estate \n     and other organizations have generally confirmed those \n     findings. For example--\n       ``(A) educational risk factors continue to start even \n     before birth for many Native Hawaiian children, including--\n       ``(i) late or no prenatal care;\n       ``(ii) high rates of births by Native Hawaiian women who \n     are unmarried; and\n       ``(iii) high rates of births to teenage parents;\n       ``(B) Native Hawaiian students continue to begin their \n     school experience lagging behind other students in terms of \n     readiness factors such as vocabulary test scores;\n       ``(C) Native Hawaiian students continue to score below \n     national norms on standardized education achievement tests at \n     all grade levels;\n       ``(D) both public and private schools continue to show a \n     pattern of lower percentages of Native Hawaiian students in \n     the uppermost achievement levels and in gifted and talented \n     programs;\n       ``(E) Native Hawaiian students continue to be \n     overrepresented among students qualifying for special \n     education programs provided to students with learning \n     disabilities, mild mental retardation, emotional impairment, \n     and other such disabilities;\n       ``(F) Native Hawaiians continue to be underrepresented in \n     institutions of higher education and among adults who have \n     completed 4 or more years of college;\n       ``(G) Native Hawaiians continue to be disproportionately \n     represented in many negative social and physical statistics \n     indicative of special educational needs, as demonstrated by \n     the fact that--\n       ``(i) Native Hawaiian students are more likely to be \n     retained in grade level and to be excessively absent in \n     secondary school;\n       ``(ii) Native Hawaiian students have the highest rates of \n     drug and alcohol use in the State of Hawai`i; and\n       ``(iii) Native Hawaiian children continue to be \n     disproportionately victimized by child abuse and neglect; and\n       ``(H) Native Hawaiians now comprise over 23 percent of the \n     students served by the State of Hawai`i Department of \n     Education, and there are and will continue to be \n     geographically rural, isolated areas with a high Native \n     Hawaiian population density.\n       ``(17) In the 1998 National Assessment of Educational \n     Progress, Hawaiian fourth-graders ranked 39th among groups of \n     students from 39 States in reading. Given that Hawaiian \n     students rank among the lowest groups of students nationally \n     in reading, and that Native Hawaiian students rank the lowest \n     among Hawaiian students in reading, it is imperative that \n     greater focus be placed on beginning reading and early \n     education and literacy in Hawai`i.\n       ``(18) The findings described in paragraphs (16) and (17) \n     are inconsistent with the high rates of literacy and \n     integration of traditional culture and Western education \n     historically achieved by Native Hawaiians through a Hawaiian \n     language-based public school system established in 1840 by \n     Kamehameha III.\n       ``(19) Following the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai`i in \n     1893, Hawaiian medium schools were banned. After annexation, \n     throughout the territorial and statehood period of Hawai`i, \n     and until 1986, use of the Hawaiian language as an \n     instructional medium in education in public schools was \n     declared unlawful. The declaration caused incalculable harm \n     to a culture that placed a very high value on the power of \n     language, as exemplified in the traditional saying: `I ka \n     `olelo no ke ola; I ka `olelo no ka make. In the language \n     rests life; In the language rests death.'.\n       ``(20) Despite the consequences of over 100 years of \n     nonindigenous influence, the Native Hawaiian people are \n     determined to preserve, develop, and transmit to future \n     generations their ancestral territory and their cultural \n     identity in accordance with their own spiritual and \n     traditional beliefs, customs, practices, language, and social \n     institutions.\n       ``(21) The State of Hawai`i, in the constitution and \n     statutes of the State of Hawai`i--\n       ``(A) reaffirms and protects the unique right of the Native \n     Hawaiian people to practice and perpetuate their culture and \n     religious customs, beliefs, practices, and language;\n\n[[Page S3417]]\n\n       ``(B) recognizes the traditional language of the Native \n     Hawaiian people as an official language of the State of \n     Hawai`i, which may be used as the language of instruction for \n     all subjects and grades in the public school system; and\n       ``(C) promotes the study of the Hawaiian culture, language, \n     and history by providing a Hawaiian education program and \n     using community expertise as a suitable and essential means \n     to further the program.\n\n     ``SEC. 9203.

Native performance on \n     standardized tests is low, Native student dropout rates are \n     high, and Natives are significantly underrepresented among \n     holders of baccalaureate degrees in the State of Alaska. As a \n     result, Native students are being denied their opportunity to \n     become full participants in society by grade school and high \n     school educations that are condemning an entire generation to \n     an underclass status and a life of limited choices.\n       ``(5) The programs authorized in this title, combined with \n     expanded Head Start, infant learning and early childhood \n     education programs, and parent education programs are \n     essential if educational handicaps are to be overcome.\n       ``(6) The sheer magnitude of the geographic barriers to be \n     overcome in delivering educational services in rural Alaska \n     and Alaska villages should be addressed through the \n     development and implementation of innovative, model programs \n     in a variety of areas.\n       ``(7) Congress finds that Native children should be \n     afforded the opportunity to begin their formal education on a \n     par with their non-Native peers.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       ``(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       ``(1) All high school students must obtain the academic \n     foundations needed for further education and training, and to \n     succeed in an economy that is increasingly characterized by \n     global competition, evolving technologies, and high demands \n     for a skilled, literate, and adaptable workforce.\n       ``(2) To be effective, high schools must not only prepare \n     students academically, they must also ensure that students \n     are connecting with adults and are receiving the necessary \n     supports to continue their personal and interpersonal growth \n     during this critical transition stage.\n       ``(3) Effective high schools are places where students feel \n     safe, the school is free of drugs, and the classrooms are \n     disciplined environments where all students can learn. High \n     schools are increasingly larger places where students feel \n     increasingly disconnected from adults and often from their \n     peers, particularly in urban and suburban areas. Research \n     shows that when students feel connected to school and to \n     their parents, they are less likely than other adolescents to \n     suffer from emotional distress, have suicidal thoughts and \n     behaviors, use violence, and smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, \n     or smoke marijuana.\n       ``(4) Research and national data collections indicate that \n     many high schools do not succeed in meeting both the academic \n     and developmental needs of students. For example--\n       ``(A) more than 20 percent of Americans, ages 25 through \n     29, do not have a regular high school diploma;\n       ``(B) on the most recent international assessment of \n     mathematics and science knowledge, the Third International \n     Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), American 12th-graders \n     outperformed students from only two of the 21 other \n     participating Nations. A comparison of these assessment \n     results with 4th-grade and 8th-grade TIMSS scores indicates \n     that American students lose ground during the high school \n     years;\n       ``(C) recent results from National Assessment of \n     Educational Progress reading assessments for 12th-graders \n     indicate improvement in the performance of higher-achieving \n     students, but no improvement in the scores for the lowest-\n     achieving students;\n       ``(D) the problems facing high schools are particularly \n     prevalent in schools that enroll concentrations of minority \n     students and students from low-income families; and\n       ``(E) relatively few high schools are undertaking serious, \n     standards-based educational reforms. For instance, most of \n     the initiatives carried out through the Comprehensive School \n     Reform Demonstrations program have been at the elementary \n     level.\n       ``(5) Because of changes made by the Improving America's \n     Schools Act of 1994, high schools now receive significantly \n     more title I funding than was the case before, and the number \n     of high schools operating title I schoolwide programs has \n     increased. However, evaluations indicate that title I, by \n     itself, has not yet resulted in significant reforms in high \n     schools. High schools now have the opportunity to use title I \n     funds to leverage Federal, State, and local funds to \n     implement education reforms.\n       ``(6) High school reforms can be effective. For example, \n     schools participating in the Southern Regional Education \n     Board `High Schools that Work' program, a whole-school, \n     research-based reform initiative, have shown significant \n     improvement in reading and mathematics scores. The Johns \n     Hopkins University Talent Development model has demonstrated \n     promising results at its initial implementation site. The \n     schools implementing locally based reforms and participating \n     in the Department of Education's `New American High Schools' \n     initiative have generally achieved improved outcomes in \n     graduation, attendance, and achievement.\n       ``(7) A variety of approaches to high school reform, geared \n     to local conditions and needs, can be effective.

SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       ``(a) Short Title.--This part may be cited as the \n     `Excellence in Economic Education Act of 2000'.\n       ``(b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       ``(1) The need for economic literacy in the United States \n     has grown exponentially in the 1990's as a result of rapid \n     technological advancements and increasing globalization, \n     giving individuals in the United States more numerous and \n     complex economic and financial choices than ever before as \n     members of the workforce, managers of their families' \n     resources, and voting citizens.\n       ``(2) Individuals in the United States lack essential \n     economic knowledge, as demonstrated in a 1998-1999 test \n     conducted for the National Council on Economic Education, a \n     private nonprofit organization. The test results indicated \n     the following:\n       ``(A) Students and adults alike lack a basic understanding \n     of core economic concepts such as scarcity of resources and \n     inflation, with less than half of those tested demonstrating \n     knowledge of those basic concepts.\n       ``(B) A little more than \\1/3\\ of those tested realize that \n     society must make choices about how to use resources.\n       ``(C) Only \\1/3\\ of those tested understand that active \n     competition in the marketplace serves to lower prices and \n     improve product quality.\n       ``(D) Slightly more than \\1/2\\ of adults in the United \n     States and less than \\1/4\\ of students in\n\n[[Page S3426]]\n\n     the United States know that a Federal budget deficit is \n     created when the Federal Government's expenditures exceed its \n     revenues in a year.\n       ``(E) Overall, adults received a grade of 57 percent on the \n     test and secondary school students received a grade of 48 \n     percent on the test.\n       ``(F) Despite these poor results, the test findings pointed \n     out that individuals in the United States realize the need \n     for understanding basic economic concepts, with 96 percent of \n     adults tested believing that basic economics should be taught \n     in secondary school.\n       ``(3) A range of trends points to the need for individuals \n     in the United States to receive a practical economics \n     education that will give the individuals tools to make \n     responsible choices about their limited financial resources, \n     and about the range of economic choices which face all people \n     regardless of their financial circumstances. Examples of the \n     trends include the following:\n       ``(A) The number of personal bankruptcies in the United \n     States rose and set new records in the 1990's, despite the \n     longest peacetime economic expansion in United States \n     history. One in every 70 United States households filed for \n     bankruptcy in 1998. Rising bankruptcies have an impact on the \n     cost and availability of consumer credit which in turn \n     negatively affect overall economic growth.\n       ``(B) Credit card delinquencies in the United States rose \n     to 1.83 percent in 1998, which is a percentage not seen since \n     1992 when the effects of a recession were still strong.\n       ``(C) The personal savings rate in the United States over \n     the 5 years ending in 1998 averaged only 4.5 percent. In the \n     third quarter of 1999, the personal savings rate dropped to \n     1.8 percent. A decline in savings rates reduces potential \n     investment and economic growth.\n       ``(D) By 2030, the number of older persons in the United \n     States will grow to 70,000,000, more than twice the number of \n     older persons in the United States in 1997. The additional \n     older persons will add significantly to the population of \n     retirees in the United States and require a shift in private \n     and public resources to attend to their specific needs. The \n     needs of this population will have dramatic, long-term \n     economic consequences for younger generations of individuals \n     in the United States workforce who will need to plan well in \n     order to support their families and ensure for themselves a \n     secure retirement.\n       ``(4) The third National Education Goal designates \n     economics as 1 of 9 core content areas in which teaching, \n     learning, and students' mastery of basic and advanced skills \n     must improve.\n       ``(5) The National Council on Economic Education presents a \n     compelling case for doing more to meet the need for economic \n     literacy. While an understanding of economics is necessary to \n     help the next generation to think, choose, and function in a \n     changing global economy, economics has too often been \n     neglected in schools.\n       ``(6) States' requirements for economic and personal \n     finance education are insufficient as evidenced by the fact \n     that, while 39 States have adopted educational standards \n     (including guidelines or proficiencies) in economics--\n       ``(A) only 13 of those States require all students to take \n     a course in economics before graduating from secondary \n     school;\n       ``(B) only 25 States administer tests to determine whether \n     students meet the economic standards; and\n       ``(C) only 27 States require that the economic standards be \n     implemented in schools.\n       ``(7) Improved and enhanced national, State, and local \n     economic education efforts, conducted as part of the Campaign \n     for Economic Literacy led by the National Council on Economic \n     Education, will help individuals become informed consumers, \n     conscientious savers, prudent investors, productive workforce \n     members, responsible citizens, and effective participants in \n     the global economy.\n       ``(8)(A) Founded in 1949, the National Council on Economic \n     Education is the preeminent economic education organization \n     in the United States, having a nationwide network that \n     supports economic education in the Nation's schools by \n     working with States, local educational agencies, and schools.\n       ``(B) This network supports teacher preparedness in \n     economics through--\n       ``(i) inservice teacher education;\n       ``(ii) classroom-tested materials and appropriate \n     curricula;\n       ``(iii) evaluation, assessment, and research on economics \n     education; and\n       ``(iv) suggested content standards for economics.\n       ``(9) The National Council on Economic Education network \n     includes affiliated State Councils on Economic Education and \n     more than 275 university or college-based Centers for \n     Economic Education. This network represents a unique \n     partnership among leaders in education, business, economics, \n     and labor, the purpose of which is to effectively deliver \n     economic education throughout the United States.\n       ``(10) Each year the National Council on Economic Education \n     network trains 120,000 teachers, reaching more than 7,000,000 \n     students. By strengthening the Council's nationwide network, \n     the Council can reach more of the Nation's 53,000,000 \n     students.\n       ``(11) The National Council on Economic Education conducts \n     an international economic education program that provides \n     information on market principles to the world (particularly \n     emerging democracies) through teacher training, materials \n     translation and development, study tours, conferences, and \n     research and evaluation. As a result of those activities, the \n     National Council on Economic Education is helping to support \n     educational reform and build economic education \n     infrastructures in emerging market economies, and reinforcing \n     the national interest of the United States.\n       ``(12) Evaluation results of economics education activities \n     support the following conclusions:\n       ``(A) Inservice education in economics for teachers \n     contributes significantly to students' gains in economic \n     knowledge.\n       ``(B) Secondary school students who have taken economics \n     courses perform significantly better on tests of economic \n     literacy than do their counterparts who have not taken \n     economics.\n       ``(C) Economics courses contribute significantly more to \n     gains in economic knowledge than does integration of \n     economics into other subjects.\n       ``(13) Through partnerships, the National Council on \n     Economic Education network leverages support for its mission \n     by raising more than $35,000,000 annually for economic \n     education from the private sector, universities, and States.\n\n     ``SEC. 10502.

FINDINGS.\n\n       ``Congress finds as follows:\n       ``(1) The General Accounting Office estimated in 1995 that \n     it would cost $112,000,000,000 to bring our Nation's school \n     facilities into good overall condition.\n       ``(2) The General Accounting Office also found in 1995 that \n     60 percent of the Nation's schools, serving 28,000,000 \n     students, reported that 1 or more building features, such as \n     roofs and plumbing, needed to be extensively repaired, \n     overhauled, or replaced.\n       ``(3) The National Center for Education Statistics reported \n     that the average age for a school building in 1998 was 42 \n     years and that local educational agencies with relatively \n     high rates of poverty tend to have relatively old buildings.\n       ``(4) School condition is positively correlated with \n     student achievement, according to a number of research \n     studies.\n       ``(5) The results of a recent survey indicate that the \n     condition of schools with large proportions of students \n     living on Indian lands is particularly poor.\n       ``(6) While school repair and renovation are primarily a \n     State and local concern, some States and communities are not, \n     on their own, able to meet the burden of providing adequate \n     school facilities for all students, and the poorest \n     communities have had the greatest difficulty meeting this \n     need.

Mr. President:\n\n     God hath not promised\n     Skies always blue\n     Flower-strewn pathways\n     All our lives through;\n     God hath not promised\n     Sun without rain,\n     Joy without sorrow,\n     Peace without pain.\n\n     But God hath promised\n     Strength for the day,\n     Rest for the laborer,\n     And light on the way,\n     Grace for the trials,\n     Help from above,\n     Unfailing sympathy\n     And undying love.\n\n  Mr. President, I have quoted this bit of poetry because I am thinking \nof Mike Epstein, Senator Wellstone's long serving legislative director. \nMike Epstein, I heard only yesterday, is gravely ill. I know that he is \nfacing this news with the same gallant, noble, straightforward courage \nthat has marked his entire life. I know because I employed him as a \nmember of the Democratic Policy Committee staff when I was the majority \nleader of the Senate, and I have seen him in action. I have seen him at \nwork many times.\n  Mike is a man of lively humor, great heart, idealistic vision, and \npragmatic understanding. Despite many years on Capitol Hill, he has \nnever lost his sense of purpose in public service. He has never lost \nhis desire to make the world a better place in which to live. At the \nsame time, he has accumulated the political savvy and acumen to rapidly \nsize up a piece of legislation, weigh its strengths and weigh its \nweaknesses, and then deliver a succinct analysis on the spot. He has \nbeen a fixture on the Democratic bench during debate on many bills.\n  It seems it was only yesterday that I saw him back here on this \nbench. I always made it a point to speak to Mike as I went by. It may \nhave been a week ago, it may have been 2 weeks ago, perhaps it was 3 \nweeks ago, but he was there. And, as I say, just like always, it was as \nthough it was only a few hours ago.\n  He has shepherded a generation of inexperienced legislative \nassistants through the arcane minuet of amendment trees, tabling \nmotions, and cloture votes. In this respect, as in so many others, Mike \nhas been outstanding in his commitment to the Senate, to its \ntraditions, and in giving one's best to the Nation. What more can one \ndo?\n  The Senate is, in many ways, Mike's enduring passion. Legislation is \nhis obsession. He was a ``policy wonk'' before that phrase was ever \ncoined. His friends are legion in both parties, and outside the Senate \nas well as inside the Senate, and outside both parties as well.\n  Senator Wellstone and his staff are part of Mike's extended Senate \nfamily. I know that everyone is shocked, just as I was shocked \nyesterday, at this unexpected news and that all my colleagues join me \nin offering Mike strength and comfort.\n  It brings home the memory of that scriptural passage which says:\n\n       Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of \n     trouble.\n       He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth \n     also as a shadow, and continueth not.\n\n  Seneca once observed that ``there is nothing in the world so much \nadmired as a man who knows how to bear unhappiness with courage.'' As \nhe bravely faces his toughest battle, Mike Epstein offers to each of us \nsomething further to admire and to cherish.\n  So tonight I shall go home, remembering Mike, sitting back there on \nthat bench, looking at me, smiling.\n  I close with a short verse by Spencer Michael Free, ``The Human \nTouch,'' which I believe best captures the warm and caring legacy of \nMike Epstein's long and faithful service to the Senate:\n\n       'Tis the human touch in this world that counts,\n       The touch of your hand and mine,\n       Which means far more to the fainting heart\n       Than shelter and bread and wine;\n       For shelter is gone when the night is o'er,\n       And bread lasts only a day,\n       But the touch of the hand and the sound of the voice\n       Sing on in the soul alway[s].\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
