In this \nimpeachment trial, we have learned again that really listening over a \nprolonged period of time is hard work.

I believe that will be approximately midway in \nthe presentation of Mr. Counsel Kendall. Then we would probably take at \nleast one more break so that the Senators and Chief Justice would have \na chance to stretch and so we will have some logical break in the \npresentations.

If there is no objection, the Journal of \nproceedings of the trial are approved to date. Under the provisions of \nSenate Resolution 16, the counsel for the President have 18 hours and 9 \nminutes remaining to make their presentation of their case.\n  The Presiding Officer now recognizes Mr. Counsel Kendall.\n  Mr. Counsel KENDALL. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, \nmanagers from the House of Representatives, good afternoon. I am David \nKendall of the law firm of Williams & Connolly. Since 1993 it has been \nmy privilege to represent the President in the tortuous and meandering \nWhitewater investigation which, approximately a year ago, was \ntransformed in a remarkable way into the Lewinsky investigation.\n  I want to address this afternoon certain allegations of obstruction \nof justice contained in article II of the articles of impeachment. Mr. \nManager Sensenbrenner remarked that no prior article allegation of \nobstruction of justice has ever reached this Chamber. So this is a case \nof first impression.\n  Deputy Counsel Cheryl Mills yesterday addressed the parts of article \nII pertaining to gifts and the President's conversations with Ms. \nCurrie. I will cover, this afternoon, the remaining five subparts of \narticle II. The evidence plainly shows that the President did not \nobstruct justice in any way and there is nothing in this article which \nwould warrant his removal from office.\n  As I begin, I want to thank you for your open minds, for your \nattention, for your withholding judgment until you have heard all of \nour evidentiary presentation. There are a lot of myths about what the \nevidence is in this case. Some of them are misunderstandings based upon \nerroneous media reports, some spring from confusion in the evidence \nitself, and some are the result of concerted partisan distortion.\n\n  I want to talk to you this afternoon about what the record is and \nwhat the evidence actually shows. I apologize to you in advance if the \nprocess is tedious. What I think I have to request from you is your \ncommon sense and some uncommon patience. But the evidence--those \nstubborn facts--is critically important to inform your ultimate vote on \nthese articles. I will do my best to avoid repetition and lawyer talk--\nalthough I am a lawyer.\n  In our trial memorandum, we gave you the citations to the evidence I \nam going to be referencing, so you can check the facts there. I want to \nsay that I welcome your scrutiny.\n  My presentation this morning consists of six parts. I would like, if \nI could, to give you those as milestones. I want to make some remarks \ngenerally about evidence, and then I want to consider the specific \nevidence which is relevant to each of the five subparts I am going to \nbe talking about. I am going to do them out of numerical order but what \nI hope is in a logical order. I am going to cover article I first, then \narticle II, then article V, article VII, and article IV. Ms. Mills, \nyesterday, has already covered III and VI.\n  First of all, a few words about evidence. We have heard a great deal \nabout the rule of law in the various presentations of the House \nmanagers. But what is at issue here--and I think Mr. Manager Graham \nmade this point very well--it is a solemn obligation, which is \nconstitutionally committed to this body. Your decision, whatever it is, \nis not going to have some kind of domino effect that ineluctably leads \nto that midnight knock at the door. The rule of law is more than \nrhetoric. It means that in proceedings like these, where important \nrights are being adjudicated, that evidence matters, fairness matters, \nrules of procedural regularity matter, the presumption of innocence \nmatters, and proportionality matters. The rule of law is not the \nmonopoly of the House managers, and it ought to be practiced in these \nproceedings, as well as talked about in speeches.\n  We have heard a lot of pejorative rhetoric about legal hairsplitting \nthat the President and his legal team have engaged in. As a member of \nthat legal team, I paid attention to that rhetoric. But as I sat there \nlistening to the various presentations, they struck me as somewhat odd, \nbecause one of the hallmarks of the rule of law is careful procedures \nand explicit laws which try to define rights for every citizen.\n  It is not legal hairsplitting to raise available defenses, or to \npoint out gaps in the evidence, or to make legal arguments based upon \nprecedent, however technical and politically unpopular some of those \narguments may be. And I think it is particularly important in a \nproceeding like this where the charge is an accusation of a crime. Mr. \nManager McCollum was quite explicit in his argument that the first \nthing you have to determine here is whether the President committed any \ncrimes.\n  I am going to try to focus on the facts and the evidence concerning \nobstruction of justice. I don't think there is a need for me to go into \nthe law; we have set forth the relevant legal principles in our trial \nmemorandum. Mr. Ruff and Ms. Mills very ably covered some of the \ngoverning principles, and Ms. Mills played some videotape excerpts of \nexperts, and the law on obstruction of justice is relatively settled. \nIndeed, our primary disagreement with the very able House managers \nconcerns the evidence and what it shows.\n\n  Now, in December the Judiciary Committee of the House of \nRepresentatives reported four articles of impeachment to the floor. Two \nof those--one alleging perjury in the President's January 17, 1998, \ndeposition in the Paula Jones case, and one alleging abuse of power--\nwere specifically considered by the House and just as specifically \nrejected, although the House managers had very cleverly attempted to \nweave into their discussion of the two articles that were adopted some \nof the rejected allegations.\n  Now, on the chart, article II alleges that the President has, in some \nway, impeded or covered up the existence of evidence relevant to the \nPaula Jones case. That is the whole focus of this article. It focuses \non the alleged impact on the Paula Jones case. It is important because \nwhen we get to subpart (7), we will see that there is no way the \nallegations there could be a part of this article or impact the Paula \nJones case.\n  The President supposedly accomplished this obstruction of justice \nthrough--and here I quote--``one or more of the following acts . . .''\n  Here, I think I should observe that this ``one or more'' menu, as it \nwere, is plainly defective in a constitutional sense because, as we \nhave pointed out in our answer and in our trial memorandum, and as Mr. \nRuff has made clear in his presentation, such a format makes it \nimpossible to assure that the constitutionally required two-thirds of \nSenators voting concur on any particular ground that is alleged. Since \nthe Senate rules provide that you can't split up this menu--you have to \ncover all seven allegations together--it would be possible for the \nPresident to be convicted without that requisite two-thirds majority, \nbecause you might get 9 or 10 votes in favor of the article based on \neach of the 7 different grounds.\n  The Constitution, of course, gives the House of Representatives the \nsole power of impeachment and has exercised that power to adopt article \nII. However, several of the allegations about what the President did to \nobstruct justice, supposedly in the House managers' presentation, are \nnowhere contained in these seven subparts; they are simply not there.\n  For example, you heard repeatedly about the President's use in his \ndeposition of the term ``alone''--was he ever alone with Ms. Lewinsky. \nThe managers claim that that somehow obstructed justice. The allegation \nthat this consisted of an impeachable offense, however, was rejected \nwhen the\n\n[[Page S833]]\n\nHouse of Representatives voted down one of the four articles alleging \ndeposition perjury.\n  You have also heard reference to the President's allegedly false and \nmisleading answers to the 81 interrogatories sent to the President in \nNovember by the House Judiciary Committee. Again, an article based upon \nthose interrogatory answers was voted down in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I would like you to bear in mind an image which Mr. Manager \nHutchinson and Counsel Ruff share in some way. You will see that they \ndidn't share it entirely. Mr. Manager Hutchinson referred to the \n``seven pillars of obstruction.'' Mr. White House Counsel Ruff referred \nto the seven shifting ``sand castles of speculation.'' It won't \nsurprise you that I agree with Mr. Ruff's characterization. But the \nimportant point is that there are 7 grounds in this article; there are \nnot 8, there are not 19, there are 7 charges. That is what the House \nenacted and that is what we are going to address and rebut.\n  Before considering the five subparts of article II that I am going to \nbe addressing, I would like to say a few words about the different \nkinds of evidence you are going to have to consider. There is, first, \ndirect evidence. Now, this isn't the most probative kind of evidence, \nbecause it is the least ambiguous. It comes directly from the five \nsenses of the witness. For example, when the witness testifies about \nsomething the witness did, that is direct evidence.\n  From the House managers' very skillful presentation, you would not be \naware of the large amount of direct evidence which is in the record \nwhich refutes and contradicts the allegations of obstruction of \njustice. I am going to cover that in detail this afternoon.\n  The second kind of evidence is what the law calls circumstantial, and \nthis describes any evidence which is probative only if a certain \nconclusion or inference is drawn from the evidence. Circumstantial \nevidence is admissible, but, by its definition, it is to some degree \nambiguous because it is not direct. Its probative power--or its value--\ndepends upon the strength of the inference you can logically draw from \nit.\n  Let me give you an example. You walk out of your house in the morning \nand you see the sidewalk is completely wet. You might conclude that it \nhas rained the night before and you might be reasonably confident in \nthat conclusion. However, were your sharp eyes to focus further and \nobserve your neighbor's sprinkler sitting right by the sidewalk, \ndripping from the sprinkler head, you might want to revise your \nconclusion.\n  Circumstantial evidence is often subject to several different \ninterpretations, and for this reason it has to be viewed very \ncarefully. As one court has stated, ``Circumstantial evidence presents \na danger that the trier of fact may leave logical gaps in the proof \noffered and draw unwarranted conclusions based on probabilities of low \ndegree.''\n  If a criminal charge is to be based on conclusions drawn from \ncircumstantial evidence rather than on direct evidence, those \nconclusions have got to be virtually unavoidable. Most of the \nobstruction case presented--and they have recognized this, and Mr. \nManager Hutchinson recognized it on Saturday--is based on \ncircumstantial evidence, and that evidence is, at best, profoundly \nambiguous. They told you that they have painted a picture with \ncircumstantial evidence. I think what they have in fact done is given \nyou a Rorschach test.\n  I would like to now turn to the five subparts of article I which I \nintend to cover. And I want to describe, as to each, the relevant \ndirect evidence in the record, the circumstantial evidence, and the \nportions of the managers' presentation which do not in fact constitute \neither kind of evidence but in fact represent speculation, theorizing, \nand hypothesis. What I believe you will find is that the direct \nevidence disproves the charges of obstruction and the managers have had \nto rely on contradictory and unpersuasive circumstantial evidence to \ntry to make their case.\n  Subpart (1) of article II alleges that the President encouraged Ms. \nLewinsky to execute an affidavit in the Paula Jones case ``that he knew \nto be perjurious, false and misleading.'' The House managers allege \nthat during a December 17 telephone conversation Ms. Lewinsky asked the \nPresident what she could do if she were subpoenaed in the Jones case \nand the President responded, ``Well, maybe you could sign an \naffidavit.'' And that is a statement the President does not dispute \nmaking.\n  It is hard to believe, but this statement of the President to Ms. \nLewinsky, advising her of the possibility of totally lawful conduct, is \nthe House managers' entire factual basis for supporting the first \nallegation in subpart (1). The managers don't claim that the President \nadvised her to file a false affidavit. That is not what subpart (1) \nalleges. And there is no evidence in the record anywhere to support \nsuch an allegation. Nor do the managers allege he even told \nher, advised her, urged her, or suggested to her what to put in her \naffidavit. The charge which the managers have spun out of this single \nstatement by the President is refuted by the direct evidence.\n\n  First of all, Ms. Lewinsky has repeatedly and forcefully denied any \nand all suggestion that the President ever asked her to lie. In her \nproffer--and a proffer, of course, is an offer made to a prosecutor to \ntry to get immunity--she made in her own handwriting on February 1, \n1998, she stated explicitly that, ``Neither the President nor anyone on \nhis behalf asked or encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to lie.''\n  In an FBI interview conducted on July 27, she made two similar \nstatements. And you see them up here on the chart: ``Neither the \nPresident or Jordan ever told Lewinsky that she had to lie.''\n  ``Neither the President nor anyone ever directed Lewinsky to say \nanything or to lie.''\n  And it was the FBI agent who transcribed those two comments.\n  I would like to focus upon the fact that she told the FBI the \nPresident never directed her ``to say anything or to lie.''\n  I think that is particularly telling as the direct evidence in the \ncontext of this allegation that the President supposedly urged her to \nfile an affidavit that he knew would be false.\n  Finally, in Ms. Lewinsky's August 20 grand jury testimony, she \nstated--and she had to volunteer to do it--``No one ever asked me to \nlie and I was never promised a job for my silence.''\n  ``No one ever asked me to lie and I was never promised a job for my \nsilence.''\n  Is there something difficult to understand here?\n  It is interesting to see how the House managers try to establish that \nsomehow the President asked Ms. Lewinsky to file a false affidavit. But \ntheir argument essentially begs the question. They argue that the \nPresident in fact somehow encouraged her to lie because both parties \nknew the affidavit would have to be false and misleading to accomplish \nthe desired result.\n  But again there is no evidence to support this conjecture, and in \nfact the opposite is true. Both Ms. Lewinsky and the President have \ntestified repeatedly that, given the particular claims being made in \nthe Jones case, they both honestly believe that a truthful, albeit \nlimited, affidavit might--``might''--establish that Ms. Lewinsky had \nnothing relevant to offer in the way of testimony in the Jones case.\n  The President explained in his grand jury testimony on at least five \noccasions in response to the prosecutor's question that he believed Ms. \nLewinsky could execute a truthful but limited affidavit that would have \nestablished there was no basis for calling her as a witness to testify \nin the Jones case.\n  For example, the President told the grand jury, ``But I'm just \ntelling you that it's certainly true what she says here, that we didn't \nhave--there was no employment, no benefit in exchange, there was \nnothing having to do with sexual harassment. And if she defined sexual \nrelationship in the way I think most Americans do . . . then she told \nthe truth.''\n  Or again, the President told the grand jury:\n\n       I've already told you that I felt strongly that she could \n     issue, that she could execute an affidavit that would be \n     factually truthful, that might get her out of having to \n     testify. . . And did I hope she's be able to get out of \n     testifying on an affidavit? Absolutely. Did I want her to \n     execute a false affidavit? No, I did not.\n\n  It is important to bear in mind that the Paula Jones case was a \nsexual harassment case, although it turned out to\n\n[[Page S834]]\n\nbe legally groundless, and it involved allegations of nonconsensual \nsexual solicitations. Ms. Lewinsky's relationship to the President had \nbeen consensual. She knew nothing whatsoever about the allegations in \nthe Jones case. There is no evidence in the record that she had ever \nbeen in Arkansas in her life. And in any event, the Jones case arose \nout of factual allegations dating from May of 1991 when the President \nwas Governor of Arkansas, long before Ms. Lewinsky had even met the \nPresident.\n  Now, it is not simply the President who believed that in the \ncircumstances here Ms. Lewinsky could have filed an affidavit which \ncould have been truthful and which might have gotten her released from \ntestifying in a Jones case deposition. Ms. Lewinsky also has testified \nthat she might have been able to file a truthful affidavit which would \nhave accomplished that purpose. For example, she told the FBI in an \ninterview after she obtained immunity on July 29 that she had told \nLinda Tripp that the purpose of an affidavit was to avoid being \ndeposed, and that she thought one could do this by giving only a \nportion of the whole story so the Jones lawyers would not think the \nperson giving the affidavit added anything of relevance to their case.\n  Again, in the same interview with the FBI, Ms. Lewinsky stated that \nthe goal of such an affidavit was to be as benign as possible so as to \navoid being deposed.\n  Again, in her grand jury testimony on August 6, Ms. Lewinsky \ntestified that:\n\n       I thought that signing an affidavit could range from \n     anywhere--the point of it would be to deter or to prevent me \n     from being deposed and so that there could range from \n     anywhere between maybe just somehow somehow mentioning, you \n     know, innocuous things.\n\n  It is not disputed that the President showed no interest in viewing a \ndraft of Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit, did not review it, and, according to \nMs. Lewinsky, said he did not need to see it. This fact is obviously \nexculpatory. If the President were truly concerned about what was going \ninto Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit, surely he would have wanted to review it \nprior to his summation.\n  Now, to counter this inference, the House managers offer speculation. \nMr. Manager McCollum tried to downplay the significance of this fact by \nasking you to engage in sheer surmise. He said on Friday:\n\n       I doubt seriously [the President] was talking about 15 \n     other affidavits of somebody else and didn't like looking at \n     affidavits anymore. I suspect and I would suggest to you that \n     he was talking about 15 other drafts of this proposed \n     affidavit since it had been around the Horn a lot of rounds.\n\n  Well, as the able House manager himself stated, this suggestion is \nmere suspicion, speculation; it flies in the face of Ms. Lewinsky's \ndirect testimony. There is evidence of only a few drafts, and there is \nno evidence that the President ever saw any draft.\n\n  Now, Ms. Lewinsky was under no obligation to volunteer to the Paula \nJones lawyers every last detail about her relationship with the \nPresident, and the fact that the President did not advise her or \ninstruct her to do so is neither wrong nor an obstruction of justice. \nThe fact is that the limited truthful affidavit might have established \nthat Ms. Lewinsky's testimony was simply not relevant to the Jones \ncase.\n  The President knew and had told Ms. Lewinsky that a great many other \nwomen he knew who had been subpoenaed by the Paula Jones lawyers had \ntried to avoid the burden, the expense, and the humiliation of a \ndeposition by filing an affidavit in support of a motion to quash the \ndeposition subpoena and by arguing in the affidavit that the subpoenaed \nwoman had no relevant evidence for the Jones case. The Jones lawyers \nwere casting a very wide net for evidence that they could use to \nembarrass the President. The discovery cutoff in the case was fast \napproaching--that is the point at which you can't take any more \ndiscovery--and there was some chance both Ms. Lewinsky and the \nPresident felt that she could escape deposition through an accurate but \nlimited affidavit.\n  Moreover, there is significant evidence in the record that at the \ntime she executed her affidavit, Ms. Lewinsky honestly could believe, \nhonestly believed that she could deny a sexual relationship given what \nshe believed to be the definition of that term. In an audiotape \nconversation which Linda Tripp, secretly recorded, Ms. Lewinsky \ndeclared:\n\n       I never even came close to sleeping with the President. We \n     didn't have sex.\n\n  Again, I would remind you of Mr. Craig's presentation yesterday \nconcerning Ms. Lewinsky's understanding of the term ``sexual \nrelations,'' which was the same as the President's.\n  There is another part of the chronology here--and a circumstantial \nevidence case often rests heavily on chronology--that the House \nmanagers simply ignore in their attempt to fit some of the facts into a \nsinister pattern. Ms. Lewinsky's name appeared on the Paula Jones \nwitness list which, the managers tell us accurately, the President's \nlawyers reviewed with him on Saturday, December 6. She was one of a \ngreat many people named on the witness list.\n  Now, if the President's concern was so intense about the appearance \nof her name on the list, would he have waited until December 17 to talk \nto her? There is no explanation for this delay, which is consistent \nwith intense concern on the President's part, except that her \nappearance with a lot of others was not particularly troubling to him. \nThe main reason for his phone call on December 17 to Ms. Lewinsky, the \nunrebutted evidence shows, is that he wanted to tell Ms. Lewinsky that \nBetty Currie's brother had died. Indeed, 3 days after that telephone \ncall, Ms. Lewinsky attended the funeral of Ms. Currie's brother on \nDecember 20.\n  Now, insofar as you want to draw inferences from the chronology of \nevents in December, this long delay is circumstantial evidence that the \nPresident felt no particular urgency either to alert Ms. Lewinsky that \nher name was on the witness list or make any suggestions to her about \nan affidavit. Remember her repeated testimony which is direct evidence: \nNo one ever asked her to lie.\n  Now, subpart (2) of article II alleges that the President obstructed \njustice by encouraging Ms. Lewinsky, in that same late night telephone \ncall--two of these articles rest on that same telephone call--to give \nperjurious, false and misleading testimony if and when she was called \nto testify personally in the Jones litigation.\n  Now, it was interesting to me that a couple of days ago the House \nmanagers released a response to our presentation and they concede here \nthat the President and Ms. Lewinsky did not discuss the deposition that \nevening of December 17 because Monica--they call her Monica--had not \nbeen subpoenaed.\n  Well, that is true. There was no deposition subpoena received by Ms. \nLewinsky until 2 days later. Now, the lawyers in the room know \nsomething about what witness lists are and what they contain that the \ncivilian part of the world may not know. As lawyers get ready to go to \ntrial, and the judge requires them to put their witnesses on the \nwitness list, you put every witness you can think of who might \nconceivably be relevant--from Mr. Aardvark to Ms. Zanzibar. All of them \ngo on the witness list. And that is what had happened here. It wasn't \nuntil you get something like a subpoena for a deposition that you know \na witness is really going to be a significant player in the trial.\n  Well, let's look at the allegations here. And remember, these \nallegations focus on December 17, 2 days before Ms. Lewinsky is going \nto receive her subpoena. I think you logically begin with the direct \nevidence, and the direct evidence is the testimony of the two people \ninvolved in the telephone conversation, Ms. Lewinsky and the President. \nMs. Lewinsky has repeatedly stated that no one ever urged her to lie \nand that this plainly applies to this December 17 conversation. She \nsaid, in her handwritten proffer that I had on the chart earlier, that \nthe President did not ask her or encourage her to lie. She made that \nstatement when talking to the independent counsel, when her fate was in \nthe hands of the independent counsel, when her immunity agreement could \nbe broken and she could be prosecuted. She has, nevertheless, continued \nto maintain that nobody asked her ever to lie. She said in the July 27 \nFBI interview neither the President nor Mr. Jordan ever told her she \nhad to lie, and she said that in her grand jury testimony.\n  It is interesting to hear all the ways that the House managers--and \nthey are\n\n[[Page S835]]\n\nvery skillful--try to minimize the importance of this direct evidence. \nYou would think Ms. Lewinsky's statements under oath were irrelevant to \nthis case. She gave this testimony, for the most part, when she was \nsubject to prosecution for perjury. It simply cannot be blandly \ndismissed because it was given under this threat. Indeed, Mr. Manager \nHutchinson--and I would like to quote him--shares this same belief with \nme. He told you, standing right here, ``that Ms. Lewinsky's testimony \nis credible and she has the motive to tell the truth because of her \nimmunity agreement with the independent counsel, where she gets in \ntrouble only if she lies.''\n  Likewise, the President has consistently insisted he never asked Ms. \nLewinsky to lie. In his grand jury testimony last August, he said that \nhe and Ms. Lewinsky ``might have talked about what to do in a non-legal \ncontext at some point in the past,'' if anybody inquired about their \nrelationship, although he had no specific memory of such a \nconversation. And he testified that they did not talk about this in \nconnection with Ms. Lewinsky's testimony in the Jones case.\n\n  He was asked by one of the prosecutors:\n\n       In that conversation, [on December 17] or in any \n     conversation in which you informed her she was on the witness \n     list, did you tell her, you know, you can always say that you \n     were coming to see Betty or bringing me letters? Did you tell \n     her anything like that?\n       [The President:] I don't remember. She was coming to see \n     Betty. I can tell you this. I absolutely never asked her to \n     lie.\n\n  There is, thus, no direct testimony from anybody that on December 17 \nthe President asked Ms. Lewinsky to lie if called to testify in the \nJones case. Here the House managers don't really even rely on \ncircumstantial evidence to refute the direct testimony of the two \nrelevant witnesses. They rely, instead, on what they assert is logic. \nThey claim that while the President maybe didn't specifically tell her \nto lie, he somehow suggested that she give a false account of their \nrelationship. What you should infer, according to them, is based upon \nwhat they may have said about their relations at other times, previous \ntimes to this late night December 17 phone call, the President somehow \nsuggested that she say the same thing at her deposition, something \nlike, ``You know, you can always say you were coming to see Betty, or \nthat you were bringing me letters.''\n  Their claim boils down, however, to the inferences to be drawn from \nthe uncontested fact that in the past, before this time, before this \nDecember 17 phone call, the President and Ms. Lewinsky had discussions \nabout what she should say if asked about the visits to the Oval Office.\n  Both have acknowledged that. Not surprisingly, at the time these \nconversations occurred they were both concerned to conceal their \nimproper relationship from others while it was going on. Cover stories \nare an almost inevitable part of every improper relationship between \ntwo human beings. By its very nature the relationship is one that has \nto be concealed and, therefore, misleading cover stories inevitably \naccompanied that relationship.\n  Now, to say that is not to excuse it or to exonerate it or justify \nit; but, rather, to emphasize that the testimony about ``visiting \nBetty'' or ``bringing me letters'' is in the record, but it is not \nlinked in any way to the December 17 phone call or to any testimony or \naffidavit with regard to the Jones case. Here again, I want to go to \nthe direct evidence that is relevant on count 2, because it undercuts \nthe managers' suggestion that this discussion of the cover stories \nactually occurred in the context of discussion about the Paula Jones \ncase.\n  Now, here on a chart we have a blowup of Ms. Lewinsky's--part of Ms. \nLewinsky's handwritten proffer to the independent counsel on February \n1, which makes it clear that she does recall having a discussion with \nthe President in which he said that if anyone questioned her about \nvisiting him, she should say she was either bringing him letters or \nvisiting Betty Currie. But Ms. Lewinsky states, ``there is truth to \nboth of these statements.'' It was a cover story but there was some \ntruth in it.\n  She also went out of her way in this proffer to emphasize that, while \nshe did not recall precisely when the discussions about cover stories \noccurred, they occurred ``prior to the subpoena in the Paula Jones \ncase.'' That is what you see in her paragraph 11. Her paragraph 11 \nrefers back to paragraph 2. And her point is that, while she and the \nPresident did have these discussions, it was not in the context of her \ntestimony.\n  In paragraph 4 also, as you see from the chart or from your handout, \nas to the contents of any possible testimony, Ms. Lewinsky wrote that \nto the best of her recollection she did not believe she discussed the \ncontent of any deposition during the December 17 conversation with the \nPresident.\n  Now, in an FBI interview on July 31, after she had received immunity \nfrom the independent counsel, the FBI agent noted what Ms. Lewinsky had \ntold him:\n\n       Lewinsky advised, though they did not discuss the issue in \n     specific relation[ship] to the Jones matter, she and Clinton \n     had discussed what to say when asked about Lewinsky's visits \n     to the White House.\n\n  This is direct evidence. Nobody denies that there was discussion of \ncover stories early in the relation, but there is no evidence that it \noccurred in connection in any way with the Jones case.\n  Again, despite Ms. Lewinsky's direct and unrefuted testimony about \nthe December 17 telephone call, the House managers asked you to \nconclude that the President must have asked her to testify falsely, \nbecause she had, by her own account, on prior occasions, assured the \nPresident that she would deny the relationship.\n  Think for a moment about that: They ask you to accept their \nspeculation, in the face of contradictory evidence from both parties, \nand use that as a basis on which to remove the President. Again, Ms. \nLewinsky never stated that she told the President anything about \ndenying their relationship on December 17, or at any other time, after \nshe had been identified as a witness. Indeed, she testified in the \ngrand jury that that discussion did not take place after she learned \nshe was a witness in the Jones case. And, again, we have her grand jury \ntestimony displayed on the chart. A grand juror is asking a question.\n  Question:\n\n       Is it possible that you also had these discussions [about \n     cover stories denying the relationship] after you learned \n     that you were a witness in the Paula Jones case?\n       [Ms. Lewinsky]: I don't believe so.\n\n  A juror--and these jurors were very good at questioning witnesses \nthroughout this proceeding:\n\n       Can you exclude that possibility?\n       [Ms. Lewinsky]: I pretty much can. I really don't remember \n     it.\n\n  Direct testimony given when Ms. Lewinsky was covered by an immunity \nagreement that can only be divested by her perjuring herself.\n  There is another thing that I think is relevant here, and that is \nthat Ms. Lewinsky has stated several times that while these were cover \nstories, they were not untrue. In her handwritten proffer, as you have \nseen, she stated that she asked the President what to say if anyone \nasked her about her visits. He said you could mention Betty Currie or \nbringing me letters. And she added there was truth to both of these \nstatements and that ``[n]either of those statements [was] untrue.'' \nIndeed, she testified to the grand jury that she did, in fact, bring \npapers to the President and that on some occasions, she visited the \nOval Office only to see Ms. Currie.\n  Question by a grand juror:\n\n       Did you actually bring the President papers at all?\n       Yes.\n       All right. Tell us a little bit about that.\n       It varied. Sometimes it was just actually copies of letters \n     . . .\n\n  Again, in her August 6, 1998, grand jury appearance, Ms. Lewinsky \ntestified:\n\n       I saw Betty every time that I was there . . . most of the \n     time my purpose was to see the President, but there were some \n     times when I did just go see Betty but the President wasn't \n     in the office.\n\n  Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Currie were friends, and they did have a \nseparate social relationship.\n  The managers assert that these stories were misleading, and the House \ncommittee report on the articles of impeachment declared that these \nstories about Ms. Currie and delivering papers was a ``ruse that had no \nlegitimate business purpose.'' In other words, while the so-called \nstories were literally true, the explanations might\n\n[[Page S836]]\n\nhave been misleading. But the literal truth here, while it may appear \nlegalistic and hairsplitting, is, in fact, a defense to both the \nperjury and the obstruction of justice charges under the rule of law. \nWhile the President and Ms. Lewinsky had discussed cover stories while \ntheir improper relationship was in progress, there is simply no \nevidence that they discussed this at any time when Ms. Lewinsky was a \nwitness in the Jones case.\n\n  The next subpart I want to consider is subpart (5). Subpart (5) \nalleges that at the deposition, the President allowed his attorney to \nmake false and misleading statements to a Federal judge characterizing \nan affidavit in order to prevent questioning deemed relevant by the \njudge.\n  It alleges obstruction solely because the President did not say \nanything when his attorney, Mr. Bennett, cited Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit \nin an unsuccessful argument to Judge Wright that evidence concerning \nMs. Lewinsky should not be admitted at that point because it was \nirrelevant to the Jones case. At one point, Mr. Bennett, the \nPresident's lawyer, states that, according to the affidavit, ``there is \nno sex of any kind in any manner, shape or form.''\n  This claim, which also is presented in the perjury section, as Mr. \nCraig pointed out, is deficient as an allegation of obstruction, both \nas a matter of fact and as a matter of law.\n  But I will say one thing. The direct evidence on this point is \nuniquely available because there is only one witness who can testify \nabout what was in his thoughts at a given moment, and the President has \ntestified at great length in his grand jury testimony about what he was \nthinking at this point.\n  The President told the grand jury that he was simply not focusing \nclosely on the exchange between the lawyers, but was instead \nconcentrating on his own testimony.\n  He said:\n\n       I'm not even sure I paid much attention to what he [Mr. \n     Bennett] was saying. I was thinking. I was ready to get on \n     with my testimony here and they were having these constant \n     discussions all through the deposition.\n\n  And again the President testifies:\n\n       I didn't pay any attention to this colloquy that went on. I \n     was waiting for my instructions as a witness to go forward. I \n     was worried about my own testimony.\n\n  I think Mr. Craig provided you with a background yesterday that I \nwon't repeat here, but I would refer you to, about what was on the \nPresident's mind at the time.\n  Mr. Manager McCollum made a very polished and articulate presentation \nto you, and he predicted that the President's lawyers were going to \nargue that the President sat in silence because he wasn't paying \nattention. We have, indeed, argued this, and it is the truth based upon \nwhat the President has testified he was thinking about. But Mr. \nMcCollum went on to argue that there was circumstantial evidence \navailable from the videotape of the President at this deposition.\n  He stated:\n\n       We've already seen the video. And you know that he was \n     looking so intently. Remember, he was intensely following the \n     conversation with his eyes. I don't know how anybody can say \n     this man wasn't paying attention. He certainly wasn't \n     thinking about anything else. That was very obvious from \n     looking at the video.\n\n  We all saw the video during the House managers' presentations, and we \nsaw a lot of the President at the deposition yesterday when Mr. Craig \nplayed the first part of it. If you observe the President throughout \nthe time you have seen him on the video in the deposition, you will \nconclude that the look on his face was no different from what it was \nduring other discussions or arguments of counsel about evidentiary or \nprocedural matters. The videotape does not, fairly considered, indicate \nthat the President was, in fact, focusing on the lengthy colloquy among \nthe lawyers or that he knowingly made a decision not to correct his own \nlawyer.\n  The President has received a great deal of criticism, because at one \npoint in his grand jury testimony, when asked about Mr. Bennett's \nstatement, the President responds to the prosecutor that whether Mr. \nBennett's statement is true depends on what the meaning of the word \n``is'' is. That is, ``there is no sex of any kind.''\n  That has gotten its share of laughs. But when you read the \nPresident's grand jury transcript in context, this was a serious \nmatter, and it is apparent that the President was not in any way \ndescribing what was in his own mind at the time of the deposition, but \nhe rather was discussing Mr. Bennett's statement from the vantage point \nof the President's later grand jury testimony. He is interpreting what \nhis own lawyer was saying. Mr. Craig pointed this out yesterday.\n  That interpretation is not perjury in article I, and it is not \nobstruction of justice in article II. What the exchange was was that \nthe President, in response to one of the prosecutors, explains why, on \none reading Mr. Bennett's statement, it may not be false.\n  Now, it may be hairsplitting and it may be professorial and it may be \ntechnical, but the important thing is it is a retrospective assessment. \nThe President is not talking about himself. He is talking about how to \nconstrue Mr. Bennett's statement. And what he says is, there is a way \nin which Mr. Bennett's statement at the deposition is accurate; that \nis, if Mr. Bennett was referring to the relationship between the \nPresident and Ms. Lewinsky on that date, it was an accurate statement \nbecause the improper relationship was over a long time earlier.\n  Now, the relevant point here is that the President's disquisition on \nthe word ``is'' and its meaning was not an attempt to explain his own \nthinking at the time of the deposition, but was rather his later \ninterpretation of what Mr. Bennett had said at the deposition.\n  In light of the President's direct unequivocal testimony, this \nspeculation about what was in his mind is simply baseless, and there \nis, in fact, no evidence to support the charge leveled in subpart (5) \nof article II.\n  There is another reason to reject the charge; and that is, that the \nlaw imposes no obligation on the client to monitor his or her lawyer's \nevery statement and representation, particularly in a civil deposition, \nin which the client is being questioned, clients are routinely advised \nto focus on the questions posed, think carefully about the answer, \nanswer only the question asked and ignore distractions. And sometimes, \nsad to say, the statements of one's own lawyer can be a distraction. \nAnd those of you who are lawyers and have defended people in \ndepositions know that that is the advice you give the client.\n  There was good reason for the President to be thinking about his own \ntestimony and leave the legal fencing to the lawyers, because whatever \nelse may be said about him, there can be no doubt that the Jones case \nitself was a vehicle for partisan attack on the President and that he \nwas going to be facing a series of hostile and difficult questions at \nthe deposition.\n  Now, Judge Wright ultimately ruled that, giving Ms. Jones every \nbenefit of the doubt, she had failed both legally and factually to \npresent allegations that merited going to trial. But while it was \nlegally meritless, while it was going on, the case did impose a \nsignificant toll on the President both personally and politically.\n  And let's be clear about one other thing while we are looking at this \ndeposition and while you review the significance of the President \nlistening in silence to Mr. Bennett's conduct. As Mr. Craig described \nyesterday, Judge Wright, in fact, interrupted Mr. Bennett in mid \nsentence as he was describing Ms. Jones' affidavit. She didn't allow \nhim to complete his objection in which he cited the Lewinsky affidavit. \nShe quickly interjected--and this is sometimes what judges do to the \nmost learned of lawyers--she quickly interjected and said, ``No, just a \nmoment, let me make my ruling.'' And then she proceeded to allow the \nvery line of questioning that Mr. Bennett was trying to prevent. So the \nPresident's silence, whatever motivated it, had absolutely no impact on \nthe conduct of the Jones deposition.\n\n  And also let's be clear about one other thing: Nothing about this \ninterchange between Mr. Bennett and Judge Wright blocked the ability of \nthe Jones lawyers to obtain information about the President's \nrelationship with Ms. Lewinsky because the Jones lawyers had been \nbriefed the night before in great detail by Ms. Linda Tripp. Ms. Tripp \nhad already gotten her own immunity agreement from the Office of \nIndependent Counsel and had set up a\n\n[[Page S837]]\n\nlunch with Ms. Lewinsky at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel the day before the \ndeposition, Friday, January 16. And at that lunch, of course, Ms. \nLewinsky was apprehended by the Office of Independent Counsel and held \nfor the next 12 hours. In the meantime, however, Ms. Tripp goes back to \nher home where she meets with the Jones lawyers that Friday night \nbefore the deposition and loads them up with all the information she \nhas obtained from her illegal, secret audiotaping of Ms. Lewinsky. That \nis why they were able to ask the questions they did with such \nspecificity and conviction.\n  Indeed, there is one point in the examination of the President where \nhe says to the Jones lawyer who is examining him, Mr. Fisher--he asked \nthe question. And Fisher says, ``Sir, I think this will come''--he \nasked a question about ``Can you tell me why you are asking these \nspecific questions?'' and Fisher replies, ``Sir, I think this will come \nto light shortly, and you'll understand.''\n  Well, how ironic that I am making a presentation today on January 21 \nbecause it did come to light--just as Mr. Fisher knew it would; just as \nMs. Tripp knew it would--it came to light 1 year ago exactly when the \nstory broke in the Washington Post. This fleeting exchange between Mr. \nBennett and Judge Wright before she overruled his objection could not \nand didn't have any impact on the Jones lawyers' conduct.\n  Now, I want to look briefly at one other part of subpart (5) because \nit alleges--continues to make one other allegation: Such false and \nmisleading statements at the deposition by Mr. Bennett allegedly were \nsubsequently acknowledged by Mr. Bennett in a communication with the \njudge.\n  Now, if you look at Mr. Bennett's letter, however, that is not at all \nwhat the letter says. Mr. Bennett wrote to the judge on September 30 of \nlast year. This is after the referral had come to Congress and after \nthe House of Representatives had seen fit to release Ms. Lewinsky's \ngrand jury testimony. Mr. Bennett does not, as the article alleges, \nacknowledge that he himself made false and misleading statements or \nthat the President, either by his word or silence, made such \nstatements. What Mr. Bennett does do in this letter, as you can see, is \ncall the court's attention to the fact that Ms. Lewinsky herself had \ntestified before a Federal grand jury in August. And--contrary to her \nearlier statements--she stated that portions of her affidavit were, \naccording to her, false and misleading. Mr. Bennett's letter, bringing \nthis to the judge's attention, was a matter of professional obligation \nand responsibility. It in no way is evidence supporting subpart (5).\n  Take a break?\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n\n\n                                 Recess\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Kendall, indicating that he is about \nhalfway through his presentation----\n  Mr. Counsel KENDALL. That is correct, sir.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would, then, ask unanimous consent we have a temporary \nrecess for 15 minutes.\n  There being no objection, at 2:10 p.m., the Senate recessed until \n2:30 p.m.; whereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by \nthe Chief Justice.\n  Mr. CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I believe the Senate is ready to proceed \nnow with the presentation by Counsel Kendall.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Counsel Kendall.\n  Mr. Counsel KENDALL. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  Subpart (7)--we have two more subparts to go. I will take them out of \norder. Subpart (7) of article II alleges that the President obstructed \njustice when he relayed or told certain White House officials things \nabout his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky that were false and \nmisleading. This is another example of double billing in the two \narticles. This charge is leveled in article I, and it appears here in \narticle II. Yesterday, Mr. Craig explained why these statements didn't \nconstitute perjury, and I would like to take just a few minutes this \nafternoon to explain why they don't constitute an obstruction of \njustice, either.\n  First of all, and most obviously, there is no way--I said this in the \nbeginning--there is no way that the statements of the aides could be in \nany way part of a scheme to deny Ms. Jones of evidence. I think on this \nground alone subpart (7) fails, because if you look at what is alleged \nin article II, it is that the President obstructed justice in order to \ndelay, impede, et cetera, existence of testimony related to Ms. Jones' \nlawsuit. There is no way here that whatever the President said to an \naide could have done that.\n  The statements, which this subpart (7) addresses, were statements \nthat the President made very shortly after the Lewinsky publicity had \nbroken to Mr. Bowles, Mr. Podesta, Mr. Blumenthal and Mr. Ickes, none \nof whom were witnesses in the Paula Jones case. They were on none of \nthe witness lists, and they had no evidence at all relevant to the \nPaula Jones case since they had been working for the President. They \nweren't working for the President when he was Governor of Arkansas in \nMay of 1991, and they weren't individuals subject to discovery. So \nthese four aides just had no evidence whatsoever that they could \ncontribute to the Paula Jones case.\n  But there is another more fundamental reason why this article is \nflawed as a matter both of the evidence and the law. The President has \nadmitted misleading his family, his staff, and the Nation about his \nconduct with Ms. Lewinsky. And he has expressed profound regret for \nthat conduct. Subpart (7), however, alleges that he should be impeached \nand removed from office simply because he failed to be candid with \nthese particular four White House aides and misled them about the \nnature of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.\n  These allegedly impeachable denials to the four aides occurred, as I \nsaid, right after the publicity broke. And one of them occurred on \nJanuary 21, last year, and then also on the 23rd and the 26th. This was \nat the very time the President denied he had had sexual relations with \nMs. Lewinsky in nearly identical terms on national television to \nwhoever throughout the United States happened to be watching at that \ntime.\n  Having made this denial to the entire country, it simply is absurd to \nregard it any differently when made to four aides in the White House \ndirectly and person-to-person rather than through the medium of \ntelevision. The President talked to these individuals about the \nLewinsky matter because of his personal relationship and his direct \nprofessional exposure to them on a daily basis. He spoke to them, \nhowever, misleadingly in an attempt to allay their concern once the \nallegations about Ms. Lewinsky become public.\n\n  No discovery here--never yet found a place in which discovery would \nbenefit the case for either side--but no discovery here is going to \nilluminate the record in any way. These four witnesses have testified \nbefore the independent counsel's grand jury on several occasions.\n  I think it is important to observe also that there is no way this \ninterchange between the President and his aides could have affected \nevidence because his statements to them were hearsay which they would \nhave reported accurately to the grand jury when asked. And by \n``hearsay,'' all they can testify to is what the President told them, \nand they could do that accurately. But their own testimony, based on \nwhatever knowledge or observation or direct sensory evidence they might \nhave, was not affected in any way by the President's statement. None of \nthese aides had any independent knowledge of the relationship between \nthe President and Ms. Lewinsky and, therefore, the only evidence they \ndo offer would be a hearsay repetition of what the President had told \nthem. And that was the same public denial that he had told everyone, \nincluding, presumably, any member of the grand jury who had his or her \ntelevision set on on that Monday, January 26.\n  But under the strained theory--you really have to focus on this--\nunder this theory, any citizen of the United States who heard that \ndenial could form the basis for an allegation of impeachable conduct \nand removal of the President from office.\n  I think this subpart (7) of article II fails for a number of reasons \nnot related to the Paula Jones case, and it violates common sense.\n\n[[Page S838]]\n\n  Let me turn to subpart (4). This subpart alleges that the President \nobstructed justice when he intensified and succeeded in an effort to \nsecure job assistance for Ms. Lewinsky in order to corruptly prevent \nher truthful testimony. The claim here is of a quid pro quo, a ``this \nfor that.'' His job assistance was allegedly in order to prevent her \ntruthful testimony.\n  I want to note a couple of things here. First of all, this word \n``intensified''--this word ``intensified'' is a pretty slippery word. \nIt doesn't say ``originated'' or ``began.'' It says ``intensified.'' \nAnd that allegation implicitly recognizes--it tries to avoid the thrust \nof its own logic--it recognizes that the job search Ms. Lewinsky was \nconducting had begun long before there was any connection to the Paula \nJones case, and the undisputed facts are going to reveal that Vernon \nJordan and others were trying to help her long before she appeared on \nthe list of witnesses Ms. Jones was considering calling.\n  The second thing I want to emphasize is the quid pro quo nature of \nthe allegation. Quid pro quo is a good Latin term meaning ``this for \nthat.'' In ``order to'' is the allegation of subpart (4). The job \nassistance was ``in order to'' prevent Ms. Lewinsky's truthful \ntestimony.\n  Well, I want to review the evidence a bit because there is not only \nno evidence in the record; there is a lot of contradictory evidence, \nboth direct and circumstantial. We have heard a great deal in the \nvarious presentations about Mr. Jordan's assistance to Ms. Lewinsky. \nBut I was surprised to sit right over there through 11 hours 52 \nminutes, by my watch, of the House managers' very able \npresentation, and I heard almost nothing about what actually happened \nin New York City as a result of Mr. Jordan's efforts. But when we \nreview the evidence--and it is all right here. Don't worry, I am not \ngoing to review every page of it. But it is all here. When we review \nthis evidence which is available--all you have to do is read it--we get \na very different picture from what we got from the able House managers. \nThere is no secret about it, nor is there any conflict in the testimony \nof these witnesses. There is no need for further discovery here, as I \nwill show, because the testimony is consistent.\n\n  Now, the proof that is in the record is that there was no corrupt \nlinkage, no assistance whatsoever which was designed and focused to get \nMs. Lewinsky to do anything--nothing which tied the job assistance to \nwhat was going on in the Jones case. Mr. Jordan did help open doors, \nand Ms. Lewinsky went through those doors, and she either succeeded or \nfailed on her own merits. Two of the companies declined to offer her a \njob, and at the third she did get an entry-level job, which she \nreceived on her own merits.\n  There was no fix, no quid pro quo, no link to the Jones case. And \nalso there was no urgency to Mr. Jordan's assistance to her. He started \nassisting her well before she showed up on the Jones witness list, and \nhe helped her whenever he could, consistent with his own heavy travel \nschedule. There is the allegation of a quid pro quo, but there is \nnothing in the evidence to support the ``pro'' part of it.\n  What the House managers have tried to do--and they are skillful \nprosecutors, they are able, they are experienced, they are polished, \nand they know what they are doing--they have tried to juxtapose \nunrelated events and, by a selective chronology, tried to establish \ncausation between two wholly unrelated sets of events. And there an old \nlogical fallacy--you have had enough Latin today--that just because \nsomething comes after something, it was caused by the preceding event. \nIt is like the rooster crowing and taking credit for the sun coming up. \nWhen you look at the House managers' case, there is a lot of that going \non, because we will see there is no real existence of causal connection \nand we will also see that a lot of the chronology you have been given \nis erroneous.\n  As I said earlier, there is no evidence, either direct or \ncircumstantial, to support this quid pro quo allegation.\n  Now, let's start with the direct evidence, the most logical place to \nbegin. It could not be more unequivocal. Let's start with Ms. Lewinsky. \nFirst of all, her New York job search began on her own initiative long \nbefore any involvement in the Jones case. Moving to New York was her \nown idea, and it was one she raised in July of 1997. This geographical \nmove did not affect in any way her exposure to a subpoena in the Paula \nJones case.\n  Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, of course, a witness can \nbe subpoenaed in any Federal district, no matter where the case is \npending. And, indeed, a great many of the depositions in the Paula \nJones case took place outside the State of Arkansas. For this reason, \nMr. Manager Barr's assertion that the President wanted Ms. Lewinsky to \ngo to New York because it would ``make her much more difficult, if not \nimpossible, to reach as a witness in the Jones case'' is entirely \nuntenable; she was just as vulnerable to subpoena in New York as she \nwas in Washington. And, indeed, she was already under subpoena in \nJanuary when she was finalizing her move. This contention just does not \nwithstand scrutiny.\n\n  Now, Ms. Lewinsky testified:\n\n       I was never promised a job for my silence.\n\n  You can't get any plainer than that. She testified that her job \nsearch had no relation to anything that she might do in the Jones case. \nIn her July 27 interview with the FBI, the FBI agent recorded her \nstatement that there was no agreement with the President, with Mr. \nJordan, or anyone else that she had to sign a Jones affidavit before \ngetting a job in New York. She told the FBI agent explicitly that she \nhad never demanded from Mr. Jordan a job in exchange for a favorable \naffidavit and neither the President nor Mr. Jordan nor anyone else had \never made this proposition to her.\n  Now, Mr. Jordan, who is an eloquent and exceedingly articulate man, \ntook care of that claim in his own grand jury testimony. He was asked \nabout any connection between the job search and the affidavit. He said \nthere was absolutely none. He said on March 5 as far as he was \nconcerned these were two entirely separate matters. And in his grand \njury appearance on May 5 he was asked whether the two were connected, \nand Mr. Jordan said, ``Unequivocally, indubitably, no.''\n  The President has likewise testified that there was no connection \nbetween the Jones case and Ms. Lewinsky's job search. He told the grand \njury:\n\n       I was not trying to buy her silence or get Vernon Jordan to \n     buy her silence. I thought she was a good person. She had not \n     been involved with me for a long time in any improper way, \n     several months, and I wanted to help her get on with her \n     life. It is just as simple as that.\n\n  Quid pro quo? No. The uncontested facts bear out these categorical \ndenials of the three most involved people. Ms. Lewinsky began looking \nfor a job in July of 1997, and the event which hardened her resolve to \nmove to New York was a report by her ostensible good friend, Ms. Linda \nTripp, on or about October 6 that one of Ms. Tripp's friends at the \nNational Security Council said that Ms. Lewinsky would never ever get a \njob in the White House again.\n  Now, it turns out that this disclosure, like so much else Ms. Tripp \nsaid, is false. Ms. Tripp's NSC friend said no such thing. But it did \nhave a profound impact on Ms. Lewinsky, who described it as the straw \nthat broke the camel's back. It was plain to her then that she was \nnever going to be able to get another White House job.\n  Mr. Jordan's assistance of Ms. Lewinsky began about a month before \nMs. Lewinsky learned--about 6 weeks before she learned she was a \npossible witness in the Jones case. Ms. Lewinsky testified that she had \ndiscussed with Linda Tripp sometime in late September or early October \nthe idea of asking for Mr. Jordan's assistance, and Ms. Lewinsky \nindicated she could not recall if it were her idea or Linda Tripp's \nidea, but in any event Mr. Jordan became involved sometime later at the \ndirection not of the President but of Ms. Currie, who was a long-time \nfriend of Mr. Jordan and who had discussed with Ms. Lewinsky her job \nsearch. Now, Ms. Currie had previously assisted Ms. Lewinsky in making \ncontact with Ambassador Bill Richardson at the U.N. Ms. Lewinsky's \nfirst meeting was with Mr. Jordan on November 5, and Ms. Lewinsky \ntestified that the meeting lasted about 20 minutes and that they had \ndiscussed a list of possible employers she was interested in. She never \ntold Mr. Jordan that there was any time constraint on his assistance, \nand both she and Mr. Jordan\n\n[[Page S839]]\n\ntraveled a great deal out of the country and in the country in that \nNovember-December period.\n\n  Now, Mr. Jordan testified unequivocally that he never, at any time, \nfelt any particular pressure to get Ms. Lewinsky a job. This is plain \nand powerful and unrebutted testimony. He was asked in the grand jury \nif you recall any ``kind of a heightened sense of urgency by Ms. Currie \nor anyone at the White House\" about helping Ms. Lewinsky during the \nfirst half of December?\n  And he replied, ``Oh, no, I do not recall any heightened sense of \nurgency. What I do recall is that I dealt with it as I had time to do \nit.''\n  Now, let me just pause here and observe that if there had been any \nimproper motive or any sinister effort to silence Ms. Lewinsky, it \nwould have been extremely easy for the President to have arranged for \nher to be hired at the White House. If there were some corrupt intent \nto silence her, that was an obvious solution because she very much \nwanted to go back to work at the White House. It mattered to her a \ngreat deal. But, while she was interviewed a couple of times by White \nHouse officials in the summer of 1997, those interviews never resulted \nin a job offer. The fix was not in. There was no corrupt effort to \nbring Ms. Lewinsky back, give her a White House job or, indeed, \ntransfer her in any way from her Pentagon job.\n  Now, she continued her job search efforts with the assistance of some \nof the White House people. In late October or early November, she told \nher boss at the Pentagon, Mr. Kenneth Bacon, that she wanted to leave \nand move to New York City. She enlisted his assistance in trying to \nhelp her get a private sector job, and he helped her because she had \ndone good work for him. He had a positive impression and testified that \nhe wanted to do whatever he could for her.\n  In November of 1997, her supervisor at the Pentagon indicated that \nMs. Lewinsky gave notice of an intention to quit her Pentagon job at \nthe year end.\n  Now, before we get to the private sector firms that Ms. Lewinsky went \nto, I want to pause and make the point that she had a United Nations \ndelegation job in her back pocket. Back pocket is a male image--perhaps \nin her purse. She had it in her hand and available, all during this \nperiod.\n  In early October at the request of Ms. Currie, Mr. Podesta--John \nPodesta, who was then the White House Deputy Chief of Staff--had asked \nAmbassador Bill Richardson to consider Ms. Lewinsky for a position at \nthe U.N. The Ambassador testified that he did not take this as a \n``pressure call.'' He said ``there was no pressure anywhere by \nanybody'' to hire Ms. Lewinsky.\n  Ms. Currie testified to the grand jury, without contradiction, that \nshe was acting on her own, as Ms. Lewinsky's friend, in trying to help \nher.\n  Now, Ms. Lewinsky interviewed for the U.N. position on October 31 \nwith Ambassador Richardson. And he, through his staff, offered her a \njob on November 3. Ambassador Richardson testified to the grand jury \nthat he never spoke to the President or Mr. Jordan about Ms. Lewinsky, \nthat he was impressed by her, that he made the offer on the merits, and \nthat no one had pressured him to hire her.\n\n  He testified specifically to the grand jury on April 30, ``This was \nmy decision to hire her. I did not do it under any pressure or \nanything. I felt that she would be suitable for the job, and I didn't \nfeel I had to report to anybody. It's not in my nature. I don't take \npressure well on personnel matters. I'm a Cabinet member. I don't have \nto account for anything. This was mine, my choice, my decision. And I \nstand behind it.''\n  He also declared, ``What I did was routine.''\n  This fact was highly significant, because although this job was not \nprecisely the job Ms. Lewinsky wanted, it was a job in New York, and \nshe kept this open until January 5 when she finally turned it down. \nNow, it was Mr. Manager Bryant who referred to this in passing--just \nkind of walked around it. He disparaged it in the way a good trial \nlawyer does--recognize it is there, but then move around and away from \nit. But it is an important fact and it tears a very large hole in their \ncircumstantial evidence case. Because she had in her hand, I will say, \nthis job offer all through this period of November and December and \ninto January. It wasn't precisely what she wanted but it was a good \njob. It was in New York City. And there was no urgent necessity for \nher, connected with her private sector job search. Once again, quid pro \nquo? No.\n  Now, there is a lot of further direct evidence concerning her job \nsearch. And this is contained in a great many interviews in grand jury \ntranscript from the people at the various New York firms Mr. Jordan \ncontacted on Ms. Lewinsky's behalf. Again, there is simply no direct \nevidence whatsoever from any of these people of any kind of quid pro \nquo treatment. While Mr. Jordan made the contacts on her behalf, there \nwas no urgency about them. There was no pressure, and they were wholly \nunrelated to the Jones case.\n  Let's recognize the obvious here. The President's relation, improper \nrelation with Ms. Lewinsky, had been over for many months. He continued \nto see her from time to time. He did what he could to be of assistance \nto her as she sought employment in New York because, as he testified, \nshe was a good person, and he was trying to help her get on with her \nlife.\n  Mr. Jordan was able to open some doors, but once open, there was no \ninappropriate pressure. He really opened three doors for her: at \nAmerican Express, at Young & Rubicam, and at Revlon. And she batted one \nfor three. And actually in job searches, as in baseball, I, at least, \nwill take that batting average any day of the week. But she succeeded \non her own once she was through the door, and her getting through the \ndoor had no relation to the Paula Jones case.\n  Let's, first of all, take a look at what happened with American \nExpress and see whether in direct or circumstantial evidence there is \nany evidence of a quid pro quo here. The independent counsel conducted \na very large number of interviews and also summoned a great many \nwitnesses from each of these three sets of companies. Mr. Jordan was a \nmember of the American Express board of directors, and he telephoned a \nMs. Ursula Fairbairn, the Executive Vice President of Human Resources \nat American Express on December 10 or 11. And he told Ms. Fairbairn \nthat he wanted to send her the resume of a talented young woman in \nWashington, to see whether she matched up to any openings at American \nExpress.\n  Ms. Fairbairn told the FBI that it was not at all unusual for \nAmerican Express board members or other company officers to recommend \nyoung people for employment. Ms. Fairbairn said Mr. Jordan did not, in \nfact, mention any White House connection that the applicant had, and he \nexerted no pressure at all on her to hire the applicant. Ms. Fairbairn \nrecalled that Mr. Jordan made another employment recommendation about 2 \nmonths earlier and indicated this was simply not an unusual request.\n  Now, the Office of Independent Counsel also--you see it on the \nchart--interviewed Thomas Schick at American Express. He is the \nExecutive Vice President for Corporate Affairs and Communications.\n  Ms. Fairbairn had sent the name and resume to Mr. Schick because she \nthought that is where Ms. Lewinsky might fit in, and he interviewed Ms. \nLewinsky on December 23 in Washington. He decided after this interview \nnot to hire Ms. Lewinsky because she was--he felt she was lacking in \nexperience and he also thought that American Express was probably not \nthe right kind of company for her, given what she had told him she was \ninterested in at the interview, and that she probably would be better \noff going to a public relations firm.\n\n  The decision not to hire, he told the FBI, was entirely his own. He \nfelt no pressure to either hire or not hire Ms. Lewinsky and never \ntalked to Mr. Jordan at any time during this process. Once again, quid \npro quo? No.\n  The second company--actually two companies. It is Young & Rubicam and \nBurson-Marsteller. Mr. Jordan called Peter Georgescu, the chairman and \nCEO of Young & Rubicam, the large New York advertising agency. Mr. \nJordan had no formal connection with the company, but he had been a \nfriend of Mr. Georgescu's for over 20 years.\n  Mr. Georgescu was interviewed by investigators of the Office of \nIndependent Counsel and said that sometime in December 1997, Mr. Jordan \nhad telephoned\n\n[[Page S840]]\n\nhim and had asked him to take a look at a young person from the White \nHouse for possible work in the New York area.\n  Mr. Georgescu had responded, ``We'll take a look at her in the usual \nway.'' And he stated that that was a kind of a code between him and Mr. \nJordan, and it meant that if there was an opening for which she was \nqualified, she would be interviewed and hired, but there would be no \nspecial treatment. He testified that Mr. Jordan understood that, and he \nalso said that Mr. Jordan did not engage in any kind of sales pitch \nabout Lewinsky.\n  Mr. Georgescu said that he then initiated an interview on behalf of \nMs. Lewinsky, but his own involvement was arm's length, and that she \nsucceeded or failed totally on her own merits.\n  He recalled that Mr. Jordan had made another similar request on a \nprevious occasion, and he said that he and Mr. Jordan frequently \nexchanged opinions about people in the advertising business on an \ninformal basis.\n  As a result of this telephone call, Ms. Lewinsky was interviewed by \nanother person, a Ms. Celia Berk, who was the managing director of \nhuman resources at Burson-Marsteller, a public relations firm that was \na division of Young & Rubicam. According to Ms. Berk, this interview \nwas handled ``by the book,'' and while Ms. Lewinsky's interviews were a \nlittle bit accelerated, they went through the normal steps.\n  Ms. Berk testified that nobody put any pressure on her. She said that \nwhile both she and the director of corporate practice at Burson-\nMarsteller, Erin Mills, and another corporate practice associate, Ziad \nToubassy, had all liked Ms. Lewinsky and felt she was well qualified, \nthe chairman of the corporate practice group, Mr. Gus Weill had decided \nnot to hire Lewinsky.\n  Ms. Mills testified that the procedure under which Ms. Lewinsky was \nconsidered involved nothing out of the ordinary. Not a single one of \nthese witnesses testified there was any urgency connected with Mr. \nJordan's request.\n  Ms. Mills also told the FBI that despite the fact that Ms. Lewinsky \nhad been referred by the chairman of Young & Rubicam, their \nconsideration of her was entirely objective. She thought that Ms. \nLewinsky was poised and qualified for an entry-level position, but Mr. \nWeill decided to take a pass. Once again, quid pro quo? No.\n  Mr. Jordan was a member of the board of directors of Revlon, a \ncompany wholly owned by MacAndrews & Forbes Holding company, and Mr. \nJordan's law firm had done legal work for both of these companies.\n  The corporate structure here is complicated, but I will be talking \nbasically about two firms: Revlon--I think we all know what Revlon \ndoes--and its parent company, MacAndrews & Forbes Holding.\n  Mr. Jordan telephoned his old friend, Mr. Richard Halperin, at the \nholding company on December 11 and said that he had an interviewee or \nhe had an applicant that he wanted to recommend, and he gave Mr. \nHalperin some information about her. Mr. Halperin testified to the \ngrand jury that it wasn't unusual for Mr. Jordan to call him with an \nemployment recommendation. He had done so at least three other times \nthat Mr. Halperin could recall.\n  On this occasion, Mr. Jordan told Mr. Halperin on the telephone that \nMs. Lewinsky was bright, energetic, enthusiastic, and he encouraged Mr. \nHalperin to meet with her. Mr. Halperin didn't think there was anything \nunusual about Mr. Jordan's request, and he testified that in the \ntelephone call Mr. Jordan did not ask him to consider Ms. Lewinsky on \nany particular timetable, no acceleration of any kind. Indeed, far from \nthere being some heightened sense of urgency, Mr. Halperin explicitly \ntold the FBI that there was no implied time constraint or requirement \nfor fast action.\n  Ms. Lewinsky came up to New York City and she interviewed with Mr. \nHalperin on December 18, 1997. Mr. Halperin described her as follows: \nAs a ``typical young, capable, enthusiastic Washington, DC-type \nindividual.'' I don't know if that is pejorative or not----\n  (Laughter.)\n  Who described her primary interest as being in public relations. He \nand Ms. Lewinsky talked about the various companies that MacAndrews & \nForbes controlled, and Ms. Lewinsky identified Revlon as a company that \nshe would like to be considered at, and Mr. Halperin decided to send \nher there for an interview.\n  Mr. Halperin sent her resume to another person at the holding \ncompany--not at Revlon, at the holding company--to a Mr. Jaymie Durnan \nwho was a senior vice president there. He got the resume in mid-\nDecember, and he decided to interview her in early January.\n  You have at the holding company two sets of interviews of Ms. \nLewinsky going on. When he returned in early January, Mr. Durnan also \nscheduled an interview. He met with Ms. Lewinsky on January 8. His \ndecision was made entirely independently of Mr. Halperin's decision, \nand he wasn't even aware Mr. Halperin had seen Ms. Lewinsky when he met \nwith her on January 8.\n  Mr. Durnan met with Ms. Lewinsky in the morning and he thought--now \nthere is his view and you are going to get two views of this \ninterview--Mr. Durnan thought she was an impressive applicant for \nentry-level work. He was impressed with her, particularly by her work \nexperience at the Pentagon, he told the FBI. He felt she would fit in \nwith the parent company, but there were not any openings there.\n  Based upon what she had said her interests were, he decided to send \nher resume over to Revlon, because he thought it matched up well with \nher interests. He sent the resume over, and he left a message--and now \nwe are going to come to a Revlon person--he left a message with Ms. \nAllyn Seidman, who was the senior vice president of corporate \ncommunications at Revlon.\n  Now cut to Ms. Lewinsky. Ms. Lewinsky had had a very good interview \nwith Mr. Halperin, both she and Mr. Halperin thought. However, for \nreasons the record doesn't make clear, Ms. Lewinsky's impression of the \nDurnan interview was dismal. She thought the interview had not gone \nwell. She thought it had gone poorly. She described herself as being \nupset and distressed. She had no idea of his positive reaction to \nher. And this is not just a late analysis. He had already sent the \nresume. He sent the resume over to Revlon immediately after their \ninterview. But in any event, Ms. Lewinsky was afraid it had gone \npoorly, that she had embarrassed Mr. Jordan. So she called up Mr. \nJordan.\n\n  And on that same day--later--January 8, Mr. Jordan spoke, by \ntelephone, to the CEO of MacAndrews & Forbes, his friend, Mr. Ronald \nPerelman. He mentioned to Mr. Perelman that Ms. Lewinsky had \ninterviewed at MacAndrews & Forbes, but he made no specific request and \nhe did not ask Mr. Perelman to specifically intervene in any way.\n  Now, later that day--and I know this is complicated--Mr. Durnan \nhappened to speak--Mr. Durnan is the second interviewer that Ms. \nLewinsky happened to speak to--happened to speak to Mr. Perelman, and \nPerelman mentioned he had a call from Mr. Jordan about a job candidate. \nPerelman then said to Durnan, ``Let's see what we can do.'' And Durnan \nindicated he already, on his own initiative, had been working on this, \nhad talked to Ms. Lewinsky, had sent her resume over to Revlon.\n  Mr. Perelman, later that day, phoned Mr. Jordan back to say \neverything is all right, she appeared to be doing a good job, the \nresume was over at Revlon. Mr. Jordan expressed no urgency, no time \nconstraints. Mr. Perelman didn't say anything out of the ordinary had \nhappened, because it had not.\n  Now, later that same day, after speaking to Mr. Perelman, Mr. Durnan \nphoned Ms. Seidman at Revlon, and sent the resume over earlier in the \nday. He didn't say that Mr. Perelman had mentioned Ms. Lewinsky to him. \nHe simply said to Ms. Seidman: Look, I sent you a resume. I have met \nwith the young woman. If you think she is good, you should hire her.\n  According to Mr. Durnan, Mr. Perelman never said or implied that Ms. \nLewinsky had to be hired. And indeed, Mr. Durnan had already \ninterviewed her and formed a positive impression. According to Ms. \nSeidman, who is at Revlon, Mr. Durnan gave her a similar account that \nhe gave to the grand jury. He said she ought to interview Ms. Lewinsky, \nmake her own decision, hire her if she thought she was a good candidate \nonly.\n\n[[Page S841]]\n\n  The record is crystal clear that Ms. Seidman over at Revlon had no \nknowledge that Mr. Perelman had ever spoken to anyone about Ms. \nLewinsky. Ms. Seidman testified that she made an independent assessment \nof Ms. Lewinsky. She interviewed her the next day. She told the grand \njury that she found Ms. Lewinsky to be ``a talented, enthusiastic, \nbright young woman who was very eager. I liked that in my department.''\n  At the conclusion of the interview, she intended to make an offer to \nMs. Lewinsky, but it was contingent on the opinion of two other \npeople--a Ms. Jenna Sheldon, who is the manager of human resources at \nRevlon, and Ms. Nancy Risdon, who is the manager of public relations \nfor corporate affairs. Ms. Seidman testified that after they both \ninterviewed Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Risdon told her that she found her very \nimpressive, and Ms. Sheldon had also been very impressed. Ms. Risdon \ntold the FBI that she had been impressed with Ms. Lewinsky who, \nalthough she had no public relations experience, was ``bright and \narticulate.'' On the basis of all this, Ms. Seidman decided to offer \nMs. Lewinsky an entry-level job as public relations administrator. The \noffer was made, and Ms. Lewinsky accepted. And, I repeat, the record \nevidence is uncontradicted that the fix was not on at all in this \nprocess.\n  This was the third company Ms. Lewinsky had interviewed with, and on \nthis series of interviews she was successful. Nobody in any of these \ncompanies suggested there was any quid pro quo link. The only person--\nthe only person--in this record who talked about trying to have Ms. \nLewinsky use signing of the affidavit as leverage to get a job was none \nother than Linda Tripp, that paragon of fateful friendship.\n\n  On the audiotapes, it is Ms. Tripp who frequently urges Ms. Lewinsky \nnot to sign an affidavit until she has a job in New York. It is not \nclear if Ms. Tripp knew about the UN job that Ms. Lewinsky had. She--on \nthe audiotape, Ms. Lewinsky sometimes professes agreement with Ms. \nTripp's advice, saying she will not sign an affidavit until she has a \njob. But, as Ms. Lewinsky testified to the grand jury--and, again, Ms. \nLewinsky is testifying under the threat of perjury, which will blow \naway her immunity agreement--she was lying to Ms. Tripp when she said \nshe would wait to sign the affidavit until she got a job.\n  As Ms. Lewinsky testified to the grand jury, her statement to Ms. \nTripp about Mr. Jordan assisting her in a quid pro quo sense was not \ntrue. She said it only because Ms. Tripp was insisting that she promise \nher not to do this. But, in fact, the affidavit was already signed when \nMs. Lewinsky made that promise. Once again, quid pro quo? No. That is \nsome of the direct evidence.\n  Now, let's look at the circumstantial evidence, the alleged \ncircumstantial evidence. The quid pro quo theory rests on assumptions \nabout why things happened and, on the facts, about when things \nhappened. The former requires logic, but the second is a matter of \nfact.\n  I mentioned previously that article II of the subpart (4) here uses \nthe word ``intensified.'' It didn't say that the job search began as an \neffort to silence Ms. Lewinsky. It only says that it ``intensified'' as \na result of that process.\n  The original charge made by the independent counsel--and it is there \nin the independent counsel's referral at page 181--was an allegation \nthat the President helped Ms. Lewinsky obtain a job in New York at a \ntime when she would have been a witness against him. However, the House \ncommittee looked at the evidence I think in the five volumes and, even \nthough they have not referred to it here very much, decided that that \ntheory would not get off the runway. So they revised their claim and \ngave us a kind of wimpified version, alleging not initiation but \nintensification.\n  Now, under the right circumstances, it is plain that helping somebody \nfind a job is a perfectly acceptable thing to do. There is nothing \nwrong with it. Mr. Manager Hutchinson told you that --and I quote \nhere--``There is nothing wrong with helping somebody get a job. But we \nall know there is one thing forbidden in public office: we must avoid \nquid pro quo, which is: This for that.''\n  Now, he went on to assert that the President's conduct ``crossed the \nline,'' as he put it, when the job search assistance became ``tied and \ninterconnected''--those are his words--with the President's desire to \nget a false affidavit. And then he went on to say, ``You will see''--\nthat is a prediction that Mr. Manager Hutchinson made to you--``You \nwill see that they are totally interconnected, intertwined, \ninterrelated; and that is where the line has crossed into \nobstruction.''\n  Now, Mr. Manager Hutchinson pointed to a critical event for their \nquid pro quo theory, and that is the entry on December 11, 1997, by \nJudge Wright, the judge in the Paula Jones case, of an order pertaining \nto discovery in the Paula Jones case. This is the critical event, \naccording to the managers. But let's look closely at this so-called \n``critical event'' because it's the only claim--only factual claim--the \nmanagers make of some causal relationship between the job search and \nthe Jones case. And that claim is dead wrong; and it is demonstrably \ndead wrong.\n  The managers have argued that what brought Mr. Jordan into action to \nhelp Ms. Lewinsky find a job, what really jump-started the process, was \nJudge Wright's December 11 order. And that order concerned discovery of \nrelationships the President had--allegedly had--during the search \nperiod of time with women who were State or Federal employees.\n  In the House, Chief Counsel Schippers powerfully made the point about \nhow important this December 11 order was. ``. . . why the sudden \ninterest,'' he asked, ``why the total change in focus and effort? \nNobody but Betty Currie really cared about helping Ms. Lewinsky \nthroughout November, even after the President learned that her name was \non the prospective witness list. Did something happen [that moved] the \njob search from a low to a high priority on that day?\n  Oh, yes, something happened. On the morning of December 11, 1997, \nJudge Susan Webber Wright ordered that Paula Jones was entitled to \ninformation regarding'' these other women.\n  Now, Mr. Manager Hutchinson, again, emphasized the impact of this \nDecember 11 order was dramatic. He stood here and told you that the \nPresident's attitude suddenly changed, and what started out as a favor \nfor Betty Currie in finding Ms. Lewinsky a job dramatically changed \ninto something sinister after Ms. Lewinsky became a witness.\n\n       And so what triggers [this is Manager Hutchinson]--let's \n     look at the chain of events: The judge--the witness list came \n     in, the judge's order came in, that triggered the President \n     into action and the President triggered Vernon Jordan into \n     action. That chain reaction here is what moved the job search \n     along . . . remember what else happened on that [December 11] \n     again. That was the same day that Judge Wright ruled that the \n     questions about other relationships could be asked by the \n     Jones attorneys.\n\n  Mr. Manager Hutchinson presented in his very polished and able \npresentation a chart. It was exhibit 1. I have taken the liberty of \nborrowing it for our own purposes. You see the key is outlined in \ndetail what happened on December 11. The very first item is that \n``Judge Susan Webber issues order allowing testimony on Lewinsky.'' The \nsecond meeting between Lewinsky and Jordan, ``leads provided/\nrecommendation calls placed,'' and then, later, the ``President and \nJordan talk about a job for Lewinsky.''\n  Well, that is what the chart says. But when you look at the \nuncontested facts, this isn't even smoke and mirrors. It is worse.\n  First of all, Ms. Lewinsky entered Mr. Jordan's building for their \nmeeting at 12:57 on December 11. As we see here from the chart, the \nentry chart of Mr. Jordan's law firm, Ms. Lewinsky's name is \nmisspelled, and she identified this as her entry into the law firm. But \nthis did not spring from, magically, the entry of the judge's order. It \nwas scheduled 3 days earlier, on December 8. And even that telephone \ncall was pursuant to an agreement made between Ms. Lewinsky and Mr. \nJordan two weekends before then. It had nothing, whatever, to do with \nthe judge's order.\n  Indeed, after her first meeting with Mr. Jordan on November 5, Ms. \nLewinsky testified that she had a follow-up conversation by telephone \nwith Mr. Jordan around Thanksgiving, and he advised her he was working \non the job search as he had time for it. He asked her to call him back \nin early December. Mr. Jordan testified he was\n\n[[Page S842]]\n\nout of the country from the day after Thanksgiving until December 4. He \nalso testified that on December 5--this is before the witness list--Ms. \nCurrie called and reminded him that Ms. Lewinsky was expecting his \ncall. He asked Ms. Currie to have Ms. Lewinsky call him. She does so on \nDecember 8 and they agreed to meet at Mr. Jordan's office on December \n11.\n  So this meeting, this sinister meeting, was arranged by three people \nwho had no knowledge whatever about the Paula Jones witness list at the \ntime they acted. Now, Ms. Lewinsky herself was also out of Washington \nfor most of the period from Thanksgiving to December 4, first in Los \nAngeles and then overseas.\n  Inexplicably, but I think significantly, because it says something \nabout the strength of the case, the House managers ignore this key \npiece of testimony that when the meeting was set up it is \nuncontradicted. The point is that the contact between Mr. Jordan and \nMs. Lewinsky resumed in December not because of something having to do \nwith the order, but because they had agreed it would. The gap is \nattributable--the gap in timing--to Mr. Jordan's travel schedule.\n\n  Now, let's look at when this discovery order was entered. It was, in \nfact, entered late in the day of December 11 after the conclusion of a \nconference call among all the counsel in the Paula Jones case. We have \nhere on the chart a blowup of the clerk's minutes.\n  Now, it is a great accommodation to lawyers when in a case a judge \nwill have conference telephone calls because it means you don't have to \ntravel to a different city. There were a number of these held in the \nJones case. This was a conference call that began, as the clerk's \nminutes indicate, at 5:33 p.m. Little Rock time, in the afternoon. That \nwould be 6:33 in Washington, DC. It ended at 6:50 p.m. in Little Rock, \nor 7:50 in Washington, DC.\n  Now, quite late in the conference call Judge Wright took up other \nmatters and advised counsel that an order on the plaintiff's motion to \ncompel testimony had been filed and Barry--Barry Ward, the judge's \nclerk--will fax a copy of the order on that motion to compel counsel. \nSo, some time after 7:50 p.m. counsel get the witness list. Notice that \nthis proceeding is so late in the day, I don't know if you can see it, \nbut when the clerk's minutes are filed, they are filed not on December \n11, but on December 12.\n  Finally, while we don't even have evidence of a telephone call \nbetween the President and Mr. Jordan--we are back now to Mr. Manager \nHutchinson's chart No. 1--we don't have any evidence that the \nPresident, in fact, ever placed a call to Mr. Jordan on this date. The \nPresident was out of the city. But if the call occurred, it must have \noccurred by 5:55 p.m.\n  Now, let's, again, look at this chart. December 11 is so important \nthat the managers have put it on the chart twice. It is the only date \non the chart that appears twice. ``The President and Jordan talk about \na job for Lewinsky.'' Clearly what they are telling you is that first \nyou get the order. That energizes, that jump starts the process, and \nthen the President talks to Vernon Jordan. As I said, if a call \noccurred on that day, the earliest you could have had any knowledge of \nthe order would have been 7:50 p.m.\n  There is a problem, though, when you think that maybe the President \nand Vernon Jordan talked on this date, even if we don't have evidence \nof it. And the problem is that at 7:50 p.m., Mr. Vernon Jordan was high \nover the Atlantic Ocean in an airplane. He was on his way to Amsterdam. \nHe testified that ``I left on United Flight 946 at 5:55 from Dulles \nAirport.'' That is where Mr. Jordan was on the evening of December 11. \nHe had taken off even before the conference call.\n  This makes no sense. The managers' theory just makes no sense. His \nmeeting with Ms. Lewinsky and his calls on her behalf had taken place \nearlier in the day. The President could not have spoken to him about \nthe entry of Judge Wright's discovery order. The entry of that order \nhad nothing whatever to do with Mr. Jordan's assistance to Ms. \nLewinsky. This claim of a causal relation totally collapses when you \nlook a the evidence.\n  Now, the charts purporting to show causation are also riddled with \nerror. I only want to show a few of them. Again, we borrowed the chart \nfrom Mr. Manager Hutchinson, his chart No. 7. Now he showed you this \nchart and it purports to be an account of what happened on January 5, \n1998. You see how the President and Ms. Lewinsky appear to be \nconferring about the affidavit that she is going to be filing in the \nJones case. But when you look at the real facts, the chart becomes a \nfiction.\n  Mr. Manager Hutchinson told you:\n\n       Let's go to January 5th. This is a sort of summary of what \n     happened on that day.\n       Ms. Lewinsky meets with her attorney, Mr. Carter, for an \n     hour. Carter drafts the affidavit for Ms. Lewinsky just a few \n     minutes later . . .\n\n  And Mr. Manager Hutchinson continued:\n\n       Frank Carter drafts the affidavit. She is so concerned \n     about it, she calls the President. The President returns Ms. \n     Lewinsky's phone call.\n\n  Now, the suggestion here--and this is our old circumstantial evidence \nproblem--the suggestion from this fact pattern is that Ms. Lewinsky \nobtained a draft affidavit from her lawyer, Mr. Carter, on January 5, \nand then in a call with the President later that day she offered it to \nhim for his review.\n  Possible? Yes. True? No. The facts here simply do not bear out this \nchart. Why is that? Well, it is because Mr. Carter's grand jury \ntestimony is very clear that he drafted the affidavit on the morning of \nJanuary 6, and he even billed for it on that morning. He did not draft \nit, and Ms. Lewinsky did not have it, on January 5. There is no \ncausation here, no linkage. The theory on this chart doesn't stand up, \nand if I may take something else from the House managers--not simply \ntheir chart, but to borrow Mr. Manager Bryant's expression, ``that dog \nwon't hunt.''\n  Ms. Lewinsky could not have offered to show the President a draft \naffidavit she herself could not have had on January 5. The idea that \nthe telephone call on that day is about that affidavit is sheer, \nunsupported speculation and, even worse, it is speculation demolished \nby fact.\n  Let's kick the tires of another exhibit. Chart No. 8, which was shown \nto you by Mr. Manager Hutchinson, purports to describe the events of \nJanuary 6. Again, it sets forth a chain of events which makes it look \nas though Mr. Jordan was himself intimately involved in drafting Ms. \nLewinsky's affidavit. Mr. Manager Hutchinson told you when he showed \nyou this chart--and I want to quote his exact words:\n\n       The next exhibit is January 6. On this particular day, Ms. \n     Lewinsky picks up the draft affidavit. At 2:08 to 2:10 p.m., \n     she delivers that affidavit. To whom? Mr. Jordan. . . . At \n     3:48, he telephones Ms. Lewinsky about the draft affidavit, \n     and at 3:49--you will see in red--both agree to delete a \n     portion of the affidavit that created some implication that \n     maybe she had been alone with the President.\n       So Mr. Jordan was very involved in the drafting of the \n     affidavit and the contents of that.\n\n  That is the theory proposed by the chart. That is the hypothesis they \noffer on the basis of the circumstantial evidence. But there are \nproblems that absolutely destroy that because when we look beyond the \nsuggestive juxtaposition and consider material overlooked by the \nmanagers, a very different picture emerges.\n  The key ``fact'' that chart 8 tries to establish is the statement \nthat at 3:49 Mr. Jordan telephoned Ms. Lewinsky to discuss the draft \naffidavit, and they allegedly agreed ``to delete an implication that \nshe had been alone with the President.''\n  There is a very serious difficulty with this ``theory.'' The chart \nblithely states that ``both agree[d] to delete [the] implications that \nshe had been alone with the President.'' But that is not what evidence \nshows.\n  Ms. Lewinsky testified that she spoke to Mr. Jordan because she had \nconcerns about the draft affidavit. According to her testimony, when \nasked whether Mr. Jordan agreed with what were clearly Ms. Lewinsky's \nideas about changes in the affidavit, Ms. Lewinsky said, ``Yes, I \nbelieve so.''\n\n  Now, Mr. Jordan recalled the conversation in which Ms. Lewinsky \nraised the subject of her draft affidavit. He remembered her saying \nthat she ``had some questions about the draft of the affidavit.'' But \nhis testimony was emphatic that he was ``not interested in the \ndetails,'' that the ``problems she had with what had been drafted for \nher\n\n[[Page S843]]\n\nsignature [were] for her to work out with her counsel,'' and that ``you \n[Ms. Lewinsky] have to talk to your lawyer about it.'' And Ms. Lewinsky \ndid talk to her lawyer about it.\n  The record is perfectly clear about that. Indeed, it could not be \nclearer, although you would not know this from chart 8, that the idea \nof deleting the reference to her being alone with the President came \nfrom her own lawyer, Mr. Carter. He testified to the grand jury--this \nis the lawyer who actually drafted the affidavit. He was referring to a \npassage about Ms. Lewinsky being alone with the President and he said:\n\n       Paragraph 6 has in its [draft] form as the last part of the \n     last sentence ``and would not have been a `private meeting, \n     that is not behind closed doors'. . . .''\n\n  According to Mr. Carter:\n\n       This paragraph was modified when we sat down in my office \n     [on January 7], the day after the events described on chart \n     8.\n\n  Mr. Carter further testified that ``before the meeting on the 7th, it \nwas my opinion that I did not want to give Paula Jones' attorney any \nkind of a hint of a one-on-one meeting. What I told Monica was, ``If \nthey ask you about it, you will tell them about it. But I'm not putting \nit in the affidavit. I am not going to give them that lead to go after \nin the affidavit, because my objective is not to have you be deposed.''\n  It is clearly Mr. Carter who deleted the reference to being alone \nwith the President. The bottom line is that the insinuations on that \nchart just don't survive scrutiny.\n  I want to say a final thing about all the charts involving \ncircumstantial evidence. You remember how many telephone calls were up \non these charts. I am going to let you in on a little secret--a secret \nthat a lot of you who are lawyers know. It is pretty easy to get \ntelephone call records and to identify telephone calls. But it is a \ncommon trick to put them up, even though you don't know what is going \non in the telephone calls, and ask people to assume some insidious \nrelationship between events and the telephone call. No matter how many \ntelephone calls are listed on the chart, you don't know, without \ntestimony, what was happening in that phone call, unless the mere \nexistence--and there are cases where the mere existence of a phone call \nis probative, but not in these cases. Here they are trying to weave a \nweb, and no particular call is of significant importance.\n  The incontroverted evidence shows that, in fact, Mr. Jordan spoke to \nthe President on many, many, many occasions. He was a friend; he has \nbeen a friend of the President since 1973, and a call between them was \na common occurrence. When asked in the grand jury if Mr. Jordan \nbelieved that the pattern of telephone calls to the President was \n``striking,'' Mr. Jordan replied, ``It depends on your point of view. I \ntalk to the President of the United States all the time, and so it's \nnot striking to me.''\n  Mr. Jordan also testified that he never had a telephone conversation \nwith the President in which Ms. Lewinsky was the only topic.\n\n  The House managers ask you to believe, simply on faith, that if two \nthings happen on the same day, they are related. This relation may be \nlogical, but it is not necessarily factual. I just want to make this \npoint with a couple of telephone calls. Take Mr. Manager Hutchinson's \nchart for January 17, 1998, the day of the President's deposition in \nthe Jones case.\n  This chart suggests that there are two calls between Mr. Jordan and \nthe President after the President had concluded his deposition. One \ncall is at 5:38, and the other is at 7:02. The chart does not tell you \nseveral important things. First, these two calls each lasted 2 minutes. \nSecond, and more significantly, Mr. Jordan testified to the grand jury \nas to both telephone conversations:\n\n       On Saturday, the 17th, in the two conversations I had with \n     the President of the United States, we did not talk about \n     Monica Lewinsky or his testimony in the deposition.\n\n  Mr. Jordan was asked:\n\n       Or [about] the questions asked of him in the deposition?\n\n  And he replied:\n\n       That is correct.\n\n  In another exchange, the prosecutors asked Mr. Jordan:\n\n       Did the President ever indicate to you [in the January 17 \n     telephone conversations] that Monica Lewinsky was one of the \n     topics that had come up?\n\n  Jordan replied:\n\n       He did not.\n\n  The prosecutors asked:\n\n       Did the President ever indicate to you [in these two \n     conversations] that your name had come up in the deposition \n     as it related to Monica Lewinsky?\n\n  And Mr. Jordan answered:\n\n       He did not.\n\n  The managers, in the absence of evidence that anyone endeavored to \nobtain Ms. Lewinsky a job in exchange for her silence, indeed, in the \nface of direct testimony of all of those involved that this did not \nhappen, ask you to simply speculate. They ask you to speculate that \nsince they have thrown a lot of telephone calls up there, they must \nhave some sinister meaning. And they ask you to speculate that a lot of \nthose phone calls must have been about Ms. Lewinsky, and they ask you \nto speculate further that in one of those unidentified, unknown phone \ncalls, somebody must have said, ``Let's get Ms. Lewinsky a job in \nexchange for her silence.''\n  There is no evidence for that. It is not there. It is just a theory.\n  With regard to all this evidence about the job search, when you look \nat these dates, when you have the right chronology in mind, and when \nyou look at the relevant and uncontested facts, these facts are there; \nthey don't have to be discovered: There is no, no evidence of \nwrongdoing of any kind in connection with Ms. Lewinsky's job search \neffort in New York City. This is not a case of the managers' \npresentation resting on even circumstantial as opposed to direct \nevidence. They don't even have circumstantial evidence here. All they \nhave is a theory about what happened, which isn't based on any evidence \neither direct or circumstantial.\n  Nothing in this evidence is really contested when you get right down \nto it; strictly as a matter of who said what to whom when. When lawyers \nask you to ``keep your eye on the big picture,'' when they ask you, \n``don't lose the forest for the trees,'' or ``don't get lost in the \ndetails,'' that is usually because the details--the stubborn facts--\nrefute and contradict the big picture.\n  So it is here. You can keep adding zero to zero to zero for a very \nlong time, and indeed forever, and you will still have zero. The big \npicture here just doesn't exist. And no matter how many times the House \nmanagers keep making the assertion, there is just no evidence of any \nkind.\n  I realize that it has taken us a good bit of time and painstaking--\nperhaps even painful--attention for each one of you to walk through \nthese facts in a lawyerly manner. I am also keenly aware of the old \nsaying that when all is said and done with a lawyer, there is more said \nthan done. But we needed to take a look carefully and specifically at \nthis evidentiary material with regard to these five grounds in the same \nway that Ms. Mills took you through very specifically yesterday with \nregard to the other two grounds to try and dispel the popular \nmisconception that we were either unwilling or unable to rebut the \nfacts. We have rebutted the facts.\n  The simple fact is that there is no evidence indirectly to support \nthe allegation that the President obstructed justice in his December 17 \ntelephone call with Ms. Lewinsky in his statements to his aides, in his \nstatements to Betty Currie with relation to gifts, or the job search. \nIt sometimes has been claimed by the managers that we have adopted a \n``so what'' defense trying to take lightly or to justify the improper \nactions that are at the root of this case. Well, Senators, with all \nrespect, that argument is easy to assert, but it is false, a straw man \nasserted, only to be knocked down.\n  We have tried in our presentations the last few days and today to \ntreat the evidence in a fair and a candid and a realistic way about the \nfacts as the record reveals them. We have tried to show you that the \ncore charges of obstruction of justice and perjury cannot be proven. We \nare not saying that the alleged conduct doesn't matter. We are saying \nthat perjury didn't occur, and obstruction of justice didn't happen.\n  We haven't tried to sugar-coat or excuse conduct that is wrong. I \nthink that Mr. Manager Buyer used the right phrase when he referred to \n``self-inflicted wounds.'' There is no doubt that\n\n[[Page S844]]\n\nthere are self-inflicted wounds here, wounds that are very real and \nvery painful and very troubling. There is just no question about that. \nThe question before you is whether these self-inflicted wounds rise to \nsuch a level of lawless and unconstitutional conduct that they leave \nyou no alternative, no choice but to assume the awesome responsibility \nfor reversing the results of two national elections.\n\n  On that question, what the situation demands is not eloquence, which \nthe very able managers have in abundance, but rather a relentless focus \non the facts, the law, and the Constitution, all of which are on the \nside of the President.\n  It is a great honor for me to stand here. This body has been called \n``the anchor of the Republic.'' And it is that constitutional ability, \nthat political sanity, that is needed now. There is a story, which is \nperhaps apocryphal, that when Thomas Jefferson returned from France \nwhere he served as Ambassador while his colleagues were writing the \nConstitution, that he met with George Washington, and he asked \nWashington why they had found it necessary to create the Senate. \nWashington is said to have silently removed the saucer from his teacup \nand poured the tea into the saucer and told Jefferson that like the act \nhe had just performed, the Senate would be designed to cool the passion \nof the moment. Historically, this place has been really a haven of \nsanity, balance, wisdom in debating controversial issues which have \nbeen passionately felt, with candor, with courage, and civility.\n  So once again, I think it is your responsibility and yours alone, \ncommitted to you by the Constitution, to make a very somber judgment. \nThe President has spoken powerfully and personally of his remorse for \nwhat he has done.\n  Others have pointed out the poisonous partisanship that led the other \nbody to argue for impeachment on the most narrowly partisan vote in its \nhistory.\n  I think that the bipartisan manner, however, in which you have \nconducted this impeachment trial is a welcome change from the events of \nthe last year.\n  We ask only that you give this case and give this country \nconstitutional stability and the political sanity which this country \ndeserves. The President did not commit perjury. He did not obstruct \njustice, and there are no grounds to remove him from office.\n  Thank you.\n\n\n                                 Recess\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that we recess \nthe proceedings for 15 minutes, but that Senators be prepared to resume \nat 5 minutes after 4, because we have to hear the eloquence of one of \nour former colleagues.\n  There being no objection, at 3:49 p.m., the Senate recessed until \n4:10 p.m.; whereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by \nthe Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I believe the Senate is \nprepared now to hear the final presentation to be made by White House \ncounsel, and at the conclusion of that, I will have a brief wrapup, a \nstatement to make about how we hope to proceed on Friday and generally \non Saturday. I will do that at the close of this presentation. I yield \nthe floor, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Counsel Bumpers to \ncontinue the presentation in the case of the President.\n  Mr. Counsel BUMPERS. Mr. Chief Justice, my distinguished House \nmanagers from the House of Representatives, colleagues, I have seen the \nlook of disappointment on many faces, because I know a lot of people \nreally thought they would be rid of me once and for all. (Laughter.)\n  I have taken a lot of ribbing this afternoon. But I have seriously \nnegotiated with some people, particularly on this side, about an offer \nto walk out and not deliver this speech in exchange for a few votes. \n(Laughter.)\n  I understand three have it under active consideration. (Laughter.)\n  It is a great joy to see you, and it is especially pleasant to see an \naudience which represents about the size of the cumulative audience I \nhad over a period of 24 years. (Laughter.)\n  I came here today for a lot of reasons. One was that I was promised a \n40-foot cord. I have been shorted 28 feet. Chris Dodd said he didn't \nwant me in his lap. I assume he arranged for the cord to be shortened.\n  I want to especially thank some of you for your kind comments in the \npress when it received some publicity that I would be here to close the \ndebate on behalf of the White House counsel and the President.\n  I was a little dismayed by Senator Bennett's remark. He said, ``Yes, \nSenator Bumpers is a great speaker, but he was never persuasive with me \nbecause I never agreed with him.'' (Laughter.)\n  I thought he could have done better than that. (Laughter.)\n  You can take some comfort, colleagues, in the fact that I am not \nbeing paid, and when I finish, you will probably think the White House \ngot their money's worth. (Laughter.)\n  I have told audiences that over 24 years, I went home almost every \nweekend and returned usually about dusk on Sunday evening. And you know \nthe plane ride into National Airport, when you can see the magnificent \nWashington Monument and this building from the window of the airplane--\nI have told these students at the university, a small liberal arts \nschool at home, Hendrix--after 24 years of that, literally hundreds of \ntimes, I never failed to get goose bumps.\n  The same thing is true about this Chamber. I can still remember as \nthough it was yesterday the awe I felt when I first stepped into this \nmagnificent Chamber so full of history, so beautiful. And last Tuesday, \nas I returned, after only a short 3-week absence, I still felt that \nsame sense of awe that I did the first time I walked in this Chamber.\n\n  Colleagues, I come here with some sense of reluctance. The President \nand I have been close friends for 25 years. We fought so many battles \nback home together in our beloved Arkansas. We tried mightily all of my \nyears as Governor and his, and all of my years in the Senate when he \nwas Governor, to raise the living standard in the delta area of \nMississippi, Arkansas and Louisiana, where poverty is unspeakable, with \nsome measure of success; not nearly enough.\n  We tried to provide health care for the lesser among us, for those \nwho are well off enough they can't get on welfare, but not making \nenough to buy health insurance. We have fought about everything else to \nimprove the educational standards for a State that for so many years \nwas at the bottom of the list, or near the bottom of the list, of \nincome, and we have stood side by side to save beautiful pristine areas \nin our State from environmental degradation.\n  We even crashed a twin engine Beech Bonanza trying to get to the \nGillett coon supper, a political event that one misses at his own risk. \nWe crashed this plane on a snowy evening at a rural airport off the \nrunway sailing out across the snow, jumped out--jumped out--and ran \naway unscathed, to the dismay of every politician in Arkansas. \n(Laughter.)\n  The President and I have been together hundreds of times at parades, \ndedications, political events, social events, and in all of those years \nand all of those hundreds of times we have been together, both in \npublic and in private, I have never one time seen the President conduct \nhimself in a way that did not reflect the highest credit on him, his \nfamily, his State and his beloved Nation.\n  The reason I came here today with some reluctance--please don't \nmisconstrue that, it has nothing to do with my feelings about the \nPresident, as I have already said--but it is because we are from the \nsame State, and we are long friends. I know that necessarily diminishes \nto some extent the effectiveness of my words. So if Bill Clinton, the \nman, Bill Clinton, the friend, were the issue here, I am quite sure I \nwould not be doing this. But it is the weight of history on all of us, \nand it is my reverence for that great document--you have heard me rail \nabout it for 24 years--that we call our Constitution, the most sacred \ndocument to me next to the Holy Bible.\n  These proceedings go right to the heart of our Constitution where it \ndeals with impeachment, the part that\n\n[[Page S845]]\n\nprovides the gravest punishment for just about anybody--the President--\neven though the framers said we are putting this in to protect the \npublic, not to punish the President.\n  Ah, colleagues, you have such an awesome responsibility. My good \nfriend, the senior Senator from New York, has said it well. He says a \ndecision to convict holds the potential for destabilizing the Office of \nthe Presidency. And those 400 historians--and I know some have made \nlight about those historians, are they just friends of Bill?\n  Last evening, I went over that list of historians, many of whom I \nknow, among them C. Vann Woodward. In the South we love him. He is the \npreeminent southern historian in the Nation. I promise you--he may be a \nDemocrat, he may even be a friend of the President, but when you talk \nabout integrity, he is the walking personification, exemplification of \nintegrity.\n\n  Well, colleagues, I have heard so many adjectives to describe this \ngallery and these proceedings--historic, memorable, unprecedented, \nawesome. All of those words, all of those descriptions are apt. And to \nthose, I would add the word ``dangerous,'' dangerous not only for the \nreasons I just stated, but because it is dangerous to the political \nprocess. And it is dangerous to the unique mix of pure democracy and \nrepublican government Madison and his colleagues so brilliantly crafted \nand which has sustained us for 210 years.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, this is what we lawyers call ``dicta''--this costs \nyou nothing. It is extra. But the more I study that document, and those \n4 months at Philadelphia in 1787, the more awed I am. And you know what \nMadison did--the brilliance was in its simplicity--he simply said: \nMan's nature is to get other people to dance to their tune. Man's \nnature is to abuse his fellow man sometimes. And he said: The way to \nmake sure that the majorities don't abuse the minorities, and the way \nto make sure that the bullies don't run over the weaklings, is to \nprovide the same rights for everybody. And I had to think about that a \nlong time before I delivered my first lecture at the University of \nArkansas last week. And it made so much sense to me.\n  But the danger, as I say, is to the political process, and dangerous \nfor reasons feared by the framers about legislative control of the \nExecutive. That single issue and how to deal with impeachment was \ndebated off and on for the entire 4 months of the Constitutional \nConvention. But the word ``dangerous'' is not mine. It is Alexander \nHamilton's--brilliant, good-looking guy--Mr. Ruff quoted extensively on \nTuesday afternoon in his brilliant statement here. He quoted Alexander \nHamilton precisely, and it is a little arcane. It isn't easy to \nunderstand.\n  So if I may, at the expense of being slightly repetitious, let me \nparaphrase what Hamilton said. He said: The Senate had a unique role in \nparticipating with the executive branch in appointments; and, two, it \nhad a role--it had a role--in participating with the executive in the \ncharacter of a court for the trial of impeachments. But he said--and I \nmust say this; and you all know it--he said it would be difficult to \nget a, what he called, well-constituted court from wholly elected \nMembers. He said: Passions would agitate the whole community and divide \nit between those who were friendly and those who had inimical interests \nto the accused; namely, the President. Then he said--and these are his \nwords: The greatest danger was that the decision would be based on the \ncomparative strength of the parties rather than the innocence or guilt \nof the President.\n  You have a solemn oath, you have taken a solemn oath, to be fair and \nimpartial. I know you all. I know you as friends, and I know you as \nhonorable men. And I am perfectly satisfied to put that in your hands, \nunder your oath.\n  This is the only caustic thing I will say in these remarks this \nafternoon, but the question is, How do we come to be here? We are here \nbecause of a 5-year, relentless, unending investigation of the \nPresident, $50 million, hundreds of FBI agents fanning across the \nNation, examining in detail the microscopic lives of people--maybe the \nmost intense investigation not only of a President, but of anybody \never.\n\n  I feel strongly about this because of my State and what we have \nendured. So you will have to excuse me, but that investigation has also \nshown that the judicial system in this country can and does get out of \nkilter unless it is controlled. Because there are innocent people--\ninnocent people--who have been financially and mentally bankrupt.\n  One woman told me 2 years ago that her legal fees were $95,000. She \nsaid, ``I don't have $95,000. And the only asset I have is the equity \nin my home, which just happens to correspond to my legal fees of \n$95,000.'' And she said, ``The only thing I can think of to do is to \ndeed my home.'' This woman was innocent, never charged, testified \nbefore a grand jury a number of times. And since that time she has \naccumulated an additional $200,000 in attorney fees.\n  Javert's pursuit of Jean Valjean in Les Miserables pales by \ncomparison. I doubt there are few people--maybe nobody in this body--\nwho could withstand such scrutiny. And in this case those summoned were \nterrified, not because of their guilt, but because they felt guilt or \ninnocence was not really relevant. But after all of those years, and \n$50 million of Whitewater, Travelgate, Filegate--you name it--nothing, \nnothing. The President was found guilty of nothing--official or \npersonal.\n  We are here today because the President suffered a terrible moral \nlapse of marital infidelity--not a breach of the public trust, not a \ncrime against society, the two things Hamilton talked about in \nFederalist Paper No. 65--I recommend it to you before you vote--but it \nwas a breach of his marriage vows. It was a breach of his family trust. \nIt is a sex scandal. H.L. Mencken one time said, ``When you hear \nsomebody say, `This is not about money,' it's about money.'' (Laughter)\n  And when you hear somebody say, ``This is not about sex,'' it's about \nsex.\n  You pick your own adjective to describe the President's conduct. Here \nare some that I would use: indefensible, outrageous, unforgivable, \nshameless. I promise you the President would not contest any of those \nor any others.\n  But there is a human element in this case that has not even been \nmentioned. That is, the President and Hillary and Chelsea are human \nbeings. This is intended only as a mild criticism of our distinguished \nfriends from the House. But as I listened to the presenters, to the \nmanagers, make their opening statements, they were remarkably well \nprepared and they spoke eloquently--more eloquently than I really had \nhoped.\n  But when I talk about the human element, I talk about what I thought \nwas, on occasion, an unnecessarily harsh, pejorative description of the \nPresident. I thought that the language should have been tempered \nsomewhat to acknowledge that he is the President. To say constantly \nthat the President lied about this and lied about that--as I say, I \nthought that was too much for a family that has already been about as \ndecimated as a family can get. The relationship between husband and \nwife, father and child, has been incredibly strained, if not destroyed. \nThere has been nothing but sleepless nights, mental agony, for this \nfamily, for almost 5 years, day after day, from accusations of having \nVince Foster assassinated, on down. It has been bizarre.\n  I didn't sense any compassion. And perhaps none is deserved. The \nPresident has said for all to hear that he misled, he deceived, he did \nnot want to be helpful to the prosecution, and he did all of those \nthings to his family, to his friends, to his staff, to his Cabinet, and \nto the American people. Why would he do that? Well, he knew this whole \naffair was about to bring unspeakable embarrassment and humiliation on \nhimself, his wife whom he adored, and a child that he worshipped with \nevery fiber of his body and for whom he would happily have died to \nspare her or to ameliorate her shame and her grief.\n  The House managers have said shame, an embarrassment is no excuse for \nlying. The question about lying--that is your decision. But I can tell \nyou, put yourself in his position--and you have already had this big \nmoral lapse--as to what you would do. We are, none of us, perfect. \nSure, you say, he should have thought of all that beforehand. And \nindeed he should, just as Adam and Eve should have, just as you and you \nand you and you and millions of other people who have been caught\n\n[[Page S846]]\n\nin similar circumstances should have thought of it before. As I say, \nnone of us is perfect.\n  I remember, Chaplain--the Chaplain is not here; too bad, he ought to \nhear this story. This evangelist was holding this great revival meeting \nand in the close of one of his meetings he said, ``Is there anybody in \nthis audience who has ever known anybody who even comes close to the \nperfection of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ?'' Nothing. He repeated \nthe challenge and, finally, a little-bitty guy in the back held up his \nhand. ``Are you saying you have known such a person? Stand up.'' He \nstood up and said, ``Tell us, who was it?'' He said, ``My wife's first \nhusband.''\n  Make no mistake about it: Removal from office is punishment. It is \nunbelievable punishment, even though the framers didn't quite see it \nthat way. Again, they said--and it bears repeating over and over \nagain--they said they wanted to protect the people. But I can tell you \nthis: The punishment of removing Bill Clinton from office would pale \ncompared to the punishment he has already inflicted on himself. There \nis a feeling in this country that somehow or another Bill Clinton has \ngotten away with something. Mr. Leader, I can tell you, he hasn't \ngotten away with anything. And the people are saying: ``Please don't \nprotect us from this man.'' Seventy-six percent of us think he is doing \na fine job; 65 to 70 percent of us don't want him removed from office.\n\n  Some have said we are not respected on the world scene. The truth of \nthe matter is, this Nation has never enjoyed greater prestige in the \nworld than we do right now. I saw Carlos Menem, President of Argentina, \na guest here recently, who said to the President, ``Mr. President, the \nworld needs you.'' The war in Bosnia is under control; the President \nhas been as tenacious as anybody could be about Middle East peace; and \nin Ireland, actual peace; and maybe the Middle East will make it; and \nhe has the Indians and the Pakistanis talking to each other as they \nhave never talked to each other in recent times.\n  Vaclav Havel said, ``Mr. President, for the enlargement of the North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization, there is no doubt in my mind that it was \nyour personal leadership that made this historic development \npossible.'' King Hussein: ``Mr. President, I've had the privilege of \nbeing a friend of the United States and Presidents since the late \nPresident Eisenhower, and throughout all the years in the past I have \nkept in touch, but on the subject of peace, the peace we are seeking, I \nhave never, with all due respect and all the affection I held for your \npredecessors, known someone with your dedication, clear-headedness, \nfocus, and determination to help resolve this issue in the best way \npossible.''\n  I have Nelson Mandela and other world leaders who have said similar \nthings in the last 6 months. Our prestige, I promise you, in the world, \nis as high as it has ever been.\n  When it comes to the question of perjury, you know, there is perjury \nand then there is perjury. Let me ask you if you think this is perjury: \nOn November 23, 1997, President Clinton went to Vancouver, BC. And when \nhe returned, Monica Lewinsky was at the White House at some point, and \nhe gave her a carved marble bear. I don't know how big it was. The \nquestion before the grand jury, August 6, 1998:\n\n       What was the Christmas present or presents that he got for \n     you?\n       Answer: Everything was packaged in the Big Black Dog or big \n     canvas bag from the Black Dog store in Martha's Vineyard and \n     he got me a marble bear's head carving. Sort of, you know, a \n     little sculpture, I guess you would call, maybe.\n       Was that the item from Vancouver?\n       Yes.\n\n  Question, on the same day of the same grand jury,\n\n       When the President gave you the Vancouver bear on the 28th, \n     did he say anything about what it means?\n       Answer: Hmm.\n       Question: Well, what did he say?\n       Answer: I think he--I believe he said that the bear is \n     the--maybe an Indian symbol for strength--you know, to be \n     strong like a bear.\n       Question: And did you interpret that to be strong in your \n     decision to continue to conceal the relationship?\n       Answer: No.\n\n  The House Judiciary Committee report to the full House, on the other \nhand, knowing the subpoena requested gifts, is giving Ms. Lewinsky more \ngifts on December 28 seems odd. But Ms. Lewinsky's testimony reveals \nwhy he did so. She said that she ``never questioned that we would not \never do anything but keep this private, and that meant to take whatever \nappropriate steps needed to be taken to keep it quiet.''\n  They say:\n\n       The only logical inference is that the gifts, including the \n     bear symbolizing strength, were a tacit reminder to Ms. \n     Lewinsky that they would deny the relationship, even in the \n     face of a Federal subpoena.\n\n  She just got through saying ``no.'' Yet, this report says that is the \nonly logical inference. And then the brief that came over here \naccompanying the articles of impeachment said, ``On the other hand, \nmore gifts on December 28th . . .'' Ms. Lewinsky's testimony reveals \nher answer. She said that she ``never questioned that we were ever \ngoing to do anything but keep this private, and that meant to take \nwhatever appropriate steps needed to be taken to keep it quiet.''\n  Again, they say in their brief:\n\n       The only logical inference is that the gifts, including the \n     bear symbolizing strength, were a tacit reminder to Ms. \n     Lewinsky that they would deny the relationship even in the \n     face of a Federal subpoena.\n\n  Is it perjury to say the only logical inference is something when the \nonly shred of testimony in the record is, ``No, that was not my \ninterpretation. I didn't infer that.'' Yet, here you have it in the \ncommittee report and you have it in the brief. Of course, that is not \nperjury.\n  First of all, it is not under oath. But I am a trial lawyer and I \nwill tell you what it is; it is wanting to win too badly. I have tried \n300, 400, maybe 500 divorce cases. Incidentally, you are being \naddressed by the entire South Franklin County, Arkansas Bar \nAssociation. I can't believe there were that many cases in that little \ntown, but I had a practice in surrounding communities, too. In all \nthose divorce cases, I would guess that in 80 percent of the contested \ncases perjury was committed. Do you know what it was about? Sex. \nExtramarital affairs. But there is a very big difference in perjury \nabout a marital infidelity in a divorce case and perjury about whether \nI bought the murder weapon, or whether I concealed the murder weapon or \nnot. And to charge somebody with the first and punish them as though it \nwere the second stands our sense of justice on its head.\n  There is a total lack of proportionality, a total lack of balance in \nthis thing. The charge and the punishment are totally out of sync. All \nof you have heard or read the testimony of the five prosecutors who \ntestified before the House Judiciary Committee--five seasoned \nprosecutors. Each one of them, veterans, said that under the identical \ncircumstances of this case, they would never charge anybody because \nthey would know they couldn't get a conviction. In this case, the \ncharges brought and the punishment sought are totally out of sync. \nThere is no balance; there is no proportionality.\n\n  But even stranger--you think about it--even if this case had \noriginated in the courthouse rather than the Capitol, you would never \nhave heard of it. How do you reconcile what the prosecutors said with \nwhat we are doing here? Impeachment was debated off and on in \nPhiladelphia for the entire 4 months, as I said. The key players were \nGovernor Morris, a brilliant Pennsylvanian; George Mason, the only man \nreputedly to be so brilliant that Thomas Jefferson actually deferred to \nhim; he refused to sign the Constitution, incidentally, even though he \nwas a delegate because they didn't deal with slavery and he was a \nstrict abolitionist. Then there was Charles Pinckney from South \nCarolina, a youngster at 29 years old; Edmund Randolph from Virginia, \nwho had a big role in the Constitution in the beginning; and then, of \ncourse, James Madison, the craftsman. They were all key players in \ndrafting this impeachment provision.\n  Uppermost in their minds during the entire time they were composing \nit was that they did not want any kings. They had lived under despots, \nunder kings, and under autocrats, and they didn't want anymore of that. \nAnd they succeeded very admirably. We have had 46 Presidents and no \nkings. But they kept talking about corruption. Maybe that\n\n[[Page S847]]\n\nought to be the reason for impeachment, because they feared some \nPresident would corrupt the political process. That is what the debate \nwas about--corrupting the political process and ensconcing one's self \nthrough a phony election; maybe that is something close to a king.\n  They followed the British rule on impeachment, because the British \nsaid the House of Commons may impeach and the House of Lords must \nconvict. And every one of the colonies had the same procedure--the \nHouse and the Senate. In all fairness, Alexander Hamilton was not very \nkeen on the House participating. But here were the sequence of events \nin Philadelphia that brought us here today. They started out with \nmaladministration and Madison said, ``That is too vague; what does that \nmean?'' So they dropped that. They went from that to corruption, and \nthey dropped that. Then they went to malpractice, and they decided that \nwas not definitive enough. And they went to treason, bribery, and \ncorruption. They decided that still didn't suit them.\n  Bear in mind one thing: During this entire process, they are \nnarrowing the things you can impeach a President for. They were making \nit tougher. Madison said, ``If we aren't careful, the President will \nserve at the pleasure of the Senate.'' And then they went to treason \nand bribery. Somebody said that still is not quite enough, so they went \nto treason and bribery. And George Mason added, ``or other high crimes \nand misdemeanors against the United States.'' They voted on it, and on \nSeptember 10 they sent the entire Constitution to a committee they \ncalled the Committee on Style and Arrangement, which was the committee \nthat would draft the language in a way that everybody would \nunderstand--that is, well crafted from a grammatical standpoint. But \nthat committee, which was dominated by Madison and Hamilton, dropped \n``against the United States.'' And the stories will tell you that the \nreason they did that was because they were redundant, because that \ncommittee had no right to change the substance of anything, and they \nwould not have dropped it if they had not felt that it was redundant. \nThen they put it in for good measure. And we can always be grateful for \nthe two-thirds majority.\n\n  This is one of the most important points of this entire presentation. \nFirst of all, the term ``treason and bribery''--nobody quarrels with \nthat. We are not debating treason and bribery here in this Chamber. We \nare talking about other high crimes and misdemeanors. And where did \n``high crimes and misdemeanors'' come from? It came from the English \nlaw. And they found it in English law under a category which said \ndistinctly ``political'' offenses against the state.\n  Let me repeat that. They said ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' was to \nbe because they took it from English law where they found it in the \ncategory that said offenses distinctly ``political'' against the state.\n  So, colleagues, please, for just one moment, forget the complexities \nof the facts and the tortured legalisms--and we have heard them all \nbrilliantly presented on both sides. And I am not getting into that.\n  But ponder this: If high crimes and misdemeanors was taken from \nEnglish law by George Madison, which listed high crimes and \nmisdemeanors as ``political'' offenses against the state, what are we \ndoing here? If, as Hamilton said, it had to be a crime against society \nor a breach of the public trust, what are we doing here? Even perjury, \nconcealing, or deceiving an unfaithful relationship does not even come \nclose to being an impeachable offense. Nobody has suggested that Bill \nClinton committed a political crime against the state.\n  So, colleagues, if you are to honor the Constitution, you must look \nat the history of the Constitution and how we got to the impeachment \nclause. And, if you do that, and you do that honestly, according to the \noath you took, you cannot--you can censor Bill Clinton, you can hand \nhim over to the prosecutor for him to be prosecuted, but you cannot \nconvict him. You cannot indulge yourselves the luxury or the right to \nignore this history.\n  There has been a suggestion that a vote to acquit would be something \nof a breach of faith with those who lie in Flanders field, Anzio, \nBunker Hill, Gettysburg, and wherever. I did not hear that. I read \nabout it. But I want to say, and, incidentally, I think it was Chairman \nHyde who alluded to this and said those men fought and died for the \nrule of law.\n  I can remember a cold November 3 morning in my little hometown of \nCharleston, AR. I was 18 years old. I had just gotten one semester in \nat the university when I went into the Marine Corps. So I was to report \nto Little Rock to be inducted. My it was cold. The drugstore was the \nbus stop. I had to be there by 8 o'clock to be sworn in. And I had to \ncatch the bus down at the drugstore at 3 o'clock in the morning. So my \nmother and father and I got up at 2 o'clock, got dressed, and went down \nthere. I am not sure I can tell you this story. And the bus came over \nthe hill. I was rather frightened anyway about going. I was quite sure \nI was going to be killed, only slightly less frightened that Betty \nwould find somebody else when I was gone.\n  The bus came over the schoolhouse hill and my parents started crying. \nI had never seen my father cry. I knew I was in some difficulty. Now, \nas a parent, at my age, I know he thought he was giving not his only \nbegotten son, but one of his begotten sons. Can you imagine? You know \nthat scene. It was repeated across this Nation millions of times. Then, \nhappily, I survived that war, saw no combat, was on my way to Japan \nwhen it all ended. I had never had a terrible problem with dropping the \nbomb, though that has been a terrible moral dilemma for me because the \nestimates were that we would lose as many as a million men in that \ninvasion.\n\n  But I came home to a generous government which provided me under the \nGI bill an education in a fairly prestigious law school, which my \nfather could never have afforded. I practiced law in this little town \nfor 18 years, loved every minute of it. But I didn't practice \nconstitutional law. And I knew very little about the Constitution. But \nwhen I went into law school, I did study constitutional law, Mr. Chief \nJustice. It was very arcane to me. And trying to read the Federalist \nPapers, de Tocqueville, all of those things that law students are \nexpected to do, that was tough for me. I confess.\n  So after 18 years of law practice, I jumped up and ran for Governor. \nI served as Governor for 4 years. I guess I knew what the rule of law \nwas, but I still didn't really have much reverence for the \nConstitution. I just did not understand any of the things I am \ndiscussing and telling you. No. My love for that document came day \nafter day and debate after debate right here in this Chamber.\n  Some of you read an op-ed piece I did a couple of weeks ago when I \nsaid I was perfectly happy for my legacy, that during my 24 years here \nI never voted for a constitutional amendment. And it isn't that I \nwouldn't. I think they were mistaken not giving you fellows 4 years. \n(Laughter.)\n  You are about to cause me to rethink that one. (Laughter.)\n  The reason I developed this love of it is because I saw Madison's \nmagic working time and time again, keeping bullies from running over \nweak people, keeping majorities from running over minorities, and I \nthought about all of the unfettered freedoms we had. The oldest organic \nlaw in existence made us the envy of the world.\n\n  Mr. Chairman, we have also learned that the rule of law includes \nPresidential elections. That is a part of the rule of law in this \ncountry. We have an event, a quadrennial event, in this country which \nwe call a Presidential election, and that is the day when we reach \nacross this aisle and hold hands, Democrats and Republicans, and we \nsay, win or lose, we will abide by the decision. It is a solemn event, \na Presidential election, and it should not be undone lightly or just \nbecause one side has the clout and the other one doesn't.\n  And if you want to know what men fought for in World War II, for \nexample, in Vietnam, ask Senator Inouye. He left an arm in Italy. He \nand I were with the Presidents at Normandy, on the 50th anniversary, \nbut we started off in Anzio. Senator Domenici, were you with us? It was \none of the most awesome experiences I have ever had in my life. \nCertified war hero. I think his relatives were in an internment camp. \nSo ask him, what was he fighting for? Or\n\n[[Page S848]]\n\nask Bob Kerrey, certified Medal of Honor winner, what was he fighting \nfor? Probably get a quite different answer. Or Senator Chafee, one of \nthe finest men ever to grace this body and certified Marine hero of \nGuadalcanal, ask him. And Senator McCain, a genuine hero, ask him. You \ndon't have to guess; they are with us, and they are living, and they \ncan tell you. And one who is not with us in the Senate anymore, Robert \nDole, ask Senator Dole what he was fighting for. Senator Dole had what \nI thought was a very reasonable solution to this whole thing that would \nhandle it fairly and expeditiously.\n  The American people are now and for some time have been asking to be \nallowed a good night's sleep. They are asking for an end to this \nnightmare. It is a legitimate request. I am not suggesting that you \nvote for or against the polls. I understand that. Nobody should vote \nagainst the polls just to show their mettle and their courage. I have \ncast plenty of votes against the polls, and it has cost me politically \na lot of times. This has been going on for a year, though.\n  In that same op-ed piece, I talked about meeting Harry Truman my \nfirst year as Governor of Arkansas. I spent an hour with him--an \nindelible experience. People at home kid me about this because I very \nseldom make a speech that I don't mention this meeting. But I will \nnever forget what he said: ``Put your faith in the people. Trust the \npeople. They can handle it.'' They have shown conclusively time and \ntime again that they can handle it.\n  Colleagues, this is easily the most important vote you will ever \ncast. If you have difficulty because of an intense dislike of the \nPresident--and that is understandable--rise above it. He is not the \nissue. He will be gone. You won't. So don't leave a precedent from \nwhich we may never recover and almost surely will regret.\n  If you vote to acquit, Mr. Leader, you know exactly what is going to \nhappen. You are going to go back to your committees. You are going to \nget on with this legislative agenda. You are going to start dealing \nwith Medicare, Social Security, tax cuts, and all those things which \nthe people of this country have a nonnegotiable demand that you do. If \nyou vote to acquit, you go immediately to the people's agenda. But if \nyou vote to convict, you can't be sure what is going to happen.\n  James G. Blaine was a Member of the Senate when Andrew Johnson was \ntried in 1868, and 20 years later he recanted. He said, ``I made a bad \nmistake.'' And he said, ``As I reflect back on it, all I can think \nabout is that having convicted Andrew Johnson would have caused much \nmore chaos and confusion in this country than Andrew Johnson could ever \nconceivably have created.''\n  And so it is with William Jefferson Clinton. If you vote to convict, \nin my opinion, you are going to be creating more havoc than he could \never possibly create. After all, he has only got 2 years left. So \ndon't, for God sakes, heighten the people's alienation, which is at an \nall-time high, toward their Government. The people have a right, and \nthey are calling on you to rise above politics, rise above \npartisanship. They are calling on you to do your solemn duty, and I \npray you will.\n  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that that concludes the White \nHouse presentation. I remind all Senators that we will reconvene \ntomorrow beginning at 1 p.m. On Friday, under the provisions of Senate \nResolution 16, we will begin the question and answer period for not to \nexceed 16 hours. The majority will begin the questioning, and as we go \nforward in that process, we will alternate back and forth across the \naisle. I have discussed this proposition, obviously, with Senator \nDaschle, and we have discussed it in our conferences. We looked at a \nnumber of other alternatives, but we thought that this would be a fair \nway to proceed, that we would begin from this side with a Senator who \nwill be named, and go to the other side, back and forth.\n  We think this provides fairness and I hope all Members will entrust \nthe Chief Justice to be fair during this portion of the deliberations, \nand for the managers and counsel to, of course, be succinct in their \nanswers and respond to the question that is actually asked.\n  At this time I would anticipate approximately 5 hours of questions \nand answers being used tomorrow, Friday. We would then reconvene on \nSaturday at 10 a.m., and again resume questioning, alternating back and \nforth. We have not set any definite time for Saturday. We will need to \nsee how the questions go. We don't really know whether we will need 5 \nhours or 10 hours or the full 16. But if we reach a point on Saturday \nwhere we need to conclude the day's proceedings and we feel there are \nstill more questions that would need to be asked, then after \ncommunication on both sides of the aisle we would decide how to go \nforward.\n  It is my hope that we can complete this questioning period during the \nday Friday and Saturday and conclude it Saturday. I hope the Senators \nwill be thoughtful in their questions. They must be in writing. Please \nbe brief with your written presentation. Dissertations would not be \nappreciated in writing at this point. And we will do our best, Mr. \nChief Justice, to deal with the question of repetition or redundancy, \nand try to have some process that Senator Daschle and I will use to get \nthe Senators' questions to the Chief Justice.\n  I thank all Senators for their attention during the past 2 weeks, \nboth in the presentation of the case by the House managers and the \npresentation by the White House counsel. Obviously, the Senators have \nbeen here, attentive. We have listened.

A bill to provide for education flexibility partnerships; \nread the first time.\n\n\n           the education flexibility partnership act of 1999\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, with my \ncolleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, The Education Flexibility \nPartnership Act of 1999. This bipartisan measure will expand the \nimmensely popular and highly successful Ed-Flex program to all 50 \nstates in the country. As you may know, Ed-Flex is currently a \ndemonstration program, available only to 12 states. Under the Frist-\nWyden bill, all states would have the option to participate in the \nprogram.\n  States and localities have waged a war on poor student performance \nand they need our help. For too long, Washington has dictated a plan \nriddled with red tape and regulation. Stagnant student performance has \nbeen the result. The longer a child is in an American school, the more \nhis math and science skills deteriorate compared to the skills of his \ninternational peers, according to the Third International Math and \nScience Study (TIMSS). Out of 21 countries, the United States ranked \n19th in math and 16th in science for twelfth graders.\n  To help our states and localities, Washington must give them the \nflexibility that they need in order to find creative solutions that \nmake sense in their own communities. When localities find ideas that \nwork, the federal government should either get out of the way or lend a \nhelping hand. The last thing that our schools need is more bureaucracy \nand federal intrusion. Education dollars should be spent in the \nclassroom, not in the front office.\n  Ed-Flex frees states from the burden of unnecessary, time-consuming \nWashington regulations, so long as states are complying with certain \ncore federal principles, such as civil rights, and so long as the \nstates are making progress toward improving their students' results. \nUnder the Ed-Flex program, the Department of Education delegates to the \nstates its power to grant individual school districts temporary waivers \nfrom certain federal requirements that interfere with state and local \nefforts to improve education. To be eligible, a state must waive its \nown regulations on schools. It must also hold schools accountable for \nresults. The 12 states that currently participate in Ed-Flex have used \nthis flexibility to allow school districts to innovate and better use \nfederal resources to improve student outcomes.\n  For instance, the Phelps Luck Elementary School in Howard County, \nMaryland used its waiver to provide one-on-one tutoring for reading \nstudents who have the greatest need in grades 1-5. They also used their \nwaiver to lower the average student/teacher ratio in mathematics and \nreading from 25/1 to 12/1. By granting localities more flexibility to \nuse resources already allocated, Ed-Flex allows local decision-makers \nto decide for themselves how to best tailor federal programs to meet \nthe needs of their own schools.\n  As the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee Task Force on \nEducation, formed by Budget Chairman Pete Domenici, I heard first-hand \naccounts of the success of the Ed-Flex program and the need for \nflexibility for our states that are overburdened by federal \nrequirements. Secretary Riley told the Task Force that, ``through our \nEd-Flex demonstration initiative, we are giving State-level officials \nbroad authority to waive federal requirements that present an obstacle \nto innovation in their schools.'' The Department of Education further \nnotes, ``Ed-Flex can help participating states and local school \ndistricts use federal funds in ways that provide maximum support for \neffective school reform based on challenging academic standards for all \nstudents.''\n  Recent GAO reports have questioned whether Ed-Flex has addressed or \ncan address all of the concerns that local schools and school districts \nhave regarding the regulatory and administrative requirements that \nfederal education programs impose. GAO is definitive in its answer: Ed-\nFlex hasn't and it won't. We certainly do not believe that Ed-Flex is a \npanacea to our nation's educational system's woes. Nor do we believe \nthat the complexity, redundancy and rigidity that are the unfortunate \nhallmarks of our federal education effort will magically disappear. But \nit is a good first step. Not all states will be as active with Ed-Flex \nwaiver authority as front-runners like Texas, but they all deserve the \nopportunity to try.\n  The time has come for this common sense reform. In the Senate, the \nEd-Flex expansion bill had 21 bipartisan cosponsors last year. The \nLabor Committee passed the bill by a vote of 17-1. In the House, \nRepresentatives Castle (R-DE) and Roemer (D-IN) introduced companion \nlegislation with 25 House cosponsors. The National Governors' \nAssociation has made Ed-Flex expansion a top priority and both the \nWhite House and the Department of Education support Ed-Flex expansion. \nLast year, there obviously was a convergence of support from all \ncorners; nevertheless, the usual end-of-the-session morass claimed Ed-\nFlex as one of its many victims.\n  We must do better in the 106th Congress. Ed-Flex is a bi-partisan \nproposal with broad-based support. Even so, Ed-Flex expansion will \nagain face an uphill battle. Some in Congress want to delay real reform \nby attaching poison pill amendments or waiting for the reauthorization \nof the far-reaching Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) \nscheduled for 1999. If history is any guide, Congress will be lucky to \nhave completed the reauthorization process for K-12 education programs \ntwo years from now. Ed-Flex expansion should not get bogged down in \nthis partisan embroglio. Delay is not the answer to our education \ncrisis. The jury is in on Ed-Flex. Let's not allow partisanship to stop \nus from improving the public education system. We hope that Congress \nwill rise to meet the challenge of helping our children sooner rather \nthan later.\n  Mr. President, I believe that passage of this legislation is a strong \nfirst step for improving our public education system. Let's give states \nand localities the flexibility that they need to address the many needs \nof our students. I am hopeful that we will move this bill quickly in a \nbipartisan way. I strongly urge passage of this bill.\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the \nEducation Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999 with my colleague Senator \nBill Frist of Tennessee. This bill encourages innovation in our schools \nby expanding the Ed-Flex demonstration program from a handful of states \nto all states. Mr. President, education dollars should be spent in the \nclassroom, not the front office. That common-sense philosophy is at the \nheart of an exciting new education program known as education \nflexibility, or Ed-Flex.\n  In the raging debate over the federal government's role in education, \nEd-Flex defines a third-way approach--allowing local schools to receive \nfederal assistance while being freed from the burden of unnecessary, \ntime-consuming Washington resolutions. Local school boards, principals, \nteachers, and parents have the flexibility to find creative solutions \nthat make sense in their own communities, and are held accountable for \nachieving real results. Ed-Flex accomplishes this by giving states the \nauthority to grant waivers from federal regulations to individual \nschools or local education agencies, in exchange for agreeing to meet \nspecific targets for student improvement.\n  In other words, a school that agrees to meet high standards can \nreceive federal aid without having to worry about complying with the \nhundreds and hundreds of pages of regulations, and filling out the \nvoluminous forms that usually go along with that assistance. Virtually \nevery school district in the country, for example, employs staff whose \njob is to make sure that the schools are in compliance with rules for \nthe government's Title I program. Ed-Flex could allow school districts \nto use fewer compliance officers and hire more teachers instead.\n  Ed-Flex is currently being tried as a pilot program in a dozen states \naround\n\n[[Page S852]]\n\nthe country, and the results have been impressive:\n  Oregon community colleges and high schools work together to \nstreamline their vocational education programs. As a result, more \nstudents are learning technical skills, such as computer programming, \nand graduating from high school.\n  The Phelps Luck Elementary School in Howard County, Maryland has used \nits waiver to provide one-on-one tutoring for reading students who have \nthe greatest need in grades 1-5. They also used their waiver to lower \nthe average student/teacher ratio in mathematics and reading from 25 to \n1 to 12 to 1.\n  Achievement scores from Texas, the state which has implemented Ed-\nFlex most broadly, confirm that Ed-Flex can improve academic \nperformance. After only two years of implementation, preliminary \nstatewide results on the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills show that \ndistricts with Ed-Flex waivers outperformed districts that didn't take \nadvantage of the program by a full three points in reading and more \nthan two in math.\n  For African-American students, the gains were even greater. At \nWestlawn Elementary School in LaMarque, Texas, for example, African-\nAmerican students improved almost 23% over their 1996 math test scores, \nafter the school put an Ed-Flex waiver into practice.\n  Ed-Flex will help schools raise achievement levels by giving them a \npowerful weapon to cut through the red tape that sometimes keeps \nteachers and principals tied up in knots. This frees them up to focus \nfull time on giving children the best possible education. The Ohio \nDepartment of Education wrote in an annual report that Ed-Flex helps \ncreate an environment which ``encourages creativity, thoughtful \nplanning, and innovation.'' And in Oregon, the nation's first Ed-Flex \nstate, the program has brought ``greater flexibility and better \ncoordination to federal education programs.''\n  At the heart of all this innovation is accountability. Schools need \nto demonstrate that what they are doing produces results. If it \ndoesn't, Ed-Flex provides an opportunity to move on to something else \nthat might be more effective. Parents and taxpayers should rightfully \ndemand that schools be responsible for meeting the goals that are set \nfor them.\n  Last year, Senator Frist and I introduced legislation to expand Ed-\nFlex nationwide, and broaden its use in the states where it's already \nin place. With the support of a bipartisan group of 21 cosponsors, the \nbill passed almost unanimously through the Senate Labor Committee. In \nthe House, Representatives Castle and Roemer introduced a companion \nbill with 25 cosponsors. Unfortunately, the bills fell victim to \nlegislative gridlock at the end of the 105th Congress. But today, at \nthe beginning of the 106th Congress, we are reintroducing the bill with \nan eye toward its passage. The National Governors' Association has made \nexpansion of Ed-Flex a top priority, and both President Clinton and \nEducation Secretary Riley have announced their support for Ed-Flex. The \ntime for action is near.\n  Every hour school officials spend filling out a government form is an \nhour that could be spent giving special attention to a child. Every \ndollar spent on complying with unproductive mandates from Washington, \nDC, is a dollar that could be spent on something that works. With a \ngood education more important than ever, and confidence in our schools \nat an all-time low, it's time to try something different. Flexibility \nand accountability can be the key to a brighter future. Congress should \nexpand Ed-Flex, and allow a flurry of creativity across our entire \ncountry to give our children a brighter future.\n Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator \nFrist and others today to introduce the ``Education Flexibility \nPartnership Act of 1999.'' I commend the Senator from Tennessee for his \nleadership on this proposal, which will allow states to waive various \nfederal education regulations and give them more flexibility and \nauthority over their use of federal resources to educate their \nstudents.\n  Mr. President, we all want our nation's children to get a first-class \neducation that boosts student achievement and elevates them to \nexcellence. Our role at the federal level should be to help states and \nlocal school districts provide the best education possible for their \nstudents.\n  Unfortunately, many of our federal education programs, while well-\nintentioned, are steeped in so many rules and regulations that states \nand local schools consume precious time and resources to stay in \ncompliance with the federal programs. As a former governor, I have \nexperienced first-hand the frustration of having to jump through a lot \nof federal hoops to obtain and keep federal dollars designated for \nvarious programs. I have also heard of examples around the country \ndemonstrating this same problem I experienced.\n  For example, a 1990 study found that 52% of the paperwork required of \nan Ohio school district was related to participation in federal \nprograms, while federal dollars provided less than 5% of total \neducation funding in Ohio. In Florida, 374 employees administer $8 \nbillion in state funds. However, 297 state employees are needed to \noversee only $1 billion in federal funds--six times as many per dollar.\n  The Federal Department of Education requires over 48.6 million hours \nworth of paperwork to receive federal dollars. This bureaucratic maze \ntakes up to 35% of every federal education dollar. Clearly, states and \nlocal school districts need relief from excessive federal regulations, \nwhich take away precious dollars and teacher time from our children.\n  The Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999 will help to \nrelieve administrative burdens and save federal resources by providing \nstates with more flexibility to operate their education programs \nthrough the waiver of certain federal and state regulations. The bill \nexpands to all states the highly successful Education Flexibility \nPartnership Demonstration Program that is currently operating in 12 \nstates and is producing great results. This legislation will help to \nreduce excessive bureaucratic oversight over education and return more \ncontrol to the state and local levels.\n  Again, I appreciate Senator Frist's dedication to providing greater \nflexibility to the states and I look forward to working with him to \npass the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999. We in Congress \nshould support proposals--such as this one--that return decision-making \nauthority back to state and local decision-makers, where parents, \nteachers, and school boards have the greatest opportunity to \nparticipate in determining priorities, developing curriculum, and \nmaking other important education-related decisions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 273. A bill for the relief of Oleg Rasulyevich Rafikova, Alfia \nFanilevna Rafikova, Evgenia Olegovna Rafikova, and Ruslan Khamitovich \nYagudin; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                          private relief bill\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am introducing a private \nrelief bill that provides permanent residency to Oleg Rasulyevich \nRafikova, Alfia Fanilevna Rafikova, and their children, Evgenia \nOlegovna Rafikova and Ruslan Khamitovich Yagudin, who without this \nlegislation, would have to return to Russia and face possible threats \nof blackmail and kidnaping.\n  The Rafikova family came to the United States on August 28, 1997, \nfrom Ufa, Russia, on a visitor's visa to receive their inheritance from \nAlfia's uncle, the famous ballet dancer, Rudolf Nureyev. Rafikova's now \nfear returning to their home country because they fear that the local \nMafia would try to extort their inheritance from them.\n  According to Alfia, everything changed for the family in Ufa, Russia, \nwhen the local media announced the death of her uncle, Rudolf Nureyev \nand exaggerated the amount of her inheritance and falsely made \nassertions that the family already had the money. Alfia claims that she \nand her husband started getting harassing phone calls, threats of \nkidnaping their children for ransom, and death threats. The events \nescalated to a day when they were robbed of everything except the \nclothes they were wearing.\n  Alfia's inheritance is substantial enough that she and her family \nwill not be a public charge. In fact, Alfia and her husband Oleg, who \nis a chef by training, would like to start a restaurant in San \nFrancisco, providing jobs for Americans. Alfia's two children are \nattending school in San Francisco and look forward to the day they\n\n[[Page S853]]\n\ncould call the United States their new home.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation so we can give \nthe Rafikova family a chance to restart their life in the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 273\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase \nthe maximum taxable income for the 15-percent rate bracket; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                  middle class tax relief act of 1999\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today, along with \nSenators McCain and Torricelli, to introduce the Middle Class Tax \nRelief Act of 1999. The Senate's agenda on tax relief is premised on \nthe realization that political leaders need to create policies that \nunleash the creativity, innovation and expertise of the American \npeople. We should reject Washington-based solutions and instead, seek \nto move power, money and decision-making back to the people of this \nnation.\n  Now is the time for us to consider sweeping middle class tax relief. \nThis tax relief proposal accomplishes several goals. First, it directs \nthe vast majority of the relief to those who feel the tax squeeze the \nmost: middle-income taxpayers.\n  Second, because it is across-the-board relief, every middle class \ntaxpayer wins. Every American earning $25,000 in taxable income or more \nwould see relief. Estimates by the Joint Committee on Taxation show \nthat approximately 29 million taxpayers would see tax relief this year.\n  Third, it provides modest marriage penalty relief without adding \ncomplexity to the tax code.\n  Fourth, it is a realistic proposal that is also entirely consistent \nwith the long-term goal of achieving a flatter, simpler tax code.\n  My proposal, the Middle Class Tax Relief Act, achieves these goals by \nraising the roof on the 15% individual income tax bracket. In other \nwords, it returns middle class taxpayers to the lowest individual \nincome bracket. It would increase the income threshold between the 15% \nand the 28% income tax rate brackets by $10,000 for married couples--\n$5,000 for singles--over a five year period.\n  If the Middle Class Tax Relief Act were fully in place today, it \nwould mean that a family of four who earned $71,250 or less would be \ntaxed at the 15% rate. It would mean such families could expect up to \n$1,300 in tax relief annually. That amounts to increasing their take-\nhome pay by more than $100 a month and that is real relief.\n  In the coming weeks, a great deal of discussion will focus on \nproviding the American people with the tax relief they need and \ndeserve, and how that is to be accomplished. There are a number of \nproposals providing tax relief, some of which I support. However, I \nbelieve the Middle Class Tax Relief Act will be successful ultimately \nbecause we can actually achieve it during this Congress. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in this effort.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor The Middle \nClass Tax Relief Act of 1999 with Senators Coverdell and Senator \nTorricelli. This bill would deliver sweeping tax relief to lower- and \nmiddle-income taxpayers. The bill incrementally increases the number of \nindividuals who pay the lowest tax rate, which is 15%. If this bill had \nbeen law in 1998, approximately millions of taxpayers now in the 28% \ntax-bracket would have paid taxes at the 15% rate. In addition, this \nbill significantly lessens the effect of one of the Tax Code's most \ninequitable provisions: the Marriage Penalty.\n   Mr. President, before I proceed, I want to congratulate Senator \nCoverdell for his leadership and his tireless work in crafting this \nhistoric legislation. This bill recognizes the need to maintain the \nmomentum toward fundamental tax reform evidenced by the Taxpayer Relief \nAct of 1997.\n  This bill is the only major tax relief proposal focused directly on \naddressing the middle-class tax squeeze. According to preliminary \nestimates by the Tax Foundation, 29 million taxpayers would benefit \nfrom this broad-based, middle-class tax relief in 1998 alone.\n   Mr. President, I support this legislation because: First, it is a \nstep toward further reform; second, it helps ordinary middle-class \nfamilies who are struggling to make ends meet without asking the \ngovernment to help out, and third, it promotes future economic \nprosperity by increasing the amount of money taxpayers have available \nfor their own savings and investment.\n  It is essential that we provide American families with relief from \nthe excessive rate of taxation that saps job growth and robs them of \nthe opportunity to provide for their needs and save for the future. \nOver a five-year period, this bill would deliver sweeping tax relief to \nmiddle-class taxpayers by increasing the number of individuals who pay \nthe lowest tax rate. In addition, this bill is simple, and it \ncalculates tax relief based upon income alone, not on factors such as \nthe number of school-age children.\n  This bill benefits our citizens in several ways. It focuses tax \nrelief on the individuals who feel the tax squeeze the most: lower- and \nmiddle-income taxpayers. Under this bill, unmarried individuals will be \nable to make $35,000 and married individuals can make $70,000, and \nstill be in the lowest tax bracket.\n  This measure also results in taxpayers being able to keep more of the \nmoney they earn. This extra income will allow individuals to save and \ninvest more. Increased savings and investment are key to sustaining our \ncurrent economic growth.\n  In sum, the measure is a win for individuals, and a win for America \nas a whole. Millions of Americans would realize some tax savings from \nthis legislation. Citizens will be able to keep more of what they earn, \nwhich will ensure that Americans have more of the resources they need \nto invest in their own individual futures, and America's future.\n  Mr. President, on a broader scale, I believe we should abandon our \nexisting tax code altogether and create a new system. This new system \nshould have one tax rate, which taxes income only one time. This system \nshould also reduce the time to prepare tax returns from days to \nminutes, and the expense to prepare tax returns from thousands of \ndollars to pennies.\n  The 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act was a step in the right direction to \nprovide tax relief to lower- and middle-income\n\n[[Page S854]]\n\nfamilies. The Middle Class Tax Relief Act of 1999 represents an \nimportant further step toward a flatter, fairer tax system, which also \nprovides immediate tax relief for hard-working Americans and families.\n   Mr. President, on behalf of the millions of Americans in need of \nrelief from over-taxation, I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 275. A bill for the relief of Suchada Kwong; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n                          PRIVATE RELIEF BILL\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am offering today, a \nlegislation that previously passed the Senate by unanimous consent but \nfailed to be enacted because the bill was not considered by the House \nduring last Congress.\n  This legislation provides permanent residency to Suchada Kwong, a \nrecently widowed young mother of a U.S. citizen child who faces the \ndevastation of being separated from her child and family here in the \nU.S.\n  Suchada Kwong's U.S. citizen husband, Jimmy Kwong, was tragically \nkilled in an automobile accident in June of 1996, leaving a 3-month-old \nU.S.-born son and his 29-year-old bride.\n  Because current law does not allow Suchada to adjust her status to \npermanent residency without her husband, Suchada now faces deportation.\n  Suchada and Jimmy Kwong met in Bangkok, Thailand, through a mutual \nfriend in 1993. He communicated with her frequently by phone and \nvisited her every time he was in Bangkok. They fell in love and were \nmarried in September 1995 and Suchada gave birth to Ryan Stephen Kwong \nin May 1996.\n  Suchada was supposed to have her INS interview on August 15, 1996. \nHowever, Jimmy was killed in an accident in June, less than 3 weeks \nafter his son was born and 2 months short of the INS interview. Now, \nbecause the petitioner is deceased, Suchada is ineligible to adjust her \nstatus. While the immigration law provides for widows of U.S. citizens \nto self-petition, that provision is only available for people who have \nbeen married for over 2 years.\n  Suchada's deportation will not only cause hardship to her and her \nyoung child but to Suchada's mother-in-law, Mrs. Kwong, who faces \nlosing her grandson, only a short time after she lost her only son.\n  Mrs. Kwong is elderly, and though she is financially capable, could \nnot care for her grandson herself. Mrs. Kwong is proud to be self-\nsupporting, having owned and worked in a small business until her \nretirement. The family has never used public assistance, and through \nJimmy's job, the family has sufficient resources to support Suchada and \nRyan. It would also be difficult for Suchada as a single mother in \nThailand. Here in the United States, she has the support of Mrs. Kwong \nand their church.\n  Suchada was previously granted voluntary departure for one year on \nOctober 1996 to explore other options or prepare to leave the United \nStates. During that time period, Suchada and her family have explored \nall options but failed. Now, the voluntary departure period has expired \nand Suchada must leave the country immediately, leaving behind her \nyoung child and her family here in the U.S.\n  Suchada has done everything she could to become a permanent resident \nof this country--except for the tragedy of her husband's death 2 months \nbefore she could become a permanent resident. I hope you support this \nbill so that we can help Suchada rebuild her life in the United States.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 275\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR SUCHADA KWONG.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of \n     section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, Suchada \n     Kwong shall be eligible for issuance of an immigrant visa or \n     for adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully \n     admitted for permanent residence upon filing an application \n     for issuance of an immigrant visa under section 204 of such \n     Act or for adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident.\n       (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Suchada Kwong enters the \n     United States before the filing deadline specified in \n     subsection (c), she shall be considered to have entered and \n     remained lawfully and shall, if otherwise eligible, be \n     eligible for adjustment of status under section 245 of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act as of the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Deadline for Application and Payment of Fees.--\n     Subsections (a) and (b) shall apply only if the applications \n     for issuance of immigrant visas or the applications for \n     adjustment of status are filed with appropriate fees within 2 \n     years after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Number.--Upon the granting \n     of an immigrant visa or permanent residence of Suchada Kwong, \n     the Secretary of State shall instruct the proper officer to \n     reduce by one, during the current or next following fiscal \n     year, the total number of immigrant visas that are made \n     available to natives of the country of the alien's birth \n     under section 203(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     or, if applicable, the total number of immigrant visas that \n     are made available to natives of the country of the alien's \n     birth under section 202(e) of such Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 276. A bill for the relief of Sergio Lozano, Fauricio Lozano and \nAna Lozano; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                          Private Relief Bill\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am introducing today a \nlegislation that previously passed the Senate by unanimous consent but \nfailed to be enacted because it was never considered by the House \nduring last Congress.\n  The bill provides permanent resident status to three children, Sergio \n(18 years old), Fauricio (16 years old), and Ana Lozano (15 years old) \nwho now face deportation because they lost their mother in 1997 and the \nimmigration law prohibits permanent legal residency to minor children \nunder the age of twenty-one without their parents.\n  The Lozano children face a dire situation without this legislation \nsince despite the fact that they came into the country legally, they \ncould be deported because they were orphaned.\n  The children lived with their mother, Ana Ruth Lozano, until February \n1997 when she died of complications developed from typhoid fever. Since \ntheir mother's death, the children have been living with their closest \nrelative, their U.S. citizen grandmother, who currently lives in Los \nAngeles, California.\n  Without their mother, these children can be deported by the INS \ndespite the fact the children have no family who will take care of them \nin El Salvador except their estranged father who cannot be located by \nthe family.\n  Without this bill, the children will most likely be sent to an \norphanage in El Salvador. Here in the U.S., the children have their \nU.S. citizen grandmother and uncles who will give them a loving home.\n  I have previously sought administrative relief for the Lozano \nchildren by asking the INS District Office in Los Angeles and \nCommissioner Meissner if any humanitarian exemptions could be made in \ntheir case. INS has told my staff that there is nothing further they \ncan do administratively and a private relief bill may be the only way \nto protect the children from deportation.\n  I urge all the members to support this bill so that we can help the \nLozano children rebuild their lives in the United States.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 276\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR SERGIO LOZANO, \n                   FAURICIO LOZANO AND ANA LOZANO.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections 9a) and (b) of \n     section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, Sergio \n     Lozano, Fauricio Lozano and Ana Lozano shall be eligible for \n     issuance of an immigrant visa or for adjustment of status to \n     that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence \n     upon filing an application for issuance of an immigrant visa \n     under section 204 of such Act or for adjustment of status to \n     lawful permanent resident.\n       (b) Adjustment of Status.--if Sergio Lozano, Fauricio \n     Lozano and Ana Lozano enter the United States before the \n     filing deadline specified in subsection (c), they shall be \n     considered to have entered and remained lawfully and shall, \n     if otherwise eligible, be eligible for adjustment of status \n     under section 245 of the Immigration and nationality Act as \n     of the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n[[Page S855]]\n\n       (c) Deadline for Application and Payment of Fees.--\n     Subsections (a) and (b) shall apply only if the applications \n     for issuance of immigrant visas or the applications for \n     adjustment of status are filed with appropriate fees within 2 \n     years after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Number.--Upon the granting \n     of an immigrant visa or permanent residence to Sergio Lozano, \n     Fauricio Lozano and Ana Lozano, the Secretary of State shall \n     instruct the proper officer to reduce by three, during the \n     current or next following fiscal year, the total number of \n     immigrant visas that are made available to natives of the \n     country of the aliens' birth under section 203(a) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act or, if applicable, the total \n     number of immigrant visas that are made available to natives \n     of the country of the aliens' birth under section 202(e) of \n     such Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 278. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey \ncertain lands to the county of Rio Arriba, New Mexico; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n         the rio arriba, new mexico land conveyance act of 1999\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce \nlegislation that will provide long-term benefits for the people of Rio \nArriba County, New Mexico. In November of 1997, I introduced the Rio \nArriba, New Mexico Land Conveyance Act of 1998. The bill would have \ntransferred unwanted federal land and facilities to a community \ndesperately seeking the ability to grow. The bill had bipartisan \nsupport, and created a win-win situation. After incorporating suggested \nchanges from the Administration, the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee reported the bill unanimously in May 1998, and the \nSenate passed S. 1510 on July 17, 1998.\n  Unfortunately, despite the logic and benefit of the legislation, the \nbill failed to pass the House of Representatives in the waning days of \nthe 105th Congress. I am hoping that this body can promptly pass this \nneeded legislation again, and that the House will agree that this type \nof transfer is logical and should be quickly passed since it provides \nfacilities and lands for community use while removing unwanted and \nunused land and facilities from federal ownership.\n  Over one-third of the land in New Mexico is owned by the federal \ngovernment, and therefore finding appropriate sites for community and \neducational purposes can be difficult. More than seventy percent of Rio \nArriba County is in federal ownership. Communities in this area have \nfound themselves unable to grow or find available property necessary to \nprovide local services. This legislation allows for transfer by the \nSecretary of the Interior real property and improvements at an \nabandoned and surplus ranger station for the Carson National Forest to \nRio Arriba County. The site is known as the Old Coyote Administrative \nSite, near the small town of Coyote, New Mexico.\n  The Coyote Station will continue to be used for public purposes for \nthe County, potentially including a community center and a fire \nsubstation. Some of the buildings will also be available for the County \nto use for storage and repair of road maintenance equipment and other \nCounty vehicles.\n  Mr. President, the Forest Service has determined that this site is of \nno further use to them, since they have recently completed construction \nof a new administrative facility for the Coyote Ranger District. The \nForest Service reported to the General Services Administration that the \nimprovements on the site were considered surplus, and would be \navailable for disposal under their administrative procedures. At this \nparticular site, however, the land on which the facilities have been \nbuilt is withdrawn public domain land, under the jurisdiction of the \nBureau of Land Management.\n  I worked closely in the last Congress with the Forest Service and \nBureau of Land Management to make this transfer a reality. The \nAdministration is supportive of the legislation and the changes made to \nthe bill at their suggestion. Since neither the Bureau of Land \nManagement nor the Forest Service have any interest in maintaining \nFederal ownership of this land and the surplus facilities, and Rio \nArriba County desperately needs them, passage of this bill is a win-win \nsituation for both the federal government, New Mexico, and the people \nof Rio Arriba County. I look forward to prompt passage of this \nlegislation again in the Senate, the House's agreement, and \nPresidential signature as soon as possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 278\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. OLD COYOTE ADMINISTRATIVE SITE.\n\n       (a) Conveyance of Property.--Not later than one year after \n     the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the \n     Interior (herein ``the Secretary'') shall convey to the \n     County of Rio Arriba, New Mexico (herein ``the County''), \n     subject to the terms and conditions stated in subsection (b), \n     all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to \n     the land (including all improvements on the land) known as \n     the ``Old Coyote Administrative Site'' located approximately \n     \\1/2\\ mile east of the Village of Coyote, New Mexico, on \n     State Road 96, comprising one tract of 130.27 acres (as \n     described in Public Land Order 3730), and one tract of 276.76 \n     acres (as described in Executive Order 4599).\n       (b) Terms and Conditions.--\n       (1) Consideration for the conveyance described in \n     subsection (a) shall be--\n       (A) an amount that is consistent with the special pricing \n     program for Governmental entities under the Recreation and \n     Public Purposes Act; and\n       (B) an agreement between the Secretary and the County \n     indemnifying the Government of the United States from all \n     liability of the Government that arises from the property.\n       (2) The lands conveyed by this Act shall be used for public \n     purposes. If such lands cease to be used for public purposes, \n     at the option of the United States, such lands will revert to \n     the United States.\n       (c) Land Withdrawals.--Land withdrawals under Public Land \n     Order 3730 and Executive Order 4599 as extended in the \n     Federal Register on May 25, 1989 (54 F.R. 22629) shall be \n     revoked simultaneous with the conveyance of the property \n     under subsection (a).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Kyl, and Mr. Helms):\n  S. 279. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \neliminate the earnings test for individuals who have attained \nretirement age; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            the senior citizens freedom to work act of 1999\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator John McCain as \nan original cosponsor of the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act of \n1999. Senator McCain's legislation would give seniors relief from the \nSocial Security earnings limitation contained in current law.\n  During the 1992 presidential campaign, President Clinton said that \nAmerica must ``lift the Social Security earnings test limitation so \nthat older Americans are able to help rebuild our economy and create a \nbetter future for us all.'' I could not agree more. Yet, despite 6 \nyears of urging from many members of Congress and millions of \nAmericans, the President appears reluctant to make good on this \ncampaign promise. So, it has fallen to Senator McCain to pursue this \nissue, as he has for several years.\n  The Social Security Earnings Limitation (SSEL) was created during the \nDepression in order to move older workers out of the labor force and to \ncreate job opportunities for younger workers. Obviously, this situation \nno longer exists.\n  In an effort to address this problem, legislation was enacted in \n1996, which I supported, which will raise the Social Security earnings \nlimitation to $30,000 by 2002. However, I believe we must do more. \nSenator McCain's bill would repeal the entire limitation immediately.\n  Currently, under the SSEL, senior citizens aged 62 to 64 lose $1 in \nbenefits for every $2 they earn over the $9,600 limit. Seniors aged 65-\n99 lose $1 in benefits for every $3 they earn over $15,500 annually. \nWhen combined with federal and state taxes, a senior citizen earning \njust over $14,000 per year faces an effective marginal tax rate of 56 \npercent.\n  However, when combined with the President's tax on Social Security \nbenefits passed in 1993, a senior's marginal tax rate can reach 88 \npercent--twice the rate millionaires pay!\n  Some lawmakers apparently forget the Social Security is not an \ninsurance policy intended to offset some unforeseen future occurrence; \nrather, it is a pension with a fixed sum paid regularly to the retirees \nwho made regular contributions throughout their working lives. Social \nSecurity is a planned savings program to supplement income during an \nindividual's retirement years.\n\n[[Page S856]]\n\n  I believe no American should be discouraged from working. Such a \npolicy violates the principles of self-reliance and personal \nresponsibility on which America was founded. Regrettably, American's \nsenior citizens re severely penalized for attempting to be financially \nindependent. When senior citizens work to pay for the high cost of \nhealth care, pharmaceuticals and housing, they are penalized like no \nother group in our society.\n  Senior citizens possess a wealth of experience and expertise acquired \nthrough decades of productivity in the work place. Companies hiring \nseniors have noted their strong work ethic, punctuality, flexibility. \nTheir participation in the workforce can add billions of dollars to our \nNation's economy. To remain competitive in the global marketplace, \nAmerica needs for its senior citizens to be involved in the economy: \nworking, producing, and paying taxes to the federal government. A law \nwhich discourages this is not just bad law, it's wrong--and it hurts \nnot only seniors but all Americans.\n  I will work with Senator McCain in the 106th Congress to enact this \nlegislation which will lift the unjust and counterproductive burden \nfrom the backs of our senior citizens.\n   Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Kyl \nand Helms to introduce again this year the Senior Citizen's Freedom to \nWork Act. Our bill would fully repeal the erroneous Social Security \nEarnings test.\n  Since coming to the Senate in 1987, I have been working to eliminate \nthe discriminatory and unfair earnings test.\n  I am pleased that in 1996, Congress passed and President Clinton \nsigned into law my bill, the Senior Citizens Right to Work Act. This \nlegislation took a step in the right direction by increasing the \nearning threshold for senior citizens from $11,520 to $30,000 by the \nyear 2002. Now it is time to eliminate the unjust earnings test in its \nentirety.\n  Most Americans are shocked and appalled when they discover that older \nAmericans are penalized for working. Nobody should be penalized for \nworking or discouraged from engaging in work. Yet, this is exactly what \nthe Social Security earnings test does to our nation's senior citizens. \nThe Social Security earnings test punishes Americans between the ages \nof 65 and 70 for their attempts to remain productive after retirement.\n  The Social Security earnings test mandates that, for every $3 earned \nby a retiree over the established limit of $15,500 in 1999, the retiree \nloses $1 in Social Security benefits. This is clearly age \ndiscrimination, and it is very wrong. Due to this cap on earnings, our \nsenior citizens, many of whom exist on fixed, low-incomes, are burdened \nwith a 33.3 percent tax on their earned income. When this is combined \nwith Federal, State, local, and other Social Security taxes, it amounts \nto an outrageous 55 to 65 percent tax bite or and even higher.\n  This earnings limit is punitive and serves as a tremendous \ndisincentive to work. An individual who is struggling to make ends meet \non approximately $15,500 a year should not be faced with an effective \nmarginal tax rate which exceeds 55 percent.\n  The Social Security earnings test is a relic of the Great Depression, \ndesigned to move older people out of the workforce and create \nemployment for younger individuals. This is an archaic policy and \nshould no longer be our goal. Many senior citizens can make a \nsignificant contribution, and often their knowledge and experience \ncompliments or exceeds that of younger employees. Tens of millions of \nAmericans are over the age of 65, and together they have over a billion \nyears of cumulative work experience. These individuals have valuable \nexperience to offer our society, and we need them.\n  In addition experts predict a labor shortage when the ``baby boom'' \ngeneration ages, and it is evident that employers will have to develop \nnew sources of labor as our elderly population continues to grow much \nfaster than the number of workers entering the workforce. According to \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, ``retaining older workers is a priority \nin labor intensive industries, and will become even more critical as we \napproach the year 2000.'' It seems counterproductive and foolish to \nkeep willing, diligent workers out of the American workforce. Our \ncountry must continue to support pro-work, not pro-welfare policies.\n\n  More importantly, many of the older Americans penalized by the \nearnings test need to work in order to cover their basic expenses: \nhealth care, housing and food. Many seniors do not have significant \nsavings or a private pension. For this reason, low-income workers are \nparticularly hard-hit by the earnings test.\n  It is important to note that wealthy seniors, who have lucrative \ninvestments, stocks, and substantial savings, are not affected by the \nearnings limit. Their supplemental ``unearned'' income is not subject \nto the earnings threshold. The earnings limit only affects seniors who \nmust work and depend on their earned income for survival.\n  Finally, let me stress that repealing the burdensome and unfair \nearnings test would not jeopardize the solvency of the Social Security \nfunds. Opponents who claim otherwise are engaging in cruel scare \ntactics. The Social Security benefits which working seniors are losing \ndue to the earnings test penalty are benefits they have rightfully \nearned by contributing to the system throughout their working years \nbefore retiring. These are benefits which they should not be losing \nbecause they are trying to survive by supplementing their Social \nSecurity income. Furthermore, certain studies indicate that repealing \nthe earnings test would actually result in a net increase of $140 \nmillion in federal revenue because more seniors would be earning wages \nand paying income taxes on these wages.\n  Mr. President, there is no compelling justification for denying \neconomic opportunity to an individual on the basis of age. It is quite \nevident that the earnings test is outdated, unjust and discriminatory.\n  I am pleased that this Congress will be focusing on the overall \nstructure of the Social Security system and working together for \nsolutions which would strengthen the system for the seniors of today \nand tomorrow without placing an unfair burden on working Americans. It \nis absolutely crucial that we include elimination of the unfair \nearnings test in any Social Security bill we enact this year.\n  I find it encouraging that President Clinton indicated in his State \nof the Union Address that he is finally ready to address this issue and \nallow seniors the freedom to work without being unfairly penalized. As \nmany of my colleagues may recall, this was a campaign initiative of \nPresident Clinton in 1992 and I am pleased that it appears that we may \nfinally have a bipartisan victory for eliminating this unfair penalty \non working seniors in 1999. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to work with me to get this accomplished for America's seniors.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter in support of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      The 60 Plus Association,\n\n                                  Arlington, VA, January 20, 1999.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: Congratulations on your legislation to \n     repeal the Social Security earnings test.\n       The 60 Plus Association has been a long-time advocate of \n     removing this provision which penalizes those senior citizens \n     who work or want to work while receiving Social Security \n     benefits. It is unfair to penalize them by mandating that for \n     every $3 earned over the established limit (in 1998, a total \n     of $14,500) the senior works, he or she suffers the loss of \n     $1 in Social Security benefits. Seniors are denied by this \n     penalty the opportunity to continue contributing productively \n     to our economy. And it is a case of age discrimination \n     against ambitious seniors, and seniors who need to continue \n     working.\n       You demonstrate that you are a real friend of all senior \n     citizens by sponsoring this legislation to repeal the Social \n     Security earnings limit. You may be sure we at the 60 Plus \n     Association will work diligently to support this legislation \n     and hope it will soon be enacted into law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  James L.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na partial exclusion from gross income for individuals and interest \nreceived by individuals; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          THE MIDDLE-INCOME SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Middle-\nIncome Savings and Investment Act of 1999. This bill is designed to \nencourage lower- and middle-income Americans to save and invest more of \ntheir hard-earned dollars, by allowing taxpayers to earn $200 ($400 for \njoint filers) of interest and dividend income tax-free. This bill also \nlessens the impact of one of the most nefarious aspects of our current \ntax code--double taxation.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is important. Consumers can do three \nthings with their income: spend it, pay taxes, or save it. \nUnfortunately, Americans are not doing enough of the latter.\n  America's personal savings rate is at an all-time low. Furthermore, \nthe U.S. national savings rate ranks among the lowest of the G-7 \ncountries. According to the Department of Commerce, in September 1998, \nthe personal savings rate was 0%. In other words, we saved nothing. In \nOctober 1998, things got worse and our personal savings rate fell to \n-2%. Americans spent more that month than they earned.\n  Other countries have high tax rates, but their citizens still manage \nto save more of their hard-earned dollars than most Americans. \nEconomists say that this is because many other countries provide a tax \nincentive for small savers by exempting some portion or all of their \ninterest or dividend income from tax. In contrast, the U.S. tax code \ntaxes the savings twice, once when the individual earns the income, and \nagain when the small savers earn interest or dividends generated by the \nsavings or investments.\n  Congress can not place the blame entirely on the American consumer \nfor our nation's record low savings rates. Our current tax code \ndiscourages savings and investment. Income is taxed first when it is \nearned. If the income is spent, then it is not taxed again. However, if \nthe income is saved or invested, the returns on the savings are taxed \nonce again. Thus, savings and investment are taxed twice.\n  The multiple layers of taxation on savings increase the cost of \nsavings, which leads to a smaller supply of capital, and a decreased \npersonal savings rate. A fairer tax code would not penalize savings \nrelative to consumption. This legislation is not a cure for all of the \nills of our overly complicated burdensome tax code, but it is an \nimportant step to eradicating the double taxation inherent in our \nantiquated tax code.\n  The Middle-Income Savings and Investment Act provides some tax relief \nto taxpayers by allowing individuals to earn up to $200 in interest or \ndividend income tax-free; a married couple could earn up to $400 in \ninterest and dividends tax-free. $200 may not sound like much money, \nbut it represents an important first step in eliminating the bias \nagainst savings and investment.\n\n  This legislation would provide tax relief to the majority of \nAmericans. However, because of the low $200 and $400 exemption levels, \nthis legislation will particularly benefit lower- and middle-income \ntaxpayers, and boost savings incentives among non-savers and small-\nsavers alike. The vast majority of moderate-income savers would not be \ntaxed on any of their interest or dividend income under this \nlegislation. The Congressional Joint Economic Committee estimates that \nthis type of interest and dividend exclusion would affect 57% of all \ntaxpayers, with more than 30 million taxpayers not paying any tax on \ninterest and dividend income.\n  It is vital that we create further incentives to encourage moderate-\nincome Americans to save and invest more of their hard-earned dollars. \nPolicy makers and economists have long been concerned about the \nadequacy of savings in the United States. These fears address both the \nfinancial well-being of individuals, and the fiscal stability of the \nnational economy.\n  Increased savings and investment are an essential element of low- to \nmoderate-income Americans' financial well-being. Savings impact \ntaxpayers' ability to save for emergencies, education, home buying and \nmost importantly, for retirement.\n  Consumer spending is powering the United States economy at a brisk \nrate of growth, even as we struggle with diminished export sales and \nslumping economies in Asia, Russia, and Latin America. However, as \ndemonstrated by the low levels of personal savings in September and \nOctober of 1998, we are raiding our savings to purchase homes, consumer \ngoods, and other products. Consumers cannot raid their wealth forever.\n  The recent devaluation of the Brazilian currency and other \ngeopolitical instability could result in a potential economic downturn \nin the United States. In the event this does happen, increased personal \nsavings will give Americans a financial cushion to weather any \npotential downturn.\n  Retirement looms around the corner for many baby boomers. While I am \nconfident Congress will ensure that the Social Security trust funds \nwill be solvent when the baby boomers retire, Social Security alone may \nnot be sufficient to maintain the boomers' current standard of living. \nPersonal savings must make up this gap. Since personal savings are at \nan all-time low, it is unlikely that a substantial number of baby \nboomers will have sufficient personal savings to supplement their \nsocial security benefits to make up this income gap. Tax reform which \nencourages savings and investment can be an important tool to ensure \nthat retiring Americans have sufficient personal savings to maintain \ntheir current standard of living.\n  Increased personal savings and investment are also good for the \nnation's fiscal well-being. The money financial institutions lend or \ninvest does not grow on trees. This capital comes from the funds \neveryday Americans deposit or invest in these institutions. Thus, \nsavings are important because they are a key element of capital \nformation. Capital formation is necessary for economic growth and \nrising wages.\n  We must increase the savings rate if we wish to continue our current \neconomic expansion. Without savings, it is impossible to build \nfactories, purchase equipment, conduct research, or develop technology. \nSavings allow businesses to purchase equipment, and new equipment \nallows factories to be more productive, which in turn raises the income \nof workers and owners.\n  This link between savings rates and capital formation is not rocket \nscience. Workers are more productive when they are working with modern \nequipment. More productive workers earn higher real wages. Higher real \nwages are the beginning of higher standards of living. But, the key is \ncapital. American industry must have access to a readily available \nsupply of affordable domestic capital to purchase this productivity \nenhancing equipment.\n  The bottom line is that capital formation is necessary for economic \ngrowth and rising wages. Further incentives for savings and investment \nwill increase capital formation. The Middle-Class Savings and \nInvestment Act provides a necessary incentive to get low- to moderate-\nincome Americans to save and invest more.\n  At present, America is not suffering from its current savings \ndilemma. However, we must act now to increase the personal savings rate \nto prepare for the challenges of the next millennium.\n  Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Office estimates a budget \nsurplus of $80 billion for fiscal year 1999. Informal estimates by the \nJoint Committee on Taxation indicate that this bill will only cost $15 \nbillion over 5 years. What better way to use a small portion of the \nsurplus than to return it to the American people in the form of much-\nneeded middle-class tax relief.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n\n[[Page S858]]\n\n  S. 284. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \neliminate the marriage penalty by increasing the standard deduction for \nmarried individuals filing joint returns to twice the standard \ndeduction for unmarried individuals; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                Marriage Penalty Elimination Act of 1999\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce the \nMarriage Penalty Elimination Act of 1999. This bill would deliver \nsweeping tax relief to millions of lower- and middle-income Americans \nby eliminating the marriage penalty. The bill is simple: it \nincrementally increases the standard deduction over a 5-year period, \nuntil the joint filer's standard deduction is equal to 2 times the \nindividual filer's deduction.\n  This bill significantly lessens the effect of one of the Tax Code's \nmost inequitable provisions, the marriage penalty. Under today's Tax \nCode, the marriage penalty occurs when the sum of the tax liabilities \nof two unmarried individuals filing their own tax returns is less than \ntheir tax liability would be under a joint return if they were married. \nThe Marriage Penalty Elimination Act would allow a married couple to \nclaim the same amount of the standard deduction as two individuals. It \nseems logical that a married couple would be eligible to take two times \nthe standard deduction that an individual can take. This is not the \ncase. Under current law, joint filers are only eligible to take \napproximately 1.67 times the standard deduction of single filers.\n  Because CBO has estimated that federal budget surpluses will total \nmore than $700 billion over the next 10 years, there could be no better \ntime for Congress to focus our attention on relieving the tax burden on \nthe American people. There is no better time than now to provide relief \nto the taxpayers who have been overtaxed and overburdened with our \nantiquated tax system.\n  Mr. President, as Congress is well aware, it is essential to provide \nrelief to the ordinary, hard-working, middle-class American families \nwho are struggling to make ends meet. This bill focuses directly on \nlower- and middle-income taxpayers, because the disparity between a \nmarried couple's standard deduction and an unmarried couple's combined \nstandard deduction is most discriminating to the lower- and middle-\nincome level taxpayers.\n  The current standard deduction for joint returns is currently 1.67 \ntimes that of single returns for tax bracket rates of 15%, 28% and 31%. \nHowever, the disparity narrows at the 36% bracket for joint filers to \n1.2 times that of individual filers. And, at the highest bracket rate \nof 39.6%, the standard deduction for married and unmarried couples is \nequal. These figures make clear the discrimination that our present Tax \nCode imposes on lower- and middle-income taxpayers.\n  This bill would eliminate the unjust disparity between the standard \ndeduction afforded a married couple and an unmarried couple. It is \nvital to our Nation that Congress work to foster strength among \nAmerican families. By enacting the Marriage Penalty Elimination Act, \nthis Congress would not only be addressing the tax concerns of the \nAmerican people, but also providing an incentive for the American \nfamily. As the Tax Code is written now, couples are punished with an \nundue financial burden just for being married. In effect, the marriage \npenalty taxes marriage, one of our most fundamental institutions. There \ncan be no doubt that this kind of disincentive for marriage is wrong.\n  In addition to the overriding moral objection to a marriage penalty, \nthere exists a basic question of fairness. Not only is it debilitating \nto our society to penalize those who enter into the sacred institution \nof marriage to create a family, but it is fundamentally unjust to \nimpose a greater tax burden on two married people than on two unmarried \npeople who live together.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the millions of lower- and middle-income \nAmerican families, I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 285\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \nrestore the link between the maximum amount of earnings by blind \nindividuals permitted without demonstrating ability to engage in \nsubstantial gainful activity and the exempt amount permitted in \ndetermining excess earnings under the earnings test; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n                   blind persons earnings equity act\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an \nimportant piece of legislation which would have a tremendous impact on \nthe lives of many blind people. This bill restores the 20-year link \nbetween blind people and senior citizens in regards to the Social \nSecurity earnings limit which has helped many blind people become self-\nsufficient and productive.\n  When the Congress passed the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act in \n1996, we unfortunately broke the longstanding linkage in the treatment \nof blind people and seniors under Social Security, which resulted in \nallowing the earnings limit to be raised for seniors only and did not \ngive blind people the same opportunity to increase their earnings \nwithout penalizing their Social Security benefits.\n  My intent when I sponsored the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act \nwas not to break the link between the blind people and the senior \npopulation. In 1996, time constraints and fiscal considerations forced \nme to focus solely on raising the unfair and burdensome earnings limit \nfor seniors. I am happy to say that the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work \nAct became law in 1996, and the earnings exemption for seniors is being \nraised in annual increments until it reaches $30,000 in the year 2002. \nThis law is allowing millions of seniors to continue contributing to \nsociety as productive workers.\n  Now we should work together in the spirit of fairness to ensure that \nthis same opportunity is given to the blind population. We should \nprovide blind people the opportunity to be productive and ``make it'' \non their own. We should not continue policies which discourage these \nindividuals from working and contributing to society.\n  The bill I am introducing today is identical to one I sponsored in \nthe last Congress. It would reunite the earnings exemption amount for \nblind people with the exemption amount for senior citizens. If we do \nnot reinstate this link, blind people will be restricted to earning \n$14,800 in the year 2002 in order\n\n[[Page S859]]\n\nto protect their Social Security benefits, compared to the $30,000 \nwhich seniors will be permitted to earn.\n  There are very strong and convincing arguments in favor of \nreestablishing the link between these two groups and increasing the \nearnings limit for blind people.\n  First, the earnings test treatment of our blind and senior \npopulations has historically been identical. Since 1977, blind people \nand senior citizens have shared the identical earnings exemption \nthreshold under Title II of the Social Security Act. Now, senior \ncitizens will be given greater opportunity to increase their earnings \nwithout losing a portion of their Social Security benefits; the blind, \nhowever, will not have the same opportunity.\n  The Social Security earnings test imposes as great a work \ndisincentive for blind people as it does for senior citizens. In fact, \nthe earnings test probably provides a greater aggregate disincentive \nfor blind individuals since many blind beneficiaries are of working age \n(18-65) and are capable of productive work.\n  Blindness is often associated with adverse social and economic \nconsequences. It is often tremendously difficult for blind individuals \nto find sustained employment or any employment at all, but they do want \nto work. They take great pride in being able to work and becoming \nproductive members of society. By linking the blind with seniors in \n1977, Congress provided a great deal of hope and incentive for blind \npeople in this country to enter the work force. Now, we are taking that \nhope away from them by not allowing them the same opportunity to \nincrease their earnings as senior citizens.\n  Blind people are likely to respond favorably to an increase in the \nearnings test by working more, which will increase their tax payments \nand their purchasing power and allow the blind to make a greater \ncontribution to the general economy. In addition, encouraging the blind \nto work and allowing them to work more without being penalized would \nbring additional revenue into the Social Security trust funds as well \nas the Federal Treasury. In short, restoring the link between blind \npeople and senior citizens for treatment of Social Security benefits \nwould help many blind people become self-sufficient, productive members \nof society.\n  I am pleased that this Congress will be focusing on the overall \nstructure of the Social Security system and working together for \nsolutions which would strengthen the system for seniors of today and \ntomorrow without placing an unfair burden on working Americans. It is \nabsolutely crucial that we include raising the earnings test for blind \nindividuals as a part of any Social Security bill we enact this year.\n  I urge each of my colleagues to join me in sponsoring this important \nmeasure to restore fair and equitable treatment for our blind citizens \nand to give the blind community increased financial independence. Our \nnation would be better served if we restore equality for the blind and \nprovide them with the same freedom, opportunities and fairness as our \nnation's seniors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 286. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code to repeal the \nincrease in the tax on Social Security benefits; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                      SENIOR CITIZENS' EQUITY ACT\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation to repeal the increase in tax on Social Security benefits. \nAs my colleagues know, the 1993 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act \nincreased the taxable portion of Social Security benefits from 50% to \n85% for Social Security recipients whose threshold incomes exceed \n$34,000 (single) and $44,000 (couples). The legislation I am \nintroducing today simply phases out this increase gradually over a \nfour-year period. In 1999, the applicable percentage would be 75 \npercent; in 2000, 65 percent: in 2001, 60 percent; in 2002, 55 percent; \nand finally in 2001, the taxable percentage would return to 50%.\n  I believe the increase in the taxable portion of Social Security \nbenefits was blatantly unfair because it changed the rules in the \nmiddle of the game. Responsible senior citizens who had carefully \nplanned for their retirement were penalized and saw their income fall \nwhile their marginal tax rate skyrocketed. Nearly 9,000 seniors \nrepresenting 23.4 percent of recipients are affected by this provision. \nThese seniors relied on and based their decisions on the old law, and \nthey cannot now go back in time to change these decisions.\n  Clearly, we should be encouraging all Americans to save and invest \nfor the future. We can not be sure that Social Security benefits will \ntake care of all our retirement needs. If Congress continues to change \nthe rules after plans and investment decisions have been made, we will \ndiminish the incentive for Americans to prepare for the future and plan \naccordingly.\n  I am consistently amazed by the perverse disincentives Congress \nenacts. Aside being patently unfair, taxing 85% of Social Security \nbenefits above the current income levels creates a tremendous \ndisincentive for seniors to work. It simply does not make sense to work \nif every dollar you earn over the threshold drastically reduces your \nSocial Security benefits.\n  This legislation is supported by the National Committee to Preserve \nSocial Security and Medicare, the Seniors Coalition and Sixty-Plus.\n  I am pleased that this Congress will be focusing on strengthening and \nrestructuring our nation's Social Security system for the seniors of \ntoday and tomorrow without placing an unfair burden on American \nworkers. As we continue working together for a solution to our nation's \nretirement system I will push to include this provision in any Social \nSecurity bill we enact this year.\n  Finally, I am sure many of my colleagues note that the problems with \nthis additional tax on Social Security benefits are strikingly similar \nto the Social Security earnings limit. It is my strong hope that we \nwill act expeditiously on this legislation as well as my legislation to \nfully repeal the unfair earnings test.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    National Committee to Preserve\n\n\n                                 Social Security and Medicare,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 20, 1999.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The National Committee to Preserve \n     Social Security and Medicare is pleased to endorse your \n     legislation to repeal the inequitable tax increase on Social \n     Security benefits enacted as part of the 1993 budget \n     reconciliation bill.\n       The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 increased the \n     amount of Social Security benefits subject to tax from 50 \n     percent to 85 percent for individual beneficiaries with \n     income above $34,000 or for couples with income above \n     $44,000. The ``Senior Citizens' Equity Act'' would gradually \n     phase out this increase and return the taxable percentage to \n     50 percent.\n       The 1993 tax increase affects not only wealthy seniors but \n     also middle income seniors. Over time, many more moderate and \n     low income retirees will see their income pushed over the \n     thresholds because the thresholds are not indexed. Taxing 85 \n     percent of Social Security benefits over the current income \n     thresholds unfairly penalizes responsible older Americans who \n     planned for their retirement through employment, saving, and \n     investment. Many National Committee Members need or want to \n     work, but they also deserve to receive their hard-earned \n     retirement benefits. The increased tax rate only discourages \n     work and retirement savings.\n       Moreover, a Price-Waterhouse analysis demonstrated that the \n     1993 legislation targeted seniors by increasing their tax \n     burden more than non-seniors in every income category--on \n     average twice as great for senior families as for non-senior \n     families. Middle income seniors experienced a \n     disproportionately large tax increase under the 1993 bill, \n     and your legislation will provide them with much needed \n     relief.\n       The 5.5 million members and supporters of the National \n     Committee thank you for your efforts on behalf of older \n     Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Martha A. McSteen,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      The 60 Plus Association,\n\n                                  Arlington, VA, January 20, 1999.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: I commend you for introducing the \n     Senior Citizens' Equity Act, which would repeal the \n     previously enacted tax on Social Security benefits.\n       A great inequity hit senior citizens when President \n     Clinton's 1993 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act increased \n     the taxable proportion of Social Security benefits from 50% \n     to 85%. It hit seniors whose income was as low as $34,000 \n     (single) and $44,000 (couples). This placed an unfair burden \n     on our seniors who were suddenly singled out and had the \n     income for which they had worked subject to\n\n[[Page S860]]\n\n     a burdensome increase in taxes. Almost one-third of our \n     seniors were dealt this blow.\n       Your Senior Citizens' Equity Act will help seniors while \n     restoring fairness to the tax system for them. I hope \n     Congress will act quickly to pass your legislation and that \n     the President will sign it. We owe that much to our seniors.\n           Sincerely,\n                               James L. Martin, President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROTH (for himself and Mr. Biden):\n  S. 287. A bill to amend the Small Business Act to require the \nestablishment of a regional or branch office of the Small Business \nAdministration in each State; to the Committee on Small Business.\n\n\n         small business administration equal representation act\n\n Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to \nintroduce legislation to ensure that the federal government provides \nDelaware small businesses with the same treatment as those in other \nstates. Delaware is the only state in which the Small Business \nAdministration does not maintain a district office. As a result, \nDelaware small businesses are being shortchanged.\n  The primary function of Small Business Administration district \noffices is the approval of Small Business Administration loan guarantee \napplications. Without a district office, Delaware applications must be \nprocessed out of state. As a result, community benefit, interviews, and \nlocal outlook cannot be considered with loan guarantee paperwork as is \ncommon in other states, and applications take longer to process. Small \nBusiness Administration district offices will also provide Delaware's \nSmall Business community with more effective outreach and awareness of \nSmall Business Administration programs and services.\n  The bill I am introducing today, with the cosponsorship of Senator \nBiden, will correct this inequity. This bill, the Small Business \nAdministration Equal Representation Act, specifies that each state is \nentitled to a single Small Business Administration district office. But \nit will do so without authorizing any additional appropriations.\n  Mr. President, Delaware small businesses deserve the same level of \nsupport from the Small Business Administration as is found in every \nother state. Even Puerto Rico benefits from having a Small Business \nAdministration district office. The Small Business Administration Equal \nRepresentation Act will assure that Delaware receives from the Small \nBusiness Administration the level of support it deserves.\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Bill Roth, my \ngood friend and colleague from Delaware, the distinguished chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, in introducing legislation important to our \nState.\n  Small businesses are the cornerstone of our economy--in Delaware and \nacross the rest of the country. They are key players in the record \neconomic expansion we have enjoyed over the last seven years. They are \nengines of job growth and technical innovation, and they deserve not \nonly our praise, but our support as well.\n  The Small Business Administration has many programs that can provide \nthat support--including loan guarantee--through a national network of \ndistrict offices. However, Delaware remains the only State in the Union \nthat is without a Small Business Administration district office. The \nhigher hurdles between Delaware small businesses and the services of \nthe Small Business Administration reduce the value of those services to \nDelawareans.\n  That is why Senator Roth and I are introducing this legislation, that \nwill guarantee that every state--including Delaware--will have its own \nSmall Business Administration district office. This can be accomplished \nwithout any additional expenditures under the current Small Business \nAdministration budget.\n  A district office in Delaware will make sure that Delaware businesses \nwill enjoy the same access to Small Business Administration programs \nthat their counterparts in other States now have. I look forward to \nworking with Bill Roth, and Congressman Mike Castle in the House, to \nmake this fair and sensible proposal a success in this session of \nCongress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Smith \n        of Oregon, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Kerrey, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 288. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \nfrom income certain amounts received under the National Health Service \nCorps Scholarship Program and F. Edward Hebert Armed Forces Health \nProfessions Scholarship and Financial Assistance Program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                            tax legislation\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to \namend our tax law's treatment of scholarships awarded under the \nNational Health Service Corps (NHSC) scholarship program. Although, as \na general rule, scholarships are excludable from income, the Internal \nRevenue Service has taken the position that NHSC scholarships are \nincludible in income. Imposing taxes on the scholarships could have \ndisastrous effects on a program that for over 20 years has helped \nfunnel doctors, nurse-practitioners, physician assistants, and other \nhealth professionals into medically underserved communities.\n  Under the National Health Service Corps program, health professions \nstudents are given a scholarship covering the cost of tuition and fees, \ntogether with a monthly stipend covering living expenses. For each year \nof scholarship funding, NHSC scholars are obligated, upon completion of \ntheir training, to provide a year of full-time primary health care in \none of 2,000 designated health professions shortage areas. These \nshortage areas include the nation's neediest communities, both rural \nareas and inner cities. NHSC scholars who renege on their service \nobligations are required to re-pay an amount equal to three times the \nscholarship, plus interest.\n  Generally, the Internal Revenue Code provides that amounts received \nas scholarships are not includible in a recipient's gross income. There \nis an exception to this rule, however, when a scholarship is provided \nin exchange for services or a promise to perform services. Without such \nan exception, an employer could disguise compensation as a scholarship. \nNational Health Corps Service scholarships, however, are not disguised \ncompensation. Upon completion of their studies, the large majority of \nNHSC scholars do not work for the Federal government, which awarded \nthem the scholarship. Instead, they work at places like low-income \nclinics or inner-city hospitals. Consequently, this is not a situation \nwhere an employer is transforming compensation into a scholarship.\n  I introduced a bill similar to this one during the last Congress. It \nwas passed by the Senate as part of the Education Savings and School \nExcellence Act of 1998, and was included in the conference agreement \nfor that bill. This bill was vetoed by the president, so the problem \nstill exists. The conference committee also determined that amounts \nreceived under the F. Edward Hebert Armed Forces Health Professions \nScholarship and Financial Assistance Program should also be eligible \nfor tax-free treatment. This is a program similar to the National \nHealth Service Corps available to members of the armed forces. The bill \nI am introducing today also provides for exclusion from income for \nscholarships received under this program.\n  Last year, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that providing \nan exclusion from income for amounts received under these two \nscholarship programs would have a negligible effect on budget receipts. \nI do not expect any change in that analysis, and I urge my colleagues \nto join me in support of this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Hutchinson, and \n        Mr. Sessions):\n  S. 289. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to permit \nfaith-based substance abuse treatment centers to receive Federal \nassistance, to permit individuals receiving Federal drug treatment \nassistance to select private and religiously oriented treatment, and to \nprotect the rights of individuals from being required to receive \nreligiously oriented treatment; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n\n\n               faith-based drug treatment enhancement act\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today, I, along with my colleagues \nSenators Coverdell, Hutchinson, and\n\n[[Page S861]]\n\nSessions introduced the ``Faith-Based Drug Treatment Enhancement Act.'' \nThe purpose of this legislation is to make successful faith-based drug \nand alcohol treatment programs eligible for federal substance abuse \ntreatment dollars. It will allow faith-based programs to stand on an \nequal footing with other treatment programs which receive federal aid, \nallowing them to compete for federal funds without changing the \nreligious nature of the help they provide. This is important because it \nis the religious character of the program to which program recipients \noften point as the reason for their success in overcoming their \naddiction.\n  Many faith-based treatment centers have astounding treatment success \nrates, particularly when compared with the single-digit success rates \nof many government-sponsored secular programs. One faith-based \norganization, the Mel Trotter Ministry, is located in my state of \nMichigan. This ministry points to the accountability demanded of \naddicts entering its faith-based program as a reason for its success. \nAnother contributing factor to Mel Trotter's astounding 70 percent \nsuccess rate is the program's ability to provide recipients with an \nincentive to change. The drug addict finds a new life at Mel Trotter \nMinistries and is finally able to overcome his or her addiction.\n  A similar program in my state, the Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries, \nboasts a 78 percent success rate for its substance abuse programs. One \nof the program recipients describes his experience at Detroit Rescue \nMission Ministries this way: ``I was in and out of jail. During the \nwinter of 1995, I was exposed to arctic cold with a resulting case of \nfrostbite so severe I was threatened with amputation. Released from \nprobation for the sixth time, I found Detroit Rescue Mission \nMinistries' Oasis shelter on Woodward Avenue and stayed 22 nights. \nThere I found more than a shelter--I found a relationship with God and \na new life of service for Him.''\n  Mel Trotter Ministry and Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries are \nexamples of substance abuse treatment programs with proven success \nrecords. These programs and programs like them should be allowed to \nprovide the crucial assistance needed for individuals to overcome their \nsubstance abuse once and for all.\n  This legislation builds on the charitable choice provision Senator \nAshcroft fought to have included in the historic welfare reform bill. \nThat provision allows faith based charities to contract with government \nto supply social services without having to give up their religious \ncharacter. No longer will religious groups have to literally hide the \nBibles in order to help people.\n  Where sterile, bureaucratic government run programs fail, faith based \nprograms can succeed, and are succeeding already. I urge my colleagues \nto support these efforts by supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 290. A bill to establish an adoption awareness program, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n                         ADOPTION PROMOTION ACT\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues' \nsupport for The Adoption Promotion Act. This legislation will work to \nprovide important information on adoption to women facing unplanned \npregnancies.\n  Mr. President, each year more than a million couples eagerly await \nthe opportunity to adopt a child. Unfortunately, only 50,000 domestic, \nnon-related adoptions occur each year. Couples waiting to adopt are \nwilling and able to provide loving homes. Some of them have for one \nreason or another found themselves incapable of having children of \ntheir own. Others simply wish to share their lives and their homes with \nanother child. Every one of them could nurture and give a good \nupbringing to whatever youngster is lucky enough to get them as \nparents. Unfortunately, the would-be parents often must wait several \nyears for the opportunity to adopt a healthy child. For the anxious \nparents, the waiting seems to last an eternity.\n  There are many reasons for the sharp disparity between the relatively \nlimited number of children available for adoption and the growing \nnumber of families anxiously waiting to adopt a child. Crucial is the \nfact that many women are not provided adequate information about \nadoption when they are making the important decision of how to deal \nwith an unexpected pregnancy. Too few women are fully informed \nconcerning the adoption option.\n  We know that providing information to women on adoption as a choice \ncan increase the number of adoptions that occur each year and decrease \nthe number of abortions. I believe that this is an important goal. For \nthis reason, I have introduced, along with my colleague, Senator \nLandrieu, legislation that authorizes an Adoption Promotion program. \nThis program will provide $25 million in grants to be used for adoption \npromotion activity. It will also require recipients to contribute $25 \nmillion of in-kind donations. The total amount going to adoption \npromotion will, therefore, be $50 million. This amount will allow for a \nthorough information campaign to take place--reaching women all over \nthe country.\n  The legislation provides for grants to be used for public service \nannouncements on print, radio, TV, and billboards. Grants will also be \nprovided for the development and distribution of brochures regarding \nadoption through federally funded Title X clinics. These provisions \nwill enable women to have accurate and clear information on adoption as \nan alternative when at a crucial point in their pregnancies. Further, \nthe campaign will help to raise the level of awareness around the \ncountry about the importance of adoption.\n  Mr. President, I believe that each and every one of us, whether pro-\nlife or pro-choice, should be working to reduce the number of abortions \nthat occur each year. Indeed, I have often heard on this floor that \nabortion should be ``safe, legal and rare.'' I take my colleagues at \ntheir word and urge them to join me in this voluntary information \nprogram; a program designed to inform women of all their choices \nregarding any unexpected pregnancy.\n  Too many women in America feel abandoned and helpless in the face of \nan unexpected pregnancy. The father of the child may have left, the \nwoman's family and friends even may desert her. Even those who stay \nwith her may simply pressure her to end an embarrassing and troublesome \nsituation.\n  Too often, then, our women, in a vulnerable state, are left without \nfull, unbiased information and guidance concerning their options. I \nthink it is crucial in these circumstances that we keep these women \nfully informed of all their options--including the option of releasing \ntheir child into the arms of a welcoming couple, anxious to become \nloving parents.\n  If we truly are committed to making every child a wanted child, Mr. \nPresident, I believe it is our duty to see to it that pregnant women \nknow that there are couples out there who would love to care for their \nchildren. It is time for us, as a nation, to make clear our commitment \nto truly full information for expectant mothers, information that \nincludes the availability of safe, loving homes for their \nchildren.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 291. A bill to convey certain real property within the Carlsbad \nProject in New Mexico to the Carlsbad Irrigation District; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n       the carlsbad irrigation project acquired land transfer act\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am again introducing the \nCarlsbad Irrigation Project Acquired Land Transfer Act. I, along with \nCongressman Skeen, have been working to convey tracts of land--paid for \nby Carlsbad Irrigation District and referred to as ``acquired lands''--\nback to the district, during the past several congresses.\n  I introduced this bill in May of 1997 in order to transfer lands back \nto the rightful owners. This legislation transfers acquired land \nwithout affecting operations at the New Mexico state park at Brantley \nDam, or the operations and ownership of the dam itself. Furthermore, \nthe bill allows the Carlsbad Irrigation District to utilize proceeds \nfrom oil and gas leases on the transferred lands and moves land \nmanagement responsibilities from the federal government to a local \nentity.\n  The Carlsbad Irrigation Project is a single-purpose project created \nin 1905 by the Bureau of Reclamation. The district has had operations \nand maintenance responsibilities for the irrigation\n\n[[Page S862]]\n\nand drainage system since 1932. This legislation directs the Carlsbad \nIrrigation District to continue to manage the lands as they have been \nin the past, for the purposes for which the project was constructed. It \nmet all the repayment obligations to the government in 1991, and it's \nabout time we let Carlsbad Irrigation District have what is rightfully \ntheirs.\n  This is a fair and equitable bill that has been developed over years \nof negotiations. This legislation accomplishes three things: conveys \ntitle of acquired lands and facilities to Carlsbad Irrigation District; \nallows the District to assume management of leases and the benefits of \nthe receipts from these acquired lands; and sets a 180 day deadline for \nthe transfer, establishing a 50-50 cost-sharing standard for carrying \nout the transfer.\n  This bill passed the Senate near the end of the 105th Congress, but \nunfortunately did not get through the House of Representatives due to \npolitical wrangling at the end of the session. However, this bill has \nstrong bipartisan and administration support, and it is about time that \nwe pass this legislation to provide the Bureau of Reclamation with the \nability to accomplish their stated goal of logical transfer such as \nthis.\n  This transfer shifts responsibility from the federal government back \nto a local entity, and creates opportunity for the district to improve \nand enhance the management of these lands. I hope that both the Senate \nand the House of Representatives will act quickly on this legislation \nso that the Carlsbad Irrigation District will promptly begin getting \nthe benefits for that which they have paid.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 291\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to preserve the cultural resources of the Route 66 \ncorridor and to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to provide \nassistance; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                   ROUTE 66 CORRIDOR PRESERVATION ACT\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill which \nwill help preserve an important part of American history for future \ngenerations--Route 66. This legislation, which passed in the Senate at \nthe end of the 105th Congress, will protect the unique cultural \nresources along the famous Route 66 corridor and authorize the Interior \nSecretary to provide assistance\n\n[[Page S863]]\n\nthrough the Park Service. Congresswoman Heather Wilson of Albuquerque, \nNew Mexico, has reintroduced a companion bill (H.R. 66) in the House of \nRepresentatives, and we hope this Congress will act promptly in passing \nthis legislation aiding grassroots efforts to maintain this important \npart of American culture.\n  The road system of a nation links its people together. Without such a \nroad, the movement of goods and services would be impossible. History \nis replete with examples of pioneers, such as those that forged the \nSanta Fe Trail, trying to find passage across this great country.\n  John Steinbeck referred to Route 66 as the ``Mother Road'' in ``The \nGrapes of Wrath,'' and many in this Chamber may recall traveling across \ncountry on this road in their youth. New Mexico added to the aura of \nRoute 66, giving new generations of Americans their first experience of \nour colorful culture and heritage. Starting in Chicago, Illinois, and \nwinding 2,200 miles across the United States to Santa Monica, \nCalifornia, Route 66 linked the urban centers of the Midwest and West. \nServices sprung up along the route to provide for travelers crossing \nthe heart of the country.\n  It rolled through eight American states, and in New Mexico, it went \nthrough the communities of Tucumcari, Santa Rosa, Albuquerque, Grants \nand Gallup. Route 66 allowed generations of vacationers to travel to \npreviously remote areas and experience the natural beauty and cultures \nof the Southwest and Far West. Route 66 symbolized freedom and mobility \nfor an entire generation of Americans in their automobiles. This bill \nwill facilitate greater coordination in federal, state and private \nefforts to preserve structures and other cultural resources of the \nhistoric Route 66 corridor, the 20th Century route equivalent to the \nSanta Fe Trail.\n  I introduced the Route 66 Study Act of 1990, which directed the \nNational Park Service to determine the best ways to preserve, \ncommemorate and interpret Route 66. The study, which was completed in \n1995, determined that Route 66 had historic national significance, and \nthe structures along the disappearing asphalt should be preserved. As a \nresult, I introduced a bill last June authorizing the National Park \nService to join with federal, state and private efforts to preserve \naspects of the historic Route 66 corridor, the nation's most important \nthoroughfare for east-west migration in the 20th century.\n  The Administration testified in favor of this legislation, with some \nmodifications. We made some good changes to the bill, which passed the \nSenate, and prompt passage will ensure success of this Park Service \nprogram. This legislation authorizes a funding level over 10 years and \nstresses that we want the federal government to support grassroots \nefforts to preserve aspects of this historic highway.\n  This bill authorizes the National Park Service to support state, \nlocal and private efforts to preserve the Route 66 corridor by \nproviding technical assistance, participating in cost-sharing programs, \nand making grants. The Park Service will also act as a clearing house \nfor communication among federal, state, local, private and American \nIndian entities interested in the preservation of the Route 66 \ncorridor.\n  As we draw to the close of this century, there is more interest in \ntrying to save Route 66.

A bill to direct the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior \nand to convey certain lands in San Juan County, New Mexico, to San Juan \nCollege; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n             THE OLD JICARILLA SITE CONVEYANCE ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to again introduce \nimportant legislation allowing for a transfer of an unwanted piece of \nfederal property to an educational institution which needs it. The Old \nJicarilla Site Conveyance Act of 1999 allows for transfer by the \nSecretaries of Agriculture and Interior of real property and \nimprovements at an abandoned and surplus ranger station to San Juan \nCollege. The site is in the Carson National Forest near the village of \nGobernador, New Mexico. The Jicarilla Site will continue to be used for \npublic purposes, including educational and recreational purposes of the \ncollege.\n  Over one third of the land in New Mexico is owned by the federal \ngovernment, and therefore finding appropriate sites for community and \neducational purposes can be difficult. The Forest Service determined \nthat these ten acres are of no further use to them because a new \nadministrative facility has been located in the town of Bloomfield, New \nMexico. In fact, the facility has had no occupants for several years, \nand the Forest Service testified last year that enactment of this bill \nwould ``provide long-term benefits for the people of San Juan County \nand the students and faculty of San Juan College.''\n  I am hoping this bill will again move swiftly through this body. \nClearly, this legislation deserves prompt approval in the House and \nsignature by the President because it is noncontroversial and the land \ncan readily be put to good use for San Juan College and the area \nresidents. We also need to put this property in the hands of the \ncollege so it can protect the area from further deterioration and fire.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 293\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. OLD JICARILLA ADMINISTRATIVE SITE.\n\n       (a) Conveyance of Property.--Not later than one year after \n     the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretaries of \n     Agriculture and Interior (herein ``the Secretaries'') shall \n     convey to San Juan College, in Farmington, New Mexico, \n     subject to the terms and conditions under subsection (c), all \n     right, title, and interest of the United States in and to a \n     parcel of real property (including any improvements on the \n     land) consisting of approximately ten acres known as the \n     ``Old Jicarilla Site'' located in San Juan County, New Mexico \n     (T29N; R5W; portions of Sections 29 and 30).\n       (b) Description of Property.--The exact acreage and legal \n     description of the real property conveyed under subsection \n     (a) shall be determined by a survey satisfactory to the \n     Secretaries and the President of San Juan College. The cost \n     of the survey shall be borne by San Juan College.\n       (c) Terms and Conditions.--\n       (1) Notwithstanding exceptions of application under the \n     Recreation and Public Purposes Act (43 U.S.C. 869(c)), \n     consideration for the conveyance described in subsection (a) \n     shall be--\n       (A) an amount that is consistent with the Bureau of Land \n     Management special pricing program for Governmental entities \n     under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act; and\n       (B) an agreement between the Secretaries and San Juan \n     College indemnifying the Government of the United States from \n     all liability of the Government that arises from the \n     property.\n       (2) The lands conveyed by this Act shall be used for \n     educational and recreational purposes. If such lands cease to \n     be used for such purposes, at the option of the United \n     States, such lands will revert to the United States.\n       (d) Land Withdrawals.--Public Land Order 3443, only insofar \n     as it pertains to lands described in subsections (a) and (b) \n     above, shall be revoked simultaneous with the conveyance of \n     the property under subsection (a).\n\n

Mr. President, the Senate must bid goodbye today \nto an excellent group of young men and women who served as United \nStates Senate Pages this last fall and winter.\n  This group of pages observed a number of important and historic \ndebates in the last few months. Since the beginning of last fall, the \nSenate has debated measures to reform our nation's bankruptcy laws, to \ngovern commerce over the Internet, and to provide funding for the \nvaried programs of the United States government, among others. Of \ncourse, in the last few weeks, these pages have seen history being made \nin the impeachment trial of a President for only the second time since \nour government was founded. But pages are not just passive observers. \nThey are active participants in the daily operations of the United \nStates Senate.\n  Mr. President, a page's life is certainly not easy. They are up \nbefore dawn, at page school at 6:15 am, then here in the Senate for the \nrest of the day. While they are here, their duties run the gamut. They \nhelp set up the chamber, deliver messages all over the Capitol complex, \nand help things function smoothly here on the Senate floor and in the \ncloakrooms. During their limited down time, they often try to sneak in \na few minutes of homework. At the end of their long day, it is back to \nthe dorm for more homework, a little down time, and a little sleep \nbefore they wake up and do it again the next day.\n  On behalf of all Democratic Senators, I would like to thank this fall \nand winter's pages for their hard work and contributions to the Senate, \nand I ask that a list of the 1998 fall and winter pages be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  I hope each member of this page class takes back to his or her home \nstate a better knowledge of how their government works and a better \nappreciation of the need to work together to achieve a common goal. \nThese young people are our future leaders. Measured by their brief \nservice here in the United States Senate, we should all feel confident \nabout our country's future. Perhaps someday, one or more of them will \nreturn as Members of the United States Senate.\n  The list follows:\n\n                         1998 Fall Senate Pages\n\n\n                               democratic\n\n       Hilary Davis, Virginia.\n       George Etheridge, Michigan.\n       Mark Hadley, Virginia.\n       Jennifer Johnston, Vermont.\n       Cara Lane, South Dakota.\n       Lauren Luellwitz, Wisconsin.\n       Andrew Mezvinsky, Pennsylvania.\n       Anna Santiago, Illinois.\n\n\n                               republican\n\n       Erin Anderson, Vermont.\n       Molly Arico, Rhode Island.\n       Rick Carroll, Delaware.\n       Jessica Day, New Hampshire.\n       Denise Foye, South Carolina.\n       Courtney Johnson, Arkansas.\n       Lauren Martindale, Georgia.\n       John Natter, Alabama.\n       Mejken Poore, Utah.\n       Michael Rohrbaugh, Missouri.\n       Russell Sample, Idaho.\n       Tim Shumaker, Kentucky.\n       Erin Tankersley, Mississippi.\n       Sara Van Doren, Washington.\n       Trenton Young, Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/21/senate-section/article/S865-2", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THOMAS G.

After over 35 years of service, today he will end his \nlengthy and productive career by retiring to his country home in \nCulpeper, VA.\n  Tom began working in the Senate as the Senate press liaison. In 1977 \nhe began work in the Office of Daily Digest, where he has served as \neditor since 1989.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my \ncolleagues on the Senate Steel Caucus in sponsoring the Trade Fairness \nAct of 1999. This legislation seeks to respond to the current steel \nimport crisis and prevent future crises by amending U.S. trade law and \ncreating a comprehensive steel import monitoring system.\n  Within the past year, foreign steel has been imported into the United \nStates at unprecedented levels and at prices far below cost. As \neconomic markets have failed in Russia and Asia, foreign steel \nmanufacturers have increasingly turned to the United States to sell \ntheir product and, in return, obtain hard currency. In fact, the import \nrate rose 30 percent in the first ten months of 1998, as compared with \nthe same period last year, and U.S. steel imports this past October \nwere the second highest in history.\n  As a result, U.S. steel manufacturers are faced with a real crisis, \none that threatens to undermine a key sector of our economy. Plants \nacross the country have been forced to shorten shifts,\n\n[[Page S866]]\n\nlay-off workers and, in some cases, declare bankruptcy. In my own \nstate, workers at Bethlehem Steel's Sparrows Point Division have been \nsubjected to shorter hours, shorter shifts and even the shutting down \nof Sparrows Point's galvanized steel line.\n  Mr. President, for the past fifteen years, the U.S. steel industry \nhas worked aggressively to streamline its operations, improve \nproductivity and cut costs, but it cannot compete against illegally \ndumped steel. It is, in fact, time for this Congress to Stand Up For \nSteel.\n  With this legislation, we can begin to do just that. The Trade \nFairness Act of 1999 is comprised of two sections which will enhance \nthe ability of the Administration to take action on this crisis. The \nfirst of these sections amends the emergency safeguards provisions, \nSection 201, of the 1974 Trade Act which allows the President to grant \ntemporary import relief to a domestic industry which the International \nTrade Commission finds has been seriously injured by increased imports. \nThis section seeks not only to ensure that the steel industry is \ntreated equitably, but that all domestic industries may be allowed to \ncompete fairly in the global marketplace.\n  The second section creates a comprehensive steel import monitoring \nprogram which requires importers to provide information including the \nname and address of the importer, supplier and producer of the goods to \nbe imported, the country of origin of the goods, the expected date of \nentry of the goods, a description of the goods, including the \nclassification of these goods under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of \nthe United States, and the quantity of the goods to be imported. This \ninformation will aid the Administration in monitoring the amount of \nsteel brought into the United States and allow these numbers to be \ntabulated and released at a rate faster than at present.\n  Mr. President, as you know, on January 7, the Administration \nsubmitted the ``Report to Congress on a Comprehensive Plan for \nResponding to the Increase in Steel Imports.'' I am disappointed that \nthis report appears largely to be a recital of things already done by \nthe Administration, rather than new steps planned to address the \nproblem. The Administration should be focusing on keeping America's \nsteelworkers in their line of work, instead of in line collecting \nunemployment. For over a century, the steel industry has stood tall and \nserved as a foundation of the American economy. The time for the \nAdministration to Stand Up For Steel is now. The U.S. steel industry \nand the 226,000 Americans employed by it deserve nothing less than the \nfull support of their country.\n  The Trade Fairness Act of 1999 would allow the Administration to \nprovide strong support for the American steel industry. I strongly urge \nmy colleagues to support its passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/21/senate-section/article/S865-4", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     TRIBUTE TO THE PENNSYLVANIA ASSOCIATION OF STUDENT ASSISTANCE \n                             PROFESSIONALS\n\n Mr. SANTORUM.

The PASAP is a state-wide organization \ncomprised of school officials, teachers, treatment center and medical \npersonnel, psychologists and other professionals who address the \ninfluence of alcohol, drugs and mental health issues on students in the \n501 Pennsylvania school districts.\n  The theme of this year's conference, ``Help is Just Down the Hall--\nBuilding Resilience, Building Partners, Building America's Future,'' \nwill focus on parental involvement, crisis response in a school setting \nand other issues focusing on the at-risk student population.\n  According to state statistics, more than 61,000 students were \ndirectly helped during the last school year as a result of the Student \nAssistance program process.\n  The PASAP provide a state forum for sharing resources, common needs, \nexperience and outcomes and promote the development of joint school and \ncommunity programs for youth. The PASAP also provide leadership and \ntraining on national, regional, state and local levels as well as \nadvocate for increased local, state and federal support for student \nassistance programs, treatment services and related personnel in the \npublic and private sector.\n  Mr. President, the PASAP has altered the course of many lives among \nPennsylvania's youth. I ask my colleagues to join with me in commending \nthe PASAP for their committed efforts to the well-being of the youth in \nPennsylvania and the future of our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/21/senate-section/article/S866-1", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TAIWAN'S PARTICIPATION IN THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, Senator Murkowski and I have \nsubmitted a resolution that is critical to the future health and well-\nbeing of the people of Taiwan and the rest of the world. I rise today \nto express my support for the resolution regarding the Republic of \nChina on Taiwan's participation in the World Health Organization (WHO). \nImproving health care in Asia, and around the world, is one of the most \nimportant issues facing the international community as we move into the \n21st century. Despite the fact that many people are better off today \nthan their parents and grandparents were years ago, we still face \ntremendous obstacles to establishing basic health care in a number of \nregions around the world. To this date, children are still not \nvaccinated, clean water and sanitation are still not available to \nhundreds of millions of people, curative drugs and treatments are still \ninaccessible, and over 500,000 mothers die unnecessarily each year in \nchildbirth.\n  The WHO has been instrumental in helping to draw attention to these \nissues, and to bring needed relief to some of the most underprivileged \npeople in the world. As we all know, sickness and disease span across \nborders and can affect anyone, regardless of where he or she lives. \nHere in the United States, we have been lucky enough to enjoy \nrelatively easy access to the newest advances in medical technology and \nknowledge. However, the people of Taiwan have not been so fortunate. \nThe 21 million citizens of Taiwan are currently barred from accessing \nthe same technologies and techniques through the WHO that many other \nnations benefit from.\n  In addition, the Taiwan has been frustrated in its attempts to share \nits own medical knowledge with the rest of the world. Until Taiwan \ngains membership in the WHO, it cannot contribute its substantial \nexpertise in health care to furthering the organization's goals. We can \nall benefit from the advances Taiwan has made on its own, and Taiwan \ncan, in turn, improve its own situation by accessing the resources \namassed by the WHO. The resolution that Senator Murkowski and I have \nsubmitted addresses an issue of basic human decency, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support our efforts to help Taiwan become a member of the \nWHO.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/21/senate-section/article/S866-2", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S866-S867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO GUS OWEN, FORMER SURFACE TRANSPORTATION BOARD MEMBER\n\n Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Gus Owen, the \nimmediate past Vice Chairman of the Surface Transportation Board (STB), \nfor his outstanding service to the nation. Gus Owen completed his term \nof service on the STB on December 31, 1998, after more than four years \nof public service. It is most fitting that we recognize Mr. Owen's \nservice because he met the challenge at a critical time in the history \nof railroad regulation.\n  As the last Commissioner sworn in to serve on the Interstate Commerce \nCommission, Mr. Owen was instrumental in shaping the direction of the \nSTB, the ICC's successor. Mr. Owen's vision of a more streamlined \nderegulated transportation industry is reflected in his many \naccomplishments while serving on the ICC and the STB. As the 104th \nCongress began consideration of overhauling Government oversight of the \nsurface transportation industry, Mr. Owen prepared a ``Blueprint for \nFurther Deregulation of the Surface Transportation Industry.'' This \nplan contained a 34-point analysis of the industry that endorsed \nmarket-based solutions over government regulation. Much of Mr. Owen's \nplan served as a basis for the ICC Termination Act of 1995, which \nauthorized the replacement of the ICC with the more streamlined STB.\n\n[[Page S867]]\n\n  In his capacity as STB Member, Mr. Owen reviewed and voted on cases \ninvolving complicated antitrust, service, competition, environment, and \nlabor issues, including the three largest railroad mergers in the \nhistory of the United States. These were the 1995 Burlington Northern-\nSanta Fe merger, the 1996 Union Pacific-Southern Pacific merger, and \nthe 1998 CSX-Norfolk Southern-Conrail merger. Mr. Owen's insight, \njudgment, and expertise were key to the Board's successful adjudication \nof these incredibly complex cases.\n  Gus Owen has returned to the private sector and his family in \nCalifornia after an extremely successful four years of public service. \nThe Nation has lost a talented, pragmatic, and respected STB Member, \nwhose work with the transportation industry will have a significant and \nbeneficial impact on that industry and our economy. We take pride in \nhis record and wish him well in his return to private life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/21/senate-section/article/S866-3", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S867-S868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMERICAN STEEL WORKERS CRISIS\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise to address the topic \nof steel imports. The dramatic reduction in the price of imported steel \nposes a significant challenge to America's steel industry. In the first \nten months of 1998 alone (October is the last month for which figures \nare available), Japan more than doubled the level of imports compared \nto their year-end total for all of 1997. Japan's 882,000 net tons \nimported in October appears to be an all-time monthly record. However, \nJapan is not solely responsible for the surge in imports. The total \nOctober 1998 steel import level was the second highest monthly total \never, with over 4.1 million net tons--an increase of 56% over October \n1997 levels.\n  Earlier this month, a representative of the United Steelworkers of \nAmerica union claimed that 5,000 steelworkers had already received \nlayoff notices and another 20,000 were working reduced hours because of \nthese imports. More recent reports indicate the number of laid-off \nworkers is fast approaching 10,000. The American Iron and Steel \nInstitute recently released figures which demonstrate that U.S. \ndomestic steel production had been nearly decimated by the \nunprecedented surge in imports. In November 1998, U.S. steel mills \nshipped approximately 7.4 million net tons. This represents a decrease \nof 12.8% from the roughly 8.5 million net tons shipped the previous \nNovember. Of even more concern is that November 1998 shipments were \ndown 10.6% just from the previous month! And as the import figures \noutlined above indicate, the magnitude of the situation is growing, not \ndiminishing.\n  Mr. President, there are several factors behind this surge in low-\npriced steel imports. First, the general deflationary trends in the \nglobal economy have caused all commodity prices--including steel \nprices--to plummet. In my judgment, the Federal Reserve's tight \nmonetary policy in 1997 and most of 1998 is to blame. While the Fed has \ntaken corrective action to reduce short-term interest rates in recent \nmonths, commodity prices have yet to rebound. Second, the economic \ncrisis in Asia and Russia has forced these countries to rely almost \nexclusively on exports to keep their economies afloat. Given the size \nof our manufacturing sector and our comparatively robust economic \nclimate, the United States is an obvious, attractive export target for \nthese nations. In many instances, the International Monetary Fund is to \nblame because it convinced these countries to either raise interest \nrates or devalue their currencies, which in turn allowed foreign steel \nto undercut American steel prices.\n  Against this macroeconomic backdrop of generally falling prices, some \nforeign steel companies may have engaged in the practice of \n``dumping''--that is, selling steel below the cost of production. While \nwe are eager to offer economic assistance to these struggling \ncountries--and in many cases we have offered direct and indirect \neconomic assistance to them--there is no reason we should have to \ncompromise or ignore our trade laws.\n  So the question that confronts us today is: What do we--the \nAdministration, the Congress--do about this serious problem? The \nAdministration's lack of decisive action reportedly is due to their not \nwanting to risk subjecting the fragile economies in Asia, Russia and \nBrazil to further challenges. However, our willingness to assist our \nallies and trading partners ought not translate into requiring us to \nignore unfair trading practices--and our own trade laws--or deleterious \neffects these practices have on our workers and domestic industry.\n  On the macroeconomic level, the Federal Reserve should focus on \nachieving price stability--and that means addressing deflation as well \nas inflation. The Clinton Administration must take decisive action on \nthis matter quickly. Promising to talk to our trading partners in the \nhope of getting their cooperation in cutting back the import levels is \nnot sufficient at this late date. In the international arena, the \nAdministration must be exert more leadership in arguing against \ncurrency devaluations. In the trade arena, the Administration must take \nfirm action in enforcing our anti-dumping laws.\n  To this end, I have cosponsored S. 61, a bill introduced yesterday by \nSenator DeWine, that would eliminate existing disincentives for fair \ntrade in our trade laws. Specifically, under current trade law, duties \nand fines imposed on those engaged in dumping go directly to the U.S \nTreasury. However, under the DeWine bill, the duties or fines collected \nwould be transferred to the affected industries, not to the U.S. \nTreasury. Therefore, continuation of unfair trade practices would \nresult in the perpetrators of such activities effectively financially \naiding their U.S. competitors.\n  It is important to note that this legislation does not create new \nduties or penalties, nor does it increase existing duties or penalties. \nFrankly, this legislation will not mandate that importers raise the \nprice of steel one single penny, and therefore, it should not directly \naffect the market for underpriced steel. However, in the long run, \nproducers who engage in dumping will have to seriously rethink their \nunfair trade practices. Because by continuing such practices, they only \nsucceed in subsidizing those among our domestic industries that are \nbeing hurt by their illegal actions.\n  Mr. President, the recent surge in imported steel and the resulting \njob loss and scaled back production at U.S. steel plants may be a \ndemonstration that current law does not effectively discourage unfair \ntrade practices such as these. I have long been an ardent supporter of \nfree and open trade. However, my support of free trade is prefaced on \nthe notion that our trading partners will not engage in unfair trading \npractices, such as dumping, and that when our Nation is confronted by \nunfair trading practices, we will seek remedy, whether by invoking \nprovisions in our own trade laws designed to combat such unfair trade \npractices or pursuing means of redress through international trade \ntribunals such as the World Trading Organization.\n  As long as our trade laws prohibit dumping, it is imperative for the \nAdministration to adhere to them and to implement them where and when \nthe circumstances require it. To fail to do so will have consequences, \nboth for American workers and industry and for the principle of free \ntrade that I believe is so important. More and more steel workers may \nbe laid off and steel plants may begin to shut down. Our domestic steel \nindustry, which has done so much over the last two decades to modernize \nand become competitive on an international basis, could become \nirreparably harmed.\n  If things deteriorate, we will see calls for quotas on steel imports. \nWe will also see a political backlash against free trade, just at the \ntime when we should be entering into free trade agreements with some of \nthese very regions--Asia, Pacific Rim, and South America. This will \nonly serve to set us back further from being the dominant player on the \nglobal marketplace in the next century.\n  Finally, let me pay tribute to the individuals and groups that have \ntravelled all the way to Washington, D.C. to attend today's ``Stand Up \nfor Steel'' rally. These people are here to raise our consciousness \nabout the steel import situation. In my office alone, we have already \nreceived an estimated 15,000 letters on this issue. My constituents are \nrightly concerned by the situation. It is my hope that after attending \nthe rally held at the Capitol this afternoon and after learning of\n\n[[Page S868]]\n\nlegislation being introduced by interested Senators, such as S. 61, \nthat these people will return home knowing that we in Congress are not \nignorant of this crisis or of their concern.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/21/senate-section/article/S867-1", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     A TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM B. RUGER\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, on October 29th last year, one of \nNew Hampshire's outstanding citizens, William B. Ruger, Chairman and \nChief Executive Officer, Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc., was honored by \nThe Camp Fire Club of America.\n  The Camp Fire Club of America is one of the most prestigious hunting \nand conservation organizations in the country. Its code of ethics \nstresses that the wildlife of today is not ours to do with as we \nplease, but was given to us in trust for the benefit both of the \npresent and the future. They also believe that it is the duty of every \nperson who finds pleasure in the wilderness or in the pursuit of game \nto actively support the protection of forests and wildlife.\n  The Camp Fire Club awarded its Medal of Honor--its highest tribute--\nto William B. Ruger. This Medal is awarded to ``one person, who in the \njudgment of the Board of Governors, has merited such recognition by his \ncareer or special work in forest or game protection, or along other \nlines which are in accord with the object and aims of the club.''\n  Mr. President, several former recipients of this high honor by The \nCamp Fire Club are: Colonel Theodore Roosevelt in 1910; Carl Rungius, \nthe outstanding painter in 1931; Horace Albright, former Director of \nNational Parks in 1961; and Laurance Rockefeller in 1967.\n  Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to bring to your attention \nthe tribute below, made to Bill Ruger on the occasion of his being \nawarded The Camp Fire Club Medal of Honor.\n\n           Medal of Honor, William B. Ruger, 29 October 1998\n\n       I welcome to this room of honor, five former presidents of \n     Camp Fire seated at the head table, the officers and \n     governors (both past and present), family members, friends \n     and special guests.\n       It is a tradition of the Club at the Board of Governors' \n     meetings to take a moment to remember those who are no longer \n     with us. At such a momentous occasion as this, it is also \n     appropriate to take a moment of silence for all our friends, \n     family and companions that have crossed the Great Divide. You \n     may remain seated.\n       At our formal dinners at the turn of the century, the \n     founder of Camp Fire established several principles which \n     they and we have been unable to uphold. To name a few, they \n     were: no drinking, no smoking, no swearing and no long \n     speeches. I will observe one of these this evening and get \n     right to the matter.\n       The Club through its By-Laws permits the active President \n     to award the Presidential Citation for meritorious service. \n     The Board of Governors has the power to recognize members \n     through the Medal of Valor and the John E. Hammett Award for \n     work in conservation. But it is only the membership of the \n     organization that can bestow our highest expression of \n     admiration. In this particular instance, it began with a \n     whisper over ten years ago, and through the Board of \n     Governors ended in the hands of the entire membership's \n     approval.\n       In 1906, the first Medal of Honor was presented and since \n     that time only 24 recipients have been named. They have \n     experienced many walks of life. To name a few, they have \n     included conservationists, preservationists, a painter, a \n     forester (the country's first), a writer, a bird lover, a \n     Senator, an Olympian, an explorer (Polar), a rifleman, a \n     rider of the Chisholm Trail, Founder of the Boy Scouts and a \n     United States President. They all exemplified the spirit and \n     the fellowship that is Camp Fire today. We honor them because \n     we admire their perseverance, fortitude and courage.\n       Like each of the recipients before him, Mr. William B. \n     Ruger has shown this same fortitude and courage to lead. He \n     has willingly accepted these challenges and leads with \n     dignity. He has the unique ability to explain in a clear \n     manner not only to us, who are supporters, but to opponents \n     the importance of retaining personal freedom and our firearm \n     heritage. He embodies a natural sense of justice and a \n     passion for exploration, not only in the traditional sense \n     but in a business sense as well. Through the various and \n     substantial endowments he has created, he has established a \n     way to train and educate the youth in the importance of \n     personal responsibility, conservation and truth; and at the \n     same time has illuminated the way for us.\n       By his generosity, future generations may enjoy the \n     advantages, benefits and pleasures of the outdoor experience \n     and better understand the importance of wildlife and \n     wilderness protection.\n       His distinguished service to the nation, while visible \n     today, will be more fully appreciated and comprehended in the \n     years to come.\n       The Medal of Honor is paramount in its absolute justice. It \n     is a justice free from all influence whether it be of favor, \n     political or sentimental. It is a symbol of life, of loyalty, \n     of integrity and of self reliance. But most of all it is a \n     badge of inspiration, not only to the one who has the honor \n     to wear it, but for those who gaze upon it.\n       The inscription on the back of this gold medallion reads: \n     ``William B. Ruger--Inventor, Manufacturer, Industrialist--In \n     recognition of his dedication to conservation and the Spirit \n     of Camp Fire--29 October 1998.''\n       As President of The Camp Fire Club of America and \n     representative of the entire membership, it is our great \n     pleasure to bestow upon you the Medal of Honor. \n     Congratulations.\n\n                                The Camp Fire Club of America,\n\n                                                  Scott T.

CUNNINGHAM\n\n Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as the 106th Congress begins its \nlegislative process this week, I want to first take a moment and \nrecognize a very special Mississippian.\n  We have all heard stories about individuals who give generously or \nleave the bulk of their estates to causes and charities that are dear \nto them. This story is yet another example that the kindred American \nspirit is alive and well.\n  Mr. Phillip Cunningham of Tupelo worked hard all his life, doing what \nhe loved to do best--gardening. His profession provided a modest \nliving, but most certainly a rewarding one. Working with his hands in \nthe garden was very important to Mr. Cunningham who, for over 25 years, \nwas a personal gardener for a local Tupelo family, Bill and Doyce Deas. \nIn his ``spare'' time, he was caretaker for the school district. ``I've \nalways been interested in growing things'' was his personal motto.\n  Over the years, Mr. Cunningham accumulated savings. He recognized \nthat a college education is important, and wanted others who shared his \ncalling to have the chance to cultivate their green thumbs. This \nunselfish commitment led to the ultimate establishment of an endowed \nscholarship fund bearing his name--the Cunningham Scholarship Fund--to \ndo just that. His gift of $38,000 will support students at Mississippi \nState University majoring in lawn-care related fields. Here was a \nmodest man who made a significant contribution.\n  Not only was this 85-year-old a skilled gardener with, as some \naffectionately would say, ``the midas touch'', but also a dear friend. \nAccording to Mrs. Deas, he was ``part of the family and a wonderful \nrole model to our children. He enriched our lives in many ways.'' In \nfact, Mrs. Deas' late father's foundation, the L.D. Hancock Foundation, \nwill match the generous gift.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for letting me share this \ninspiring story and pay tribute to this fine gentleman. The landscapes \nhe worked on will ``bear fruit'' for years to come, and so will the \nstudents who benefit from his scholarship. They, too, will \nblossom.\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/21/senate-section/article/S868-2", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}]
