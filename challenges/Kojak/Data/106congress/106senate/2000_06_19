Mr. President, I come to the floor today having arrived \nback in the country in the early morning hours from a trip which I took \nto Colombia this weekend with Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island. I had \nnever been to this country before. In fact, I had never been to South \nAmerica. But I have come to understand, as most Americans do, that what \nis happening in that country thousands of miles away has a direct \nimpact on the quality of life in America.\n  Senator Reed and I spent a little over 2 days there in intense \nmeetings with the President of Colombia, the Secretary of Defense, and \nthe head of the national police. We met with human rights groups.\n  It is hard to imagine, but yesterday we were in the southern reaches \nof Colombia in a province known as Putumayo, which is the major \ncocaine-producing section of South America in Colombia.\n  It was a whirlwind visit but one that I think is timely, because \nthere is a request by the Clinton administration to appropriate over $1 \nbillion for what is known as ``Plan Colombia.'' Plan Colombia is an \neffort by the President of Colombia, Andres Pastrana, to try to take \nthe control of his country away from the guerrillas and the right-wing \nterrorists, and try to put an end to the narcotrafficking.\n  The narcotrafficking out of Colombia is primarily cocaine, but it \nincludes heroin. It is now estimated that Colombia supplies 85 to 95 \npercent of the world's supply of cocaine. How does that affect America? \nI think we all know very well how it affects America.\n  In my home State of Illinois, the prison population has dramatically \nincreased over the last few years at great cost to the taxpayers in an \neffort to reduce drug crime in the streets of my State. That story is \nrepeated over and over in States across the Nation.\n  So what is happening in the jungles of Colombia in the cultivation of \ncocaine has a direct impact on the quality of life in America. That is \nwhy President Pastrana has called for a coordinated effort by the \nUnited States and the European powers as well to bring his country \nunder control and to end the narcotrafficking. It hits quite a \nresounding note with most Americans.\n  You would not imagine what it was like yesterday flying over the \njungles\n\n[[Page S5314]]\n\nof Colombia to look down from a Blackhawk helicopter as a Colombian \ngeneral pointed out to me all of the coca fields that were under \ncultivation in the jungle.\n  If you take a step back, we now have the capacity by satellite to \ntake photographs of Colombia, and we can actually pick out where the \ncocaine fields are located by satellite imagery. When they produce \nthese maps, which I saw over the weekend, you can see provinces such as \nPutumayo that are virtually covered with cocaine production.\n  What is the cocaine production worth to the locals? Some estimate \nthat a given hectare, or 2.2 acres roughly, can produce some 8.6 \nkilograms of cocaine during the course of a year. That involves about \nsix harvests. A kilogram is a little over 2 pounds. So you are \nproducing about 17 pounds of cocaine on each 1 of these hectares.\n\n  What is it worth to the local farmer? He receives about $900 for each \nkilogram. As you multiply it out, you realize it is a profitable \nundertaking for many.\n  Then if you want to understand the true value of the cocaine \neconomics, consider that as it moves up the chain, it becomes more and \nmore expensive. The guerrilla who takes the cocaine out of the fields \nfrom the landowner and the farmer is going to turn around and turn it \ninto coca paste, a rough paste. It is now going to increase the value \nfrom $900 up to over $1,000.\n  The next move is to the trafficker who converts it into the white \npowder, and that will triple the value of it to some $3,000 for 2 \npounds.\n  Now it is headed to the clandestine airstrip where it is going to be \nshipped to the United States, and in that process maybe go through \nMexico, wherever it might be, on its way to the United States. Now it \nis up from $3,000 to $7,500 for 2 pounds. Then it arrives on the \nstreets of Washington, DC, where it can sell for $60,000--2 pounds of \ncocaine.\n  When you look at the economics, you can understand why, starting with \nthe peasant farmer and moving up through the chains of guerrillas, \ntraffickers, and exporters, there is so much money to be made that they \nare willing to take the risk.\n  The World Bank estimated last week that the drug trade in Colombia \ngenerates some $1 billion a year in revenue to the guerrillas. These \nare not people living off the land, as we understand guerrillas. These \nare the folks who are in the narcobusiness big time, and with this \nmoney they can afford to literally create towns, which they have done \nin some of the remote parts of Colombia.\n  The standing joke, I guess, in Colombia is that if you want to know \nhow well the drug lords are doing, take a look at how sophisticated the \ndiscotheque is that they have just created. In one of the towns, one of \nthe most remote jungle areas of Colombia, they created a city and a \ndiscotheque with the most sophisticated sound equipment in the world. \nIt was raided, taken over, and closed down. But it shows you the \ncapacity with the money they have.\n  The question before the United States is, What can we do to address \nthis cultivation of cocaine, as well as the emergence of the guerrilla \ngroups, as well as the right wing terrorist groups who have made \nextortion and kidnapping and narcodrug trafficking a matter of course \nin this Nation?\n  We try to develop these counternarcotic battalions in Colombia that \nwill attack the guerrillas, and go after them and their \nnarcotrafficking. I visited this camp known as Tres Esquinas yesterday \nand saw 2,000 young Colombians who are being trained to be better \nsoldiers and will be able to fight.\n  We have a debate going on as to whether we will send them \nhelicopters. It is a big investment. The Blackhawk helicopter, I am \ntold, runs around $10 million, $11 million, $12 million per helicopter. \nThe so-called Huey helicopters, the older models, are slower, slightly \nsmaller, and less expensive. But they don't believe it is up to the \ntask they need to do in Colombia. We will debate sending the \nhelicopters to support those troops to go after the guerrillas \nsupporting this narcotrafficking that sends cocaine to the United \nStates.\n  We are in this and we are in it big time. I came back from a meeting \nover the weekend, with the impression that we have to sit down at \nseveral levels and say these are the things on which we should insist. \nFirst, accountability from the Colombians. Any dollars sent by the \nUnited States need to be spent for good cause to put an end to this \ndrug trafficking. We need to ask and demand of the Colombian military \nthat they bring in more reform so that they end corruption. \nHistorically, the Colombian army, in many cases, has been in league \nwith the people who are either on the guerrilla side or the right-wing \nterrorist side. That is changing. I am glad to see it is changing. The \nnew general in charge, General Tapias, is bringing reform. It is a move \nin the right direction.\n  The so-called Leahy amendment, named after Senator Pat Leahy of \nVermont, says no money goes to Colombia unless their army shows \nprogress on human rights. I think we should insist on that as part of \nany discussion.\n  In addition, we have to accept the reality that no plan is going to \nwork in Colombia unless it starts with the peasant farmer who is trying \nto grow something on his land to feed his family. Growing the coca \nplant and selling it is profitable. We need to talk about alternative \nagriculture if this is going to work. We talked about the vast expanse \nof Colombia and that challenge. That has to be part of the program.\n  In addition, we need to discuss how we eliminate these coca plants. \nNow we are spraying them. It is called fumigation. This herbicide that \nis sprayed is roughly comparable to one that we are familiar with in \nAmerica known as Roundup. It is a basic chemical. Once it hits the \nleaves of the coca plants, it destroys them. I met yesterday with some \nof the pilots who are on contract with the United States to destroy \nthese coca plants. It is incredible that they can take the satellite \nimagery which tells them where the coca fields are, convert it through \nthe global positioning system into exact coordinates so they can fly at \nnight and spray this herbicide on the coca plants, killing them, by \nspraying within 12 inches. That is the accuracy of the spraying, \neven taking into consideration wind drift. They are fast at work trying \nto do this. Imagine a strip of land that is some 300 miles long and 3 \nmiles wide. That is what we are talking about in this one province, the \nsquare mileage of coca cultivation, how much spraying has to be done to \nkill the plants. Sometimes we have to come back the next year and do it \nagain. The farmer tries to get around it again.\n\n  There is a lot to be done, a lot of investment to be made. Clearly, \nfrom our point of view in the United States, this is something we \nshould take seriously. When we think of the impact of narcotics and \ndrugs on America and what it means to the safety of each one of us in \nour homes and neighborhoods and communities, the fact that those who \nare drug addicts, desperate to buy this drug, will do virtually \nanything, commit any crime, in order to come up with the resources to \nfeed their habit, we can understand why that drug coming out of \nColombia has a direct impact on the United States.\n  Let me talk for a moment about the other side of the equation. It \nwould be naive to believe that this is just a supply side problem, that \nif we eliminate the supply of cocaine and heroin that America will see \nan end to drug crimes. We know better. We know there are alternative \ndrugs currently being developed in America, American-grown products \nthat are competing with the traditional drugs. Methamphetamine was \nstarted in Mexico, went to California, and now has swept the country. \nIn the rural areas of Illinois, in the small town farming areas of \nIllinois, they are discovering these methamphetamine labs that can be \nbuilt with items that are purchased at a local hardware store and can \nbe developed into a drug which is very addictive and destructive.\n  It is important as we look at the narcotics problem in America to \nestablish that it is not only interdiction and elimination of supply we \nneed to address, but also demand. That takes a lot of effort and a \nmyriad of approaches which have been promulgated by this Senate, the \nHouse, and so many different agencies.\n  We should take into consideration the limited opportunity for drug \naddicts in this country to have access to rehabilitation. In other \nwords, if you\n\n[[Page S5315]]\n\nwere a drug addict in this country and decided you were sick and tired \nof this life and wanted to change and wanted to eliminate your \naddiction, would you be able to turn someplace for help? Too many \ntimes, the answer is no. There is no drug rehab available. The addict \nstays on the street. He might have had a conversion at one point and \nwanted to change his life and found there was nowhere to turn.\n  Let me give an illustration. In my home State of Illinois, in 1987, \nabout 500 people were imprisoned in our State prisons for the \npossession of a thimble full of cocaine, a tiny amount of cocaine; \ntoday in the State of Illinois for possession of the same amount of \ncocaine, about a thimble full, we have 9,000 prisoners. In 13 years, it \nwent from 500 prisoners to 9,000. It costs roughly $30,000 a year to \nincarcerate someone in Illinois prisons. We are spending on an annual \nbasis just for those 9,000 prisoners--out of a total prison population \nof 45,000--we are spending about $270 million a year in the State of \nIllinois. That story is repeated in every State in the Nation.\n  When we talk about $1 billion to Colombia for the interdiction of \ndrugs, and it seems like an overwhelming amount, put it in the context \nof what the drugs are doing in America. Remember, too, as I said \nearlier, it is not only the supply side; it is the demand side. In my \nState of Illinois, a person incarcerated for a drug crime serves about \n9 months in prison and then they are out again. Half the people in our \nprison population are released during the course of a year. Those who \nthink we will put them away and throw away the key ought to take a \ncloser look at the statistics. Half the people in prisons are coming \nout each year. Who are they when they come out? We know when they went \nin they were criminals. In the case of addicts, we know they came into \nprison with the drug addiction which led to a crime, which might have \nled to a theft or something worse, a violent crime, and they went into \nprison for the average 9-month incarceration. We also know in my State \nof Illinois, it is very rare, if ever, that the person in the Illinois \nprison system has any opportunity for drug rehab while he is in prison. \nSo he comes in an addict and he leaves an addict. In the meantime, \nthough, he has joined some fraternities of gang members and veteran \ncriminals who told him how to be a better criminal when he goes back on \nthe street.\n\n  That is very shortsighted. What have we achieved? We have brought an \naddict in and released an addict 9 months later to go out and commit \nanother crime. We have to look not only to the supply side of the \nequation and interdiction, but also the demand side: How do we start \nreducing demand in this country for these drugs so we can have a more \npeaceful and just society?\n  I am happy I took the weekend to be in Colombia and to learn first \nhand some of the things we are facing. I certainly hope my colleagues \nwill avail themselves of an opportunity to learn of things that we \nshould be considering as part of a plan with Colombia and as part of \nour effort to reduce this narcotics dependence in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/19/senate-section/article/S5315-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5315-S5316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        LITHUANIAN INDEPENDENCE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am also concerned about another issue \nwhich has become very timely. It is related to recent statements by \nofficials in Russia concerning Russia's view of the Baltic countries. I \nhave a personal interest in this. My mother was born in Lithuania, an \nimmigrant to the United States. Over the course of my public career, I \nhave journeyed to the Baltic countries on several occasions and have \nwitnessed the miracle of independence and democracy coming to \nLithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. This was something that many of us had \nprayed for but never believed would happen in our lifetime; that the \nSoviet empire would come down and that these three countries, which had \nbeen subjugated to the Russians and Soviets in the early forties, would \nhave a chance for their own independence and democracy.\n  In fact, I was able to be there on the day of the first democratic \nelection in Lithuania. My mother was alive at the time, and she and I \ntook great pride that the Lithuanian people had maintained their \ncourage and dignity throughout the years of Soviet occupation and now \nwould be given a chance to have their own country again.\n  I have met with the leaders of these countries. I am particularly \nclose to the President of Lithuania, Valdas Adamkus. The story of Mr. \nAdamkus is amazing. He fought the Nazis in World War II and then fought \nthe Soviets and finally decided he had to escape and came to the United \nStates where he went to school and settled in Chicago, became an \nengineer, went to work for the Environmental Protection Agency, spent a \nlifetime of civil service, receiving awards from Presidents for his \nservice to our country, and then at the time of his retirement \nannounced that he was going to move back to Lithuania at the age of 70 \nand run for President. When Mr. Adamkus came to me and suggested that, \nI thought, well, it is a wonderful dream; surely, it is not going to \nhappen. And he won, much to the surprise of everyone. He is currently \nthe President of Lithuania; he is very popular. He believes, as I do, \nthat the freedom in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia is something that we \nin the West must carefully guard.\n  Those of us who for 50 years protested the Soviet takeover of these \ncountries cannot ignore the fact they are still in a very vulnerable \nposition. Not one of these countries has a standing army or anything \nlike a missile arsenal or anything like a national defense. Yet they \nlook across the borders to their neighbors in Russia and Belarus and \nsee very highly armed situations--and in many cases very threatening.\n  That is why the recent statements by Vladimir Putin, the new \nPresident in Russia, are so troubling. According to the Washington Post \non June 15, Russian President Vladimir Putin made a statement in which \nhe said that fulfilling the aspirations of Estonia, Latvia, and \nLithuania for NATO membership would be a reckless act that removed a \nkey buffer zone and posed a major strategic challenge to Moscow that \ncould, in his words, ``destabilize'' Europe.\n  The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement on June 9 of this \nyear that claimed that Lithuania's forceable annexation in 1940 was \nvoluntary.\n  This is an outrageous rewrite of history. The Soviets were legendary \nfor their rewrites. They would rewrite history and decide that they, in \nfact, had developed an airplane first, an automobile first, all these \naffirmations, and Stalin was, in fact, a benevolent leader and was not \na ruthless dictator. All of these revisions were used to scoff at the \nWest.\n\n  We thought that the end of the Russian empire would be the end of \nrevisionist history. Unfortunately, Mr. Putin and his leadership in \nMoscow are starting to turn back to the same old ways. By the \nstatements that they have made, they have said, if we went forward with \nallowing the Baltic States into NATO, it would be an explicit threat to \nthe sovereignty of Russia. And they also go on to say it could \ndestabilize Europe.\n  Such a threat by the Russian Federation against security in Europe \ncannot go unchallenged, and that is why I come to the Senate floor \ntoday. It is incredible that the Russian President would continue to \ncall the Baltic countries ``buffer States'' that would presumably have \nno say in their own security in the future and could once again be \nsubjugated with impunity. To suggest that the Baltic nations are \nsomehow pawns to be moved back and forth across the board by leaders in \nRussia is totally unacceptable. It is unbelievable that the Russian \nForeign Ministry could forget the secret Molotov-Ribbentrop pact that \ncarved up Eastern Europe between Hitler and Stalin, that moment in time \nwhen the Nazis and Communists in Russia were in alliance, in league \nwith one another, and through respective foreign ministers basically \ngave away countries.\n  At that moment in time, the Baltic States were annexed into the \nSoviet Union against their will, and for more than 50 years we in the \nUnited States protested that. It was the so-called Captive Nations Day \nwe celebrated on Capitol Hill and across America to remember that those \nBaltic States and so many other countries were brought into the Soviet \nempire against their will. Somehow, Mr. Putin in this new century is \nsuggesting that we did not understand history; the Baltic nations \nreally wanted to be part of the Soviet\n\n[[Page S5316]]\n\nUnion. That is a ridiculous statement, and it defies history and defies \nthe facts that everyone knows. It is beyond belief that the Russian \nForeign Minister would claim that the Red Army troops occupying the \nBaltic countries in June of 1940 were not the reason that these \ncountries so-called ``joined'' the Soviet Union. Listen to the \nstatement by the Russian Foreign Minister.\n\n       The August 3, 1940 decision of USSR Supreme Soviet to admit \n     Lithuania into the Soviet Union was preceded by corresponding \n     appeals from the highest representative bodies of the Baltic \n     States.\n       Therefore it would be wrong to interpret Lithuania's \n     admission to the USSR as a result of the latter's unilateral \n     actions. All assertions that Lithuanian was ``occupied'' and \n     ``annexed'' by the Soviet Union and related claims of any \n     kind of neglect, political, historical and legal realities \n     therefore are groundless.\n\n  This is the statement by the Russian Foreign Minister.\n  Let me tell you, he not only ignores the history of 1940 which is \nvery clear, but he ignores the fact that in 1991 the Russian Foreign \nMinistry entered into a treaty with Lithuania in which Russia \nexplicitly admitted that the 1940 Soviet annexation violated Lithuanian \nsovereignty and that Lithuania, they said, at the time was free to \npursue its own security agreements and arrangements. So in 1991, in \nthose enlightened moments as the Soviet empire came down and Russia \nbecame a new State with democratic elections, they entered into a \ntreaty with Lithuania and acknowledged the reality that Lithuania was \nforcibly annexed into the Soviet Union. They said in 1991 Lithuania had \nthe right, as the Baltic States do, to pursue their security \narrangements.\n\n  Now, when Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia talk about membership in \nNATO, the Russian Foreign Minister and Russian President Putin come \nforward and say unacceptably, it would destabilize Europe; it would \neliminate the so-called ``buffer States.'' They still view these \ncountries as vassals, as pawns to be used. They will not acknowledge \nthe sovereignty which should be acknowledged of these countries.\n  These disturbing statements show clearly why the Baltic countries \nmust be admitted to NATO; that is, to show Russia and any neighboring \ncountry that it must give up its territorial ambitions against NATO \nmembership for the Baltic countries, and it would make it critically \nclear that the West would never again accept ``buffer State'' \nsubjugation of them. The idea that the three tiny Baltic States could \nthreaten the enormous and powerful Russian Federation is laughable. If \nRussia has no design on the Baltic States, it has nothing to fear from \ntheir membership in NATO.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/19/senate-section/article/S5316-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5316-S5317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have spoken about the drug problems in \nAmerica and this issue of foreign policy. But there is another issue \nwhich is a continuing concern across America. It is the fact that this \nSenate and Congress have failed to act on the problem in America of gun \nviolence. It has been a little over a year since the Columbine tragedy, \nbut still the leadership in this Congress refuses to enact sensible gun \nsafety legislation.\n  Most will recall that a little over a year ago, we passed in this \nChamber, with the tie breaking vote of Vice President Gore, legislation \nwhich would allow us to do background checks on people who buy guns at \ngun shows. If you go to buy a gun here in America, they are going to \nask some questions: Do you have a history of committing a crime; a \nhistory of violent mental illness; are you old enough to own a gun? \nThat is part of the Brady law. And with that law, we stopped some \n500,000 people from buying guns in America who were, in fact, people \nwith a criminal record or a history of violent and mental illness, or \nchildren. We stopped it--half a million of them--but there is a big \nloophole there. If you go to the so-called gun shows which we have in \nIllinois and States such as Texas and all over the country, these gun \nbazaars and flea markets do not have any background checks. You do not \nhave to be John Dillinger and the greatest criminal mind to understand \nif you need a gun, do not go to a gun dealer, go to a gun show. No \nquestions are asked; you can buy it on the spot.\n\n  We passed a law. We said we have to close this loophole. If we really \nwant to keep guns out of the hands of people who will misuse them, we \nneed a background check at gun shows. That was part of our bill.\n  The second part of the bill related to a provision with which Senator \nKohl from Wisconsin came forward. It said if you sell a handgun in \nAmerica, it should have a child safety protection device, or so-called \ntrigger lock. You have seen them. They look like little padlocks. You \nput them over the trigger so if a child gets his hands on a gun, he or \nshe will not be able to pull the trigger and harm anyone.\n  Is this important? It is critically important. We read every day in \nthe newspapers about kids being harmed, killing their playmates, and \nterrible things occurring when they find a handgun. It is naive for any \ngun owner to believe if they have a gun in the house, they can \nsuccessfully hide a gun. Children are always going to find Christmas \ngifts and guns. We have to acknowledge that as parents. If they find \nChristmas gifts, it is disappointing. If they find guns, it can be \ntragic.\n  Those who say they will not have a gun in their house if they have \nlittle kids may not have peace of mind if they know their playmates' \nparents own guns and do not have a trigger lock on them.\n  We said as a matter of standard safety in America, we want every \nhandgun to be sold with a trigger lock. Is it an inconvenience for the \ngun owner? Yes, let's concede that fact. Do we face inconveniences \nevery day bringing safety to our country and to our lives? Of course we \ndo. Have you gone through an airport lately? Did you have to put that \npurse or that briefcase on the conveyor belt? Did you go through the \nmetal detector? It is inconvenient, isn't it? It slowed you down, \ndidn't it? We all do it because we do not want terrorists on airplanes \nand we want to fly safely.\n  So the idea of a trigger lock on a handgun I do not believe is a \nmajor obstacle to gun ownership or using a gun safely and legally. That \nwas the second part of the bill that passed and went over to the House \nof Representatives.\n  The third part is one that is hardly arguable, and that is, we ban \nthe domestic manufacture of high-capacity ammunition clips in this \ncountry, clips that can hold up to 100 or more bullets. The belief was \nnobody needed them. The only people who would need those would be the \nmilitary or police. The average person has no need for them.\n  I said time and again that if a person needs an assault weapon or \nsome sort of automatic weapon with a 100-round clip to shoot a deer, \nthey ought to stick to fishing. Sadly, there are people who found if \nyou could not manufacture these high-capacity ammo clips in the United \nStates, you could import them from overseas. The third part of our gun \nsafety legislation said we are going to stop the importation of high-\ncapacity ammo clips which are designed to kill people. They have \nnothing to do with legitimate sports or hunting.\n  Three provisions: Background checks at gun shows, trigger locks on \nhandguns when they are sold, and no more importation of high-capacity \nammo clips. Do those sound like radical ideas to you? They do not to \nme. They sound like a commonsense effort to keep guns out of the hands \nof people who would misuse them.\n\n  We barely passed the bill. The National Rifle Association, the gun \nlobby, opposed it. The bill received 49 votes for, 49 votes against. \nVice President Al Gore sat in that chair, as he is entitled under the \nConstitution, and cast the tie-breaking vote--50-49. The bill went to \nthe House of Representatives--this is after Columbine--and with all \nthis determination, we said: We are finally going to do something to \nrespond to gun violence.\n  Of course, when it went over to the House of Representatives, the gun \nlobby, the National Rifle Association, piled it on, and the bill was \ndecimated. There is nothing in it that looks like what I described. \nThen it went to conference. We are supposed to work out differences \nbetween the House and the Senate in conference. They have sat on it for \na year, and every day in America, 12 or 13 children are killed by guns. \nThe same number of kids who died at Columbine die each day, not in one \nplace but all across America. They are kids\n\n[[Page S5317]]\n\nwho commit suicide. They are kids who are gang bangers shooting up \ninnocent people. They are kids who are playing with their playmates.\n  The gun tragedy continues in America, and this Congress refuses to do \nanything. Many of us come to the floor of the Senate on a regular basis \nas a reminder to our colleagues in Congress that this issue will not go \naway because gun violence is not going away, and we need to do \nsomething to make America safer.\n  Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. \nUntil we act, the Democratic leadership in the Senate who supports this \ngun safety legislation will read some names into the Record of those \nwho lost their lives to gun violence in the past year and will continue \nto do so every day the Senate is in session. In the name of those who \nhave died and their families, we will continue this fight.\n  The following are the names of just some of the people killed by \ngunfire 1 year ago on the dates that I mention. On June 19, 1999, these \nwere the gun victims in just some of the States and some of the cities \nacross America:\n  Milton Coleman, 58, Gary, IN; Darnell Green, 28, Gary, IN; Ronald \nHari, 25, Chicago, IL; David Jackson, 23, St. Louis, MO; Andre Johnson, \n24, Detroit, MI; Eien Johnson, 19, Detroit, MI; Nakia Johnson, 22, \nPhiladelphia, PA; Lewis Lackey, 47, Baltimore, MD; Malcolm Mitchell, \nGary, IN; Mann Murphy, 76 Detroit, MI; Robert Rodriguez, 31, Houston \nTX; Donnell Roland, 20, Kansas City, MO; Denise Wojciechowski, 33, \nChicago, IL; an unidentified male, 36, Long Beach, CA; another \nunidentified male, 53, Nashville, TN; another unidentified male, 19, \nNewark, NJ.\n  In addition, since the Senate was not in session on June 17 or June \n18, I ask unanimous consent that the names of those who were killed by \ngunfire last year on June 17 and June 18 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                June 17\n\n       Donald R. Gauldin, Pine Bluff, AR; Phillip Martello, 18, \n     New Orleans, LA; Lee Martindale, 14, St. Louis, MO; Marcus D. \n     Miller, 18, Chicago, IL; Larry Mitchell, 19, Dallas, TX; \n     Raymond Reed, 71, Charleston, SC; Molly Roberts, 15, Houston, \n     TX; Norberto Rodriguez, 26, San Antonio, TX; Philip M. \n     Spears, 51, Houston, TX; and Tony Williams, 19, Chicago, IL.\n\n\n                                June 18\n\n       Warren Cunningham, 33, Charlotte, NC; Barron Howe, 31, \n     Washington, DC; Daniel Metcalf, 31, Washington, DC; Tony \n     Muse, Detroit, MI; Adam W.

Mr. President, the reason these names are being read is \nto share with my colleagues in the Senate the fact that this is not \njust another issue. The issue of gun safety and gun violence in America \nis an ongoing tragedy, a tragedy which we will read about in tomorrow \nmorning's paper and the next morning's paper and every day thereafter \nuntil we in this country come forward with a sensible gun safety policy \nto keep guns out of the hands of those who misuse them.\n  I have seen the National Rifle Association, Mr. Heston, and all of \nhis claims about second amendment rights to the ownership of guns. I \nbelieve people have a right to own guns, so long as they do so safely \nand legally, but I do not believe there is a single right under our \nConstitution--not one--that does not carry with it a responsibility.\n  There is a responsibility on the part of gun owners across America to \nbuy their guns in a way that will keep guns out of the hands of those \nwho would misuse them and to store their guns in a way so they are \nsafely away from children who would use guns and hurt themselves and \nothers, and not to demand guns in America that have no legitimate \nsport, hunting, or self-defense purpose.\n  Most Americans agree with what I have just said. I think it is a \nmajority opinion in this country. It is clearly not the feeling of the \nRepublican leadership in the Senate and the House of Representatives. \nThey have continued to bottle up this legislation which would move us \ncloser to the day when we have a safer society and when families and \ncommunities across America can breathe a sigh of relief that the crime \nstatistics and gun statistics about which we read are continuing to go \ndown and not up.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/19/senate-section/article/S5317-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5317-S5318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the last item I want to address today is \nrelative to a suggestion by the Vice President of the United States to \ncreate what is known as a Medicare lockbox. There have been many \nsuggestions made during the course of this Presidential campaign about \nSocial Security and Medicare. It is no surprise. There are hardly any \nprograms in Washington, DC, that affect so many people and affect the \nquality of life of so many families across America. I am proud to be a \nmember of the Democratic Party which, under Franklin Roosevelt, created \nSocial Security.\n  We took a group of Americans--our parents and grandparents, the \nseniors in America, who were literally one of the most impoverished \nclasses in our society--and said: With Social Security, we will create \nfor you a safety net. With this safety net, when you go into retirement \nin your senior years, you are going to have some peace of mind that you \nwill not be destitute and poor and have to depend on your children for \nyour livelihood.\n  Social Security has worked. It has now become a very bipartisan \nprogram--and it should. Democrats, Republicans, and Independents alike \nunderstand that this safety net for seniors and for disabled people in \nour country really makes America a better place.\n  In the 1960s, President Lyndon Johnson--another Democrat--came up \nwith the idea of Medicare. It was not a new one. President Truman had \nproposed some version of it earlier, and others had talked about it. \nPresident Johnson, with his legislative skill, was able to pass \nMedicare.\n  In Medicare, we said we would create for America a health insurance \nprogram for the elderly. This again was considered socialistic, \nradical, by its critics. They said America does not need this, that \neverything will be just fine.\n  Yet we see what has happened since we introduced and passed the \nMedicare program. Seniors are living longer. They are more independent. \nThey are healthier. They are active. They are leading great lives \nbecause of the combination of Social Security and Medicare.\n  Many of us want to take care that in the midst of any Presidential \ndebate about these two programs, we do not go on any risky escapade \nthat could endanger the life of these programs. There are too many \npeople who depend on them; and not just the seniors, but their children \nwho expect Social Security and Medicare to be there.\n  George W. Bush, the Governor of Texas, and soon to be the Republican \nnominee for President, has proposed changing the Social Security system \nso that there could be a private investment factor so that individuals \ncould direct the investment of some of their Social Security funds into \nprivate investments.\n  On its face, a lot of people who own stocks and mutual funds across \nAmerica would say: Goodness, that gives me a chance to increase the \namount of money I can put into these types of investments. Perhaps if \nthe stock market continues to do well, I will profit from it. It is a \nsurface reaction you might expect that is positive among some American \nfamilies. But the real issue is, how would we come up with the same \nlevel of protection in Social Security if we started taking money out \nand letting people direct it as they care to in their own private \ninvestments?\n  The basic benefits on which many elderly depend for almost all of \ntheir retirement income could be cut by as much as 40 percent. How can \nthat be, if George Bush is only talking about a few percentage points \nof investment?\n  Social Security is a pay-as-you-go program. The amount of money we \ncollect in the payroll taxes goes out to pay today's seniors. When I \nbecome a senior citizen, eligible for Social Security--if I live that \nlong--I will be paid by the current wage earners in the payroll tax \nthat is collected from them.\n  It is a pay-as-you-go system. If at any point in time you want to \nremove some 2 percent, or whatever the number might be, of the money \nthat workers are paying into Social Security, it\n\n[[Page S5318]]\n\nhas a direct impact on today's seniors because they do not have the \npool of money coming in to sustain today's Social Security needs.\n\n  So when there is a proposal made to cut back the amount of \ncontribution by individuals to give them 2 percent of whatever it might \nbe for their own self-directed investment, the obvious question is, Who \nwill pay it? Who will pick up the difference?\n  The basic Social Security benefit is pretty modest across America, \nbut it is important. For workers with a history of average earnings who \nretired in 1999 at age 62--most people retire before they reach the age \nof 62, incidentally--their monthly benefit is $825. For the lower \nearner, the benefit is $501 a month. Despite these modest amounts, \nSocial Security is the major source of retirement income--50 percent or \nmore--for 63 percent of the older population.\n  The whole point of having Social Security is to provide workers with \na predictable retirement benefit.\n  Mr. Bush's plan affects these basic retirement benefits in two ways.\n  First, the program has a long-term deficit of about 2 percent of \npayroll. The deficit isn't Governor Bush's creation, by any means. It \nconfronts anybody attempting to reform the system. But Governor Bush's \nproposal makes the problem worse by pledging not to add any new money \nto the Social Security system.\n  Vice President Gore has said, let's take the surplus and pay down the \nnational debt by paying off the internal debt of Social Security and \nMedicare. We collect $1 billion in taxes a day from businesses, \nfamilies, and individuals to pay interest on our national debt.\n  I think the most responsible thing we can do, in a time of surplus, \nis to take the extra dollars and reduce that debt and reduce the \ninterest we pay and our children will pay for things we did many years \nago. I know that is conservative. It isn't as flashy as proposing tax \ncuts. But I think it is sound. We do not know if these surpluses will \nbe there forever, but as long as they are here, let us pay down the \ndebt of this country. That is the position of President Clinton, Vice \nPresident Gore, and the Democratic side of the aisle.\n  On the other side, from Republican Governor Bush, and many Republican \nleaders, we are told, no, no, no, take this surplus, as it exists, give \ntax cuts to certain people, and change the Social Security system, and \ndo not address the fundamental concern about this $6 trillion national \ndebt we continue to finance on a daily basis to the tune of $1 billion \na day in Federal tax collections.\n  I hope during the course of this debate on reforming Social Security, \nwhether the proposal is from the Democrats or the Republicans, that \nfamilies across America will look long and hard at whether these \nproposals are in fact honest, whether they use real numbers, whether \nthey really affect the future of America in a positive way and can \ncontinue this economic growth we have seen, and whether they are in \nfact the kinds of things which reflect the values of this country.\n  When we take a look at some of the proposals coming from the \ncandidates in the Presidential race, particularly on Governor Bush's \npart, I do not think they meet that test.\n  I am going to close now because I see my colleague from Arkansas has \ncome to the floor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to Senator Lincoln.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/19/senate-section/article/S5318-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5318-S5320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT AND THE SOCIAL SERVICES BLOCK GRANT\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I rise to call attention to the \nneeds of our Nation's seniors. Although Social Security, Medicare \nreform and prescription drugs make daily headlines in newspapers across \nthe country and are the topic of Congressional and Presidential \ndebates, there are two other important programs for seniors which do \nnot receive the media attention they deserve. These two programs are \nthe Older Americans Act and the Social Services Block Grant.\n  As a member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging and a Senator \nrepresenting the State with the highest poverty rate among seniors, I \nwant to reinforce to my colleagues in the Senate the importance of \nthese two programs, which are lifelines to low-income, homebound and \nfrail seniors.\n  First, we need to reauthorize the Older Americans Act. It is our \ncountry's main vehicle for providing a wide range of social services \nand nutrition programs to older men and women. Unfortunately, the Older \nAmericans Act has not been reauthorized since 1995--absolutely \ninexcusable--making this the sixth year without a reauthorization of \nsuch a vital program for our Nation's senior. Because this year marks \nthe 35th anniversary of the Older Americans Act, Congress has a unique \nand timely opportunity to improve the Older Americans Act.\n  If we don't act, we will be sending the wrong message to our Nation's \nseniors. We would be telling them that they are not a priority in this \nNation. This is absolutely the wrong message to be sending to those who \nhelped create this incredible prosperity in our Nation. I say to my \ncolleagues, we can do better. We must do better.\n  The South not only has some of the highest poverty rates among \nseniors, but the South is the home of the majority of seniors in the \ncountry. Here are some statistics that might surprise you: Florida, \nWest Virginia and Arkansas rank among the top five States nationally \nwith the highest percentage of seniors over the age of 55; through \n2020, the South will see an 81 percent increase in its population of \npersons age 65 to 84 years of age; and for people age 85 and over, that \nincrease in the South will be 134 percent--phenomenal in terms of what \nwe will see in the South with elderly individuals dependent on programs \nthat the Older Americans Act provides--and over half of all elderly \nAfrican Americans live in the South.\n  Based on these compelling statistics and the pending ``age wave'' \nthat is coming to the South, the time to act is now. We must update the \nformula used to calculate Older Americans Act funds so Southern states \nreceive their fair share of the funds. Currently, 85 percent of Older \nAmericans Act funds are distributed to States based on 1985 numbers. \nThis is neither fair to southern States nor is it good public policy to \nbe using such outdated information. Without a formula update, States \nlike Arkansas, and other southern States, with greater numbers of \nseniors will continue to be expected to do too much with absolutely too \nlittle.\n  Each year Title III funding provides seniors around the country with \nhot, nutritious meals in senior centers and other congregate settings. \nIn addition, millions of meals are delivered each year to homebound men \nand women who rely on this program not only for nutrition, but for \ncompanionship and human contact which volunteers provide when they \nvisit the person each day. I have made those rounds with constituents, \ndelivering meals on wheels to our seniors in rural areas. It means so \nmuch to have someone bring a nutritous meal and to visit.\n  For many seniors, the only human contact they have each day is with \nthe person who delivers their meals. During extreme weather conditions, \nhome-delivered meal volunteers are able to check on seniors and make \nsure they are not ill or suffering from extreme heat or cold.\n  In Arkansas, we deliver 2 million home meals a year to the elderly \nand provide another 2 million congregate meals. However, many seniors \nare still unable to receive meals. About 1,300 frail, homebound elderly \nmen and women are on waiting lists for home-delivered meals. This \nnumber only represents a fraction of low-income seniors who need meals \nbut can't get them, because those living in rural areas that are not \nserved by programs like Meals on Wheels are not counted for waiting \nlists.\n  Here is a story which was sent to me by an Area Agency on Aging \ncaseworker from Fulton County, AR. She writes about a couple by the \nname of John and Reba.\n\n       John and Reba live in a mobile home near Salem, Arkansas. \n     They started receiving home delivered meals in October 1999. \n     Both of them are physically handicapped and are barely able \n     to get around. John is on oxygen and has severe heart \n     problems. Reba has heart problems and arthritis.\n       At the time they began receiving meals they were physically \n     and financially burdened and didn't know how they would buy\n\n[[Page S5319]]\n\n     food for the next meal. Reba said getting the meals had \n     relieved them from a great burden. She said they can hardly \n     wait each day to get their meals. They really look forward to \n     seeing the volunteer and the van coming to their trailer.\n\n  Here is another story about an Arkansas senior. Mr. Black is 71 years \nold and lives alone in an old farmhouse in an isolated, rural area in \nVan Buren County. In the winter you can feel the wind blow through the \nhouse and in the summer the heat is unbearable. Mr. Black does not have \nany immediate family to check on him. He only has a microwave to cook \nin. He lives on a fixed income and has no transportation to get into \ntown to purchase groceries on a regular basis.\n  Mr. Black said this about the home delivered meals he receives, \n``They help me out a lot. The meals are better than the food I can buy. \nI can't buy much on a fixed income.'' Mr. Black has told his case \nmanager on more than one occasion that he does not know what he would \ndo without the meals. It is a real hardship on him if he misses his \nhome delivered meals. One week he missed all of his home delivered \nmeals because of doctors appointments and it was very difficult for him \nto buy food and prepare meals that week. He just went without.\n  The Title V senior employment program is one of the best kept secrets \nin the country. Through this funding mechanism, older Americans who \nwant to work can go to a senior employment agency in their community \nand learn of available job opportunities.\n  No matter what type of training seniors need to fill these jobs, \ntraining is made available to them. For example, if seniors need \ntraining to work in a modern office environment, they learn how to surf \nthe internet, use computers and send faxes. Nationally, over 61,000 \nseniors a year are employed through senior programs.\n  Some of Arkansas's finest employment programs for seniors are \noperated by Green Thumb and other outstanding Area Agencies on Aging. I \nhave met many older workers and listened to them talk with enthusiasm \nabout their jobs. I only hope that when I'm 75, 80, or 85 I will have \nhalf of their energy and zest for life!\n  The senior employment program is a win-win proposition for both \nsides. Low-income seniors who need additional income to supplement \ntheir Social Security checks have an opportunity to find a job \nplacement and any necessary training through a Title V contractor. This \nnot only generates additional income for seniors but a sense of purpose \nand a chance to stay engaged in their community and make a \ncontribution--something we all want to feel, and that is needed.\n  The community and employers benefit by hiring honest, loyal and \ndependable persons who are committed to showing up for work every day \nand doing a good job. Especially in booming economic times when the job \nmarket is tight, seniors can fill jobs that employers otherwise might \nnot be able to fill. The senior employment program makes good economic \nsense. It also provides for the workers: the quality and guidance of \nseniors who exemplify a tremendous work ethic and bring a lot to the \nworkplace.\n  Here is a remarkable story of a woman from Texarkana, AR, whose life \nwas transformed by the Green Thumb program. Olla Mae Germany came to \nthe Green Thumb program at the age of 65. She had been a victim of \ndomestic violence. She had never worked, could barely read and had \nwalked to the interview. She told the coordinator that she was ``dumb, \nstupid, ugly, ignorant, and no one cared about her.'' During that \nmeeting she also shared her hopes for the future--she wanted to learn \nto read, achieve a GED, gain clerical and computer skills, and get a \njob.\n  Ms. Germany was assigned to the Literacy Council in Texarkana. Her \njob entailed clerical duties and literacy training. After receiving her \nfirst pay check, Ms. Germany told her boss that she bought a new outfit \nfor work and had her hair styled professionally for the first time in \nher life. She was especially pleased that the people in her office \nnoticed her appearance and told her she looked pretty. With increased \nself-esteem she became more confident in her abilities. Only 24 weeks \nafter her Green Thumb enrollment, Ms. Germany learned to read and \nsignificantly improved her office skills. She began making public \nspeeches on behalf of the local literacy council.\n  Today, Ms. Germany continues to work toward self-sufficiency. She has \na new job with a Texarkana agency that promotes neighborhood \nrevitalization and economic development. She is learning new technology \nskills. She is also studying for her GED. Recently, Ms. Germany was \nable to buy her very first car, thanks to the money she has earned from \nher jobs. With new marketable skills, a confident self-image and \ndependable transportation, Ms. Germany is well on her way toward \nachieving her goals for a brighter future and making a contribution to \nher community.\n  I know Democrats and Republicans on the Special Committee on Aging \ndisagree over the allocation of Title V monies. I think groups like \nGreen Thumb have proven their ability to train and place older workers \nsuccessfully in the community and I urge my colleagues to allow the \nnational Title V grantees to continue receiving a majority of Title V \nfunds.\n  The reauthorization of the Older Americans Act will also include a \nnew authorization for the National Family Caregivers Act. I am an \noriginal cosponsor of this bill in the Senate because I believe that \nour country needs to find a better way to support family members who \nserve as caregivers. No one wants to leave their home just because they \nare aging and/or disabled. The inclusion of a National Family \nCaregivers Act is foreward thinking and family friendly. Baby boomers \nneed support to care for their family members and it is high time that \nwe provide Federal leadership in this area of home care.\n  Finally, the other program I will focus on is the Social Services \nBlock Grant, better known by its acronym SSBG. States use SSBG funds to \nsupport programs for both at-risk children and seniors. In Arkansas, a \nsignificant portion of SSBG funds are used to support and operate \nsenior centers, to provide Meals on Wheels for frail, homebound \nelderly, and to provide transportation for seniors, especially those \nliving in rural areas.\n  Over the past five years, Congress has cut SSBG funds by $1 billion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are operating under a consent agreement \nwith the Republican side.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Perhaps the chairman of the Aging Committee will allow \nme 5 additional minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that we extend for our side as \nwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nRepublican side will have 5 additional minutes, and the Democratic side \nwill have 5 additional minutes.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. This year alone, the Senate Labor-HHS Subcommittee on \nAppropriations cut SSBG by $1.1 billion. This translates into a cut of \nnearly two-thirds. Arkansas will lose over $11 million in FY 2001. This \ndraconian cut comes on the heels of a $134 million cut in FY 2000 in \nwhich Arkansas lost $1.3 million.\n\n  What does this dramatic funding loss mean to senior services in my \nhome state? Because Arkansas spends a majority of its SSBG funds on \nsenior services, 40 senior centers around the state may have to shut \ndown or dramatically reduce operating hours. In addition to providing \nsocial activities and hot, nutritious meals to seniors, senior centers \nalso provide seniors with rides to the doctor's office, the pharmacy \nand grocery stores. As one Area Agency on Aging administrator in \nMalvern, Arkansas wrote to me, ``for many of our seniors, the senior \ncenter is their lifeline. It provides them with a reason to get up in \nthe morning.''\n  I would like to read to you what a social services case manager sent \nme about an aging client in northwest Arkansas.\n\n       When Delbert was in his early 50's he suffered a stroke \n     that left him with paralysis on the left side and confined to \n     a wheelchair. He has no children and his only family support \n     comes from a sister and brother-in-law in Atlanta, Georgia. \n     They help him with money management. Case managers and case \n     workers with the Area Agency on Aging helped him find a \n     personal care assistant on a temporary basis through the \n     state's Supplemental Personal Care Program.\n\n[[Page S5320]]\n\n       In the meantime, Delbert applied for and awaited approval \n     from the Alternatives Program for Adults with Physical \n     Disabilities, a state Medicaid program. Once approval came, \n     he received funding and assistance in having his bathroom \n     retrofitted to be handicapped accessible.\n       He was also provided with personal care and housekeeping \n     assistance. Delbert also began to receive home delivered \n     meals. Last October, Delbert celebrated his 65th birthday. \n     Because he was confined to a wheelchair and very isolated and \n     lonely, his doctor prescribed socialization and exercise to \n     combat his depression. Now, every Tuesday and Thursday \n     Delbert rides in a handicap accessible van to the Benton \n     County Senior Services Center where he participates in an \n     exercise program.\n       He now enjoys his newfound friends and enjoys games and \n     other activities at the senior center. Thanks to these aging \n     and disability support services, Delbert lives with dignity \n     and independence. Without this assistance he would, no doubt, \n     have spent the past few years in a long-term care facility at \n     enormous cost to the public.\n\n  If SSBG gets cut severely this year, millions of Meals on Wheels to \nhomebound seniors may not be delivered next year to people who rely on \nthem. States are already scaling back congregate and home delivered \nmeal programs because of last year's Federal funding cuts. Although \nCongress increased Older Americans Act funds for home delivered meals \nby 31% last year, it simultaneously cut the Social Services Block Grant \nand the USDA Nutrition Program for the Elderly, which resulted in a net \nloss of $300,000 in Federal funds to Arkansas. Unless we act, this \nyear's cuts will be even greater.\n  To put the cost of home delivered meals in perspective, the cost of \nproviding home delivered meals to a senior for one year costs about as \nmuch as one day's stay in the hospital for one person. I don't know \nabout you, but I think that is pretty affordable.\n  The irony of the situation is that these draconian cuts to SSBG come \nat a time when our budget is experiencing unprecedented surpluses. That \nis why I respectfully disagree with some of my colleagues who support \nthese crippling SSBG funding cuts. They argue that Governors can offset \nthese cuts with tobacco settlement money or TANF funds, but I think \nthis is unrealistic. Governors are spending most of their tobacco \nsettlement funds on health related initiatives and smoking prevention \nprograms.\n  I supported an amendment during last year's Labor/HHS/Education \nappropriations process to restore funding to the SSBG, although it did \nnot pass. Recently I cosponsored legislation by Senators Graham and \nJeffords to restore SSBG funding. When I was in the House of \nRepresentatives and voted for welfare reform, an agreement was made \nbetween Congress and the states to decrease SSBG from $2.8 billion to \n$2.4 billion until welfare reform was firmly established. In FY 03, \nCongress was to restore funding to the $2.8 billion level. Clearly, \nCongress has not operated in good faith in honoring this agreement.\n  I believe that the Older Americans Act and the Social Services Block \nGrant are vital safety nets for our nation's seniors. I hope the Senate \nwill do the right thing by passing a pro-senior Older Americans Act and \nrestore funds to the Social Services Block Grant.\n  I don't know about my colleagues, but I do know there is not a day \nthat goes by that I don't think of the contribution of an elderly \nperson in my life.\n  I would like to close by reading a quote by Senator Hubert Humphrey \nthat you may be familiar with:\n\n       It was once said that the moral test of government is how \n     that government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the \n     children; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; \n     and those who are in the shadows of life--the sick, the needy \n     and the disabled.\n\n  I think we have a wonderful opportunity to help the young, the old, \nthe sick, the needy and the disabled by restoring the cuts to the \nSocial Services Block Grant and reauthorizing the Older Americans Act.\n  Let's get to work!\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).

Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak on the \nsubject of technology. The message on technology is very simple. \nTechnology is moving fast, but somehow Congress does not pass laws that \nkeep up with the technology. I wish to state the proposition that, from \nthe standpoint of the right to privacy, our laws cannot be left behind. \nEvery day, more and more Americans are waking up to what technology can \ndo to improve their lives. Thanks to the hard work of the American \npeople in the technology sector, we live in an amazing time. Congress \ndidn't bring about this revolution, and Congress should not do anything \nto impede the rapid changes taking place in technology.\n  However, one of the main threats to the growth of electronic commerce \nis the risk of a massive erosion of privacy. While the Internet offers \ntremendous benefits, it also comes with the potential for harm. If we \nlack confidence that our privacy will be protected online, we won't \ntake full advantage of what the Internet has to offer. The Judiciary \nCommittee is now considering a bill to protect the privacy of Internet \nusers. I want to focus on one particular issue, and that is maintaining \nprivacy of personal health information obtained by web sites.\n  I happen to believe, as a matter of basic principle, that information \nabout my health is very personal, and nobody else should know that \nwithout my permission. So I am pleased to join my colleague from New \nJersey, Senator Torricelli, in cosponsoring an amendment on this issue \nbefore the Judiciary Committee. I think it will be up this week, on \nThursday.\n  The amendment Senator Torricelli and I plan to sponsor will give \ncitizens a chance to control any health information that they might \nprovide while surfing the web. None of that will be passed on to others \nwithout their explicit permission. Our amendment simply provides that a \ncommercial web site operator must obtain permission from a person \nbefore sending health information to another entity. In addition, it \nwould require that individuals be told to whom their medical \ninformation will be released if permission is given.\n  I know to people watching this sounds like a pretty simple, \ncommonsense thing, that there would be no dispute and it ought to be \npart of the laws of our country under our Constitution that personal \ninformation not be sold or used by anybody else without the personal \npermission of the person who that medical information is about. It \nsounds pretty simple that it ought to be part of our law. It appears to \nbe such common sense that maybe we should not even have to deal with \nthat; it is just common sense that nobody else should profit from your \npersonal information without telling you about it and without your \npermission.\n  It is only fair--it seems to myself and to Senator Torricelli--to put \nthat burden on the web site operator and not on the consumer. Medical \ninformation can be highly personal, and consumers face serious risk if \nit becomes a public commodity that can be bought and sold without the \nindividual's consent. If that is allowed, then we are all at risk.\n  As far as your own personal information being a public commodity that \ncan be sold--outside the fact that it shouldn't be done without your \npermission, not only to protect your privacy but you ought to know \nabout the information being disseminated and to whom it is going, it is \nalso the fact that personal health information, if it is a commodity, \nis under your personal, private property rights, and they ought to be \nprotected just as personal property rights are protected under our \nConstitution.\n\n[[Page S5321]]\n\n  The Department of Health and Human Services is working on regulations \nto finalize medical privacy rules this summer. I understand that for \nthe most part those rules would set up a mechanism so individuals would \nhave to opt into the procedure of giving permission for their medical \ninformation to be disseminated--opting in meaning that you have to \nactually say, I give permission for my medical information to be used \nin such and such a way, as opposed to kind of an opt-out situation \nwhere your personal medical information will be disseminated unless you \nsay it can't be disseminated. From that standpoint, the Department of \nHealth and Human Services rules, which they say will actually come out \nthis way, will be in agreement with the goals of our amendment. I see \nthe need to allow the process in the Department of Health and Human \nServices to finish.\n  The current draft of our amendment explicitly will not interfere with \nthose rules and the rulemaking process now going on, and it also does \nnot apply to entities subject to those proposed rules, such as health \nplans and providers.\n  Our amendment gets at those commercial health web sites to which the \nprotections of Health and Human Services rules will not apply. But \nhaving said that, our amendment is pending.\n  Having made clear that our amendment does not interfere with the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services rulemaking now going on, I want \nto put President Clinton on notice, if it turns out that the final \nHealth and Human Services rules are inadequate from the standpoint of \nprotecting the personal privacy of health information of individuals, \nhaving this amendment in the bill as a placeholder will provide those \nof us in Congress who are concerned about this issue of privacy of \nmedical health information a vehicle to strengthen the HHS rules \nlegislatively in the future if necessary. There should be ample time \nfor that because realistically we all know that more work will have to \nbe done on Internet privacy before final enactment.\n  Senator Torricelli and I are open to ideas on how to improve the \namendment. But let me make clear that I am adamant on the point that \npeople should have a basic right to control their medical information, \nand to control it from the standpoint of making a separate individual \ndecision as to whether that information can be disseminated--not from \nthe opposite point of view that if they fail to say it can't be used it \ncan be legally disseminated. I believe that very strongly.\n  We all know there are special interests out there that do not agree \nwith us. I happen to think they are wrong. I look forward to having \nthis issue aired fully in the committee. We should protect citizens' \nmost confidential information from those who misuse it. I suppose there \nis a lot of confidential information other than just medical \ninformation about an individual that we ought to be concerned about. \nBut I can't think of anything more personal or that could be more \ndestructive to the individual than medical information.\n  We should also arm our citizens to make a thoughtful and informed \ndecision on how their health information will be used--even educating \nthem about the possibility that because they use the Internet certain \nhealth information about them can be disseminated. I am not so sure \nthat we don't take the use of the Internet and technology so much for \ngranted today that we often don't think about what we are doing and \nwhat we are putting into it about ourselves, and who might be making \nuse of that. It is important for us to be informed about the \npossibilities. Once we have done that, I think the American people can \nbe assured that they can go online without having surrendered their \nprivacy rights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/19/senate-section/article/S5321-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5321-S5323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SECURITY BREACHES AT NATIONAL LABS\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, one of the reasons we have time today is to \ndiscuss the breach of security at the National Laboratories. I want to \naddress that subject for a moment this afternoon.\n  We are all aware of what happened in the last couple of weeks \nregarding the lost computer disks at the Los Alamos National Lab, and \nthe news that those disks have now been found. But the questions remain \nabout what happened to them during the time they were gone--whether or \nnot they were copied and whether or not in any event our National \nLaboratories are, in fact, secure.\n  Let me go back in time to about a year ago when we were debating the \nDefense authorization bill of last year. One of the portions of that \nbill was an amendment that I offered, along with Senators Domenici and \nMurkowski, to create a new semiautonomous agency at the Department of \nEnergy, the Department of Energy Reorganization Act. That was in \nresponse to the recommendation of one of the President's own \ncommissions, a group called the President's Forward Intelligence \nAdvisory Board, or the so-called PFIAB Act.\n  Former Senator Rudman chaired the President's Foreign Intelligence \nAdvisory Board and made some recommendations concerning the creation of \nthis semiautonomous agency in response to the effect of the theft of \nsome of our most sensitive nuclear secrets from the Los Alamos Lab a \nfew years ago.\n  We discovered that the Chinese Government had possession of what \nwere, in effect, the blueprints for some of our Nation's most \nsophisticated nuclear weapons ever built. We didn't know how those \nblueprints were obtained by the Chinese Government, but we believe they \nhad to have been obtained from the Los Alamos nuclear lab. We \ndetermined that we needed to make some changes in security practices at \nthe laboratory.\n  It was believed that a scientist there by the name of Wen Ho Lee had \ntaken charge of these documents and had somehow gotten them to someone \nrepresenting the Chinese Government--a matter that has not yet been \nproven. We wanted to get to the bottom of it, and to make sure there \nwould never again be a security breach at our National Laboratories.\n  By way of background, these National Laboratories, two of them--\nLawrence Livermore and Los Alamos--are technically run by the \nUniversity of California at Berkeley. But they do their weapons work \nunder the auspices of the Department of Energy.\n  The PFIAB reports found that the culture of the laboratories to \npromote good science and develop all of these new technologies relating \nto nuclear weapons was such that it would be very difficult to reform \nfrom within, for either the Department of Energy or the laboratories \nthemselves to put into place the security measures necessary to protect \nthese secrets.\n  As a result, the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board recommended the \ncreation of an autonomous agency, totally separate and apart from the \nDepartment of Energy, under which this work is done, or, at a minimum, \nthe creation of a semiautonomous agency within the Department of Energy \nfor this weapons work to be done. Some called it a stovepipe; in other \nwords, an organization within the Department of Energy that was totally \nenclosed, that would be run by an Under Secretary, and would be very \nmuch focused on security at the labs.\n  The Secretary of Energy, Bill Richardson, didn't like this idea. He \nwanted to remain in charge. On the debate just about a year ago, my \ncolleagues on both the Democrat and Republican sides of the aisle \nconcluded that the President's own Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board \nwas correct, that we should create a semiautonomous agency and take \nthat out of the Secretary's direct control. The Secretary was so much \nopposed, he tried to get the President to veto the bill over that, \nbecause we passed it in the Senate and the House of Representatives \npassed it. It became part of the Defense authorization bill for last \nyear. The President signed the bill, and it became the law.\n  The Secretary continued to fight it, maintaining he should maintain \nthe jurisdiction over this nuclear weapons program, that he could do \nthe job. As a result, the President did not send up the name of this \nUnder Secretary to head this new, semiautonomous agency, and Secretary \nRichardson did not implement the new law. He did virtually nothing to \nsee that the new law was put into place. He kept maintaining that he \nwas in charge and that so\n\n[[Page S5322]]\n\nlong as there was not an Under Secretary, he would still personally be \nin charge.\n  In fact, he testified last October before the Congress that he would \nremain in charge until a new person was put in charge. He specifically \nsaid: The buck stops with me. He said: The President has asked me to \nremain in charge until there is a new Under Secretary, and the \nPresident will hold me accountable, and I intend to be held \naccountable.\n  Senator Fitzgerald asked him a specific question as he said: The buck \nstops with me. Senator Fitzgerald asked the Secretary: If, God forbid, \nthere should be a security breach at one of the laboratories, you would \nassume full responsibility, is that correct? And Secretary Richardson \nsaid: Yes, I will assume full responsibility.\n  Now, that was then and this is now. We know there was not an Under \nSecretary appointed, that Secretary Richardson continued to maintain \ncontrol over the situation, to take the responsibility for it, to \nassure the American people that our weapons labs were safe and secure. \nIn fact, he said last year: I can assure the American people that our \nnuclear laboratories are safe and secure. Because he was in charge.\n  But what we now know is this past April and May, or presumably during \nthat period, sometime in April, at the Los Alamos Nuclear Laboratory, \ntwo hard drive disks containing some very sensitive information \nrelating to both U.S. and other countries' nuclear weapons were taken \nfrom the vault, from a portion of Division X of the nuclear program at \nLos Alamos. They were missing. They were missing for several weeks. \nThey were believed to have been found in the last few days behind a \ncopy machine in Division X. But the FBI has not yet disclosed its \nfindings with respect to how the disks were removed, how they were \nreturned, and what might have happened to them in the interim.\n  The Secretary said he believes an employee was trying to cover up the \nfact that he had the disks and that there is no evidence they have been \ncopied. The fact is there is no evidence either way. It is very \ndifficult for the FBI to determine whether or not these hard drive \ndisks were, in fact, copied. We may know more about that in the next \nseveral days. Whether they were, whether someone also has that \nsensitive information or not, there was still a significant security \nbreach and lapse at the laboratories, revealing that they are still not \nsafe and secure; there are still problems. We have to figure out what \nto do about it.\n  What would happen if that information had been obtained by someone \nelse? In addition to telling that person or country a lot about our \nnuclear weapons and how they work, it would have provided an \nopportunity for them to understand how we intended to dismantle or \ndisable a nuclear weapon because these disks were in the possession of \nthe team we have put in charge of disarming a terrorist nuclear weapon. \nThere is a special kit prepared, and these disks are part of that kit. \nIf we find that there is a nuclear device somewhere in the country, \nthese experts will immediately take that kit to the site and begin to \ntry to dismantle the weapon. The hard drives contain information which \nis helpful to them in determining how to dismantle the weapon. \nObviously, if you have that, you have some ideas about how to prevent \nthe dismantling and how to boobytrap it if you are a terrorist. It is \nan important piece of information.\n  What happened from the time Secretary Richardson maintained he was in \ncharge until now?\n  Finally, last month, the President sent up the name of Gen. John \nGordon to become the Under Secretary and head up this agency. But the \nSenate still hadn't confirmed General Gordon until last month. Why? \nBecause Democrats were still trying to change the underlying law, at \nSecretary Richardson's request.\n  A member of the Senate minority had held up the confirmation vote on \nGeneral Gordon for several weeks, almost a month, trying to get us to \nmake changes in the law that were acceptable to Secretary Richardson. \nIt wasn't until the embarrassment of last week that they finally agreed \nto have a vote. Of course, when we took the vote, his confirmation was \napproved 97-0. Presumably, he is on the job as of today. I have a great \ndeal of confidence in General Gordon, if Secretary Richardson will \nallow him to do his job. That remains the question.\n  I summarize in the following way: It is clear we still have problems \nat our national labs. It is clear that General Gordon and his new \nsemiautonomous agency needs to be allowed to get to the bottom of the \nsituation and to put into place protections that will prevent further \nsecurity breaches at our national labs.\n  I believe Secretary Richardson should step down from his position for \ntwo reasons. First, it was his choice to maintain personal \nresponsibility over this for the last year. We afforded him the \nopportunity to put somebody else in charge. At one point I said to him: \nMr. Secretary, cooperate with us. Let's get an Under Secretary \nnominated and put into place and let that expert run this \nsemiautonomous agency and give him the responsibility for this. \nSecretary Richardson, in effect, said: No, I will remain personally \nresponsible because I want to do it my way.\n  Because he wanted to take personal responsibility, contrary to the \nlaw that had been then signed by the President, and because he said he \nwould accept full responsibility, it seems to me we should now take him \nat his word and allow him to assume full responsibility by taking the \nblame, rather than passing it on to other people.\n  The second reason he should step down is that I don't have confidence \nin him allowing General Gordon to do the job even now. He has ``dual-\nhatted'' several employees in the Department of Energy, asking that \ncurrent people be allowed to fill positions we created under this new \nlaw, positions we intended to be part of this separate, semiautonomous \nagency, not employees of the Department of Energy who would wear two \nhats--their regular Department of Energy hat and fulfill the \nresponsibilities under this new law.\n  We don't think you can do both. Secretary Richardson didn't want to \nhave separate employees. He wants to use his own employees under his \ncontrol, and therefore he has been dual-hatting these employees. To \nthis day, I don't know whether he will allow separate employees to be \nhired, whether he will allow General Gordon to bring his own team, or \nallow him to do the job as he sees fit, or whether Secretary Richardson \nwill continue to maintain the fixation for personal control of the \nsituation. I have no confidence in that. I call for him to step down \nand allow General Gordon to do the job. That is what the law provides. \nThat is why the President signed the law. I think the American people \nwant to know that our nuclear weapons laboratories will be secure. This \nis the only way they will be secure.\n  Finally, I heard a colleague on television yesterday say, back in his \nday, President Bush issued a regulation which changed some of the \nsecurity procedures at the laboratories, as if somehow that had \nsomething to do with what has recently occurred. The point is this: If \nSecretary Richardson was in charge, then he had the full authority to \nchange anything he didn't like, including any directives President Bush \nmay have put into place. But Secretary Richardson's bent is to blame \nother people rather than accept the responsibility himself. So if he \nthought there was something wrong with the way President Bush did it, \nhe could have corrected it since. Remember, he was in charge.\n\n  My purpose here is not just to point the finger at Secretary \nRichardson for political purposes but to say that until he steps aside, \nI don't have any confidence the situation is going to get any better \nbecause he has had a year now to correct the situation, and all he has \nfound time to do is to criticize others when he himself had accepted \nthe responsibility.\n  I am hoping, A, that the FBI will in the next few days get to the \nbottom of it, tell us exactly what occurred, and hopefully be able to \nassure us that no secrets have gone to an unauthorized party; B, that \nthe people responsible for the breach in security will be found and \nwill be properly punished; and, C, that General Gordon will be allowed \nto do his job, as Senator Rudman's commission, the President's advisory \ncommission, and the Congress hoped when we passed the legislation \ncreating his position and this new semiautonomous agency.\n\n[[Page S5323]]\n\n  The American people deserve to know that our most important nuclear \nsecrets can be kept safe and secure. Especially with the terrorist \nthreat that confronts this country, we need to know we can disarm a \nterrorist nuclear weapon if we should ever be faced with that \nparticular kind of threat. We need to know our ability to do it has not \nbeen compromised.\n  For that reason, I hope that the Secretary will step down, that \nGeneral Gordon will be able to do his job, and that from now on our \nnuclear laboratories can operate in a way that protects the vital \ninformation they have been able to develop over these many years.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank particularly the Senator from \nArizona for his very thorough and accurate description of where we are \nand where we have been in terms of our nuclear security, in terms \nspecifically of the Los Alamos matter, and more importantly, of course, \nwhere we are in terms of overall security, which has to be one of the \nmost important things this Government has to do. The Senator is \nprobably one of the more knowledgeable Members in terms of the \nmilitary, in terms of intelligence, so I appreciate that very much.\n  Unfortunately, we have been through this now several times, the \nmatter of having a system upon which we could rely for the security of \nour nuclear arsenal and secure military information. And even though \nthis is a very trying thing we are involved in now, really the overall \nsystem is what is worrisome. If we are having these kinds of \ndifficulties at Los Alamos--there are a number of places in this \ncountry where, of course, we are required to have security--and if we \nhave that notion that there is no more security there than there has \nproven to be, then we have to wonder, of course, about the other \nfacilities in this country which require the same kind of security.\n  I believe, as the Senator mentioned, the real issue is that we went \nthrough this before, not very many months ago. I happen to be on the \nEnergy Committee in which we listened to this a great many times; we \nlistened to the Wen Ho Lee question, and we heard from the Secretary \nthat now we were going to take care of this issue and now you could \nrest assured we would have security.\n\n  The fact is we do not. The fact is that apparently there are some \nvery simple kinds of things that could be done that would have \nalleviated this problem. It is difficult to understand that in a place \nsuch as Los Alamos, where you have secure storage for this kind of \ninformation, as someone said, you have less security than Wal-Mart in \nterms of checking in and out. That is really very scary.\n  So my point is that we really have to take a long look at the system. \nAs the Senator pointed out, Congress established a while back a \nsemiautonomous unit that was to have responsibility for nuclear \nsecurity. The Secretary did not approve of that. The President, despite \nthe fact that he signed it, did not approve it either, and therefore it \nwas never inaugurated; it was never put into place. That raises another \nissue, of course, that is equally troubling to me, and that is that \nthis administration has sort of had the notion that, if we don't agree \nwith what the Congress has done, we simply won't do it, or, if we want \nto do something the Congress doesn't agree with, we will go ahead and \ndo it.\n  That is really troublesome to me in that one of the real benefits of \nfreedom, one of the real benefits of the operation of this country over \nthe years, has been the division of power, the constitutional division \namong the legislative, the executive, and the judiciary. It is so \nvital, and we need to retain it. We find increasing evidence of the \nfact that some of it, of course, is in the closing chapters of this \nadministration, but they are determined that if they don't happen to \nlike what the Congress has done or can do something that Congress will \nnot accept, they go ahead and do it. This is not right. This is really \nvery scary.\n  We have, as you all know, a great many young people who come to visit \nthe Senate, come to visit their Capitol, and I am delighted that they \ndo. People want to see all the buildings, and they want to see the \npeople who are currently filling these offices and in the White House. \nBut the fact is that the Constitution is really the basis for our \nfreedom. That is what other countries do not have, a Constitution and a \nrule of law to carry it out.\n  So when we threaten the division of power, then it really is \nworrisome, and I think we have the great responsibility to make sure \nthat that does not in fact happen. In this instance, I think we have \nhad a pretty patent rejection of the things the Congress has done and \nput into law and that have not, indeed, been implemented.\n  There are a number of important matters, of course, that are before \nus as we enter into what are almost the closing months of this \nCongress. We have accomplished a number of things that are very useful; \nwe have some tax reform, some welfare reform; we have done some things \nfor the military, to strengthen it. There are a number of items, of \ncourse, yet to be done.\n  One of them, of course, that is imperative is the passage of \nappropriations, all of which have to be done before the end of \nSeptember, which is the end of the fiscal year. One of the scary things \nfor the Congress, I believe, again, with this sort of contest sometimes \nwith the executive branch, is if we do not finish these things in time, \nthe President would threaten, of course, as he did before, to shut down \nthe Government and blame the Congress for doing that and use the \nleverage for the budget to be quite different from what the Congress \nwould like it to be. Therefore, we need to move forward.\n  I was in Wyoming this weekend, as I am nearly every weekend. There is \na good deal of concern about regulatory reform, the idea that, first of \nall, we have probably excessive regulation in many places. One of the \nmost current examples, I believe, might be in the area of the price of \ngasoline where, without much consideration of where we were going and \nits result, we have had more regulations to control diesel fuel and \ngasoline, which is at least a part of the reason that gas prices are as \nhigh as they are, the lack of a policy in energy. We have allowed \nourselves to become overly dependent on OPEC and the rest of the world \nby limiting or restricting, through regulation, our access to energy \nthat could be produced in the United States so at least we were not 60-\npercent dependent, as we soon will be, on overseas production.\n  Those are the things with which we ought to be dealing in terms of \nexcessive regulation.\n  One of the ways to fix that is to have a system whereby once the laws \nare passed by the legislature and are implemented by the executive \nbranch through regulation, those regulations should come back to the \nlegislative body to ensure the thrust of the legislation is reflected \nin the regulations.\n  This happens in most States. Most State legislators have an \nopportunity to look at the regulations once they have been drafted to \nensure it reflects the intent of the legislation.\n  We passed a law in 1996 to do that. Unfortunately, it has not worked. \nWe have had 12,000 regulations. Very few have come back because they \nhave to go through OMB to be scanned out, first of all. I believe there \nhas been some effort to change five of them, but none of have been \nchanged because the system does not work.\n  I introduced a bill 3 weeks ago that will give us an opportunity to \nlook at the regulations and accept the responsibility that a \nlegislature has to oversee the implementation of regulations to ensure \nthe laws are carried out properly.\n  We have a responsibility for energy policy. I mentioned that. This \nadministration does not have an energy policy. We have not dealt with \nthe question of how to encourage and, indeed, should\n\n[[Page S5324]]\n\nwe encourage the production of domestic petroleum. We have great \npetroleum reserves in the West and in ANWR. Better ways of exploring \nand producing resources that are more protective of the environment are \nbeing developed. Yet we do not have a policy to do that. We find \nourselves at the mercy of OPEC.\n  We have to deal with the question of coal production. There are ways \nin which we can use that resource and make it more environmentally \nfriendly. We have to recognize that is a main source of electric \nproduction as we find ourselves using more and more electricity and our \ngenerating capacity is not growing, partly because of a lack of an \nenergy policy. Interestingly enough, the problem we are having with \nsecurity also is in the Energy Department. So the Senator's suggestion \nthat perhaps we have some changes there may apply to some other issues \nas well.\n  Many of us are very interested in public land management. In the \nWest, in my State, 50 percent of the State belongs to the Federal \nGovernment. In most States in the West, it is even higher than that. \nNevada is nearly 90 percent federally owned.\n  The people who live there need a way with which to deal with the \nquestion of public land management. I happen to be chairman of the \nSubcommittee on National Parks. Clearly, the goal is to maintain those \nresources. They are great natural resources. They are national \ntreasures.\n  At the same time, as we maintain those facilities and resources they \nought to be available to their owners--the taxpayers--to visit. This \nadministration is seeking to limit access in a number of ways, such as \na nationwide rule automatically designating 40 million acres roadless. \nI have no objection to looking at roadless areas. We have roadless \nareas, and we ought to manage those. It ought to be done on the basis \nof forest plans for each individual forest instead of one plan.\n  I see the Forest Service is proud of all the meetings they have been \nhaving to have input. I attended some of those meetings. The fact is, \npeople have very little information available to them when they go to \nthe meetings and cannot respond. Sometimes they are not asked to \nrespond but only to listen to a broad description of where it is going. \nThere was great discussion in the House about the Antiquities Act which \nis an old law. Theodore Roosevelt used it years ago. Most of us have no \nproblem with the concept that the President can, through Executive \norder, change their lands and change their designation. This is \nlimitless and has been used more over the last few months by this \nadministration than at any time in memory without involvement of the \nlocal people.\n\n  All these things go together. Now we are faced with a proposition to \ntake $1 billion a year to acquire more Federal land without any \nrecognition of the fact that the States in the West are already heavily \nfederally owned.\n  These are some issues about which we need to be talking. My friend on \nthe other side of the aisle in the previous hour was talking about \nSocial Security. He was very critical of the idea of allowing Social \nSecurity payers to take a portion of their Social Security and invest \nit in equities in the marketplace so that the return will be four or \nfive times what it is now.\n  Unfortunately, for young people, such as these pages, when they make \ntheir first dollars, 12.5 percent of it will be put into Social \nSecurity. If things do not change, there is very little chance they \nwill have any benefits for them.\n  How do we change that? Raise taxes? I do not think people are \ninterested in that. We can reduce benefits; I do not think many are \ninterested in that.\n  One alternative is to take those dollars now invested under law in \nGovernment securities and return 1 percent on investment and allow 2 \npercent of the 12 percent to be invested in personal accounts. The \naccount belongs to the payer and will be invested on their behalf as \nthey direct, whether it is in equities, bonds, or a combination of the \ntwo. If they should be unfortunate enough to pass away before they ever \nget the benefits, it will go to their estate.\n  There is great criticism about that on the other side of the aisle \nwithout a good alternative as to how we are going to provide benefits \nfor young Social Security payers as they enter into the program. I \nshould mention, one of the safety factors is that no one over 50 or 55 \nwill be impacted or affected. Their Social Security will not change.\n  These are a few of the things with which we ought to be dealing.\n  Tax relief: We seem to be greatly concerned about what we do with \nexcess money that will appear in this year's budget. Certainly, there \nare some things we ought to do. One of them, of course, is to \nadequately fund Government programs. I understand people have different \nideas about that, but we can do that and there would still be \nsubstantial excess dollars available.\n  The next priority is to make sure Social Security is there and those \nSocial Security dollars are not spent for operations, which is \nsomething we have done over years, until the last couple of years. That \nought to be set aside so it does not happen. We ought to be dealing \nwith Medicare making sure those dollars are set aside as well and not \nspent for operations so those benefits will be available.\n  Frankly--and I realize there are different views and that is what the \nSenate is about--but there are those generally on that side of the \naisle whose idea--and it is legitimate--is that the Federal Government \nought to be spending more, doing more; the Federal Government ought to \nundertake to solve all these problems. I do not happen to agree with \nthat. I happen to think we ought to have a limited Federal Government; \nthat, indeed, we ought to do those things the Federal Government ought \nto be doing, but it should not be involved in all of our lives. That is \nwhat the private sector is for. That is what local governments are for. \nThat is what State governments are for.\n  Of course, that is the philosophical argument with which we are all \nfaced. One of the elements of that is tax relief. We have passed one \ntax relief bill this year. We passed the marriage penalty tax which is \nmore of a fairness issue than anything. It deals with the fact that a \nman and woman, earning a certain amount of money, unmarried pay a \ncertain amount in taxes. These two same people get married, earning the \nsame amount of money and pay more income taxes. It is wrong. We passed \na bill in both Houses. Now we need to make sure the President signs it.\n  The estate tax is another one that takes away over 50 percent of an \nestate above a certain level.\n  We ought to make that more fair. Tax relief is certainly one of the \nthings that we ought to be doing, that we ought to be talking about. \nUnfortunately, what we are faced with now is that we find ourselves in \na position where I think many in the body are more interested in \ncreating issues than they are in finding solutions. We find the same \nissues being brought up time after time after time. For example, my \nfriend again talked about gun control this morning. He talked about \nadditional laws, when the fact is, clearly, what is really important is \nthe enforcement of the laws that we have now.\n  In the Colorado incident, there were 22 laws broken. Do we need more \nlaws? Probably not. What we need to do is enforce them. The General \nAccounting Office did an audit of the effectiveness of the national \ninstant criminal background check. As of September of 1999, the ATF \nheadquarters staff had screened 70,000 denials and concluded that only \n22,000 had merit. Only 1 percent of those denials were ever pursued as \nto if the person trying to buy a gun was, in fact, legally allowed to. \nClearly, that issue has been talked about here. It basically has been \nresolved.\n  We keep talking about the Patients' Bill of Rights. We passed it in \nboth Houses. The question now is whether, when you need an appeal from \nyour HMO, you go to the court or physicians in an appeal position, \nwhether you want to take a year and a half to go to court, or whether \nyou want an automatic and quick response from professionals in the \nmedical profession who say: Yes, do it. That is where we are.\n  You hear in the media that the Senate defeated the Patients' Bill of \nRights. That is not true. The Patients' Bill of Rights has been passed \nby this Congress in both Houses. We need now to put it together. \nIndeed, it is in conference.\n  We find ourselves debating education. We find ourselves having to \npull away from the elementary and secondary\n\n[[Page S5325]]\n\neducation bill in which the Federal Government participates--not \nheavily. The Federal Government's role in funding elementary and \nsecondary education is about 7 percent of the total expenditure. But \nthe argument is whether the decisions are made in Washington as to how \nthat 7 percent is used before it is sent down to the school districts \nor whether we send down the 7 percent and let the States and the school \ndistricts decide, which is what our position is on this side.\n  I spoke at a graduation a couple weeks ago in Chugwater, WY. The \ngraduating class was 12. You can see that is a pretty small school. The \nthings they need in Chugwater, WY, are quite different than what you \nneed in Pittsburgh or Philadelphia or Washington, DC. So if you are \ngoing to really be able to help all different kinds of schools and have \nthe flexibility to do that, clearly, you have to transport those \ndecisions to State and local government.\n  These are some of the things in which we find ourselves involved. I \nam hopeful we can move forward. I do not expect everyone to agree. \nCertainly, that is not why we are here. But we ought to have a system \nwhere, No. 1, after we have dealt with an issue, we can move on to the \nnext issue, and not have it continuously brought up as nongermane \namendments, which is happening all the time. We ought to be able to \nsay, we have a system where we can participate. But we have a system \nthat can hold everything up, which is being used now in not allowing us \nto move forward as we should.\n  As you can imagine, it gets just a little bit nerve-racking from time \nto time when you think of all the things that we could be doing, and \nneed to be doing, but find it difficult to do.\n  Finally, there is something, it seems to me, that would be most \nhelpful if we could do it a little more. We are talking now about the \nreregulation of electricity, trying to make it competitive so there \nwould be better opportunity for people to choose their supplier, so \nthere would be a better opportunity for people to invest in generation, \nand do all those things. But we really have not decided where we want \nto go and where we want to be.\n  One of the things that seems to be difficult for us to do in \ngovernance is, first of all, to decide what we want to accomplish and \nthen talk about how we get there. It sounds like a fairly simple \nroutine, but it is not really happening. It would be good if we could \ndo that, if we could say, for example, in terms of the Patients' Bill \nof Rights: All right, what do we want the result to be? What is our \ngoal? What do we want to accomplish? and see if we could not define \nthat, and then make the rules, make the regulations, pass the laws that \nwould implement that decision. But instead, if we do not have that \nclearly defined, it seems that we continue to go around and around.\n  I am sometimes reminded by children of Alice in Wonderland. She fell \nthrough the hole in the Earth and was lost, and she talked to people to \ntry to get some directions. None of them were very useful. She finally \ncame to the Cheshire cat who was sitting up in a tree at a fork in the \nroad.\n  She said: Mr. Cat, which road should I take?\n  He said: Where do you want to go?\n  She said: I don't know.\n  He said: Then it doesn't make any difference which road you take.\n  That is kind of where we are in some of the things we do. In any \nevent, we are going to make some progress. I hope that we move forward \nand get our appropriations finished. I hope we can do something on \nnational security. We need to have a system that works to decide what \nit is we want to accomplish, how we best accomplish that, and put it \ninto place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/19/senate-section/article/S5325-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--AMENDMENT TO S. 2549\n\n  Mr. THOMAS.

Madam President, I would like to highlight the work of \nCongressman Steve Kuykendall concerning this important amendment to the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001. His tireless \nefforts over the past several months ensured this legislation was not \nonly included in the chairman's mark during the House Armed Services \nCommittee markup of H.R. 4205, but also that it remained unchanged \nduring the debate on the House floor. Although I am confident that we \ncould have resolved this issue in conference, there is always some risk \nwhen the House and Senate do not have identical legislation provisions. \nAs a thorough legislator unwilling to take this risk, Mr. Kuykendall \nimmediately sought my assistance after the House had acted on the bill \nto include the proposal in the Senate's defense authorization \nlegislation. By ensuring that the land-for-building swap language is \nincluded in both the House and Senate authorization bills, Mr. \nKuykendall has guaranteed that this innovative solution will appear in \nthe final defense authorization legislation sent to the President for \nsignature. I was glad to work with my colleague from the house to \ninclude his language in our bill, and appreciate Senator Feinstein's \nsupport on this effort.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, this amendment would authorize the \nSecretary of the Air Force to convey a fair market value of \napproximately 110 acres at the Los Angeles Air Force Base. I believe \nthis amendment has been cleared.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This amendment provides for reports on the progress of the \nFederal Government in developing information assurance strategies. I \nbelieve this has also been cleared.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3471) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3472\n\n (Purpose: To reform Government information security by strengthening \n   information security practices throughout the Federal Government)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for Mr. Thompson, \n     for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Cleland, Mr. \n     Helms, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Abraham, and Ms. Collins, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 3472.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself as chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee and Senator \nLieberman, the committee's ranking minority member. This amendment \ndeals with the important issue of information security at the \nDepartment of Defense and other Federal agencies. The amendment is \nessentially the same as S. 1993, a bill reported by our committee this \npast April.\n  Senator Lieberman and I introduced the original S. 1993 last November \nas the result of the considerable time spent by the Governmental \nAffairs Committee last Congress examining the state of Federal \ngovernment information systems. Numerous Governmental Affairs Committee \nhearings and General Accounting Office reports uncovered and identified \nsystemic failures of government information systems which highlighted \nour nation's vulnerability to computer attacks--from international and \ndomestic terrorists to crime rings to everyday hackers.\n  Report after report, agency after agency, we learned that our \nnation's underlying information infrastructure is riddled with \nvulnerabilities which represent severe security flaws and risks to our \nnational security, public safety and personal privacy.\n  In fact, GAO believes the problems in the government's information \ntechnology systems to be so severe that it has put government-wide \ninformation security on its list of ``high-risk'' government programs--\nprograms which are most vulnerable to waste, fraud, abuse and \nmismanagement.\n  For example, GAO told us:\n  That unknown and unauthorized individuals were gaining access to \nhighly sensitive unclassified information at the Department of Defense;\n  That weaknesses in IRS computer security controls continue to place \nIRS systems and taxpayer data ``at serious risk to both internal and \nexternal attack'';\n  That ``pervasive, serious weaknesses jeopardize State Department \noperations'';\n  That ``many NASA mission-critical systems face serious risks'';\n  That flight safety is jeopardized by weak computer security practices \nat FAA; and\n  That, based on the most recent review of the government's 24 largest \nagencies, computer security weaknesses place critical government \noperations, such as national defense, tax collection, law enforcement \nand benefit distribution, at risk.\n  At our hearings, we learned from the Director of Central \nIntelligence, George Tenet, that information warfare or cyberterrorism \nhas the potential to deal a crippling blow to our national security if \nstrong measures are not taken to counter it. Potential threats range \nfrom national intelligence and military organizations, terrorists, \ncriminals, industrial competitors, hackers, and disgruntled or disloyal \ninsiders.\n  Director Tenet stated that several countries, including Russia and \nChina, have government-sponsored information warfare programs with both \noffensive and defensive applications. These countries see information \nwarfare as a way of leveling the playing field against a stronger \nmilitary power, such as the U.S.\n  We learned from the Director of the National Security Agency, General \nMinihan, that severe deficiencies exist in our ability to respond to a \ncoordinated attack on our national infrastructure and information \nsystems.\n  We heard from agents of the Social Security Administration's Office \nof Inspector General who described how computer crimes were committed \nby SSA employees. This demonstrated the danger of the ``inside threat'' \nto agencies that do not adequately monitor and limit access to computer \ninformation by their own employees.\n  And finally, we heard from reformed hacker, Kevin Mitnick, and \nlearned of his ability to crack into systems without ever touching a \ncomputer. He told us that, even if we did everything else right, \nwithout strong personnel security, nothing is safe. He described how he \nsuccessfully tricked the employees of a multi-national company into \ngiving him pass codes to the company's security access devices. He said \n``The human side of computer security is easily exploited and \nconstantly overlooked.''\n\n  And, yet, even with evidence from all of these various experts on how \ninformation systems should be managed to prevent against attacks, year \nafter year, we continue to receive reports detailing significant \nsecurity breaches at Federal agencies.\n  The one thing that came through loud and clear is that at the core of \nthe government problems is the absence of effective management. GAO \ntold us ``Poor security program planning and management continue to be \nfundamental problems . . . What needs to emerge is a coordinated and \ncomprehensive management strategy.''\n  To identify potential management solutions, we asked GAO to study the \nmanagement practices of organizations known for their superior security \nprograms. When GAO looked at eight organizations--most of which were \nprivate companies--GAO found that these organizations implemented \ninformation security policies on an ongoing basis through a coordinated \nmanagement framework.\n  Agencies clearly must do more than establish programs and set \nmanagement goals--agencies and the people responsible for managing \ninformation\n\n[[Page S5331]]\n\nsystems in those agencies must be held accountable for their actions.\n  That is what Senator Lieberman and I intend with this amendment. The \nprimary objective of the amendment is to address the management \nchallenges associated with operating in the current interdependent \ncomputing environment. It will provide a coordinated and comprehensive \nmanagement approach to protecting information.\n  For example, the bill would:\n  Vest overall government accountability within the highest levels of \nthe Executive Branch [Deputy Director for Management at the Office of \nManagement and Budget];\n  Create specific management rules for agency heads, such as requiring \nagency-wide security programs;\n  Require agencies to have an annual independent evaluation of their \ninformation security programs and practices;\n  Focus on the importance of training programs and government-wide \nincident response handling.\n  Our amendment reflects changes made to S. 1993 based on comments \nreceived from our colleagues in the Senate and working with the \nDepartment of Defense and others in the intelligence community, the \nOffice of Management and Budget, the agency Inspectors General, and \nindustry.\n  We urge support of our amendment and believe that, through continued \nvigorous oversight, we will drive the Federal government to focus on \nimproving its computer security deficiencies. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to ensure that government information technology \nsystems are secure and that the information within those systems is \nprotected from further attacks.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I want to thank Chairman Warner and \nRanking Member Levin for their foresight in accepting the amended text \nof S. 1993, the Government Information Security Act, which was \nunanimously reported out of the Government Affairs Committee.\n  We are now far enough into the digital age to understand both its \npromise and its pitfalls. Our booming economy is driven in large part \nby the dot.com entrepreneurs who are providing goods and services \nfaster and more cost-effectively than ever before in our history. But \nwe are also experiencing threats to our privacy, to the integrity of \nour digitized information, and even to our ability to use our computers \nfreely.\n  We know there will be trade-offs for the benefits government will \nreap in the digital age. But, I offer this sincere warning now: \ninformation security cannot be one of them. With this amendment, we \nwould lay the groundwork for securing much of the government's \nelectronic information. Above all else, protecting the integrity, the \navailability and the confidentiality of information stored on federal \ncomputers is central to serving taxpayers in the digital age. And we \nmust be vigilant about it.\n  Like the rest of the nation, the government is ever more dependent on \nautomated information systems to store information and perform tasks. \nAt hearings before the Government Affairs Committee last Congress, \nhowever, witnesses testified that such increased reliance has not been \nmet by an equivalent strengthening of the security of those systems. It \nis chilling to think of less than perfect security in the context, for \nexample, of tax and wage information the Internet Revenue Service \nmaintains, troop movements monitored by the Defense Department, or \npublic health threats analyzed by the Centers of Disease Control. \nWithout proper security, government's dependence on computers would \nexpose to exploitation all of this information--and much more.\n  Indeed, some of this information may be in jeopardy right now. A \nseries of General Accounting Office (GAO) studies found government \ncomputer security so lax that GAO put the entire apparatus on its list \nof ``high risk'' government programs. GAO reported in September 1998 \nthat inadequate controls over information systems at the Veterans \nAdministration exposed many of its service delivery and management \nsystems to disruption or misuse. In May 1998, the GAO gained \nunauthorized access to State Department networks, enabling the GAO, had \nit tried, to modify, delete or download data and shut down services. In \nMay 1999, GAO reported that one of its test teams gained access to \nmission critical computer systems at NASA, which would have allowed the \nteam to control spacecraft or alter scientific data returned from \nspace.\n  Our problem is not simply a technical one. It is also a cultural one. \nThe federal government can purchase and implement the most advanced \nsecurity programs it can afford but unless top government officials \nacknowledge that our future depends on information security, those \nprograms will be meaningless. But even high-level attention to and \nresponsibility for security will mean little unless everyone and anyone \nwho uses a computer--which, these days, must include practically every \ngovernment worker--does their part to ensure the security of the system \non which they work. This amendment, therefore, focuses on good \nmanagement practices to ensure secure government information systems.\n\n  Had this amendment been in place earlier this year when the ``Love \nBug'' and successive, mutating viruses wreaked havoc on the world's \ncomputers, government would have been better prepared to withstand the \nattack. I hope that government employees would have been more aware of \nthe need to upgrade their systems' security software to ensure that \nsuch ``worms,'' as they are called, were barred from the system. And \nthis amendment's training provisions would have helped to ensure that \nemployees were versed in the dangers of opening attachments from \nunknown senders.\n  The cornerstone of this amendment is the plan each agency must \ndevelop to protect sensitive federal information systems. Agency chief \ninformation officers (CIOs) would be responsible for developing and \nimplementing the security programs, which must undergo annual \nevaluations and be subject to the approval of the Office of Management \nand Budget (OMB).\n  Because we need to change our cultural attitudes toward information \nsecurity, the OMB also would be responsible for establishing \ngovernment-wide policies promoting security as a central part of each \nagency's operation. And we intend to hold agency heads accountable for \nimplementing those policies. This amendment requires high-level \naccountability for the management of agency systems beginning with the \nDirector of OMB and agency heads. Each agency's plan must reflect an \nunderstanding that computer security is an integral part of the \ndevelopment process for any new system. Agencies now tend to develop a \nsystem and consider security issues only as the system is about to go \nonline.\n  This amendment establishes an ongoing, periodic reporting, testing \nand evaluation process to gauge the effectiveness of agencies' policies \nand procedures. This would be accomplished through reviews of agency \nbudgets, program performance and financial management. And the \namendment requires an independent, annual evaluation of all information \nsecurity practices and programs to be conducted by the agency's \nInspector General, GAO or an independent external auditor. I hope that \nthe IGs will use their limited resources wisely and use their \ndiscretion in targeting those areas of their agencies' programs which \nrequire the most attention. In addition, I hope that agency heads will \nwork with their IGs, especially when it comes to sharing information on \npotential threats to agencies' systems.\n  Our amendment requires that agencies report unauthorized intrusions \ninto government systems. GSA currently has a program for reporting and \nresponding to such incidents. The amendment requires agencies to use \nthis reporting and monitoring system.\n  The amendment requires that the national security and classified \nsystems adhere to the same management structure as every other \ngovernment system under our bill. This means they must develop a plan \naddressing security upgrades, although the plan need not be approved \nby OMB. To address particular concerns raised by the defense and \nintelligence communities, the amendment allows the heads of agencies \nwith national security and classified systems to designate their own \nindependent evaluators in the interest of protecting sensitive \ninformation and system vulnerabilities. And the Secretary of Defense, \nthe Director of Central Intelligence, and other agency heads, as \ndesignated by the President, may develop their own procedures for\n\n[[Page S5332]]\n\ndetecting, reporting and responding to security incidents.\n\n  Finally, President Clinton has proposed a very creative idea known as \nthe Federal Cyber Service designed to strengthen the government's cadre \nof information security professionals. Our amendment authorizes this \nprogram and gives agencies the flexibility they need to implement it. \nThe program includes scholarships in exchange for government service, \nretraining computer information specialists and, as part of our \ncampaign to influence cultural behavior, proposals to promote cyber-\nsecurity awareness among Federal workers and high school and secondary \nschool students.\n  Since Senator Thompson and I introduced S. 1993 last November, we \nhave worked closely with the Administration, the Department of Defense, \nthe National Security Agency, the Department of Energy, the CIO \nCouncil, the Inspector General community, and interested parties \noutside government. We have made changes to address the concerns that \nhave been raised and I am very pleased that the administration strongly \nsupports the provisions.\n  Witnesses testifying at the Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on \nS. 1993 were also very supportive of the bill. Jack Brock, Director of \nGAO's Governmentwide and Defense Information Systems Group in the \nAccounting and Information Management Division testified that ``the \nbill, in fact, incorporates the basic tenets of good security \nmanagement found in our report on security practices of leading \norganizations. . . . '' He also said that ``the key to this process is \nrecognizing that information security is not a technical matter of \nlocking down systems, but rather a management problem. . . . Thus, it \nis highly appropriate that S. 1993 requires a risk management approach \nthat incorporates these elements.''\n  Roberta Gross, the Inspector General at the National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration testified that ``. . . S. 1993 is a very positive \nstep in highlighting the importance of centralized oversight and \ncoordination in responding to risks and threats to IT [information \ntechnology] security.'' S. 1993 ``. . . importantly recognizes that IT \nsecurity is one of the most important issues in shaping future Federal \nplanning and investment . . . the Act makes it clear that each agency \nmust be far more vigilant and involved than current practices.''\n  Another witness, James Adams, Chief Executive Officer of Defense, a \nsecurity consulting firm, testified that S. 1993 is ``. . . thoughtful \nand badly needed legislation . . .'' which ``. . . takes a crucial step \nforward.'' Ken Watson of Cisco Systems noted hat S. 1993 is consistent \nwith what industry has already been encouraging, that is that ``. . . \nsecurity must be promoted as an integral component of each agency's \nbusiness operations, and information technology security training is \nessential. . . .''\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that, if enacted, this amendment will \nimprove our computer security to the point where the operations of \ngovernment in the digital age are performed with the privacy and well-\nbeing of the American public in mind. Again, I am pleased the \nleadership of the Armed Services Committee has accepted this amendment \nbecause, in the digital age, there is no such thing as moving too \nquickly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3472) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I believe we will proceed in accordance \nwith the order.\n  Madam President, I rise this afternoon--14 days since the Senate \nfirst turned to consideration of the Fiscal Year 2001 Defense \nAuthorization Bill--to, once again, emphasize the importance of the \nSenate passing this critical legislation. Our troops deployed around \nthe world, many in harm's way, their families here at home, and all \nthose who have answered the call to duty before them are waiting on the \nSenate to act.\n  Since June 6 when the Senate first began consideration of the Defense \nAuthorization bill we have had productive debate and dialogue. The \nSenate has spent four days debating and voting on this legislation, and \nthe Committee has done a great deal of work during the ``down time''--\nwhen the Senate was considering various appropriations bills--in \nclearing many of the amendments that are in order on the authorization \nbill. We now have a Unanimous Consent agreement for the next day and a \nhalf to deal with several pending amendments. In my view, there is \nperhaps an additional day's worth of debate and votes on the remaining \namendments which we believe will be offered to this bill. I urge my \ncolleagues to work with the Committee on any remaining amendments so \nthat we can pass this bill in the Senate and send a strong signal of \nsupport to our troops.\n  Mr. President, I think it is useful to remind my colleagues of the \namount of hard work that goes into the annual defense authorization \nbill. This year alone, the Armed Services Committee has conducted 50 \nhearings related to the defense budget, and spent four days--15 hours--\nin marking up the bill which is before the Senate.\n  This bill, which we reported out of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee on May 12th with bipartisan support, is a good bill which \nwill have a positive impact on our nation's security, and on the \nwelfare of the men and women of the Armed Forces and their families. It \nis a fair bill. It provides a $4.5 billion increase in defense \nspending--consistent with the congressional budget resolution. But, the \nreal beneficiaries of this legislation are our servicemen and women who \nwill not only have better tools and equipment to do their jobs, but an \nenhanced quality of life for themselves and their families. We must \nshow our support for these brave men and women all of whom make great \nsacrifices for our country and many of whom are in harm's way on a \ndaily basis by passing this important legislation.\n  I am privileged to have been associated with the Senate Armed \nServices Committee and the development of a defense authorization bill \nevery year of my modest career here in the Senate--a career quickly \napproaching 22 years. The Senate has passed a defense authorization \nbill each and everyone of those years. In fact, the Senate has passed a \ndefense authorization bill each year since 1961--since the beginning of \nthe current authorization process. This year, the House passed its \nversion of the defense authorization bill by an overwhelming vote of \n353-63. It is now the Senate's duty to fulfill its responsibilities on \nthis important legislation.\n  But our responsibility to consider and pass the annual defense \nauthorization bill goes beyond statutory requirements and historical \nprecedent. We must also be aware of the importance of this measure to \nour men and women in uniform around the world.\n  U.S. military forces are involved in overseas deployments at an \nunprecedented rate. Currently, our troops are involved in over 10 \ncontingency operations around the globe. Over the past decade, our \nactive duty manpower has been reduced by nearly a third, active Army \ndivisions have been reduced by almost 50 percent, and the number of \nNavy ships has been reduced from 567 to 316. During this same period, \nour troops have been involved in 50 military operations worldwide. By \ncomparison, from the end of the Vietnam War in 1975 until 1989, U.S. \nmilitary forces were engaged in only 20 such military deployments.\n  In an all-volunteer force, where increasing deployments and \noperations challenge the capabilities of our military to effectively \nmeet those commitments, as well as challenge the efforts of our \nmilitary to recruit and retain quality military personnel, we must \nembrace every opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to our military \npersonnel. The National Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 2001 \nsends this important message.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to make my colleagues \nwell aware of the impact of NOT passing The National Defense \nAuthorization Bill for Fiscal Year 2001.\n  With respect to personnel policy, the committee included legislation \nin the defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2001 to continue to \nsupport initiatives to address critical recruiting and retention \nshortfalls. In this regard, the committee increased compensation\n\n[[Page S5333]]\n\nbenefits and focused on improving military health care for our active \nduty and retired personnel and their families.\n  Without this bill, there will be:\n  No extension of TRICARE benefits to active duty family members in \nremote locations;\n  No elimination of health care co-pays for active duty family members \nin TRICARE Prime;\n  No Thrift Savings Plan for military personnel;\n  No stipend for military families to eliminate their need to rely on \nfood stamps McCain amendment);\n  No five year pilot program to permit the Army to test several \ninnovative approaches to recruiting; and\n  No transit pass benefit for Defense Department commuters in the \nWashington area.\n  Without this bill, almost every bonus and special pay incentive \ndesigned to recruit and retain service members will expire December 31, \n2000, including:\n  Special pay for health professionals in critically short wartime \nspecialities;\n  Special pay for nuclear-qualified officers who extend their service \ncommitment;\n  Aviation officer retention bonus;\n  Nuclear accession bonus;\n  Nuclear career annual incentive bonus;\n  Selected Reserve enlistment bonus;\n  Selected Reserve re-enlistment bonus;\n  Special pay for service members assigned to high priority reserve \nunits;\n  Selected Reserve affiliation bonus;\n  Ready Reserve enlistment and re-enlistment bonuses;\n  Loan repayment program for health professionals who serve in the \nSelected Reserve;\n  Nurse officer candidate accession program;\n  Accession bonus for registered nurses;\n  Incentive pay for nurse anesthetists;\n  Re-enlistment bonus for active duty personnel;\n  Enlistment bonus for critical active duty specialities; and\n  Army enlistment bonuses and the extension of this bonus to the other \nservices.\n  And, Mr. President, without this bill, the Congress will not meet \nit's commitment to our miliary retirees and their families to provide a \ncomprehensive lifetime health care benefit, including full pharmacy \nservices. Without this bill, military health care system benefits will \ncontinue to be denied to retirees and their dependents who reach age 65 \nand become Medicare eligible. Military beneficiaries will lose the \nearned military health care benefit that this bill finally restores to \nthem.\n\n  The committee has carefully studied the recruiting and retention \nproblems in our military. We have worked hard to develop this package \nto increase compensation and benefits. We believe it will go a long way \nto recruit new servicemembers and to provide the necessary incentives \nto retain mid-career personnel who are critical to the force.\n  Mr. President, on many occasions I have shared my concerns about the \nthreats posed to our military personnel and our citizens, both at home \nand abroad, by weapons of mass destruction: chemical, biological, \nradiological and cyber warfare. Whether these weapons are used on the \nbattlefield or by a terrorist within the United States, we, as a \nnation, must be prepared.\n  Without this bill, efforts by the committee to continue to ensure \nthat the DOD is adequately funded and structured to deter and defeat \nthe efforts of those intent on using weapons of mass destruction or \nmass disruption would not be implemented. Efforts that would not go \nforward without this bill include:\n  Establishing a single point of contact for overall policy and \nbudgeting oversight of the DOD activities for combating terrorism;\n  Fully deploying 32 WMD-CST (formerly RAID) teams by the end of fiscal \nyear 2001;\n  Establishing an Information Security Scholarship Program to encourage \nthe recruitment and retention of Department of Defense personnel with \ncomputer and network security skills; and\n  Creating an Institute for Defense Computer Security and Information \nProtection to conduct research and critical technology development and \nto facilitate the exchange of information between the government and \nthe private sector.\n  Mr. President, I would like to briefly highlight some of the other \nmajor initiatives in this bill that would be at risk without the \ndefense authorization bill:\n  Without this bill, multi-year, cost-saving spending authority for the \nBradley Fighting Vehicle and UH-60 ``Blackhawk'' helicopter would \ncease.\n  Without this bill, there would not be a block buy for Virginia Class \nsubmarines. Without the block buy, there would be fewer opportunities \nto save taxpayer dollars by buying components--in a cost-effective \nmanner--for the submarines.\n  All military construction projects require both authorization as well \nas appropriations. Without this bill, over 360 military construction \nprojects and 25 housing projects involving hundreds of critical family \nhousing units would not be started.\n  The Military Housing Privatization Initiative would expire in \nFebruary 2001. Without this bill, the program would not be extended for \nan additional three years, as planned. The military services would not \nbe able to privatize thousands of housing units and correct a serious \nhousing shortage within the Department of Defense.\n  Mr. President, it has been said that, ``Example is the best General \nOrder.'' The Senate needs to take charge, move out, and pass the \nNational Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 2001. This \nlegislation is important to the nation and to demonstrate to the men \nand women in uniform, their families and those who have gone before \nthem, our current and continuing support and commitment to them on \nbehalf of a grateful nation.\n\n\n                         Military Installations\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. First, I would like to thank Senator Warner and \nSenator Levin for their continued leadership on the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. Your efforts have helped reverse fourteen \nconsecutive years of real decline in defense spending--a decline that \nhas affected all aspects of our military, from morale to readiness. Our \ntroops and our Nation are grateful for your leadership in stopping this \ndecline.\n  I would like to take a moment to engage the chairman in a colloquy on \none particular area within this bill--military construction.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator for his kind words and would be glad \nto indulge him in a colloquy on this subject.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Of course, we are all appreciative of what the \ncommittee has done for our bases across the Nation. As the chairman \nknows, Georgia has a proud military tradition. Currently it is home to \nthirteen military installations representing all branches of our \nmilitary and housing some of our armed service's most vital missions. \nAs is the case at military installations across the country most of the \nbases in Georgia are in need of new infrastructure.\n  Through my travels to Georgia's bases, I was struck in particular \nwith the condition of the buildings at Fort Stewart in Hinesville, \nGeorgia, home of the 3rd Infantry Division. As the chairman and ranking \nmember know, the 3rd I.D. is the heavy division of the Army's \nContingency Corps. It is ready to go at a moment's notice and is part \nof our Army's ``tip of the spear'' force.\n  Despite this crucial mission, it is my understanding that Fort \nStewart is the only major FORSCOM installation that still performs \ncorps functions in World War II wooden buildings.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. It is clear to me that Fort Stewart needs more \nmilitary construction dollars. However, I also understand that the \ncommittee and the Pentagon have certain parameters within they work to \ndetermine military construction dollars. I understand that one of the \nreasons Fort Stewart is not gaining authorization for military \nconstruction projects is that the projects I requested were not in the \nPentagon's FYDP and that the committee uses the FYDP as its guide for \nauthorizing military construction dollars. Is that correct?\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator from Georgia is correct. We see many projects \nthat need funding. However, in distributing scarce resources we must \nwork with the Pentagon's priorities. While base commanders may have \ndifferent views of what their bases need, if those priorities do not \ncorrespond with the Pentagon's priorities then it is different for us \nto assess the military value of the various projects.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the chairman. I have relayed similar views to\n\n[[Page S5334]]\n\nFort Stewart and will work with our other Georgia bases to ensure that \nthey understand this process. I would like to ask the chairman how the \ncommittee views the situation at Fort Stewart.\n  Mr. WARNER. We agree that Fort Stewart needs new construction dollars \nand worked very hard this year to do what we could to help. We are \ncommitted to Fort Stewart's future and look forward to working with \nyou, the base and the Pentagon to help it in the future.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the chairman for his remarks and look forward \nto working with him on this matter in the future.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I would like to join my distinguished colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, in highlighting the \ncritical needs of Fort Stewart in Georgia. I would also like to note my \nappreciation for the remarks of Chairman Warner and his recognition of \nFort Stewart.\n  I too would like to highlight the importance of Fort Stewart. Since \nits birth in 1940, Fort Stewart has seen a flurry of activity. Its \noriginal mission began as an anti-aircraft artillery training center \nand later evolved into a helicopter training facility, and is now home \nto 3rd Infantry Division. Fort Stewart has shown its importance during \nthe Korean war, Vietnam war, the Persian Gulf war, and even during the \nCuban missile crisis. Through the years, Fort Stewart has adapted to \nthe changing landscape of our military missions. Despite this glorious \nhistory, Fort Stewart needs our attention. Fort Stewart has important \nmilitary construction needs to provide the critical infrastructure to \nfulfill its mission. It is my hope that through increased attention \nfrom the Department of the Army, the Pentagon, and the Congress, Fort \nStewart's needs can be addressed. I thank my colleagues for engaging in \nthis colloquy regarding such a vital facility.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3473\n\n (Purpose: To enhance Federal enforcement of hate crimes and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan (Mr. Levin), for himself and \n     Senator Kennedy, proposes an amendment numbered 3473.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the Kennedy proposal has two major \nprovisions. First, it strengthens current law as it relates to hate \ncrimes based on race, religion and nation origin. Second, it broadens \nthe definition of hate crimes to include gender, sexual orientation, \nand disability.\n  The two major provisions in the Kennedy amendment address specific \nloopholes in our current federal civil rights statute. Under current \nlaw, the federal government is limited in its ability to intervene in \ncase unless it can be proved that the victim was engaged in one of six \nnarrowly defined ``federally protected activities,'' such as enrolling \nin a public school, participating in a state or local program or \nactivity, applying for or enjoying employment, serving as a juror, \ntraveling in or using interstate commerce, and enjoying certain places \nof public accommodation.\n  The other unduly severe limitation under current law is this: federal \nprosecution is limited to those crimes motivated by race, color, \nreligion and national origin and does not allow for federal \nintervention in crimes motivated by a person's sexual orientation, \ngender, or disability.\n  The Senate has the ability and the responsibility to pass the Kennedy \namendment and send a clear message that America is an all-inclusive \nnation--one that does not tolerate acts of violence based on bigotry \nand discrimination.\n  Hate crimes are a special threat in a society founded on ``liberty \nand justice for all.'' Too many acts of violence and bigotry in the \nlast years have put our nation's commitment to diversity in jeopardy. \nWhen Matthew Shepard, a gay student was severely beaten and left for \ndead or James Byrd, Jr. was dragged to death behind a pick-up truck, it \nwas not only destructive for the victims and their families, but \ndamaging to the victims' communities, and to our American ideals.\n  When a member of the Aryan Nations walked into a Jewish Community \nCenter day school and fired more than 70 rounds from his Uzi submachine \ngun, then killed a Filipino-American federal worker because he was \nconsidered a ``target of opportunity,'' it not only affected the \nfamilies of the victims but all those who share the traits of the \ntargeted individuals.\n  In a united voice, we must not only condemn these acts of violence \nthat terrorize Americans every day, but act against them. America's \nagenda will remain unfinished so long as incidents like those occur and \nstatistics like the following threaten our people. According to the FBI \nUniform Crime Reports, at least one hate crime occurs each hour. These \nare often acts of violence, not threats, verbal-abuse or hate speech, \nbut criminal offenses.\n  In 1998, there were 7,755 incidents involving 9,722 victims. Of those \nincidents, approximately 56 percent were motivated by racial bias; 18 \npercent by religious bias; 16 percent by sexual-orientation bias; and \nthe remainder by ethnicity/national origin bias, disability and \nmultiple biases, and prejudices and hate.\n  In my own home state of Michigan, according to the State Police, \nthere were 578 hate crimes in the same year. According to Donald Cohen, \ndirector of Michigan's Anti-Defamation League, racist, anti-gay and \nanti-Semitic activity is on the rise. In October of 1998, Cohen, who \nmonitors hate crimes for his organization said ``I can say I have seen \nmore hate-group material circulated . . . in the last few months than I \nhave seen in the prior two years.''\n  As a result, civil rights and law enforcement officials, who were \nconcerned about the rise of hate crimes in Michigan moved to counter \nthem by founding the Michigan Alliance Against Hate Crimes. The \nAlliance is a statewide coalition working to provide support to victims \nof hate crimes and to identify, combat and eliminate such crimes.\n  The group was already in place last September, when this crime was \ncommitted in Grand Rapids, Michigan: a 30-year-old white man, Charles \nRaab, beat unconscious an African-American man, Willie Jarrett, ran him \nover with a car three times and dragged him with the car for 80 feet, \nbefore he dislodged the victim and fled the scene. Witnesses said that \nduring the scene, the attacker used racial slurs to describe his \nvictim--who suffered wounds to his back, hands, chest, and shoulders, \nand had half of his ear torn off.\n  The Michigan Alliance Against Hate Crimes immediately assembled a \n``rapid response team'' and worked with the local prosecutor to charge \nRaab, the attacker, under the Ethnic Intimidation Act--Michigan's hate \ncrime law. In the end, Raab pleaded guilty to the charges against him \nand was sentenced to seven to twenty-five years in prison for the \nattack.\n  The city of Grand Rapids, along with the Michigan Alliance Against \nHate Crimes, made sure that the perpetrator of this heinous hate crime \nwas prosecuted to the extent of the law. Unfortunately, not all hate \ncrimes are prosecuted so successfully. There are several states without \nsuch Alliances and hate crimes are not prosecuted with success either \nbecause state or local authorities do not have adequate resources or \npersonnel; state and local authorities aren't as incensed as they \nshould be or decline to act for other reasons.\n  In some cases, state or local authorities simply don't have \njurisdiction to prosecute hate crime cases: 42 states have hate crime \nstatutes but only 21 cover sexual orientation and disability and 22 \ncover gender. Michigan's Ethnic Intimidation Act, for example, is \nlimited to crimes incited by a person's race, color, religion, gender \nor national origin, and does not include crimes motivated by a person's \nsexual orientation or disability.\n  The FBI Statistics show that the number of reported hate crimes based \non sexual orientation is third only to those based on racial bias and \nreligious bias.\n  My home state of Michigan has had its share of hate crimes based on \nsexual\n\n[[Page S5335]]\n\norientation. Last summer, an 18-year-old boy leaving a gay nightclub in \nGrand Rapids, Michigan was met by an attacker who was waiting outside \nthe club in a car. The assailant jumped the young man and slashed his \nface with a razor blade hospitalizing him for over a week. His face is \npermanently scarred.\n  A few weeks ago in Detroit, a gay man was buying cigarettes at a gas \nstation late at night and a car full of men pulled up, accosted him and \nasked if he was gay. When he just walked away the men became infuriated \nand beat him badly, shattering his skull and putting him in a coma for \nseveral days. The assailants have not been arrested.\n  A gay man driving in Royal Oak, Michigan was allegedly harassed and \nintimidated by four other motorists in a nearby car. The assailants \nwere screaming anti-gay epithets and succeeded in running him off the \nroad and destroying his car. The assailants then screamed at the man, \nspit on him, and kicked in his window.\n  The police officer investigating the case allegedly asked multiple \nquestions about the driver's sexual orientation and sexual activity \nrather than the details of the accident. The four assailants were never \ncharged and despite the fact that witnesses and crime specialists \nreconstructed the scene as told by the driver, the driver was convicted \nof reckless driving. Local media and community leaders were outraged \nand called it a miscarriage of justice.\n  This and other such stories are examples of crimes that not only \naffect the fundamental rights of the victim, but deprive that victim of \na sense of security and self worth. These crimes are just as damaging \nas those motivated by race or religion, but state authorities are \nlimited in their ability to respond because Michigan's hate crimes \nstatute is inadequate.\n  Congress has the opportunity to take action against these and other \nhate crimes, which go unprosecuted at the state level, with the passage \nof the Kennedy hate crimes amendment. This amendment would expand the \nfederal definition of hate crimes to include crime motivated by a \nperson's sexual orientation, gender or disability adding to the current \nlist of attacks motivated by race, color, religion or national origin.\n  The Kennedy amendment would also broaden the federal government's \nauthority to prosecute any hate crime based on race, color, religion or \nnational origin. Currently, federal prosecution of hate crimes is \nlimited and U.S. attorneys have had difficulties prosecuting cases--\nthat state authorities are unwilling or unable to prosecute--because of \nthe need to prove that the victim of a hate crime was also targeted \nbecause of his participation in one of six specified federally \nprotected activities. The statute's severe restrictions has prevented \nthe federal government from prosecuting perpetrators of some of the \nmost egregious hate crimes.\n  For example, in recent years a jury acquitted three white \nsupremacists who had assaulted African-Americans. After the trial, some \nof the jurors revealed that they felt racial animus had been \nestablished but did not believe there was sufficient evidence to show \nthat the defendants intended to prevent the victims from engaging in a \nnarrowly defined federally protected activity that the statute had \nprovided.\n  The Kennedy amendment will not make every hate crime a federal crime. \nAlmost all hate crimes will remain the primary responsibility of sate \nand local law enforcement agencies. For these cases, broadening federal \nauthority will permit joint federal-state investigations and may be \nuseful to state and local authorities who will be able to rely on \ninvestigatory and prosecutorial assiatnce from the Department of \nJustice. The Kennedy amendment makes grants of up to $100,000 available \nto state and local law enforcement agencies who have incurred \nextraordinary expenses associated with investigating and prosecuting \nhate crimes.\n  For the few hate crimes that the Justice Department does act to make \nfederal crimes, the Department will be required to use its authority \nsparingly, as is required with the existing authority to prosecute \ncrimes motivated by racial or religious hatred. Prior to federally \nindicting someone, the Justice Department must certify and there is \nreasonable cause to believe that the crime was motivitated by bias and \nthe U.S. attorney has consulted with the state or local law enforcement \nofficials and determined one of the following situations is \npresent, under the Kennedy amendment, to show we are not creating under \nthis amendment a situation where the Federal Government is going to be \nprosecuting every hate crime. There are still restrictions built in \nhere to rely more heavily on State and local law enforcement. If one of \nthe following situations is present, then the U.S. attorney, under \ncertain circumstances at least, would be authorized to proceed:\n\n  No. 1, the state does not have jurisdiction or does not intend to \nexercise jurisdiction;\n  No. 2, the state has requested that the federal government assume \njurisdiction;\n  No. 3, the state does not object to the federal government assuming \njurisdiction;\n  No. 4, or the state has completed prosecution and the verdict or \nsentence obtained under state law left demonstratively unvindicated the \nfederal interest in eradicating bias-motivated violence.\n  In addition, for crimes based on the three new categories--gender, \nsexual orientation, and disability, and in some instances, for crimes \nbased on religion and national origin--the Kennedy amendment provides \nthat the Federal Government must prove an interstate commerce \nconnection showing that:\n  No. 1, the defendant or the victim traveled across state lines;\n  No. 2, the defendant or the victim used a channel, facility, or \ninstrumentality of commerce;\n  No. 3, the defendant used a firearm, explosive, incendiary device or \nother weapon that has traveled in commerce, or\n  No. 4, the conduct interferes with commercial or other economic \nactivity in which the victim is engaged at the time of conduct.\n  Stated simply, the Kennedy hate crimes amendment will allow for more \neffective and just prosecutions of hate crimes. The alternative, the \nHatch proposal, which will be before the Senate, neither addresses the \nproblems with existing law--that the victim must be engaged in a \nnarrowly specified federally protected activity; nor does it address \nthe limited definition of a hate crime--which excludes sexual \norientation, disability, and gender.\n  More than 175 law enforcement, civil rights, civic and religious \ngroups as well as 22 State Attorneys General support the Kennedy \namendment, and the role it gives the federal government to prosecute \nindividuals who have committed violent acts resulting from racist, \nanti-Semitic or homophobic motives. This legislation is also supported \nby the Justice Department, and is compliant with the recent Supreme \nCourt decision United States v. Morrison. In a June 13, 2000 letter to \nSenator Kennedy, the Justice Department stated clearly that the \namendment ``would be constitutional under governing Supreme Court \nprecedents''\n  Passage of this amendment will send the message that we are a country \nthat treasures equality and tolerance. We will not condone the hate \ncrimes that have plagued our nation and have had such a devastating \nimpact on the families of Matthew Shepard, James Byrd, Jr. and too many \nothers. I hope my colleagues will support the Kennedy amendment. This \namendment will bring us closer to the time when all Americans have \nequal opportunities, and perpetrators of hate crimes receive swift and \nvigorous prosecution.\n  I believe there is a unanimous consent order relative to the next \nspeaker, but before the Senator from Minnesota speaks, I see the \nSenator from Oregon on the floor and I want to express my gratitude to \nhim for the article that was in this morning's paper. It was an \nextremely beautifully written, heartfelt article. I hope every Member \nof this body has an opportunity to read it. I know the Senator from \nOregon is too modest to do so. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 19, 2000]\n\n               Nationally: Why Hate Crimes Are Different\n\n                          (By Gordon H. Smith)\n\n       On June 7, 1998, James Byrd Jr. was dragged to death along \n     a dusty Texas road. On Oct. 12, 1998, Matthew Shepard was \n     beaten and left to die on a lonely Wyoming fence.\n\n[[Page S5336]]\n\n     They were murdered not for their property, but for who they \n     were--one black, the other gay.\n       Their brutal murders shocked the nation and spurred a \n     national debate over what can be done to prevent further hate \n     crimes and to ensure that perpetrators of such crimes are \n     brought to justice.\n       The Senate soon will consider the Hate Crimes Prevention \n     Act of 2000. This act would authorize federal law enforcement \n     officers to aid and assist state and local police in the \n     pursuit and prosecution of hate crimes--even if state lines \n     have not been crossed.\n       The act is controversial. Some believe that all crime is \n     hateful, and that by providing federal resources for hate \n     crimes we would be telling the victims of crimes committed \n     for other motives that they are not as important. I believe, \n     however, that hate crimes are different. While perpetrated \n     upon an individual, the violence is directed at a community.\n       The most controversial element in this legislation is that \n     in addition to categories of race, religion, gender and \n     disability, it contains a category for sexual orientation. \n     Many in the Senate will oppose the legislation because they \n     feel that to legislate protections for gays and lesbians is \n     to legitimize homosexuality.\n       I once shared that feeling, but no longer. One needn't \n     agree with all the goals of the gay community to help it \n     achieve fair treatment within our society. It is possible, \n     for example, to oppose gay marriage on religious and policy \n     grounds but to protect gays and lesbians against violence on \n     the same grounds. There is a biblical example and a present \n     duty to protect anyone in the public square who would be \n     stoned by the sanctimonious or the politically powerful.\n       As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I \n     have spoken against hate crimes of many kinds and in many \n     lands. For that reason, I cannot be silent at home. I cannot \n     forget the testimony given at a recent hearing by Elie \n     Wiesel:\n       ``To hate is to deny the other person's humanity. It is to \n     see in `the other' a reason to inspire not pride but disdain, \n     not solidarity, but exclusion. It is to choose simplistic \n     phraseology instead of ideas. It is to allow its carrier to \n     feel stronger than `the other,' and thus superior to `the \n     other.' The hater . . . is vain, arrogant. He believes that \n     he alone possesses the key to truth and justice. He alone has \n     God's ear.''\n       I often have told those who attempt to wield the sword of \n     morality against others that if they want to talk about sin, \n     go with me to church, but if they want to talk about policy, \n     go with me to the Senate. That is the separation of church \n     and state.\n       At times, the law can and should be a teacher--and this is \n     one of them. Yes, in many ways, passage of the Hate Crimes \n     Prevention Act would be nothing more than a symbol. But it is \n     a symbol that can be filled with substance by changing hearts \n     and minds and by better protecting all our citizens, be they \n     disabled, female, black or gay. They are Americans all.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota is to be recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I say to my colleague, I will be very \nbrief on this amendment. I will try to take less than 10 minutes \nbecause Senator Smith has taken a major leadership role. I know Senator \nHatch will be speaking, and I am sure my colleague from Oregon will \nwant to be here for that debate. The only reason I am taking this time \nright now is I won't be able to stay beyond the next 10 or 15 minutes. \nI will be brief. Then the country will have a chance to hear from the \nSenator from Oregon. I have not read the piece, but I thank the Senator \nvery much for his leadership.\n  I am not a lawyer, but I want to try to briefly summarize what this \nbill is about. Senator Levin always does a more masterful job of that \nthan I can. Then I will talk about why I think this piece of \nlegislation is so important for Minnesota and people in the country.\n  When it comes to hate crimes based on race, religion, or national \norigin, this legislation essentially moves beyond the very restrictive \nlanguage we have right now where we can't prosecute people who have \ncommitted violent crimes against someone unless that person was \ninvolved in some kind of federally protected activity. That is way too \nnarrow a definition. We want to be in a position as a nation where the \nFederal Government can prosecute, for example, those who murdered James \nByrd. It is that simple.\n  We don't want to have such narrowly restrictive laws and language--\nand this is where the amendment of the Senator from Utah doesn't do us \nany good at all--we don't want to have such a narrow definition that we \ncan't prosecute people when they murder a James Byrd. I think it is \nthat simple.\n  Secondly, we further define the hate crime legislation applied to \ngender, disability, and sexual orientation when there is an interstate \ncommerce nexus. And in this particular case what we want to make sure \nof is that as a national community, as the Senate, as the House of \nRepresentatives, we care deeply when a Matthew Shepard is murdered, \nand, indeed, the Federal Government can play a role, and those who \ncommit such a murder because of someone's sexual orientation will be \nprosecuted, that they will pay the price.\n  I know there have been some arguments made against this legislation. \nI am sure my colleague from Oregon will take up those arguments and \ndeal with them in more depth, but as to the argument that somehow this \ntakes on freedom of speech, we are not talking about freedom of speech. \nWe are not talking about somebody in the pulpit saying whatever they \nwant to say about people because of their sexual orientation, as much \nas I would be in disagreement with what I think would be prejudice or, \nI would argue, ignorance. But we are talking about an action; we are \ntalking about when there is an act of violence perpetrated against \nsomeone because of their sexual orientation. I am not talking about \nspeech. I am talking about violent action.\n  I believe strongly in this amendment and am proud to support it \nbecause I think hate crimes are very special. I came to the human \nrights rally in Washington, DC--it seems as though it was yesterday; \nmaybe it was a couple months ago--I wanted to speak, and I had an \nopportunity to introduce Judy and Dennis Shepard. That was, for me, a \nmuch greater honor than actually giving a long speech or speaking at \nall. I wanted to introduce them. I have seen them at so many gatherings \nwhere they have been willing, as the parents of Matthew Shepard, who \nwas murdered because of his sexual orientation, to go around the \ncountry and support other people and speak out and try to do everything \nthey can in memory of their son, to make sure that this never happens \nagain. I guess we cannot make sure it never happens again, but we can \ndo everything possible to make sure that it never happens again.\n  That is what this hate crimes amendment is all about--basically, what \nhappens when there is an act of violence against someone because of the \ncolor of their skin or their religion. I am sensitive to this. My \nfather was a Jewish immigrant born in the Ukraine, lived in Russia, \nfled persecution, and came to the United States of America because of \nreligious persecution. When you have this kind of violence against \nsomeone because of their religion or their national origin or their \ngender or their disability or their race or their sexual orientation, \nit is terrorism because what you are saying to a whole lot of other \npeople is it could happen to you, too. That is the purpose of a lot of \nthese crimes. You are saying to other people who are gay and lesbian, \nyou are saying to other people because of their religion, sometimes you \nare saying to other people because they are white--not that long ago I \nthink it was in Pittsburgh we saw people murdered just because of the \ncolor of their skin; they were white--what you are saying with these \nkinds of hate crimes is: other people, you could be next.\n  What you are doing is you are creating a whole second class of \ncitizens who have to live their lives in terror. What you are doing is \ndehumanizing people. That is what these hate crimes are about.\n  Now, we should have a high threshold--I am not a lawyer, but we \nshould have a high threshold. We want to make sure that truly these are \nhate crimes. And believe me, that will have to be proven in our court \nsystem. But, colleagues, in all due respect, you have an amendment here \nthat does a good job of getting beyond the very narrow definition so \nthat, indeed, we have a definition of a hate crime that applies to the \nmurder of a James Byrd; we have a definition of a hate crime that \napplies to the murder of a Matthew Shepard, and I don't know how \nSenators can vote against it. It is long past time that we passed such \na law. We must and I hope we will.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of OREGON. Madam President, I wish to say what is in my \nheart and why I as a Republican stand here in support of a Kennedy \namendment on hate crimes.\n\n[[Page S5337]]\n\n  On June 7, 1998, when James Byrd, Jr., was dragged to death on a \ndusty Texas road, something happened to me. I was horrified beyond my \nability to express it.\n  On October 12, 1998, when Matthew Shepard was beaten to death on a \nWyoming prairie, hung to a fence to die, something happened to me. I, \nagain, had no ability to express the outrage and horror that I felt of \nsuch conduct and wondered: What is it in the heart of humankind that \ncould perpetrate such an action upon a fellow human being?\n  These were people who were murdered not for their property. They were \nmurdered because of who they were. One was a black man and the other \nwas a gay man. I think much of America felt the shock and revulsion \nthat I did. Many of us began to look around and ask: What can I do in \nmy sphere of influence? How can I help to see that this never happens \nagain in my country?\n  So I was attracted to the whole issue of hate crimes. This is a very \ncontroversial thing with many Senators. It is controversial because, \nfrankly, of one clause. It is controversial because it includes a new \ncategory: ``. . . or sexual orientation.'' And many of my friends in \nthe Senate believe that disqualifies it from consideration. But it \nseems to me that our duty as public officials is to help Americans help \nhuman beings however we find them; no matter what we may believe their \nsins are because all of us are sinful.\n  Many will say that to legislate favorably towards a gay man is to \nlegitimize homosexuality for our society. I used to have that feeling \nmyself, but I do not any longer. I truly believe it is possible to \nobject to a gay marriage and yet come to the defense of a gay person \nwhen it comes to violence. And I believe we have a duty to show up to \nwork in the Federal Government when it comes to the issue of hate \ncrimes. Some people believe that, well, all crime is hateful; don't \ndesignate some types of crime. But I tell you that I have come to \nrealize that hate crimes are different in this respect. Hate crimes are \nvisited upon one person, but they are really directed at an entire \ncommunity--in one case, a black man in the African American community, \nand in the other case, a gay man in the gay and lesbian community. We \nneed to help, and I believe the Kennedy amendment actually helps.\n\n  Some see this as controversial because they will stand behind the \nargument of States rights; that we cannot defend these people at the \nFederal level because there are State officials and local officials \nwhere most police actions and prosecutions occur; that we should leave \nthat to them. I had that feeling until I was visited by a group of \nconservative Republican law enforcement officers from Wyoming who said, \nin the case of Matthew Shepard: It would have helped a great deal had \nthe Federal Government shown up with resources and support to help in \nthe prosecution of this horrible tragedy.\n  The Kennedy amendment allows this to happen, and I support it for \nthat reason, because I believe we need to show up to work.\n  As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I have spoken all \nover the globe against hate crimes of all kinds. Because of that, I \ncannot in good conscience remain silent about hate crimes in my own \ncountry. It is time to speak out, and it is time to vote on something \nthat will actually make a difference.\n  In my Subcommittee on European Affairs, I recently held a hearing on \nthe issue of antisemitism. One of the most remarkable witnesses I have \never listened to in the Senate came to testify in that hearing. He is \nthe Nobel Laureate Elie Wiesel. I will never forget what he said to our \ncommittee that day. He said:\n\n       To hate is to deny the other person's humanity. It is to \n     see in ``the other'' a reason to inspire not pride, but \n     disdain; not solidarity, but exclusion. It is to choose \n     simplistic phraseology instead of ideas. It is to allow its \n     carrier to feel stronger than ``the other,'' and thus \n     superior to ``the other.'' The hater . . . is vain, arrogant. \n     He believes that he alone possesses the key to truth and \n     justice. He alone has God's ear.\n\n  I am afraid there are some like that not just in Nazi Germany about \nwhich he was speaking, there are some like that today in Bosnia, in \nYugoslavia, Kosovo, in Africa. There are haters still, and there are \nhaters in our own country as well. We are trying to say, once and for \nall, that when it comes to hate and hate crimes that are directed at \nthese minority communities who live among us as Americans: Your Federal \nGovernment cares, too. The Federal Government will show up to work. The \nFederal Government will try to use the law as well to teach the \nAmerican people that there is no room for hate, and if you commit a \nhate crime, we will come after you with the full force of the law at \nthe local, the State, and the Federal level, because while many will \nsay this is just symbolism, I grant you it is in part, but it is \nsymbolism that can be made substance if we change some hearts and \nminds. In that sense, the law can be a teacher.\n  That is why I support the Kennedy amendment, because I think we need \nto change some hearts and minds, as well as some laws, so that the \nFederal Government can show up to work.\n  I am going to do something I do not suppose is commonly done here, \nbut I want to speak using a Scripture. I do this because I need to \nreach out, not to change the minds necessarily of some in my own \npolitical base who are the conservative Christians. They are my \nfriends, and many of their views are views I hold. But on this issue, I \nbelieve we can care enough to change some hearts and minds. I believe \nthat the God of Christianity, the God whom I worship, said on this \nEarth that by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples--if you \nhave love one for another. He showed that in a remarkable episode, and \nI want to share it. I share it with my friends in the Christian \ncommunity because we need to remember this story when we think somehow \nthat we should not help a community because of what we think their sins \nmay be.\n\n  This is the story. It comes from the 8th Chapter of John:\n\n       Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.\n       And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and \n     all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught \n     them.\n       And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman \n     taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,\n       They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in \n     adultery, in the very act.\n       Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be \n     stoned: but what sayest thou?\n       This they said, tempting him, that they might have to \n     accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote \n     on the ground, as though he heard them not.\n       So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, \n     and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him \n     first cast a stone at her.\n       And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.\n       And they which heard it, being convicted by their own \n     conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, \n     even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman \n     standing in the midst.\n       When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the \n     woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine \n     accusers? hath no man condemned thee?\n       She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do \n     I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.\n\n  This happened in a public square. This was a wonderful example of \nmercy and compassion. It was a wonderful occasion in which, in my view, \nthe greatest of all stood up against violence, violence that was later \nvisited upon Him with hatred.\n  I point out that if you care about the American family and you \nperceive homosexuality as a threat to that family institution, remember \nthat adultery, if you want to talk about sins, is a far greater threat \nto the American family than homosexuality.\n  What I say to fellow Christians everywhere is, it is time to help. It \nis time to remember a story and an example. It is time to say to the \ngay community: I do not agree with you on everything, but I can help \nyou on many things. And particularly when it comes to violence, \nparticularly when it comes to dragging a man to death, particularly \nwhen it comes to seeing someone beaten to death on a fence, I would be \nashamed if we did not act as the Federal Government to say: We can show \nup to work, we can help, we can teach, we can change hearts and minds, \nand we can turn the symbolism into substance by letting Federal \nauthorities bring resources and help make a difference.\n  I know I may not be in large numbers on my side of the aisle, but I \nhope they will consider what I have just said. All of the excuses that \nwill be offered today--are we prosecuting people for their thoughts? \nNo, we are prosecuting people for their actions that kill people.\n\n[[Page S5338]]\n\n  Some will say: There are limitations in the bill so that every hate \ncrime is not a Federal crime. There are limitations that will trigger \nthe Federal response. We will defer to the States.\n  Some will say: What business is it of ours to put hate crimes on the \nDefense authorization bill? Some of the most horrible hate crimes I \nhave read about have occurred within the military. It is our business \nto put it here if that is what it takes to pass it here.\n  Some will say: Isn't every act of domestic violence or rape a hate \ncrime? I say, it may well be. It may trigger Federal involvement. But \njust because it includes sexual orientation does not make those victims \nless American.\n  Some will say: The Kennedy amendment is not constitutional. I believe \nit is constitutional. I believe it is OK to say we will help \nAmericans--how we find them--whether they are black, whether they are \ndisabled, or whether they are gay.\n  So my remarks today, Madam President, are about having a bigger heart \nand making the Federal law big enough to include communities that are \nthe most vulnerable among us.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 4 \no'clock having arrived, the Senator from Utah is recognized to offer \nhis amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3474\n\n(Purpose: To authorize a comprehensive study and to provide assistance \n                  to State and local law enforcement)\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, our Nation's recent history has been \nmarred by some horrific crimes committed because the victim was a \nmember of a particular class or group. The beating death of Matthew \nShepard in Laramie, WY, and then the dragging death of James Byrd, Jr. \nin Jasper TX. These two spring readily to mind. I firmly believe that \nsuch hate-motivated violence is to be abhorred and that the Senate must \nraise its voice and lead on this issue.\n  During the last 30 years, Congress has been the engine of progress in \nprotecting civil rights and in driving us as a society increasingly \ncloser to the goal of equal rights for all under the law.\n  Historians will conclude, I have little doubt, that many of America's \ngreatest strides in civil rights progress took place just before this \npresent moment on history's grand timeline: Congress protected \nAmericans from employment discrimination on the basis of race, sex, \ncolor, religion and national origin with the passage of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964; Congress protected Americans from gender-based \ndiscrimination in rates of pay for equal work with the Equal Pay Act of \n1963, and from age discrimination with the passage of the Age \nDiscrimination in Employment Act of 1967; Congress extended protections \nto immigration status with the Immigration Reform and Control Act in \n1986, and to the disabled with the passage of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act in 1990. And the list goes on and on.\n  Yet despite our best efforts, discrimination continues to persist in \nso many forms in this country, but most sadly in the rudimentary and \nmalicious form of violence against individuals because of their \nmembership in a particular class or group. Let me state, unequivocally, \nthat this is America's fight. As much as we condemn all crime, crimes \nmanifesting an animus for someone's race, religion or other \ncharacteristics can be more sinister than other crimes.\n  A crime committed not just to harm an individual, but out of the \nmotive of sending a message of malice to an entire community--\noftentimes a community that has historically been the subject of \ndiscrimination--is appropriately punished more harshly, or in a \ndifferent manner, than other crimes.\n  This is in keeping with the longstanding principle of criminal \njustice--as recognized by the Supreme Court in its unanimous 1993 \ndecision in Wisconsin versus Mitchell upholding Wisconsin's sentencing \nenhancement for crimes of animus--that the worse a criminal defendant's \nmotive, the worse the crime.\n  Moreover, crimes of animus are more likely to provoke retaliatory \ncrimes; they inflict deep, lasting and distinct injuries--some of which \nnever heal--on victims and their family members; they incite community \nunrest; and, ultimately, they are downright un-American.\n  The melting pot of America is the most successful multiethnic, \nmultiracial, and multifaith country in all recorded history. This is \nsomething to ponder as we consider the atrocities so routinely \nsanctioned in other countries--like Serbia or Rwanda--committed against \npersons entirely on the basis of their racial, ethnic or religious \nidentity.\n\n  I am resolute in my view that the Federal Government can play a \nvaluable role in responding to crimes of malice and hate. One example \nhere is my sponsorship of the Hate Crime Statistics Act of 1990, a law \nwhich instituted a data collection system to assess the extent of hate \ncrime activity, and which now has thousands of voluntary law \nenforcement agency participants.\n  Another, more recent example, is the passage in 1996 of the Church \nArson Protection Act, which, among other things, criminalized the \ndestruction of any church, synagogue, mosque or other place of \nreligious worship because of the race, color, or ethnic characteristics \nof an individual associated with that property.\n  To be sure, however, any Federal response--to be a meaningful one--\nmust abide by the constitutional limitations imposed on Congress, and \nbe cognizant of the limitations on Congress's enumerated powers that \nare routinely enforced by the courts.\n  This is more true today than it would have been even a mere decade \nago, given the significant revival by the U.S. Supreme Court of the \nfederalism doctrine in a string of decisions beginning in 1992. Those \ndecisions must make us particularly vigilant in respecting the courts' \nrestrictions on Congress's powers to legislate under section 5 of the \n14th amendment, and under the commerce clause.\n  We therefore need to arrive at a Federal response to this matter that \nis not only as effective as possible, but that carefully navigates the \nrocky shoals of these court decisions. To that end, I have prepared an \napproach that I believe will be not only an effective one, but one that \nwould avoid altogether the constitutional risks that attach to other \npossible Federal Responses that have been raised.\n  Indeed, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder testified before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee that States and localities should continue \nto be responsible for prosecuting the overwhelming majority of hate \ncrimes, and that no legislation is worthwhile if it is invalidated as \nunconstitutional. This is worth repeating. Deputy Attorney General Eric \nHolder testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that States and \nlocalities should continue to be responsible for prosecuting the \noverwhelming majority of hate crimes, and that no legislation is \nworthwhile if it is invalidated as unconstitutional.\n  There are two principal components to my approach:\n  First my amendment creates a meaningful partnership between the \nFederal Government and the States in combating hate crime by \nestablishing within the Justice Department a grant program to assist \nState and local authorities in investigating and prosecuting hate \ncrimes.\n  Much of the cited justification given by those who advocate broad \nFederal jurisdiction over these hate-motivated crimes is a lack of \nadequate resources at the State and local level. Accordingly, before we \ntake the step of making a Federal offense of every crime motivated by a \nhatred of someone's membership in a particular class or group, it is \nimperative that we equip States and localities with the resources \nnecessary so that they can undertake these criminal investigations and \nprosecutions on their own.\n  Second, my approach undertakes a comprehensive analysis of the raw \ndata that has been collected pursuant to the 28 U.S.C. 534, the law \nrequiring the collection of data on these crimes--a bill that I worked \nvery hard to pass. The Federal Government has been collecting this data \nfor years, but we have yet to analyze it. A comparison of the records \nof different jurisdictions--some with hate crimes, others without--to \ndetermine whether there is, in fact, a problem in certain States' \nprosecution of hate crimes also is provided for in my amendment.\n  Before we make all hate crimes Federal offenses, I believe we should \nprovide assistance to the States and analyze whether our assumptions \nabout\n\n[[Page S5339]]\n\nwhat the States are doing, or are not doing, are valid.\n  It is no answer for the Senate to sit by silently while these crimes \nare being committed. The ugly, bigoted, and violent underside of some \nin our country that is reflected by the commission of hate crimes must \nbe combated at all levels of government.\n  For supporters of the Kennedy amendment, Federal leadership \nnecessitates Federal control. I do not subscribe to this view, \nespecially when it comes to this problem. Thus, I oppose Senator \nKennedy's amendment. It proposes that to combat hate crimes Congress \nshould enact a new tier of far-reaching Federal criminal legislation. \nThat approach strays from the foundations of our constitutional \nstructure--namely, the first principles of federalism that for more \nthan two centuries have vested States with primary responsibility for \nprosecuting crimes committed within their boundaries.\n  As important as this issue is, there is little evidence that a broad \nfederalization of hate crimes is warranted. Indeed, it may be that \nnational enforcement of hate crimes could decrease if States are told \nthe Federal Government has assumed primary responsibility over hate \ncrime enforcement.\n  In addition, serious constitutional questions exist regarding the \nKennedy hate crimes amendment. First, the Kennedy amendment, if \nadopted, would not be a valid exercise of congressional authority under \nsection 5 of the 14th amendment. The Supreme Court has made clear in \nrecent years that legislation enacted by Congress pursuant to section 5 \nof the 14th amendment may only criminalize action taken by a State. \nJust last month, the Supreme Court in the recent United States v. \nMorrison case re-emphasized the State-action requirement that limits \nCongress' authority to enact legislation under the 14th amendment. The \nCourt stated:\n\n       Foremost among these limitations [on Congressional power] \n     is the time-honored principle that the Fourteenth Amendment, \n     by its very terms, prohibits only state action. The principle \n     has become firmly embedded in our constitutional law that the \n     action inhibited by the . . . Fourteenth Amendment is only \n     such action as may fairly be said to be that of the States. \n     That Amendment erects no shield against merely private \n     conduct, however, discriminatory or wrongful.\n\n  The Kennedy amendment, however, seeks to prohibit private conduct--\ncrimes of violence committed by private individuals against minorities, \nreligious practitioners, women, homosexuals, or the disabled. It \ntherefore is very similar to the provision of the Violence Against \nWomen Act--a bill I worked very hard to pass, called the Biden-Hatch \nAct--that sought to prohibit crimes of violence committed by private \nindividuals against women. The Supreme Court in Morrison held that that \nprovision of the Violence Against Women Act was not a valid exercise of \ncongressional power under section 5 of the 14th amendment.\n  To be sure, Congress can regulate purely private conduct under its \ncommerce clause authority. But the Kennedy amendment likely would not \nbe a valid exercise of congressional authority under the commerce \nclause either. The Supreme Court's 1995 decision in United States v. \nLopez, and especially its recent Morrison decision, set forth the scope \nof Congress' commerce clause power. The Morrison opinion, in \nparticular, changed the legal landscape regarding congressional power \nin relation to the States. Thus, legislation that was perfectly fine \nonly 2 months ago now raises serious constitutional questions. The \nKennedy amendment is not consistent with Lopez and Morrison.\n  Both Lopez and Morrison require that the conduct regulated by \nCongress pursuant to its commerce clause power be ``some sort of \neconomic endeavor.'' The Court has held that a statute that is ``a \ncriminal statute that by its terms has nothing to do with `commerce' or \nany sort of economic enterprise, however broadly one might define those \nterms,'' does not meet constitutional muster. Here, the conduct sought \nto be regulated--hate crimes--is in no sense economic or commercial, \nbut instead, by its very terms, is non-economic and criminal in nature, \njust like the conduct Congress sought to regulate in the Gun Free \nSchools Zones Act and the Violence Against Women Act--statutes that \nwere held to be unconstitutional in Lopez and Morrison.\n  In light of the Morrison decision, the Kennedy amendment makes an \neffort to require a direct link to interstate commerce before the \nFederal government can prosecute a hate crime based on sexual \norientation, gender, or disability. It permits Federal hate crimes \nprosecution in four broad circumstances: No. 1, where the hate crime \noccurred in relation to interstate travel by the defendant or the \nvictim; No. 2, where the defendant used a ``channel, facility or \ninstrumentality'' of interstate commerce to commit the hate crime; No. \n3, where the defendant committed the hate crime by using a firearm or \nother weapon that has traveled in interstate commerce; and No. 4, where \nthe hate crime interferes with commercial or economic activity of the \nvictim. None of these circumstances provides an appropriate interstate \nnexus that would make the legislation constitutional.\n  First, the interstate travel requirement of the Kennedy amendment's \nfirst circumstance where Federal prosecution would be appropriate does \nnothing to change the criminal, non-economic nature of the hate crime.\n  The requirement of the second circumstance, that the defendant commit \nthe hate crime by using a channel, facility or instrumentality of \ninterstate commerce, may provide a interstate nexus, but it is unclear \nprecisely what hate crimes that would encompass: hijacking a plane or \nblowing up a rail line in connection with a hate crime?\n  The third circumstance's requirement that the defendant have used a \nweapon that traveled in interstate commerce would blow a hole in the \ncommerce clause; Congress could then federalize essentially all State \ncrimes where a firearm or other weapon is used; for example, most \nhomicides.\n  Finally, the fourth circumstance's requirement that the victim be \nworking and that the hate crime interfere with his or her work is \nanalogous to the reasoning the Court rejected in Morrison; that is, \nthat violence against women harms our national economy. In the case of \nthe Kennedy hate crimes amendment, the argument would be that hate \ncrimes harm our national economy and therefore they have a nexus to \ninterstate commerce. The Court in Morrison and in Lopez rejected those \n``costs of crime'' and ``national productivity'' arguments because \n``they would permit Congress to regulate not only all violent crime, \nbut all activities that might lead to violent crime, regardless of how \ntenuously they relate to interstate commerce.'' Finally, the Kennedy \namendment's catch-all provision, that the Federal government may \nprosecute a hate crime only if the crime ``otherwise affects interstate \nor foreign commerce,'' not only merely restates the constitutional \ntest, it misstates the constitutional test. To be constitutional, the \nconduct must ``substantially affect'' interstate commerce.\n  In addition to its constitutional problems, the Kennedy amendment has \nother deficiencies. The amendment provides that where the hate crime is \na murder, the perpetrator ``shall be imprisoned for any term of years \nor for life.'' It does not authorize the death penalty for even the \nmost heinous hate crimes. Accordingly, the horrific dragging death of \nJames Byrd, Jr. on a back road in Jasper, TX, for example, under the \nKennedy amendment, would provide only for a life sentence. In the Byrd \ncase, however, State prosecutors tried the case as a capital case and \nobtained death sentences for the defendants. The Kennedy amendment, \nthen, which purports to provide Federal leadership in the prosecution \nof hate crimes, would not even provide for the ultimate sentence \npermitted under duly enacted Texas law.\n  When we asked the Justice Department what type of proof they had that \nthe States are not doing the job, they promised to provide us evidence. \nI haven't seen it yet.\n  That was quite a while ago. There may be, in the eyes of some, and in \nmy eyes, a great reason to try to make Senator Kennedy's amendment \nconstitutional, and that is what I tried to do in my amendment in order \nto do something about this if the States are not doing the job. But to \nthis day, I have not had any information indicating that they are not \ndoing the job. And in the Byrd case, they certainly have. In the \nShepard case, they certainly have, just to mention a couple of them.\n  I feel as deeply about hate crimes as Senator Kennedy or anybody else \nin\n\n[[Page S5340]]\n\nthis Chamber. But I want to abide by the Constitution. I recall Justice \nScalia's admonition that there should be a presumption that Congress \nwant to enact constitutional legislation, but because of some of the \nthings we are doing, maybe that presumption is unjustified\n  Supporters of the Kennedy amendment have claimed that it will create \na partnership with State and local law enforcement. They have \ndelicately described the legislation as being deferential to State and \nlocal authorities as to when the Justice Department will exercise \njurisdiction over a particular hate crime. This is hogwash. The \namendment does not defer to State or local authorities at all. It would \nleave the Justice Department free to insert itself in a local hate \ncrime prosecution at the beginning, middle or end of the prosecution, \neven after the local prosecutor has obtained a guilty verdict. Even if \nthe Justice Department does not formally insert itself into the \nparticular case, it nevertheless will be empowered by the legislation \nto exert enormous pressure on local prosecutors regarding the manner in \nwhich they handle the case--from charging decisions the plea bargaining \ndecisions to sentencing decisions. The Kennedy hate crimes amendment, \npure and simple, would expand federal jurisdiction and federalize what \ncurrently are State crimes.\n  By contrast, my amendment would address the issue of hate crimes in a \nresponsible, constitutional way--by assisting States and local \nauthorities in their efforts to investigate and prosecute hate crimes. \nIt provides for a study of this issue to see if there really are States \nand local governments out there who, for whatever reason, are not \ninvestigating and prosecuting hate crimes. And, it would provide \nresources to State and local governments that are trying to combat hate \ncrimes but lack the resources to do so.\n  In summary, we must lead--but lead responsibly--recognizing that we \nlive in a country of governments of shared and divided \nresponsibilities. In confronting a world of prejudice greater than any \nof us can now imagine, President Abraham Lincoln said to Congress in \n1862 that the ``dogmas of the quiet past'' were ``inadequate to the \nstormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must \nrise--with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, and \nact anew.''\n  In that very spirit, I encourage this body to question the dogma that \nfederal leadership must include federal control, and I encourage this \nbody to act anew by supporting a proposal that seeks to stem hate-\nmotivated crime, while at the same time respecting the primacy states \ntraditionally have enjoyed under our Constitution in prosecuting crimes \ncommitted within their boundaries.\n  Ultimately, I believe the approach I have set forth is a principled \nway to accommodate our twin aims--our well-intentioned desire to \ninvestigate, prosecute, and, hopefully, end these vicious crimes; and \nour unequivocal duty to respect the constitutional boundaries governing \nany legislative action we take.\n  My proposal should unite all of us on the one point about which we \nshould most fervently agree--that the Senate must speak firmly and \nmeaningfully in denouncing as wrong in all respects those actions we \nhave increasingly come to know as hate crimes. Our continued progress \nin fighting to protect Americans' civil rights demands no less.\n  Madam President, what the Hatch amendment does in comparison to the \nKennedy amendment--and look, like I say, I feel as deeply about this as \nSenator Kennedy does, and I respect him for how he feels, and I also \nrespect Senator Smith from Oregon and the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois. We are all trying to do the same thing, and that is make sure \nthat hate crimes are prosecuted in our society today. I am very \nconcerned about it, but I am also concerned about meeting the \nrequisites of the Constitution as well. I believe my amendment would do \nthat. I believe it would do it in a far more responsible way than the \nway the Kennedy amendment does.\n  What the Hatch amendment does is provide for a comprehensive study so \nwe can find out once and for all--we have the Hate Crimes Statistics \nAct giving us the statistics; it is something that I helped to do years \nago along with Senator Kennedy. That study would help us to find out \njust what is happening in our society and whether or not the State and \nlocal governments are inadequate or incapable or unwilling to \ninvestigate and prosecute hate crimes.\n  Two, we would provide for an intergovernmental assistance program. We \nprovide technical, forensic, prosecutorial, or other assistance in the \ncriminal investigation or the prosecution of crimes that, one, \nconstitute a crime of violence; two, are a felony under relevant State \nlaw; and three, are motivated by animus against the victim by reason of \nthe victim's membership in a particular class or group.\n  My amendment would provide for Federal grants. We authorize the \nAttorney General, in cases where special circumstances exist, to make \ngrants of up to $100,000 to States and local entities to assist in the \ninvestigation and prosecution of hate crimes. We require grant \nrecipients to certify that the State or local entity lack the resources \nnecessary to investigate or prosecute such crimes. And, we require that \nthe Attorney General shall approve or disapprove grant applications \nwithin 10 days of receiving the application. We provide that the \nAttorney General shall report to Congress on the effectiveness of the \nprogram and conduct an audit to assure that the grants awarded are used \nproperly.\n  What we do not do is we do not create a new Federal crime. We do not \ngive the Justice Department jurisdiction over crimes that are motivated \nbecause of a person's membership in a particular class or group; that \nis, the Hatch amendment does not Federalize crimes motivated because of \na person's race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or disability.\n  To enact such a broad federalization of hate-motivated crimes would \nraise serious constitutional concerns. In addition, the Kennedy \namendment would federalize all rapes and sexual assaults and, in so \ndoing, would severely burden Federal law enforcement agencies, Federal \nprosecutors, and Federal courts. My amendment does not authorize \nFederal interference with State and local investigations and \nprosecutions. It is not our job to second-guess the investigation and \nprosecution and sentencing decisions of State and local authorities in \ncases involving hate crimes. As such, my amendment recognizes the \nsignificant efforts of State and local law enforcement in investigating \nand prosecuting all violent crimes, including hate crimes.\n  In other words, my amendment would provide the analysis, study, and \ndata to determine whether or not the States are failing or refusing to \ncombat these horrible crimes. It provides the Government assistance to \nbe able to help the State and local people do their job in these areas. \nOf course, we provide various other kinds of assistance that could be \nhelpful in this matter.\n  Madam President, I have taken enough time. Parliamentary inquiry. Is \nit time to send the amendment to the desk?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can send his amendment to the \ndesk.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3474.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. COMPREHENSIVE STUDY AND SUPPORT FOR CRIMINAL \n                   INVESTIGATIONS AND PROSECUTIONS BY STATE AND \n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS.\n\n       (a) Studies.--\n       (1) Collection of data.--\n       (A) Definition of relevant offense.--In this paragraph, the \n     term ``relevant offense'' means a crime described in \n     subsection (b)(1) of the first section of Public Law 101-275 \n     (28 U.S.C. 534 note) and a crime that manifests evidence of \n     prejudice based on gender or age.\n       (B) Collection from cross-section of states.--Not later \n     than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Comptroller General of the United States, in consultation \n     with the National Governors' Association, shall select 10 \n     jurisdictions with\n\n[[Page S5341]]\n\n     laws classifying certain types of offenses as relevant \n     offenses and 10 jurisdictions without such laws from which to \n     collect the data described in subparagraph (C) over a 12-\n     month period.\n       (C) Data to be collected.--The data described in this \n     paragraph are--\n       (i) the number of relevant offenses that are reported and \n     investigated in the jurisdiction;\n       (ii) the percentage of relevant offenses that are \n     prosecuted and the percentage that result in conviction;\n       (iii) the duration of the sentences imposed for crimes \n     classified as relevant offenses in the jurisdiction, compared \n     with the length of sentences imposed for similar crimes \n     committed in jurisdictions with no laws relating to relevant \n     offenses;

Madam President, I respect my colleagues. I think we are \nall here to try to get at the same problem. I respect Senator Kennedy \nfor his sincere effort to try to do what is right with regard to civil \nrights matters generally, and with regard to hate crimes in particular.\n  I feel very much the same way. This is a great country. It is the \ngreatest in the world. We ought to set an example. We ought to do the \nthings that really need to be done. But I think we have to have the \nfacts before we act. I don't think we should federalize crimes. I think \nthis amendment is too broad.\n  We are approaching this in two different ways. I hope we can somehow \nor other get together to solve this matter in a way that will make \nsense--that respects the principles of federalism, that respects the \nStates in their efforts to combat hate crimes. Right now, we are not \nsure there are any States or local jurisdictions out there that are \nfailing or refusing to investigate and prosecute hate crimes. You can \ncite the James Byrd and Matthew Shepard cases as two illustrations \nwhere State authorities have done a tremendous job in prosecuting \nhorrific, hate-motivated crimes.\n  I don't think anybody should have to suffer from hate crime activity. \nI think my amendment does not go as far as Senator Kennedy's, but I \nthink it will certainly handle the problem in a way that respects \nfederalism, respects the Constitution, and respects the nine decisions \nof the Supreme Court over the last 8 years that have reinforced the \nprinciple of federalism. In the end, I think my amendment will do what \nall of us here on the floor would like to see done--promote the \ninvestigation and prosecution of hate crimes--in a way that is \nconstitutionally sound.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, let me say at the outset to my colleague \nand friend, the Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, that it was my honor to \nserve on the Judiciary Committee when he was chairman and I was a \nmember of that committee. I hope someday to return. It is an \ninteresting and exciting assignment. Occasionally we even agreed. They \nwere rare moments, but there were those moments. I never, at any moment \nin time, lost any respect for the Senator from Utah and the values he \nespouses. I believe he is a person of good faith who will genuinely try \nto find a common ground. I sincerely hope he will.\n  I listened to his explanation of his amendment on this issue, and I \nreally think it comes down to a classic debate, which has been on the \nfloor of this Senate many times in its history, when we were discussing \nwhether or not African Americans were to become full citizens of the \nUnited States with all of their rights and responsibilities. There were \nthose on the floor who said: It is not a Federal issue; let the States \ndecide; the Federal Government should not get involved in this.\n  There have been issues involving religious persecution--whether it is \npeople of the Senator's faith, or my faith, or many others. There have \nbeen those who said this a State-and-local matter to decide, it should \nnot be a Federal issue.\n  The same thing was true when it came to elevating women in America \nfrom their status in the Constitution--which we revere, but a \nConstitution which, frankly, did not give the women the right to vote \nwhen it was initially drafted. When the debate came on about the rights \nof women, it was usually couched in terms of federalism: Should the \nFederal Government get involved in this; or, this is a State issue.\n\n  We can remember the hot debates over the equal rights amendment and \nall that entailed. The same thing has been true throughout history, the \nway I read it--whether we are talking about blacks, women, or people of \na certain faith, or whether we are talking about people who have \ncertain disabilities. We have always come down to this debate: Is this \nissue any business of the Federal Government?\n  I respectfully disagree with my colleague and friend, the Senator \nfrom Utah. I think when it comes to hate crimes, this is an issue for \nthe Nation to solve. To leave it to individual States to make the \ndecisions is in fact to subject some Americans to less protection than \nothers when it comes to being victims of hate crimes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I haven't said this isn't an issue for \nthe Federal Government. I think it may be. But the point is, we ought \nto get the facts, and we ought to find out if State and local \nauthorities are failing or refusing to investigate and prosecute hate \ncrimes. We ought first to find out whether State and local authorities \nare, in fact, denying individuals the equal protection of the laws. So \nfar, the Justice Department has produced precious little evidence to \nthe Judiciary Committee that would indicate\n\n[[Page S5342]]\n\nthat State and local authorities are abdicating their responsibility to \ncombat hate-motivated crimes. And we asked for the Justice Department \nto get us this information, if there is any, a long time ago.\n  Yet we have had actually nine decisions by the Supreme Court over the \nlast 8 years reinforcing the principle of federalism--the principle \nthat State governments and the federal government have distinct areas \nof responsibility. It is true that these Court decisions are, in many \ninstances, 5-4 decisions, which shows again how important the Supreme \nCourt really is in all of our lives.\n  I am a proud cosponsor of the Violence Against Women Act. I remember \nthe passion when we passed it. There were real concerns whether it \nwould be upheld by the Supreme Court. Part of it was not upheld by the \nSupreme Court, the part that I was concerned about. But up to that \npoint, I thought there was a chance.\n  But with the Morrison decision, I don't think there is a chance that \nthe Kennedy amendment, as it currently is written, will survive a \nconstitutional challenge. And I think that we ought to at least make an \nattempt to abide by the Constitution, if nothing else. This is not a \nmatter of States rights. I think there may be a role for the Federal \nGovernment. But right now, let's at least get the facts. In the \nprocess, we can lend assistance, both financial and otherwise, to the \nStates to help them with these serious problems.\n  I am very grateful for my distinguished colleague and his respectful \nremarks. They mean a lot to me because I happen to believe he is one of \nthe most articulate Members of this body. I believe he is very sincere. \nIt is true that we agree on much more than just a few things.\n  But I just want to make it clear that my amendment offers a different \napproach--an approach that I think is constitutional, that will get us \nthere without going through another 2 or 3 years and then having it \noverruled as unconstitutional and having to start all over again. I \nknow that the amendment I have offered is constitutional. I know we can \nimplement it from day one, without any fear that it will be struck down \nby the Supreme Court as violative of the Constitution. And I know it \nwill make an impact and really do something about hate crimes, rather \nthan just make political points on the floor.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Utah.\n  Let me say first how proud I am to cosponsor the legislation that has \nbeen introduced by the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, and the \nSenator from the State of Oregon, Mr. Smith. It is bipartisan \nlegislation. Senator Carl Levin of Michigan is also one of the lead \nsponsors of it as well.\n  The difference, as I understand it, between the proposal of the \nSenator from Utah and the proposal of Senators Kennedy and Smith really \ncomes down to one basic point. As I understand it, the Senator from \nUtah is looking to, first, provide grants to States and localities so \nthey can prosecute these crimes when they are found deserving; and, \nsecond, to study the issue to determine whether or not there is a need \nfor Federal legislation.\n  As I understand the amendment before us by Senators Kennedy and \nSmith, it basically creates a Federal cause of action, expanding on \nwhat we now have in current law in terms of hate crimes, and expanding \nthe categories of activities that would be covered by this hate crime \nlegislation.\n  I say to the Senator from Utah, if he is on the floor, I believe the \nSenator from Massachusetts will provide ample evidence of the need for \nthis legislation. I believe the statistics are not only there but they \nare overwhelming in terms of the reason he is introducing this \namendment and why we need this national cause of action.\n  Second, during the course of my remarks I would like to address \nsquarely the issue raised by the Senator from Utah, an issue that has \nbeen raised by the Supreme Court. It is, frankly, whether or not we \nhave the authority to create this cause of action.\n  The Senator uses recent Supreme Court decisions relating to the \ncommerce clause. When it came to the Violence Against Women Act, it is \nmy understanding the Supreme Court ruled that they could not find the \nnecessary connection between the Violence Against Women Act and the \ncommerce clause to justify Federal activity in this area.\n  If the Senator from Utah will follow this debate, I think he will \nfind that the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from Oregon \nare taking a different approach. They are using the 13th amendment as a \nbasis for this legislation. They also establish an option of the \ncommerce clause. But they are grounding it on a 13th amendment \nprinciple of law and Federal jurisdiction, which our Department of \nJustice agrees would overcome the arguments that have been raised in \nthe Supreme Court under its current composition of overextension of the \ncommerce clause.\n  I hope as the Senator from Utah reflects on this debate, the \ninformation provided by the Senator from Massachusetts, and the new \nconstitutional approach to this, that he may reconsider offering this \namendment. As good as it is to study the problem further and to provide \nadditional funds, it doesn't address the bottom line; that is, to make \nsure there will at least be the option of a Federal cause of action in \nevery jurisdiction in America.\n  I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Utah for a question.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague.\n  If I could comment, I believe the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts can show that there are hate crimes in our society. I \nthink that he will have a difficult time, however, showing that that \nState and local prosecutors are unwilling to investigate and prosecute \nhate-motivated crimes. That is why I asked the Justice Department to \nprovide to us data and information on the specific instances where \nState and local authorities failed or refused to investigate and \nprosecute hate crimes.\n  Years ago, under the leadership of Senator Kennedy and myself, the \nSenate passed the Hate Crime Statistics Act to collect data on the \nincidence of hate crimes. We have statistics. I am sure there are hate \ncrimes, but I am not sure there is any evidence to show that these hate \ncrimes are not being prosecuted in the respective States. I'm just not \nsure. That is one reason I think we should cautiously approach this, \nrather than approach it in a way that I believe would be \nunconstitutional.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will look closely at the Kennedy-Smith \namendment, he will find before the Federal cause of action can be \ninitiated--as I understand it, but I defer to either of the major \nsponsors--before there can be a Federal indictment under this proposed \nhate crime, the Department of Justice must certify two things: First, \nreasonable cause to believe that the crime was motivated by bias; \nsecond, addressing the very issue raised by the Senator from Utah, the \nU.S. attorney has to certify that he has consulted with State or local \nlaw enforcement officials and determined one of the following \nsituations is present, and he lists four situations.\n  First, the State does not have jurisdiction or does not intend to \nexercise jurisdiction; second, the State has requested that the Justice \nDepartment assume jurisdiction; third, the State doesn't object to the \nJustice Department assuming jurisdiction; or fourth, the State has \ncompleted prosecution and the Justice Department wants to initiate a \nsubsequent prosecution.\n  When the Senator from Utah suggests that the Kennedy-Smith amendment \nwill necessitate Federal control, I think, frankly, that when you look \nat the certification required by the Federal Government before the \naction can be undertaken, we clearly have a situation where the State \nhas either no jurisdiction, or has invited the Justice Department to \ninitiate the prosecution, or they have completed their prosecution.\n  In this amendment, the first option is clearly being given to the \nStates. If they have the authority and exercise it, clearly they will \nnot be preempted by this Federal cause of action, as I understand it. \nIf that is the case, I think it addresses the major concern raised by \nthe Senator from Utah.\n  Why do we need this new law? We have a 30-year-old Federal statute \nwhich says when it comes to hate crimes, we have to find a specific \nfederally protected activity. Congress, in the past, tried to \n``prophesize,'' if you will, the types of activities\n\n[[Page S5343]]\n\nthat might be involved in a hate crime. We came up with six activities: \nEnrolling in or attending a public school or private college; No. 2, \nparticipating in a service or action provided by State or local \ngovernment; No. 3, applying for employment or actually working; No. 4, \nservice on a jury in State or Federal court; No. 5, traveling in \ninterstate commerce or using a facility of interstate commerce; and No. \n6, enjoying the goods and services of certain places of public \naccommodation.\n  We have said over the years if this activity is involved and there is \nevidence of a hate crime, then the Federal prosecutors can step in.\n  I believe--and I don't want to put words in their mouths --Senators \nKennedy and Smith have said we have found too many cases arising which \ndo not fall within the four corners of these six federally protected \nactivities. Therefore, they are offering an amendment which gives \nFederal prosecutors more opportunity to consider the possibility of \nprosecution.\n  I am wearing a button today that says ``Remember Matthew.'' Matthew, \nof course, is Matthew Shepard. Two years ago, Matthew Shepard, an \nopenly gay college student in Wyoming, was brutally beaten. He was \nburned, he was tied to a wooden fence in a remote area, and left to die \nin freezing temperatures from exposure.\n  Despite this heinous act which we all read about, no Federal \nprosecution was even possible under the Shepard case. The existing \nState crime law and federally protected activities that are defined in \nit did not include what happened to Matthew Shepard. The current \nFederal statute does not include hate crimes based on a victim's sexual \norientation, gender, or disability. The Kennedy-Smith amendment, which \nI am cosponsoring, corrects that very grievous omission.\n  I think the Senator from Utah would concede that when we are talking \nabout hate crimes, we should certainly include crimes based on sexual \norientation, gender, or disability. The Matthew Shepard case would not \nhave been included, as I understand it. That is why the Kennedy-Smith \namendment is so important.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield, I am having a little bit of \ndifficulty, so I ask how the 13th amendment applies. As I read the 13th \namendment, it says, in section 1:\n\n       Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a \n     punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly \n     convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place \n     subject to their jurisdiction.\n\n  In section 2:\n\n       Congress shall have power to enforce this article by \n     appropriate legislation.\n\n  How does the Kennedy amendment qualify under the 13th amendment? As I \nmade clear, it doesn't qualify under the 14th amendment because of the \narguments I made, pure Supreme Court arguments, that are recent in \ndecision.\n  I missed something on the 13th amendment because that is the \namendment that abolished slavery.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me reply.\n  Mr. HATCH. Please tell me. This is a sincere question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to defer to the sponsors of the amendment to \nrespond and yield time if they desire.\n  The information I have been given is this: Under the 13th amendment, \nCongress may prohibit hate crimes based on actual or perceived race, \ncolor, religion, or national origin, pursuant to that amendment. Under \nthe 13th amendment, Congress has the authority not only to prevent the \n``actual imposition of slavery or involuntary servitude'' but to ensure \nthat none of the ``badges and incidents'' of slavery or involuntary \nservitude exist in the United States.\n  What the Justice Department and what the sponsors of this amendment \nhave concluded is that the 13th amendment gives the appropriate Federal \njurisdiction and nexus to pursue this matter under the question of \nwhether or not this is a badge or incident of that form of \ndiscrimination.\n  I don't want to go any further. I am sure the Senator from \nMassachusetts will explain this in more detail, but this 13th amendment \nnexus, I think, overcomes the concern of the Senator from Utah about \nthe interpretations recently handed down.\n  Mr. HATCH. I don't mean to keep interrupting, but as I read that, I \ncan see if what the Senator is after is a hate crime of keeping \nsomebody involuntarily in servitude, but I don't know of many of those \ntoday. I am sure that may happen. We are talking about all kinds of \nhate crimes that certainly don't fit within the 13th amendment. If that \nis the way we are going to get at it, I think that is a very poor way \nof getting at a resolution for a hate crime problem.\n  Reading again, section 1:\n\n       Neither slavery--\n\n  And I don't know of many instances of slavery in this day and age; in \nfact, I don't know of any, but there may be some. But we can get them \nconstitutionally, right now, if they do that --\n\n     nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime \n     whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist \n     within the United States or any place subject to their \n     jurisdiction.\n\n  Section 2:\n\n       Congress shall have power to enforce this article by \n     appropriate legislation.\n\n  If there is such a thing, if there is such a hate crime today as \nslavery, or involuntary servitude not required because of a due \nconviction, then we have the absolute power today, federally, to go in \nand prosecute under the Constitution itself under the 13th amendment.\n  Maybe I am missing something, or maybe I just haven't thought it \nthrough or I am too tired. I can't see how the 13th amendment provides \na nexus whereby the Kennedy amendment becomes constitutional. It \ndoesn't. In some ways, I wish the Kennedy amendment were \nconstitutional. I worked hard back in those days to pass the Violence \nAgainst Women Act. I am working hard right now to pass it again in a \nform that is constitutional. We thought it was constitutional. I have \nto say, I had my qualms about it and my qualms proved to be accurate.\n  Today, we know what the Court has said. It has been the principle \ndebate in this country since the beginning. The Court has said that \nCongress' power in relation to the States is limited. They are 5-4 \ndecisions that are valid and are constitutional. For us to fly in the \nface of those just because we want to federalize hate crime activity, \nis, I think, constitutionally improper. That is what worries me.\n  These Supreme Court cases outlining the limits of congressional power \nunder the principle of federalism are quite recent decisions. They are \nnot old-time decisions that have been disqualified or overly \ncriticized. They are decisions that basically advise us of the law \nright now.\n  I just wanted to make that point because I am concerned: How do you \nmake the Kennedy amendment constitutional? I don't think you can under \ncurrent law.\n  Now let's face it. If another Court comes in and reverses the nine \nmajor federalism decisions that the Supreme Court has handed down in \nthe last few years, and ignores the principle of stare decisis and \nignores the principle of federalism, I suppose that at that point you \ncould enact the Kennedy legislation with impunity. But right now, I \ndon't see how you do it if we, as Members of Congress, are trying to \nexert our influence and our obligation and our oath to uphold the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  I am sorry to interrupt.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Utah. Let me say \nparenthetically I think there is more value to this dialog and exchange \nthan many monologs we hear on the Senate floor.\n  I thank the Senator for his interest and staying to question me, and \nI am sure we will question him during the course of this debate.\n  I know there are other Members seeking recognition at this point. I \nwill try to wrap up.\n  I do not want to in any way misrepresent the amendment that is been \noffered by Senators Kennedy and Smith. I think the statements I have \nmade to date are accurate. The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act \nthat is before us, the Kennedy-Smith amendment, was drafted carefully \nand modified to assure its constitutionality under current Supreme \nCourt precedents, as has been referred to by the Senator from Utah. It \nhas been reexamined in light of the Morrison decision. Moreover, the \nDepartment of Justice and constitutional scholars have examined this \nbill and have confidently\n\n[[Page S5344]]\n\ndetermined that the Local Law Enforcement Act will stand up to \nconstitutional scrutiny.\n  Congress may prohibit hate based on race, color, religion, or \nnational origin pursuant to its power to enforce the 13th amendment to \nthe U.S. Constitution because under the 13th amendment Congress has the \nauthority not only to prevent the actual imposition of slavery or \ninvoluntary servitude but to ensure that none of the ``badges and \nincidents'' of slavery or involuntary servitude exists in the United \nStates, which goes to the very point of the Senator from Utah. He reads \nthe 13th amendment and says this goes far beyond prohibiting slavery. \nBut I might say the Supreme Court, in interpreting congressional \nauthority under the 13th amendment, said it could reach beyond the \nsimple question of prohibiting slavery or involuntary servitude. By \nusing the language ``badges and incidents,'' it opened up the \nopportunity for Congress to consider this authority and for this \namendment to be introduced.\n  None of the Supreme Court's recent Federalism decisions casts doubt \non Congress' powers under the 13th amendment to eliminate the badges \nand incidents of slavery. United States v. Morrison involved \nlegislation that was found to exceed Congress' powers under the 14th \namendment. The Court in Morrison, for example, found Congress lacked \nthe power to enact the civil remedy of the Violence Against Women Act \npursuant to the 14th amendment because the amendment's equal protection \nguarantee extends only to ``state action.'' The Senator from Utah, who \nwas one of the proponents of this and deserves high praise for it, \nmakes this point in his opening statement on his amendment.\n  Since the Violence Against Women Act was interpreted by this Court to \ngo beyond State action--that is, Government action--the Court struck it \ndown. We are trying our best to reinstate it, but that is the standard.\n  The 13th amendment, however, not the 14th amendment, which they used \nto strike down the Violence Against Women Act, plainly reaches private \nconduct as well as Government conduct, and Congress thus is authorized \nto prohibit private action that constitutes a badge, incident, or relic \nof slavery.\n\n  Moreover, this hate crimes amendment would not only apply except \nwhere there is an explicit and discrete connection between the \nprescribed conduct and interstate or foreign commerce, a connection \nthat the Government would be required to allege and prove in each case. \nThis is consistent with Morrison. Like the prohibition of gun \npossession in the statute at issue in the Lopez case, the Violence \nAgainst Women Act civil remedy required no proof of connection between \nthe specific conduct prohibited and interstate commerce. This amendment \nrequires that a nexus exist between the prohibited conduct and \ninterstate or foreign commerce.\n  Madam President, there are many who believe that a hate crime \nprevention statute is unnecessary. I don't put the Senator from Utah in \nthat category. He has made it clear he is opposed to hate crimes, and I \ntrust his word. I believe he is genuine when he says it. The question \nis, Who will have the power to enforce it? If the Senate neither has \nthe authority nor wants the authority, if the State does not want to \nprosecute a hate crime, and yet it has been committed and truly there \nis a victim, the Kennedy-Smith amendment says we will create the \nopportunity for a Federal cause of action.\n  We are not forcing the Federal cause of action, but only in the \ninstance where the State either doesn't have authority or has not \nexercised the authority or in fact defers to the Federal Government or \nin fact has completed its prosecution and left open the opportunity for \nsuch a Federal cause of action.\n  I wish we did not even have to debate hate crimes legislation. Alan \nBruce of my staff has been a person I have turned to many times on \nissues of this magnitude on this subject. He was the one who gave me \nthis button to wear in the Chamber and can remember Matthew Shepard. It \nis a grim reminder that there are still people in America who will not \naccept tolerance as the norm, and if we think it is rare, we only have \nto go to our new technology of the Internet to find the hate being \nspewed on so many web sites, efforts by small-minded people in this \ndemocratic society to turn our anger against our brothers and sisters \nwho live in America, who happen to be a different color, of a different \nsexual orientation, a different religion, a different gender. This \namendment really tries to address it and say that America as a nation \nwill make it clear that we will not tolerate this sort of hateful, \nspiteful conduct when it results in violence against one of our \nbrothers and sisters.\n  How many times have we read these harrowing details: Jasper, TX, with \nJames Byrd, Jr., 2 years ago dragged to his death when he was hooked by \na chain to the back of a pickup truck. They literally found this \nAfrican-American's body in pieces.\n  The brutal hate-motivated deaths of James Byrd and Mathew Shepard \nreceived national attention. Since their deaths, our Nation has thought \nlong and hard about whether this is an America we can tolerate. I think \nit is not.\n  Madam President, I bring your attention to two crimes in my own State \nof Illinois just in the last year.\n  April 5, 1999: Naoki Kamijima, 48 years old, a Japanese American \nshopowner was shot to death in Crystal Lake, IL, right outside of \nChicago. The gunman was allegedly searching stores for employees of \ncertain ethnic groups before finding and shooting Mr. Kamijima. \nReportedly, the gunman said to employees he left behind after \nquestioning them on their ethnic background, ``This is your lucky \nday.'' Hours later, Mr. Kamijima was shot dead, leaving a wife and two \nteenage children. His crime? He was an Asian-American. A Korean \nneighbor of the gunman said he used to chase her car when she drove \nthrough the neighborhood.\n  On the Fourth of July, 1999, a time of celebration across America, a \nshadow was cast over Illinois. Benjamin Smith, an individual associated \nwith a racist, antisemitic organization, killed an African-American \nman, Ricky Birdsong, the former basketball coach at Northwestern \nUniversity. Then he went on, this same Benjamin Smith, to wound six \nOrthodox Jews in Chicago. I met the father of one of the young boys \nwhose son was terrorized that night. His life will never be the same. \nHis only crime in the eyes of Benjamin Smith? He did not practice the \nright religion. Then Benjamin Smith went on to kill a Korean student in \nBloomington, IN.\n\n  Sadly, these incidents are only the tip of the iceberg. There are so \nmany other incidents of hate violence in my State and around the \nNation. Since 1991, 70,000 hate crime offenses have been reported in \nour country. Launching a comprehensive Government analysis of currently \navailable hate crime data would likely be time consuming and not bring \nus any closer to solving the real problem of hate violence in this \nNation.\n  Mr. President, the Local Law Enforcement Act offers a sensible \napproach to help deter this kind of discriminatory violence. This \nlegislation has bipartisan support: Senator Gordon Smith, Senator Ted \nKennedy, Senator Carl Levin, and so many others. It is supported by law \nenforcement, civil rights and civic groups, and religious \norganizations. I am proud to cosponsor this legislation. I urge my \ncolleagues to support its passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Stevens). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I start by commending the distinguished \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee for his important observations \nabout this legislation; also, to commend the principal sponsors of this \nlegislation, Senator Kennedy and Senator Smith, for bringing this \nmatter to the attention of our colleagues and seeking our support for \nthis legislation.\n  I do not think this is that complicated an issue, quite frankly. I do \nnot think the issues are so complex that they call for an extended \npsychological discourse on the makeup of the American population. Quite \nfrankly, the issues are fairly simple. America stands for the \nconstitutional principle that all men and women are created equal and \nthat we are all guaranteed the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit \nof happiness regardless of who we are or where we are from or what we \nthink, what our political views are, or what is the essence of our \nmakeup as a\n\n[[Page S5345]]\n\nhuman being. That is a right that is guaranteed to all Americans in the \nConstitution. I think no one really questions that.\n  That principle does not mean everyone in America has to agree with \neverybody else. In fact, I think that, far from it, we are a nation \nthat certainly encourages diversity of thinking, differences among \ncompeting ideas, and differences among the respected beliefs of all the \npeople who make up our great Nation.\n  That constitutional principle does not even mean that we have to like \neach other. Certainly there are instances when Catholics do not like \nProtestants, and Protestants do not like Jews, and Jews do not like \nMuslims, and Cajun Americans may have differences with British \nAmericans. For that reason alone they do not particularly care for each \nother; they do not like each other; they do not want to associate with \neach other. That also is their constitutional right, I suggest, in this \ncountry to take that opinion of people with whom they disagree. But our \nconstitutional principles do, in fact, guarantee clearly that we as \nAmericans cannot do violence or do harm to other people in our country, \nespecially when that violence or harm is based solely on whom these \nother people might be.\n  To do violence solely because of someone's religious beliefs, their \npersonal ideas, or concepts about what is right and what is wrong, or \nbecause of their religion or where they are from is especially \nrepugnant to all of us as Americans. You do not have to like everybody, \nbut you certainly cannot harm anybody, and especially you cannot harm \nanybody solely for whom they happen to be or who they are.\n  This legislation then is aimed at adding crimes that are motivated by \na bias against people solely because of their gender or solely because \nof their sexual preference or perhaps because of some disability they \nmight have. I, therefore, think this legislation which the authors \nbring to the Senate is appropriate and should be supported. It will \nsend a clear message throughout this country that these types of \nactivities in this country will not be tolerated.\n  Again, in America, our right to not embrace or befriend someone with \nwhom we do not want to be associated, for whatever reason, is \nguaranteed. But what is also guaranteed is their right under the \nConstitution of the United States to be protected against violence and \nharm that others might do unto them solely because of who they are.\n  As Americans, we certainly should be proud of our multicultural and \nmultiethnic heritage. We are a diverse nation and when we look at other \nnations that are having problems because of their heritage or their \ndiversity, we can be proud in this country that we, in fact, are a \ndifferent nation than many others. Therefore, this legislation sends a \nstrong and clear message that domestic terrorism and violence against \npeople in our country based merely on who they are or what they believe \nis something that deserves national protection, and Federal legislation \nis, in fact, important.\n  A hate crime against any American is a crime against all Americans, \nand this legislation saying that is a Federal right upon which we will \ninsist is appropriate and proper and deserves our support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak for this \nlegislation and commend Senator Kennedy for his sponsorship, along with \nmy colleagues, of this legislation. Senator Kennedy has long been an \nadvocate for a society in which individuals reach out not with hate but \nwith fellowship. I am pleased to see other supporters, like Senator \nSmith, who are also in the vanguard of this great effort.\n  This afternoon we are here because of the murders of James Byrd and \nMatthew Shepard and others--because these acts of violence tear at the \nvery fabric of our society.\n  Unfortunately, over the past 2 years, we have seen far too many cases \nof these types of crimes of violence, motivated strictly by prejudice \nand hatred of people, not because of their character but because of \nsome perception of their failings in the eyes of others.\n  In my own State of Rhode Island, in May 1998 a group of seven to ten \nmen stomped and battered a Cranston bartender and an acquaintance as \nthey were coming out of a Providence night club, while laughing and \nscreaming anti-gay epithets. The waiter suffered fractured bones in his \njaw, head and collarbone, cracked ribs, and a puncture wound to his \nchest caused by a broken bottle. The acquaintance suffered a fractured \neye socket and bruises.\n  According to Providence, Rhode Island city officials, the number of \nhate crimes reported in Providence has grown in recent years. In 1998, \n25 such crimes were reported, and, last year, 32 were reported.\n  In February 1999, in an incident which took place in Pawtucket, Rhode \nIsland, two men were walking home with a female friend from a church \nfunction and were assaulted by a third man. While yelling obscenities \nand anti-homosexual slurs, the third man hit one of the men over the \nhead with a full wine bottle, and then jumped on top of him and punched \nhim repeatedly in the face and head. He then threw him up against a \nbrick wall and continued to hit him while yelling anti-gay epithets.\n  In California, three men pled guilty to racial terrorism for burning \na swastika outside a Latino couple's residence.\n  In Florida, a Puerto Rican man was allegedly beaten by three white \nmen who yelled racial slurs.\n  In Ohio, a 23-year-old Hispanic male was gunned down by three \nassailants. Police reported it as a racially motivated incident. The \nlist goes on and on.\n  This amendment would simply extend the current definition of Federal \nhate crimes to include crimes committed on the basis of someone's \ngender, sexual orientation, or disability. It would allow the Federal \nGovernment to prosecute an alleged perpetrator who commits a violent \ncrime against someone just because that person is gay, blind, or \nfemale.\n  This amendment basically brings our civil rights statutes in line \nwith the most recent definition of hate crimes promulgated by this \nCongress.\n  This amendment also eliminates the restrictions that have prevented \nFederal involvement in many cases in which individuals were killed or \ninjured because of bias or prejudice.\n  It also supports State and local efforts to prosecute hate crimes by \nproviding Federal aid to local law enforcement officials. In \nparticular, it authorizes the Justice Department to issue grants of up \nto $100,000 to State, local, and Indian law enforcement agencies that \nhave incurred extraordinary expenses associated with investigating and \nprosecuting hate crimes.\n  This amendment does not federalize all violent hate crimes. It \nprovides for Federal involvement only in the most serious incidents of \nbodily injury or death, and only after consultation with State and \nlocal officials, a policy that is explicitly reflected in a memorandum \nof understanding entered into by the Department of Justice with the \nNational Association of District Attorneys last July.\n  Finally, the Department of Justice has reviewed this amendment and \nbelieves it does meet the constitutional standards recently articulated \nin Supreme Court cases. For crimes based on gender, sexual orientation, \ndisability, religion, and national origin, the amendment has been \ncarefully drafted to apply only to violent conduct in cases that have \nan ``explicit connection with or effect on interstate commerce.''\n  This amendment has attracted broad bipartisan support from 42 \nSenators, 191 Members of the House of Representatives, 22 State \nattorneys general, and more than 175 law enforcement, civil rights, and \nreligious organizations. This demonstrates the huge support (for \nstrengthening Federal hate crimes legislation, support) which cuts \nacross party lines and which reaffirms a fundamental belief and tenet \nof our country: That people should be able to be individuals, to be \nthemselves without fear of being attacked for their individuality, for \ntheir personhood, for their very essence.\n  These hate crimes are very real offenses. They combine uncontrolled \nbigotry with vicious acts. These crimes not only inflict personal \nwounds, they wreak havoc on the emotional well-being of people \nthroughout this country, because they attack a person's identity as \nwell as his or her body. Although bodies heal, the scars left by\n\n[[Page S5346]]\n\nthese attacks on the minds of the victims are deep and often endure for \nmany years.\n  There is no better way for us to reaffirm our commitment to the most \nbasic of American values: the dignity of the individual and the right \nof that individual to be himself or herself. We can do that by voting \nin favor of this amendment. I believe it is our duty. I am pleased to \njoin this great debate and lend my support to this amendment. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Hate Crimes \nPrevention Act. I applaud Senators Kennedy and Smith of Oregon, and \nothers for providing us an amendment on the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill which will be of great assistance in the prosecution \nof hate crimes.\n  This legislation will provide the Federal Government a needed tool to \ncombat the destructive impact of hate crimes on our society. The \namendment also recognizes that hate crimes are not just limited to \ncrimes committed because of race, color, religion, or national origin, \nbut are also directed at individuals because of their gender, sexual \norientation, or disability.\n  Any crime hurts our society, but crimes motivated by hate are \nespecially harmful. Hate crimes not only target individuals but are \nalso directed to send a message to the community as a whole. The \nadoption of this amendment would help our State and local authorities \nin pursuing and prosecuting the perpetrators of hate crimes.\n  Many States, including the State of Vermont, have already passed \nstrong hate crimes laws. I applaud them for their endeavor. An \nimportant principle of this amendment is that it allows for Federal \nprosecution of hate crimes without impeding the rights of States to \nprosecute these crimes.\n  Under this amendment, Federal prosecutions would still be subject to \nthe current provision of law that requires the Attorney General or \nanother senior official of the Justice Department to certify that a \nFederal prosecution is necessary to secure substantial justice. Such a \nrequirement under current law has ensured that the States are the \nprimary adjudicators of the perpetrators of hate crimes, not the \nFederal Government. Additionally, Federal authorities will consult with \nthe State and local law enforcement officials before initiating an \ninvestigation or prosecution. Both of these are important provisions to \nensure that we are not infringing on the rights of States to prosecute \nthese crimes.\n  Senate adoption of this amendment will be an important step forward \nin ensuring that the perpetrators of these harmful crimes are brought \nto justice. I urge my colleagues to take a strong stand against hate \ncrimes by supporting this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Has the Senator from Vermont completed his statement?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes. I have yielded the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in Las Vegas a gay man was shot to death \nbecause he was gay. In Reno, someone went to a city park with the \nspecific purpose to find someone who was gay, found him, and killed \nhim. These types of incidents have happened not once, not twice, but \nnumerous times in Nevada, and thousands of times around this country.\n  I only mention two of the occasions where someone's son, someone's \nbrother was killed. They were human beings. These people were killed \nnot because of wanting to steal from them, not because of wanting to do \nanything other than to kill them because of who they were. They were \nkilled because someone hated them.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Local Law Enforcement \nAct of 2000. I am an original cosponsor of the freestanding legislation \nauthored by the senior Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy. I \ncommend Senator Kennedy for his tireless efforts to ensure that the \nSenate consider and pass this important and much-needed measure. This \nis important legislation, and I am very happy that we are now at a \npoint where this legislation can be debated in the Senate.\n  Hate crimes legislation is needed because, according to the FBI, \nnearly 60,000 hate crimes incidents have been reported in the last 8 \nyears. In 1998, the latest year for which FBI figures are available, \nnearly 8,000 hate crimes incidents were reported. But these figures are \nmore frightening when we ponder how many hate crimes are not reported \nto law enforcement authorities.\n  Unfortunately, the Federal statutes currently used to prosecute hate-\nbased violence need to be updated. That is what Senator Kennedy is \ndoing. These Federal laws, many of which were passed during the \nReconstruction era as a response to widespread violence against former \nslaves, do not cover incidents of hate-based crimes based upon a \nperson's sexual orientation, gender, or disability. In 1998, again, the \nlast year for which statistics are available, there were 1,260 hate \ncrimes incidents based on sexual orientation reported to law \nenforcement. Many more took place. These are only the ones that were \nreported. This figure, which represents about 16 percent of all hate \ncrimes reported in 1998, demonstrates that current law must be changed \nto include sexual orientation under the definition of hate crimes.\n  I have listened to the debate on the floor today. I think we all have \nsome remembrance of the terrible series of events which occurred in \nJasper, TX, a couple years ago. On June 7, the country paused to \nremember the second anniversary of James Byrd, Jr.'s horrific death, \nwhen he was dragged along a rural back road in Texas. This man was just \nwalking along the road when certain people, because of the color of his \nskin, grabbed him, beat him, and if that wasn't enough, they tied him, \nwhile he was still alive, to the back of their pickup and dragged him \nuntil he died.\n  Due to the race-based nature of the Byrd murder, Federal authorities \nwere able to offer significant assistance, including Federal dollars, \nto aid in the investigation and prosecution of that case to ensure that \njustice was served.\n  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about another case that has \nalready been talked about here on the floor today; the case of Matthew \nShepard. He was a very small man. In spite of his small size, two men, \nassisted by one or both of their girlfriends, took this man from a bar \nbecause he was gay, and, among other things, tied him to a fencepost \nand killed him.\n  This was gruesome. It was a terrible beating and murder of this \nstudent from the University of Wyoming. But, what makes this case even \nmore disturbing is that Wyoming authorities did not have enough money \nto prosecute the case. They did, of course, but in order to finalize \nthe prosecution of that case, they had to lay off five of their law \nenforcement employees. The local authorities could not get any Federal \nresources because current hate crimes legislation does not extend to \nvictims of hate crimes based upon sexual orientation.\n\n  If there were no other reason in the world that we pass this \nlegislation than the Matthew Shepard case, we should do it. I have \ngreat respect for those people in Wyoming who went to great sacrifice \nto prosecute that case.\n  The hate crimes legislation being offered to the Defense \nAuthorization bill is a sensible approach to combat these crimes based \nupon hate. The measure would extend basic hate crimes protections to \nall Americans, in all communities, by adding real or perceived sexual \norientation, gender, or disability categories to be covered.\n  The amendment would also remove limitations under current law which \nrequire that victims of hate crimes be engaged in a federally protected \nactivity.\n  There may be those who are listening to this debate and wondering why \nwe need to protect those people who are handicapped or disabled? We \nneed only look back at some of the genocide of the Second World War and \nrecognize that Hitler was totally opposed to anyone who was not, in his \nopinion, quite right. He went after people who had disabilities.\n  So there are people, as sad as it may seem, who not only are hateful \nof people who are of a different color, a different religion, a \ndifferent sexual orientation, but also someone who does not have all \ntheir physical or mental capacities.\n  We must give law enforcement the tools they need to combat this kind \nof\n\n[[Page S5347]]\n\nviolence, to help ensure that every American can live in an environment \nfree of terror brought on by hatred and violence.\n  As Senator Kennedy will say, this amendment has been carefully \ndrafted and modified to assure its constitutionality under current \nSupreme Court precedents and has been reexamined in light of the recent \nMorrison decision which invalidated the civil rights remedy in the \nViolence Against Women Act. I appreciate the work done by Senator \nKennedy and the Judiciary Committee for taking such a close look at \nthis legislation.\n  I have shared with my colleagues two incidents in Nevada. There are \nmany, many others. There are incidents in all 50 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia of people who have been kidnaped, beaten, raped, \nand murdered as a result of their sexual orientation. Court records \nreveal that in each of these cases, with rare exception, there is hate \nthat spews out of these people's mouths before the act takes place, \nderogatory names and slurs as they are taking people to their deaths, \nbrutal sadistic murders.\n  These victims are someone's son, someone's daughter, someone's \nbrother, someone's sister, someone's loved one. People should not be \nkilled because they are different; they should not be killed because \nsomeone has a certain, misguided standard of how someone else should \nbe. People should not be killed because of hate.\n  We live in America, the land of freedom and opportunity. We should \nmake sure we stand for morality based upon people's accomplishments, \nnot because of their race, color, creed, or sexual orientation.\n  I extend my congratulations to Senator Kennedy for the work he has \ndone. I hope these two men, Senators Hatch and Kennedy, who have worked \nso closely on legislation over the years, will see that this important \naspect of the law which needs to be revised is revised in such a way \nthat we can all hold our heads high and say: When these crimes take \nplace in the future, authorities in States such as Wyoming will not \nhave to lay off five law enforcement officers to prosecute the crime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank all of our colleagues for \naddressing this issue on this Monday afternoon. We generally, on Monday \nafternoons as well as on Friday afternoons, have less heavy matters \nbefore our body.\n  This afternoon we have had a very impressive series of statements \nthat have urged us to take the action on tomorrow to move ahead and \npass strong hate crimes legislation. I listened earlier to a number of \nour colleagues. I thought there were many excellent statements, which I \nam hopeful our Members will have a chance to review in the early \nmorning in the Congressional Record. These statements have been \nabsolutely superb. We have had a wide variety of different Members from \ndifferent backgrounds and experiences, different political viewpoints, \nspeak on this issue. That is the way it should be because we are \ntalking about a matter of fundamental importance for our society and \nour country. We are talking about what our country is really about, \nwhat steps we are prepared to take to make America, America.\n  We have shown that over a period of time, certainly since the end of \nthe Civil War, this Congress has taken steps to guarantee the \nprotection of constitutional rights, going back to 1866. In the more \nmodern time, we enacted civil rights legislation in the early 1960s, \nafter the extraordinary presence of Dr. King who awakened the \nconscience of our Nation in the latter part of the 1950s and early part \nof the 1960s. We went ahead and took action in 1964 on what was known \nas the Public Accommodation Act. We were asked: Will the kinds of \nenforcement mechanisms stand up under constitutional challenge? And \nthey did.\n  Then, in 1965, we took action in order to preserve the right to vote \nfor our citizens. Now it seems almost extraordinary that a large number \nof Americans were denied the right to vote. At that time, it was \ndebated for some time. We took strong steps to ensure that America was \ngoing to be America in terms of the right to vote. In 1968, we had our \nFair Housing Act to make sure that citizens whose skin was a different \ncolor were not going to be denied the opportunity to purchase homes. We \ntook action in 1968 to protect that right. It wasn't very effective. We \nhad to come back and revisit that again in 1988. Still, the progress \nwent on. In 1988, we passed legislation to protect the rights of the \ndisabled in our society. We had made some progress with what is known \nas Title VII over time, but the Americans with Disabilities Act was the \nlegislation that established protections. We were saying to the \nAmerican people--and the American people supported it--that if \nindividuals have a disability, they should not be discriminated against \nin our society.\n  This is what we are talking about. We are talking about forms of \ndiscrimination. Discrimination is rooted in the basic emotion of \nhatred, of distrust, and of bigotry. We have seen it manifested in race \nrelations in our country. Hatred, distrust and bigotry have also been \nreflected in other ways: on the basis of religion, national origin, \nsexual orientation, gender, and disability. We freed ourselves from \ndiscrimination based on national origin with the 1965 Immigration Act. \nThe Immigration Act had certain rules for those who came from the Asian \nPacific Island triangle. We only permitted less than 150 Asians to come \nonto our shores prior to 1965. Then we also had what was called the \nnational origin quota system which discriminated against people who \ncame from a number of the European countries. All of this is part of \nour national history.\n  One of the amazing and important aspects of the progress that America \nhas made in recent time is in trying to free us from the stains of \ndiscrimination. We are talking not only about those who have been \ndiscriminated against but those who have perpetrated the \ndiscrimination.\n  We are talking about a continuum of this Nation attempting to define \nwhat America ought to be--a nation free from the forms of \ndiscrimination and hatred and bigotry. That is what distinguishes hate \ncrimes from other criminal activities. Crimes based upon hatred and \nbigotry wound not only the individual, but they also wound and scar an \nentire community.\n  Hate crimes occur on a daily basis in the United States of America. \nNumerous hate crime incidents have been mentioned by our colleagues and \nillustrated time and again. According to FBI statistics, nearly one \nhate crime is committed every hour.\n  My colleagues and I want to take action that will move this country \nforward and free us from those acts of hatred that divide us.\n  We can't solve all of these problems, but there is no reason, when we \nhave violence in our society, that those who are charged with \nprotecting the Constitution of the United States ought to be standing \non the sidelines when violence based upon discrimination is taking \nplace in the United States of America. Why should we limit ourselves--\nthose who have a responsibility--from helping and assisting those who \nare involved in local enforcement and State law enforcement, \nparticularly when we are talking about these hate crimes against women \nin our society?\n  An individual was charged in Yosemite this past year with the murder \nof four women. He told the police investigators he had fantasized about \nkilling women for three decades. A gay, homeless man in Richmond, VA, \nwas found with a severed head and left at the top of a footbridge in \nJames River Park near a popular gay meeting place. In Crystal Lake, IL, \na Japanese American shopowner was shot to death outside of Chicago, \nbased upon the fact of discrimination against Asians. Three synagogues \nin Sacramento, in July of 1999, were destroyed by arson on the basis of \nanti-Semitism.\n  These things are happening today. With all due respect to my friend \nand colleague from Utah, his legislation is basically to have a further \nstudy about whether these kinds of activities are taking place. This \namendment that he has, on page 1, talks about studies, the collection \nof data, the data to be collected. Then it shows the number of relevant \noffenses, the percentage of offenses prosecuted. It continues on with \nthe identification of trends. Then it has provisions for grants to \nlocal communities, and eligibility, and grants of $100,000.\n\n[[Page S5348]]\n\n  We have had the FBI doing the study for the last 10 years. We have \nthe figures that the FBI has produced. The one thing that the FBI has \ntestified to, and is very clear about in their studies, is they believe \nit is vastly underestimating the amount of hate crimes that are taking \nplace, because in so many instances there isn't the local training or \nprioritizing of hate crimes by local communities and State communities \nin order to collect the information or data on this.\n  So we do know that this is happening today. It is happening in \nincreasing numbers. The reports that we do have basically underestimate \nthe amount of action and activity that is taking place, and the States \nthemselves--some of them--have taken action. But very few, if any, have \ntaken the kind of comprehensive action we are talking about.\n  There are enormous gaps in the activities of the States in the kinds \nof protections they are providing. Others have talked about it, and I \nam glad to get into the various kinds of protections that we are \ntalking about here, the reasons for this legislation. Again, I say, \nthis is our opportunity--and tomorrow--to say whether we are going to \nbe serious about taking action in this area of bigotry and hatred that \nis focused on particular groups in our society. We have been willing to \ntake action in the past. We were willing to do it in the past. I have \nmentioned six or eight instances when this Congress thought there was \nsuch a compelling reason for us to take the action that we went ahead \nand took that action in order to try to do something about \ndiscrimination in our society.\n  We have the same issue in a different form before the Senate now. In \nthe early 1960s, we had discrimination against blacks because we were \nnot going to permit them to vote. We passed legislation and then \nimplementing legislation. We said we were not going to protect \ndiscrimination and bigotry, discriminating against blacks in the areas \nof housing. We did the same regarding the disabled on the Americans \nWith Disabilities Act. We made progress on discrimination against women \nin our society, and we have made progress as well in terms of \nunderstanding the various challenges on freeing ourselves from some \nforms of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation--although we \nhave made very little in that area.\n\n  The question is not the issue on sexual orientation. It is about \nviolence against individual Americans. That is what it is about when \nyou come down to it. It is violence based on bigotry. You can read long \nbooks about the origins of hatred and the origins of bigotry and the \norigins of prejudice and how they develop against individuals or \nindividual groups. Many of them are different in the way that they did \ndevelop. But there is no difference about what is there basically when \nit is expressed in terms of violence. It is still violence against \nthose individuals, and that is what we are attempting to address.\n  I will put in the Record the various justifications, in terms of the \nconstitutional issues. We can get into those and debate and discuss \nthose in the course of the evening. We believe we are on sound basis \nfor that. We have spent a great deal of time in assuring that the \nlegislation was going to meet the challenges of Supreme Court \ndecisions. I believe that we do. I respect those who believe we have \nnot. But we are talking about taking action and doing it now.\n  There are all kinds of reasons in this body why not to take action. \nBut if we want to try to have an important response to the problems of \nhate crimes in our society, this is the way to do it. It is a \nbipartisan effort, and it has been since the development of our initial \nefforts under the leadership of Senator Simon and others a number of \nyears ago, with just the collection of material. It has been, since \nthat time, basically bipartisan, and it is on this measure now. It is \nwhether we in the Senate are going to say that we have enough of the \nMatthew Shepard cases, that we have enough of the kind of vicious \nmurdering on the basis of race, that we have enough prejudice and \ndiscrimination and expression of violence against Jewish individuals in \nour society, and we have had enough in terms of the violence against \nthose who have a different sexual orientation. That is what the issue \nis, no more and no less.\n  I want to take a few moments, and if others want to address the \nSenate, I will obviously permit them to do so. I want to give the \nassurances to our colleagues about how this particular legislation has \nbeen fashioned and has been shaped. It is targeted, it is limited, it \nis responsive in terms of its constitutional standing and how it \nbasically complements the work of the States, which are attempting to \ntry to deal with those issues, and how it is positive in terms of \nhelping those States, and how, in many circumstances--for example, in a \nnumber of the rapes or aggravated sexual assaults, because criminal \npenalties under State laws are actually more severe than under Federal \nlaws, the prosecution quite clearly would fall in those circumstances.\n  As has been pointed out, in all the hate crimes prosecutions, the \nFederal authorities consult with the State and local enforcement \nofficials before initiating an investigation or prosecution. The \nFederal jurisdiction allows the States to take advantage of the \nDepartment of Justice resources and personnel. Even if the State \nauthorities ultimately bring the case, the Federal jurisdiction also \nallows the Attorney General to authorize the State prosecutor to bring \na case based on Federal law, when that should be important or \nnecessary.\n\n  In cases where the States have adequate resources to investigate and \nprosecute a case and it appears determined to do so, the Federal \nGovernment will not file its own case. As has been the case under \nexisting law, prosecutions under expanded case law would occur \nprimarily in four situations: where the State does not have \njurisdiction or the State prosecutors decline to act; or, after \nconsultation between Federal and local authorities there is a consensus \nthat a Federal prosecution is preferable because of the higher \npenalties and procedural advantages due to the complexity of the case; \nthird, the state does not object to the Justice Department assuming \njurisdiction; or fourth, that the State prosecution does not achieve a \njust result and the evidence warrants a subsequent Federal prosecution.\n  Those are very limiting factors because they effectively give the \nStates veto rights over Federal jurisdiction. We are talking about \nhaving an extremely effective remedy, one that will be in the interest \nof justice but one that is carefully sharpened in terms of its scope to \nmake sure that we maintain local involvement and consider local \npriorities.\n  The point is made that the Federal Hate Crimes Act would, in many \ncases, continue to overlap State jurisdiction. People have opposed this \nproposal for that reason. Violent crimes, whether motivated by \ndiscriminatory animus or not are generally covered under State law, and \nsuch an overlap is common. For example, there is overlapping Federal \njurisdiction in cases of many homicides, in bank robberies, in \nkidnapings, in fraud, and other crimes.\n  We have been willing to do it in other circumstances, and I believe \nthat we must have overlapping jurisdiction for violent crimes based on \nanimus and hatred as well. We must take meaningful steps to do \nsomething about it. Clearly, I think we have an important \nresponsibility to act.\n  The importance of the amendment is to provide a backstop to State and \nlocal enforcement by allowing a Federal prosecution, if it is \nnecessary, to achieve an effective just result and to permit Federal \nauthorities to assist in local investigations.\n  As has been mentioned, every Federal prosecutor would have to prove \nmotivation beyond a reasonable doubt in all cases. The prosecution \nwould present evidence that indicated that a motivating factor in the \ndefendant's conduct was bias against a particular group. That is a \nquestion for the jury to decide. Obviously, the prosecutor must \nconvince the jury that the crime was based upon bias in order to secure \na conviction.\n  I withhold and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the comments of my \ncolleague. He knows I have great respect for him in regard to civil \nrights matters. I have great commendation for him. I feel deeply, as he \ndoes. However, there is no use kidding about it. I\n\n[[Page S5349]]\n\nthink we ought to be prudent in the approach that we take. I think we \nought to be constitutionally sound as well.\n  In all of the comments of my dear friend, he still hasn't answered \nthis basic question, which is: Can those who are pushing this very \nbroad legislation that would federalize all hate crimes--and all crimes \nare hate crimes, by the way. I believe that is, if not wholly true, \ncertainly substantially true--but can those who want to enact this \nbroad legislation federalizing all hate-motivated crimes tell me the \nnumber of instances, if any, in which State or local authorities have \nrefused or failed to investigate and prosecute hate crimes? If there \nare any cases in which State or local authorities have refused or \nfailed to investigate and prosecute a hate crime, was it because the \nState or the local jurisdiction was unwilling, for whatever reason, to \nbring the prosecution?\n  These questions haven't been answered. We asked them at the hearings, \nand the Justice Department couldn't answer them. In fact, Deputy \nAttorney General Holder testified that States and localities should be \nresponsible for prosecuting the overwhelming majority of hate crimes. \nHe said:\n\n       State and local officials are on the front lines and do an \n     enormous job in investigating and prosecuting hate crimes \n     that occur in their communities. In fact, most hate crimes \n     are investigated and prosecuted at the State level.\n\n  That is the Deputy Attorney General of the United States of America.\n  We have never denied that hate crimes are occurring. Nobody can deny \nthat. I want to get rid of them as much as anybody--certainly as much \nas the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts.\n  But we have yet to hear of specific instances where States have \nfailed or refused to prosecute. We have heard lots of horrific stories \nabout hate crimes from Senators Kennedy, Reid, and Durbin. But I think \nthey have neglected to finish the story.\n  In each case, the Shepard case and the Byrd case, for example--\nheinous crimes, no question about it--that should never have occurred; \nthat should have been prosecuted; and were prosecuted. The State \nprosecutors investigated those cases. They prosecuted the defendants. \nIn the Byrd case, the prosecutors even obtained the death penalty, \nsomething that could not be obtained if the Kennedy amendment had been \npassed and the Federal Government had brought the case. Think about \nthat. I think some crimes are so heinous that the death penalty should \nbe imposed. Certainly the Byrd case, where racists chained James Byrd \nto a truck and dragged him to death on a back road in Jasper, Texas, \nwarranted the death penalty. But in all of those cases, there ought to \nbe absolute proof of guilt. The crime ought to be so heinous that it \njustifies the penalty, and there should be no substantial evidence of \ndiscrimination. In the Byrd case and the Shepard case, the defendants \nwere fully prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\n  The question is not whether hate crimes are occurring. They are. We \nhave them in our society--the greatest society in the world. We have \nsome hate crimes. They are occurring. We all know it. They are \noccurring, and they are horrific and are to be abhorred. The question, \nthough, is whether the States are adequately fighting these hate \ncrimes, or whether we need to make a Federal case out of every hate-\nmotivated crime.\n  My amendment calls for an analysis of that question. If my amendment \npasses and causes an analysis of that question, and we conclude that \nhate crimes are not being prosecuted by the State and local \nprosecutors, my gosh, I think then we are justified to federalize, if \nwe can do it constitutionally, many of these crimes.\n\n  A prudent thing, in my view in light of the constitutional questions \nthat are raised by the Kennedy amendment, would be to do the analysis \nfirst.\n  But my amendment does more than that. My amendment provides funds to \nassist State and local authorities in investigating and prosecuting \nhate-motivated crimes. My amendment provides resources and materials to \nbe able to help States and localities with hate crimes. We are not \nignoring the problems that exist.\n  Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder conceded in his testimony before \nour committee, and he acknowledged that an analysis of the hate crimes \nstatistics that have been collected needs to be conducted to determine \nwhether State and local authorities are failing to combat hate crimes. \nEric Holder testified that the statistics we have are, to use his term, \n``inadequate.'' In his testimony, Deputy Attorney General Holder \nrepeatedly argued that the Justice Department should be permitted to \ninvolve itself in local hate crime cases where local authorities are \n``unable or unwilling to prosecute the case.'' Holder admitted in his \ntestimony that there are ``not very many'' instances--later in his \ntestimony, he said, ``rare instances''--where local jurisdictions, for \nwhatever reason, are unwilling to proceed in cases that the Justice \nDepartment ``thinks should be prosecuted.''\n  At the hearing, I asked Deputy Attorney General Holder if he could \nidentify ``any specific instances in which State law enforcement \nauthorities have deliberately failed to enforce the law against the \nperpetrator of a crime.'' I asked him a specific question, to give me \nany specific instances in which State law enforcement authorities have \ndeliberately failed to enforce the law against the perpetrator of a \ncrime.\n  I went further and I asked him, ``So the question is, can you give me \nspecific instances where the States have failed in their duty to \ninvestigate and prosecute hate crimes.'' Deputy Attorney General Holder \nresponded with only a handful of specific instances--and they were not \ninstances where the State or local authorities refused to act but \ninstances where the Justice Department felt that it would have tried \nthe case differently or sought a harsher sentence, or where the Justice \nDepartment was not pleased with the verdict that State prosecutors \nobtained. The few cases Holder identified generally were not cases \nwhere State officials abdicated their responsibility to investigate and \nprosecute hate-motivated crimes.\n  I have to believe there may be some such cases, but the ones Mr. \nHolder identified were not persuasive. They did not show any widespread \npattern of State and local authorities refusing or failing to \ninvestigate and prosecute hate crimes. I am happy to receive them from \nmy distinguished friend from Massachusetts, and I am sure he may be \nable to cite some. Are there so many of them that we justify \nfederalizing all hate crimes and dipping the Federal nose into \neverything that is done on the State and local levels? I don't know--in \nmy mind, the case for doing so has not yet been made.\n  Deputy Attorney General Holder also testified that no hate crimes \nlegislation is worthwhile if it is invalidated as unconstitutional. It \nwould be one thing if we were talking about a Supreme Court case that \nwas decided 100 years ago. We are talking about a case, however, the \nMorrison case, that was decided one month ago and invalidates exactly \nwhat Senator Kennedy is doing today. If we find out that States are \nrefusing to prosecute hate crimes, then we would be justified under the \n14th amendment in enacting legislation directed at State officials or \npeople acting under color of law who are denying victims of hate crimes \nthe equal protection of the laws. If that were shown, then we would be \njustified, especially if such conduct were pervasive, or especially if \nthere were a considerable number of cases where State officials were \ndenying the equal protection of the laws by refusing to prosecute \ncrimes committed against certain groups or classes of people. The \nsupporters of the Kennedy amendment, I have to believe, will be able to \ncome up with one, or two, or maybe three cases where State officials \ndenied the equal protection of the laws in this manner. But even if \nthen can, would that justify federalizing all hate crimes?\n  Mr. President, 95 percent of all criminal activity is prosecuted in \nState and local jurisdictions--95 percent. There are good reasons for \nthat. Frankly, they do every bit as good a job as Federal prosecutors \ndo.\n  But if you put in ``gender,'' as Senator Kennedy does in his \namendment, then every rape or assault becomes a Federal crime. I can \njust hear some of the very radical groups demanding that U.S. attorneys \nin Federal court bring cases in every rape case because every rape, in \nmy opinion, is a hate crime.\n\n[[Page S5350]]\n\n However, there is no evidence that the States are not handling those \nsorts of cases properly. They may be in a better position to handle \nthem well. It may be that the federal government needs to provide \nenough money, so that as a backup, the DNA postconviction and even \npreconviction DNA testing can be conducted and we can see that justice \nis done.\n  I am not unwilling to consider doing that. In fact, I am considering \ndoing just that. I take no second seat to any Senator in this Chamber \nin the desire to get rid of hate crimes. But I do think you have to be \nwise and you can't just emotionally do it because you want to \nfederalize things and you want to get control of them, when, in fact, \nthe State and local governments are doing a fairly decent job. If they \nare not, that is another matter. I want to see the statistics. That is \none reason I want a study, an analysis of these matters, so that we can \nknow.\n\n  Senator Kennedy and I fought on this very floor for the Hate Crimes \nStatistics Act. I have taken a lot of abuse through the years for \nhaving done so by some on the conservative side, and by some on the \nliberal side for not doing more. We have the statistics. We have a \npretty good idea that these crimes are being committed. We just haven't \ngot an analysis, nor do we have the facts, on whether the States are \ndoing an adequate job of combating these crimes. And why should we go \nblundering ahead, federalizing all these crimes, when we are not really \nsure that the State and local governments are not doing a good job. In \nfact, the evidence I have seen appears to show that the States are \ntaking their responsibilities in this area seriously.\n  My amendment does a lot. It calls for a study to determine whether \nthese hate-motivated crimes are not being prosecuted at the State level \nin the manner that they should be. There are those in our body who even \nfight against that. I am talking about the Congress as a whole. I hope \nthere is nobody in the Senate who would fight against that. We should \ndo an analysis and a study. We should know. We have the statistics.\n  I do want to clear up one thing. The Department of Justice did send \nup a handful of cases in which the Department felt the result in hate \ncrime litigation was inadequate. But the very few cases they identified \nin no way justify this type of expansive legislation. That is what I am \nconcerned about.\n  Now, if we find that the States are refusing to do their jobs, that \nis another matter. We would be justified under the equal protection \nclause of the 14th amendment to enact remedial legislation prohibiting \nthe States from denying our citizens the equal protection of the laws \nby refusing or failing to combat hate crimes.\n  Supporters of the Kennedy amendment argue that their amendment is \nlimited because the Justice Department could exercise jurisdiction only \nin four instances. Supporters of the Kennedy amendment call these \ninstances ``exceptions''--as in the Justice Department will not \nexercise jurisdiction over State prosecutions of hate crimes, \n``except'' when one of the four circumstances outlined in the amendment \nis present. But these so-called ``exceptions'' to the exercise of \nfederal jurisdiction are exceptions that swallow the rule.\n  The Kennedy amendment raises serious constitutional decisions or \nquestions. The amendment is not consistent with the Supreme Court's \ndecisions in United States v. Lopez and United States v. Morrison, just \ndecided last month. The amendment attempts to federalize crimes \ncommitted because of the victim's actual or perceived race, color, \nreligion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or disability.\n  Last month's Supreme Court decision in United States v. Morrison \nchanged the legal landscape with regard to congressional power vis-a-\nvis the States. In light of the Morrison decision, we first should take \nadequate steps to ensure that legislation is constitutional. And where \nserious constitutional questions are raised, we should responsibly \npursue less intrusive alternatives. In the case of hate crimes \nlegislation, we should at least determine whether a broad \nfederalization of these crimes is needed, and whether a broad \nfederalization of these crimes would be constitutional in light of \nMorrison. What may have been constitutional in our minds pre-Morrison \nmay not be constitutional today.\n  I was the primary cosponsor of the Violence Against Women Act. It may \nnever have come up had Senator Biden and I not pushed it as hard as we \ndid. I believed it was constitutional at the time, or I wouldn't have \ndone it. But it clearly was stricken as unconstitutional by the Supreme \nCourt.\n  As the father of three daughters and a great number of \ngranddaughters, I certainly want women protected in our society. If the \nState and local governments are not doing that, I will find some way. I \nthink perhaps Senator Kennedy, I, and others of good faith can find \nsome way of making sure that these wrongs are righted.\n  But Congress has a duty to make sure that legislation it enacts is \nconstitutional. Justice Scalia, as I stated earlier, recently \ncriticized Congress for failing to consider whether legislation is \nconstitutional before enacting it. Here is what he said:\n\n       My court is fond of saying that acts of Congress come to \n     the court with the presumption of constitutionality. But if \n     Congress is going to take the attitude that it will do \n     anything it can get away with, and let the Supreme Court \n     worry about the Constitution [let the Supreme Court worry] \n     perhaps the presumption is unwarranted.\n\n  He is saying that we have a constitutional obligation to live within \nthe constraints of the Constitution. Although Morrison was a 5-4 \ndecision, as many important decisions are, it is the supreme law of \nthis land. And the Kennedy approach is unconstitutional.\n\n  It is unconstitutional because under the 14th amendment it seeks to \ncriminalize purely private conduct. In the Morrison case, the Supreme \nCourt reaffirmed that legislation enacted by Congress under the 14th \nAmendment may only criminalize State action, not individual action. So \nit really is unconstitutional from that standpoint, from the standpoint \nof the 14th Amendment.\n  In addition, the Kennedy amendment is unconstitutional under the \ncommerce clause. In Morrison, the Supreme Court emphasized that the \nconduct regulated by Congress under the commerce clause must be ``some \nsort of economic endeavor. Here, the conduct sought to be regulated--\nthe commission of hate crimes--is in no sense economic or commercial, \nbut instead is non-economic and criminal in nature. Accordingly, it is \njust like the non-economic conduct Congress sought to regulate in the \nGun Free Schools Zones Act and the Violence Against Women Act--statutes \nheld to be unconstitutional in Lopez and Morrison.\n  In an effort to be constitutional, the Kennedy amendment provides \nthat federal jurisdiction can only be exercised in four circumstances \nwhere there is some sort of link to interstate commerce. These \ncircumstances, however, probably do not make the amendment \nconstitutional.\n  First, the interstate travel circumstance set forth in the Kennedy \namendment arguably may provide an interstate nexus, but it does nothing \nto change the criminal, generally non-economic nature of a hate crime. \nThe same can be said for the other circumstances set forth in the \nKennedy amendment authorizing the exercise of federal jurisdiction. The \nsecond circumstance's requirement, that the crime be committed by using \na ``channel, facility or instrumentality of interstate'' commerce, also \nmay provide a interstate nexus, but it is unclear precisely what hate \ncrimes that would encompass: hijacking a plane or blowing up a rail \nline in connection with a hate crime? Such occurrences, if happening at \nall, surely are so infrequent as to make the Kennedy amendment \nunnecessary. And I might add, in these cases they have been prosecuted \nby state and local officials who have the right and power to do so. So \nthere seems little or no reason to want the Kennedy amendment on that \nbasis. But without some economic activity, it still makes you wonder.\n  The third circumstance's requirement that the defendant have used a \nweapon that traveled in interstate commerce would eviscerate the limits \non commerce clause authority the Court stressed in Lopez and Morrison. \nIf using a weapon that happened to have traveled in interstate commerce \nto commit a hate crime provides a sufficient interstate nexus \nauthorizing congressional action federalizing hate\n\n[[Page S5351]]\n\ncrimes, then by the same logic Congress could federalize essentially \nall State crimes where a firearm or other weapon is used. And that \nwould include most homicides had assault cases.\n  The fourth circumstance's requirement that the victim be working and \nthat the hate crime interfere with such working is analogous to the \nreasoning the Court rejected in Morrison. In Morrison, the Court \nrejected the argument that gender-motivated violence substantially \naffects interstate commerce. It can only be presumed that the Court \nwould similarly conclude that violence motivated by disability, \nsexual orientation or gender--again--does not substantially affect \ninterstate commerce. The Court in Morrison and in Lopez rejected these \n``costs of crime'' and ``national productivity'' arguments because they \nwould permit Congress to regulate not only all violent crime, but all \nactivities that might lead to violent crime, regardless of how \ntenuously they relate to interstate commerce.\n\n  Finally, the Kennedy amendment's catch-all provision--that federal \nprosecution is permitted where the hate crime ``otherwise affects \ninterstate or foreign commerce''--not only merely restates the \nconstitutional test, it restates it wrongly. Under Lopez and Morrison, \nthe conduct sought to be regulated under the commerce clause must \n``substantially affect'' interstate commerce. The Kennedy amendment \nprovides for a much lower standard.\n  With regard to the first amendment, the Kennedy amendment also has \nthe potential to have a chilling effect on constitutionally protected \nspeech. Under the amendment, the Federal Government could obtain a \ncriminal conviction on the basis of evidence of speech that had no role \nin the chain of events that led to any alleged violent act proscribed \nby the statute. Evidence that a person holds racist or other bigoted \nviews that are unrelated to the underlying crime cannot form the basis \nfor a prosecution--otherwise the statute would be unconstitutional \nunder the first amendment.\n  The Kennedy hate crimes amendment is also bad policy. It would place \nsignificant burdens on federal law enforcement and Federal courts, \nundermine State sentencing regimes, and unduly interfere with State \nprosecution of violent crime.\n  The Kennedy amendment prohibits hate crimes based upon the victims \ngender. I mentioned this earlier. Accordingly, the amendment, on its \nface, could effectively federalize all rapes and sexual assaults. Not \nonly would such a statute likely be unconstitutional, it also would be \nbad policy. Seizing the authority to investigate and prosecute all \nincidents of rape and sexual assault from the States could impose a \nhuge burden on Federal law enforcement agencies, Federal prosecutors, \nand the federal judiciary.\n  I know that the Supreme Court is very concerned about the \nproliferation of federal crimes, as are all Federal courts in our \ncountry. They think we federalize far too many laws when, in fact, the \nStates are doing a good job in prosecuting those crimes. And there is \nlittle or no reason for us to intrude that much on State laws when they \nare doing a good job.\n  Authorities in Jasper, TX, secured a death penalty against the \nmurderers of James Byrd, Jr., without either State or Federal hate \ncrimes legislation. In contrast, the Kennedy amendment does not provide \nfor the death penalty, even in the case of the most heinous hate \ncrimes. Under the Kennedy amendment, then, a State could prosecute the \nsame criminal acts more harshly than under the Kennedy hate crimes \namendment. As a result, the Kennedy amendment would provide a lesser \ndeterrent against hate-based criminal conduct.\n  If there was ever a case justifying the death penalty, it certainly \nwas the case of James Byrd, Jr. But then again it makes my point. The \nState and local prosecutors were fully capable of taking care of this \nmatter. And why should we intrude the Federal Government's unwanted \nnose under the tent in this matter when the States are perfectly \ncapable of taking care of these matters.\n  The Kennedy amendment also would unduly interfere with state \nprosecutions of hate crimes. Contrary to claims by supporters of the \nKennedy amendment, the amendment would not defer to State or local \nauthorities at all. The amendment leaves the Justice Department free to \ninsert itself in a local prosecution at the beginning, middle or end of \nthe prosecution, and even after the local prosecutor has obtained a \nguilty verdict.\n  Even if State or local authorities inform the federal government that \nthey intend to prosecute the case and object to Federal interference, \nthe Justice Department, nevertheless, is empowered by the amendment to \nexert enormous pressure on local prosecutors regarding the manner in \nwhich they handle the case, from charging decisions to plea bargaining \ndecisions to sentencing decisions. In essence, the federal government \ncan always exercise jurisdiction under the Kennedy amendment. And in so \ndoing, the Kennedy amendment works an unwarranted expansion of federal \nauthority to prosecute defendants--even when a competent State \nprosecution is available.\n  In my view, hate crimes can be more sinister than non-hate crimes. A \ncrime committed not only to harm an individual, but out of the motive \nof sending a message of hatred to an entire community--often a \ncommunity that historically has been the subject of prejudice or \ndiscrimination--is appropriately punished more harshly or in a \ndifferent manner than other crimes.\n  In Wisconsin versus Mitchell, the Supreme Court essentially agreed \nthat the motive behind the crime can make the crime more sinister and \nmore worthy of harsher punishment. In that case, the Court upheld the \nState of Wisconsin's sentencing enhancement for hate crimes.\n  There is a limited role for the federal government to play in \ncombating hate crime. The federal government can assist State and local \nauthorities in investigating and prosecuting hate crimes. In addition, \nthe Hate Crimes Statistics Act of 1990, which I sponsored, provides for \nthe nationwide collection of data regarding hate crimes.\n  Because I believe there is a federal role to play, I have introduced \nlegislation, held hearings, and am offering this amendment today. The \nFederal government has a responsibility to help States and local \ngovernments solve our country's problem of hate-motivated crime.\n  But for a federal response to be meaningful, it must abide by the \nlimitations imposed on Congress by the constitution, as interpreted by \nthe Supreme Court. This is especially true today in light of the \nSupreme Court's decisions in Lopez and Morrison, which emphasized that \nthere are limits on congressional power. The Morrison case was decided \njust last month and changed the legal landscape regarding congressional \npower in relation to the States.\n  We should be concerned, as the Supreme Court is, about the \nproliferation of companion Federal crimes in areas where State criminal \nstatutes are sufficient. The Kennedy amendment would vastly expand the \npower and jurisdiction of the Federal Government to intervene in local \nlaw enforcement matters.\n  Repeatedly, supporters of the Kennedy amendment have argued the State \nand local authorities are either ``unable or unwilling'' to investigate \nthe prosecute hate crimes. Let's examine this rationale closely.\n  First, the argument that State and local authorities are unable to \nget serious about hate crimes: I do not dispute that in certain cases \nthe resources of local jurisdictions may be inadequate. We can solve \nthat. But that cannot mean that we therefore should federalize these \ncrimes. That soft-headed logic would lead us to argue that because \nState and local resources are inadequate to, for example, educate our \nyoung people in some parts of the country, then the Federal Government \nshould conduct a nationwide takeover of elementary and secondary \neducation. That, of course, would be the wrong solution. The right \nsolution to a problem involving inadequate resources at the local level \nis to try to provide some Federal assistance where requested and where \nneeded. That is what my amendment does.\n  If it is not enough money, then let's beef up the money. That is what \nmy amendment does. It provides the monetary means whereby we can assist \nthe States if they do not have the money to investigate and prosecute \nhate-motivated crimes. With regard to postconviction DNA evidence, it \nmay mean we have to do more from a Federal Government standpoint.\n\n[[Page S5352]]\n\n  Second, I have even more difficulty stomaching the second argument \nput forth by supporters of the Kennedy amendment, that State and local \nauthorities are unwilling to get serious about hate crimes. I admit \nthat I am not certain what the supporters of the Kennedy amendment mean \nwhen they say ``unwilling.'' I assume that we all understand and \nappreciate that in numerous cases State and local officials are \nunwilling to go forward because the evidence does not warrant going \nforward. Supporters of the Kennedy amendment cannot possibly mean to \ncover all of these cases. So what do they mean? A subset of these \ncases? Does the Federal Government intend to review every case where \nlocal officials fail to go forward, second guess their judgments, and \nthen pick and chose on which of those cases they want to proceed? The \ntrue answer is that no one knows what supporters of the Kennedy \namendment mean when they claim that States are ``unwilling'' to deal \nwith hate crimes.\n  If we want to act responsibly and sensibly, we ought to do what I \nsuggest in my amendment--(1) conduct a comprehensive analysis of \nwhether there, in fact, is unwillingness at the local level in the \nhandling of crimes motivates against persons because of their \nmembership in a particular class or group and (2) provide some grant \nmonies to States who may lack resources.\n  The amendment I have offered does not go as far as legislation I have \noffered in the past, but this is not because I do not believe that hate \ncrimes are not a problem. Rather, it is because the Supreme Court has \nruled as recently as a month ago in this area, and I do not think we \ncan ignore that. The recent decision in Morrison requires that we step \nback and prudently assess whether legislation like the Kennedy \namendment would pass constitutional muster, and I think more than an \noverwhelming case can be made that it does not.\n  Let's assume that if this amendment is ultimately adopted, and 2 or 3 \nyears from now the Supreme Court decides the case based upon that \namendment, and I am right and the Kennedy amendment is overturned, that \nmeans we are 3 more years down the line unable to do anything about \nhate crimes in our society when, if we do the appropriate analysis and \nget the information and do not walk in there emotionally, and try to \ngive the State and local governments the monetary support and the other \ntypes of support we describe in our amendment, we could start tomorrow \ncombating hate crimes at the federal level. The day my amendment is \npassed doing something about hate crimes, that will really be \nsubstantial and will work. It is a throw of the dice if we adopt the \nKennedy amendment and that becomes law because I do not believe it can \nbe possibly upheld by the Supreme Court in light of current \nconstitutional law.\n  My amendment is very limited and does not raise the constitutional \nquestions raised by the Kennedy amendment. At the same time, it \nprovides for Federal assistance to State and local authorities in \ncombating hate crimes.\n  With regard to both amendments, I find no fault at all--in fact, I \ncommend my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts, my friend from \nOregon, and others who are pushing the Kennedy amendment because they \nbelieve something has to be done about hate crimes in our society. I \nfind no fault with that. In fact, I admire them for doing that. I find \nno fault with people trying to write laws, but I do believe we can be 3 \nyears down the line and lose all that time in making headway against \nhate criminal activity in our society.\n  Where, if we do it right today and do it in a constitutionally sound \nway, as my amendment does, then we will have truly accomplished \nsomething. Perhaps we can get together and find some way of doing this \nso it brings everybody together; I would like to see all civil rights \nbills, all bills that involve equal protection under the laws pass \nunanimously, if we can. I want to work to that end.\n  I pledge to work with my colleagues from Massachusetts, Oregon, \nVermont, and others in this body in trying to get us there. We are all \nafter the same thing, and that is to have a better society so that \npeople realize there are laws by which they have to live, that there \nare moral laws by which they should live, and that people realize this \nsociety has been a great society and will continue to be, the more we \nare concerned about our fellow men and women and equality under the \nlaw.\n  We differ on the ways to get there at this point. Maybe we can get \ntogether and find some way of resolving the differences. I find no \nfault with my colleagues, other than that I think Morrison is so clear, \nand it was decided only a month ago. I do find fault in that sense, to \npush an amendment probably is unconstitutional.\n  I find no fault with the motivations behind those supporting the \nKennedy amendment. In fact, I am very proud of my colleagues for \nwanting to do something in this area, to make a difference in our \nsociety and help our society be even better. I commend them and thank \nthem for their efforts in that regard, but I do think we ought to do it \nin a constitutional way. I do think we ought to do it in a thoughtful \nway. I do think we ought to do it in an analytical way. I do think we \nought do it in a way that will bring people together, not split them \napart. And I do think we ought to do it in a way that will help State \nand local prosecutors, rather than Federal prosecutors, to handle these \ncases in manners that are proper and acceptable in our society. I do \nthink it ought to be done in a way that does not burden our Federal \ncourts with a plethora of cases, in addition to the drug cases \nburdening our courts today, when State and local governments are \ntotally capable of taking care of it, perhaps with some monetary \nassistance from the Federal Government.\n  I look forward to finding a way whereby Senator Leahy and I and \nothers can get together to resolve these problems of postconviction DNA \ntesting because regardless of where one stands on the death penalty, \nfor or against it, that is not the issue. The issue is justice, and \nthat is what the issue is here as well.\n  Does anyone in this body think I like opposing this amendment? I \ndon't think so. I have stood up on too many of these matters for them \nto think that. But defending the Constitution is more important to me \nthan ``feeling good'' about things or just ``feeling emotional'' about \nthings. I do feel emotionally about hate crimes. I do want to stamp \nthem out. I do want to get rid of them. I want to start now, not 3 \nyears from now when we have to start all over again because the Court \nrules that the Kennedy amendment is unconstitutional.\n  I have taken enough time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on tomorrow we will have the opportunity \nto choose between the proposal of the Senator from Utah and the \namendment Senator Smith and I are recommending to our colleagues.\n  When it is all said and done, as I mentioned earlier, the proposal \nthat has been put forward by my friend and colleague from Utah is \nbasically to conduct a study about the problems and frequency of hate \ncrimes, permits up to $5 million in authorization, and permits the \nJustice Department to provide grants for prosecution. That is really \nthe extent of the amendment of the Senator from Utah.\n  He has outlined his reasons for supporting that particular approach. \nI heard him say earlier he believes that it is really going to solve \nthe problem and that it is going to really deal with the issue of hate \ncrimes. Of course, I do not believe that to be the case.\n  We reviewed this issue on a number of different occasions in the \nJudiciary Committee. I understand his position. I respect it, although \nI do have some difficulties in being persuaded by it this evening.\n  For example, he basically has not questioned the existing limited \nhate crimes legislation that is on the books, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 245, \ndealing with the issue of race, color, religion, and national origin in \nour society, even though it is restricted in its application. He did \nnot say we ought to eliminate that situation. He did not really refer \nto eliminating current hate crimes law.\n  The fact is, we have very limited hate crimes legislation on the \nbooks. Current law is restricted, as the Justice Department testified \nbefore the Judiciary Committee, in ways that virtually deny \naccountability for the serious hate crimes that are committed by \nindividuals on the basis of race, color,\n\n[[Page S5353]]\n\nreligion, or national origin in our society. Specifically, it requires \nthe federal government to prove that the victim was engaged in a \nfederally protected activity during the commission of the crime. We are \ntrying to address this deficiency and to expand current law to include \ngender, disability, and sexual orientation.\n  Those of us who will favor our position tomorrow believe the ultimate \nguarantor of the right for privacy, liberty, and individual safety and \nsecurity in our society is the Constitution of the United States. That \nis where the repository for protecting our rights and our liberties is \nenshrined. It is enshrined in the Constitution, as interpreted by the \nSupreme Court. But ultimately we are the ones who help define the \nextent of the Constitution's protection.\n  When we find that we have inadequate protection for citizens because \nof sexual orientation, or gender, or race, that challenge cries out for \nus to take action.\n  My good friend from Utah does not mind federalizing class action \nsuits to bring them into the Federal court. He does not mind \nfederalizing property issues in the takings legislation, to bring those \ninto Federal court. For computer fraud, he does not mind bringing those \ncrimes in Federal courts. But do not bring in Federal power to do \nsomething about hate crimes. I find that absolutely extraordinary.\n  Why are we putting great protection for property rights and computer \nfraud and class actions into Federal court, giving them preference over \ndoing something about the problems of hate crimes in our society that \neven Senator Hatch admits are taking place? We see from the data \ncollected by the FBI and various studies that hate crimes are taking \nplace. That is a fact. Look at the statistics that have been collected \nover the last few years, from 1995 through 1998. We see what is \nhappening with regard to race, religion, national origin, ethnic \nbackground, sexual orientation, and disability. As we have heard from \nthe FBI and the Justice Department, they believe the FBI statistics \nvastly underestimate what is happening in our society.\n\n  The fact is, hate crimes are unlike any other crimes. Listening to \nthe discussion of those who are opposed to our amendment, one would \nthink these crimes were similar to pick-pocketing cases, misdemeanors, \nor traffic violations.\n  The kind of impact that hate crimes have in terms of not only the \nindividual but the community is well understood. It should be well \nunderstood by communities and individuals. I do not have to take the \ntime to quote what the American Psychological Society says about the \nenduring kind of burden that individuals undergo when they have been \nthe victims of hate crimes over the course of their lifetime, even in \ncontrast to other crimes of violence against individuals. It has a \ndifferent flavor, and it has an impact on the victim, the family and \nthe community. Hate crimes are an outrageous reflection of bigotry and \nhatred based on bias that cannot be tolerated in our society.\n  We have an opportunity to take some moderate steps to do something \nabout it--to untie the hands of the Department of Justice. That is what \ntomorrow's vote is about. We have the constitutional authorities on our \nside, including the Justice Department, and others.\n  I will include the list of distinguished constitutional authorities \nthat are supporting our positions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the U.S. Department of \nJustice letter dated June 13, 2000, on the constitutionality of the \nLocal Law Enforcement Enhancement Act of 2000 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 13, 2000.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: This letter responds to your request \n     for our views on the constitutionality of a proposed \n     legislative amendment entitled the ``Local Law Enforcement \n     Enhancement Act of 2000.'' Section 7(a) of the bill would \n     amend title 18 of the United States Code to create a new \n     Sec. 249, which would establish two criminal prohibitions \n     called ``hate crime acts.'' First, proposed Sec. 249(a)(1) \n     would prohibit willfully causing bodily injury to any person, \n     or attempting to cause bodily injury to any person through \n     the use of fire, a firearm, or an explosive or incendiary \n     device, ``because of the actual or perceived race, color, \n     religion, or national origin of any person.'' Second, \n     proposed Sec. 249(a)(2) would prohibit willfully causing \n     bodily injury to any person, or attempting to cause bodily \n     injury to any person through the use of fire, a firearm, or \n     an explosive or incendiary device, ``because of the actual or \n     perceived religion, national origin, gender, sexual \n     orientation, or disability of any person,'' \n     Sec. 249(a)(2)(A), but only if the conduct occurs in at least \n     one of a series of defined ``circumstances'' that have an \n     explicit connection with or effect on interstate or foreign \n     commerce, Sec. 249(a)(2)(B).\n       In light of United States v. Morrison, 120 S. Ct. 1740 \n     (2000), and other recent Supreme Court decisions, defendants \n     might challenge the constitutionality of their convictions \n     under Sec. 249 on the ground that Congress lacks power to \n     enact the proposed statute. We believe, for the reasons set \n     forth below, that the statute would be constitutional under \n     governing Supreme Court precedents. We consider in turn the \n     two proposed new crimes that would be created in Sec. 249.\n\n\n                  1. proposed 18 u.s.c. Sec. 249(a)(1)\n\n       Congress may prohibit the first category of hate crime acts \n     that would be proscribed--actual or attempted violence \n     directed at persons ``because of the[ir] actual or perceived \n     race, color, religion, or national origin,'' Sec. 249(a)(1)--\n     pursuant to its power to enforce the Thirteenth Amendment to \n     the United States Constitution. Section 1 of that amendment \n     provides, in relevant part, ``[n]either slavery nor \n     involuntary servitude . . . shall exist within the United \n     States.'' Section 2 provides, ``Congress shall have power to \n     enforce this article by appropriate legislation.''\n       Under the Thirteenth Amendment, Congress has the authority \n     not only to prevent the ``actual imposition of slavery or \n     involuntary servitude,'' but to ensure that none of the \n     ``badges and incidents'' of slavery or involuntary servitude \n     exists in the United States, Griffin v. Breckinridge, 403 \n     U.S. 88, 105 (1971); see Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 \n     U.S. 409, 440-43 (1968) (discussing Congress's power to \n     eliminate the ``badges,'' ``incidents,'' and ``relic[s]'' of \n     slavery). `` `Congress has the power under the Thirteenth \n     Amendment rationally to determine what the badges and \n     incidents of slavery, and the authority to translate that \n     determination into effective legislation.' '' Griffin, 403 \n     U.S. at 105 (quoting Jones, 392 U.S. at 440); see also Civil \n     Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3, 21 (1883) (``Congress has a right \n     to enact all necessary and proper laws for the obliteration \n     and prevention of slavery, with all its badges and \n     incidents''). In so legislating, Congress may impose \n     liability not only for state action, but for ``varieties of \n     private conduct,'' as well. Griffin, 403 U.S. at 105.\n       Section 2(10) of the bill's findings provides, in relevant \n     part, that ``eliminating racially motivated violence is an \n     important means of eliminating, to the extent possible, the \n     badges, incidents, and relics of slavery and involuntary \n     servitude,'' and that ``[s]lavery and involuntary servitude \n     were enforced . . . through widespread public and private \n     violence directed at persons because of their race.'' So long \n     as Congress may rationally reach such determinations--and we \n     believe Congress plainly could--the prohibition of racially \n     motivated violence would be a permissible exercise of \n     Congress's broad authority to enforce the Thirteenth \n     Amendment.\n       That the bill would prohibit violence against not only \n     African Americans but also persons of other races does not \n     alter our conclusion. While it is true that the institution \n     of slavery in the United States, the abolition of which was \n     the primary impetus for the Thirteenth Amendment, primarily \n     involved the subjugation of African Americans, it is well-\n     established by Supreme Court precedent that Congress's \n     authority to abolish the badges and incidents of slavery \n     extends ``to legisla[tion] in regard to `every race and \n     individual.' '' McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., 427 \n     U.S. 273, 288 n.18 (1976) (quoting Hodges v. United States, \n     203 U.S. 1, 16-17 (1906), and citing Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer \n     Co., 392 U.S. 409, 441 n.78 (1968)). In McDonald, for \n     example, the Supreme Court held that 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981, \n     a Reconstruction-era statute that was enacted pursuant to, \n     and contemporaneously with, the Thirteenth Amendment, \n     prohibits racial discrimination in the making and \n     enforcement of contracts against all persons, including \n     whites.--See McDonald, 427 U.S. at 286-96.\n       The question whether Congress may prohibit violence against \n     persons because of their actual or perceived religion or \n     national origin is more complex, but there is a substantial \n     basis to conclude that the Thirteenth Amendment grants \n     Congress that authority, at a minimum, with respect to some \n     religions and national origins. In Saint Francis College v. \n     Al-Khazraii, 481 U.S. 604, 613 (1987), the Court held that \n     the prohibition of discrimination in Sec. 1981 extends to \n     discrimination against Arabs, as Congress intended to protect \n     ``identifiable classes of persons who are subjected to \n     intentional discrimination solely because of their ancestry \n     or ethnic characteristics.'' Similarly, the Court in Shaare \n     Tefila Congregation v. Cobb, 481 U.S. 615, 617-18 (1987), \n     held that Jews can state a claim under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1982, \n     another Reconstruction-era antidiscrimination statute enacted \n     pursuant to, and contemporaneously\n\n[[Page S5354]]\n\n     with, the Thirteenth Amendment. In construing the reach of \n     these two Reconstruction-era statutes, the Supreme Court \n     found that Congress intended those statutes to extend to \n     groups like ``Arabs'' and ``Jews'' because those groups \n     ``were among the peoples [at the time the statutes were \n     adopted] considered to be distinct races.'' Id.; see also \n     Saint Francis College, 481 U.S. at 610-13. We thus believe \n     that Congress would have authority under the Thirteenth \n     Amendment to extend the prohibitions of proposed \n     Sec. 249(a)(1) to violence that is based on a victim's \n     religion or national origin, at least to the extent the \n     violence is directed at members of those religions or \n     national origins that would have been considered races at the \n     time of the adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment.\n       None of the Court's recent federalism decisions casts doubt \n     on Congress's powers under the Thirteenth Amendment to \n     eliminate the badges and incidents of slavery. Both Boerne v. \n     Flores, 521 U.S. 507 (1997), and United States v. Morrison, \n     120 S. Ct. 1740 (2000), involved legislation that was found \n     to exceed Congress's powers under the Fourteenth Amendment. \n     The Court in Morrison, for example, found that Congress \n     lacked the power to enact the civil remedy of the Violence \n     Against Women Act (``VAWA''), 42 U.S.C. Sec. 13981, pursuant \n     to the Fourteenth Amendment because that amendment's equal \n     protection guarantee extends only to ``state action,'' and \n     the private remedy there was not, in the Court's view, \n     sufficiently directed at such ``state action.'' 120 S. Ct. at \n     1756, 1758. The Thirteenth Amendment, however, plainly \n     reaches private conduct as well as government conduct, and \n     Congress thus is authorized to prohibit private action that \n     constitutes a badge, incident or relic of slavery. See \n     Griffin, 403 U.S. at 105; Jones, 392 U.S. at 440-43. \n     Enactment of the proposed Sec. 249(a)(1) therefore would be \n     within Congress's Thirteenth Amendment power.\n\n\n                  2. Proposed 18 U.S.C. Sec. 249(a)(2)\n\n       Congress may prohibit the second category of hate crime \n     acts that would be proscribed--certain instances of actual or \n     attempted violence directed at persons ``because of the[ir] \n     actual or perceived religion, national origin, gender, sexual \n     orientation, or disability,'' Sec. 249(a)(1)(A)--pursuant to \n     its power under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, art. \n     I., Sec. 8, cl. 3.\n       The Court in Morrison emphasized that ``even under our \n     modern, expansive interpretation of the Commerce Clause, \n     Congress' regulatory authority is not without effective \n     bounds.'' 120 S. Ct. at 1748; See also United States v. \n     Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 557-61 (1995). Consistent with the \n     Court's emphasis, the prohibitions of proposed Sec. 249(a)(2) \n     (in contrast to the provisions of proposed Sec. 249(a)(1), \n     discussed above), would not apply except where there is an \n     explicit and discrete connection between the proscribed \n     conduct and interstate or foreign commerce, a connection that \n     the government would be required to allege and prove in each \n     case.\n       In Lopez, the Court considered Congress's power to enact a \n     statute prohibiting the possession of firearms within 1000 \n     feet of a school. Conviction for a violation of that statute \n     required no proof of a jurisdictional nexus between the gun, \n     or the gun possession, and interstate commerce. The statute \n     included no findings from which the Court could find that the \n     possession of guns near schools substantially affected \n     interstate commerce and, in the Court's view, the possession \n     of a gun was not an economic activity itself. Under these \n     circumstances, the Court held that the statute exceeded \n     Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce because the \n     prohibited conduct could not be said to ``substantially \n     affect'' interstate commerce. Proposed Sec. 249(a)(2), by \n     contrast to the statute invalidated in Lopez, would require \n     pleading and proof of a specific jurisdictional nexus to \n     interstate commerce for each and every offense.\n       In Morrison, the Court applied its holding in Lopez to find \n     unconstitutional the civil remedy provided in VA WA, 42 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 13981. Like the prohibition of gun possession in \n     the statute at issue in Lopez, the VA WA civil remedy \n     required no pleading or proof of a connection between the \n     specific conduct prohibited by the statute and interstate \n     commerce. Although the VA WA statute was supported by \n     extensive congressional findings of the relationship between \n     violence against women and the national economy, the Court \n     was troubled that accepting this as a basis for legislation \n     under the Commerce Clause would permit Congress to regulate \n     anything, thus obliterating the ``distinction between what is \n     truly national and what is truly local.'' Morrison, 120 S. \n     Ct. at 1754 (citing Lopez, 514 U.S. at 568). By contrast, the \n     requirement in proposed Sec. 249(a)(2) of proof in each case \n     of a specific nexus between interstate commerce and the \n     proscribed conduct would ensure that only conduct that falls \n     within the Commerce power, and thus is ``truly national,'' \n     would be within the reach of that statutory provision.\n       The Court in Morrison emphasized, as it did in Lopez, 514 \n     U.S. at 561-62, that the statute the Court was invalidating \n     did not include an ``express jurisdictional element,'' 120 S. \n     Ct. at 1751, and compared this unfavorably to the criminal \n     provision of VA WA, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2261(a)(1), which does \n     include such a jurisdictional nexus. See id. at 1752 n.5. The \n     Court indicated that the presence of such a jurisdiction \n     nexus. See id. at 1752 n.5. The Court indicated that the \n     presence of such a jurisdictional nexus would go far towards \n     meeting its constitutional concerns:\n       ``The second consideration that we found important in \n     analyzing [the statute in Lopez] was that the statute \n     contained ``no express jurisdictional element which might \n     limit its reach to a discrete set of firearm possessions that \n     additionally have an explicit connection with or effect on \n     interstate commerce.'' [514 U.S.] at 562. Such a \n     jurisdictional element may establish that the enactment is in \n     pursuance of Congress' regulation of interstate commerce.''\n       Id. at 1750-51; see also id. at 1751-52 (``Although Lopez \n     makes clear that such a jurisdictional element would lend \n     support to the argument that [the provision at issue in \n     Morrison] is sufficiently tied to interstate commerce, \n     Congress elected to cast [the provision's] remedy over a \n     wider, and more purely intrastate, body of violent crime.'')\n       While the Court in Morrison stated that Congress may not \n     ``regulate noneconomic, violent criminal conduct based solely \n     on that conduct's aggregate effect on interstate commerce,'' \n     id. at 1754, the proposed regulation of violent conduct in \n     Sec. 249(a)(2) would not be based ``solely on that conduct's \n     aggregate effect on interstate commerce,'' but would instead \n     be based on a specific and discrete connection between each \n     instance of prohibited conduct and interstate or foreign \n     commerce. Specifically, with respect to violence because of \n     the actual or perceived religion, national origin, gender, \n     sexual orientation or disability of the victim, proposed \n     Sec. 249(a)(2) would require the government to prove one or \n     more specific jurisdictional commerce ``elements'' beyond a \n     reasonable doubt. This additional jurisdictional requirement \n     would reflect Congress's intent that Sec. 249(a)(2) reach \n     only a ``discrete set of [violent acts] that additionally \n     have an explicit connection with or effect on interstate \n     commerce,'' 120 S. Ct. at 1751 (quoting Lopez, 514 U.S. at \n     562), and would fundamentally distinguish this statute from \n     those that the Court invalidated in Lopez and in Morrison. \n     Absent such a jurisdictional element, there exists the risk \n     that ``a few random instances of interstate effects could be \n     used to justify regulation of a multitude of intrastate \n     transactions with no interstate effects.'' United States v. \n     Harrington, 108 F.3d 1460, 1467 (D.C. Cir. 1997). By \n     contrast, in the context of a statute with an interstate \n     jurisdictional element (such as in proposed \n     Sec. 249(a)(2)(B)), ``each case stands alone on its evidence \n     that a concrete and specific effect does exist.''\n       The jurisdictional elements in Sec. 249(a)(2)(B) would \n     ensure that each conviction under Sec. 249(a)(2) would \n     involve conduct that Congress has the power to regulate under \n     the Commerce Clause. In Morrison, the Court reiterated its \n     observation in Lopez that there are `` `three broad \n     categories of activity that Congress may regulate under its \n     commerce power.' '' 120 S. Ct. at 1749 (quoting Lopez, 514 \n     U.S. at 558):\n       ``First, Congress may regulate the use of the channels of \n     interstate commerce. . . . Second, Congress is empowered to \n     regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate \n     commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even \n     though the threat may come only from intrastate activities. . \n     . . Finally, Congress' commerce authority includes the power \n     to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to \n     interstate commerce, . . . i.e., those activities that \n     substantially affect interstate commerce.''--Id. (quoting \n     Lopez, 514 U.S. at 558-59).\n       Proposed Sec. 249(a)(2)(B)(i) would prohibit the violent \n     conduct described in Sec. 249(a)(2)(A) where the government \n     proves that the conduct ``occurs in the course of, or as the \n     result of, the travel of the defendant or the victim (a) \n     across state lines or national borders, or (b) using a \n     channel, facility, or instrumentality of interstate or \n     foreign commerce.'' A conviction based on such proof would be \n     within Congress's powers to ``regulate the use of the \n     channels of interstate commerce,'' and to ``regulate and \n     protect . . . persons or things in interstate commerce.'' \n     Proposed Sec. 249(a)(2)(B)(ii) would prohibit the violent \n     conduct described in Sec. 249(a)(2)(A) where the government \n     proves that the defendant ``uses a channel, facility or \n     instrumentality of interstate or foreign commerce in \n     connection with the conduct''--such as sending a bomb to the \n     victim via common carrier--and would fall within the power of \n     Congress to ``regulate the use of the channels of interstate \n     commerce'' and ``to regulate and protect the \n     instrumentalities of interstate commerce.''\n       Proposed Sec. 249(a)(2)(B)(iii) would prohibit the violent \n     conduct described in Sec. 249(a)(2)(A) where the government \n     proves that the defendant ``employs a firearm, explosive or \n     incendiary device, or other weapon that has traveled in \n     interstate or foreign commerce in connection with the \n     conduct.'' Such a provision addresses harms that are, in a \n     constitutionally important sense, facilitated by the \n     unencumbered movement of weapons across state and national \n     borders, and is similar to several other federal statutes in \n     which Congress has prohibited persons from using or \n     possessing weapons and other articles that have at one time \n     or another traveled in interstate or foreign commerce. The \n     courts of appeals uniformly have upheld the constitutionality \n     of such statutes. And, in Lopez itself, the Supreme Court \n     cited to the jurisdictional element in the statute at issue \n     in United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336 (1971), as an example \n     of a provision that ``would ensure, through case-by-case \n     inquiry, that the firearm possession in question affects \n     interstate commerce.'' 514 U.S. at 561. In Bass, 404 U.S. at \n     350-51, and in Scarborough v. United\n\n[[Page S5355]]\n\n     States, 431 U.S. 563 (1977), the Court construed that \n     statutory element to permit conviction upon proof that a \n     felon had received or possessed a firearm that had at some \n     time passed in interstate commerce.\n       Proposed Sec. 249(a)(2)(B)(iv)(I) would apply only where \n     the government proves that the violent conduct ``interferes \n     with commercial or other economic activity in which the \n     victim is engaged at the time of the conduct.'' This is one \n     specific manner in which the violent conduct can affect \n     interstate or foreign commerce. This jurisdictional element \n     also is an exercise of Congress's power to regulate `` \n     `persons or things in interstate commerce.' '' Morrison, 120 \n     S. Ct. at 1749 (quoting Lopez, 514 U.S. at 558). As Justice \n     Kennedy (joined by Justice O'Connor) wrote in Lopez, 514 U.S. \n     at 574, ``Congress can regulate in the commercial sphere on \n     the assumption that we have a single market and a unified \n     purpose to build a stable national economy.''\n       Finally, proposed Sec. 249(a)(2)(B)(iv)(II) would prohibit \n     the violent conduct described in Sec. 249(a)(2)(A) where the \n     government proves that the conduct ``otherwise affects \n     interstate or foreign commerce.'' Such ``affects commerce'' \n     language has long been regarded as the appropriate means for \n     Congress to invoke the full extent of its authority. See, \n     e.g., Jones v. United States, 120 S. Ct. 1904 (2000), No. 99-\n     5739, slip op. at 5 (May 22, 2000) (``the statutory term \n     `affecting . . . commerce,' . . . when unqualified, signal[s] \n     Congress' intent to invoke its full authority under the \n     Commerce Clause''); Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 \n     U.S. 265, 273 (1995) (``Th[e] phrase--`affecting commerce'--\n     normally signals Congress's intent to exercise its Commerce \n     Clause powers to the full.''). Of course, that this element \n     goes to the extent of Congress's constitutional power does \n     not mean that it is unlimited. Interpretation of the \n     ``affecting . . . commerce'' provision would be addressed on \n     a case-by-case basis, within the limits established by the \n     Court's doctrine. There likely will be cases where there is \n     some question whether a particular type or quantum of proof \n     is adequate to show the ``explicit'' and ``concrete'' effect \n     on interstate and foreign commerce that the element requires. \n     See Hamilton, 108 F.3d at 1464, 1467 (citing Lopez, 514 U.S. \n     at 562, 567). But on its face this element is, by its nature, \n     within Congress's Commerce Clause power.\n       In sum, because Sec. 249(a)(2) would prohibit violent \n     conduct in a ``discrete set'' of cases, 120 S. Ct. at 1751 \n     (quoting Lopez, 514 U.S. at 562), where that conduct has an \n     ``explicit connection with or effect on'' interstate or \n     foreign commerce, id., it would satisfy the constitutional \n     standards articulated in the Court's recent decisions.\n       The office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection from the standpoint of the Administration's \n     program to the presentation of this letter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Robert Raben,\n                                       Assistant Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I was startled to hear my friend and colleague suggest \nthat when they asked the Justice Department which States took no action \nin the Federal Government prosecution, he said there was not any. He \ndid not read his response from the Justice Department because I have in \nmy hand the response from the Justice Department that lists their \nresponse. I am not going to take the time tonight to go all the way \nthrough, but they have been listed. He ought to ask his staff for that \nbecause it has been sent to the Judiciary Committee, of which he is the \nchairman.\n  Included in the Justice Department's response are cases showing \ninstances where the Department has pursued cases Federally when the \nState cannot respond as effectively as the Federal Government. For \nexample, when State penalties are less severe than Federal penalties or \nwhere there are differences in applicable criminal procedure.\n  The idea that there really aren't times when States are unable to \nprosecute a case just does not hold water, because the cases are out \nthere and have been supplied by the Justice Department.\n  Furthermore, this chart shows what is happening across the country in \nthe various States. Eight States have absolutely no hate crimes \nstatutes, 22 States have criminal statutes for disability bias crimes, \n21 States plus the District of Columbia have criminal statutes for \nsexual orientation bias crimes, and 20 States identify gender bias \ncrimes.\n  But, if you are in any of these States shown on this chart which are \ncolored gray, including many in the Northeast, as well as out in the \nWest, and you are involved in the beating or battering of an individual \nAmerican because of their sexual orientation, there are no hate crimes \nstatutes under which to prosecute the perpetrator.\n  The States shown in yellow on the chart have no hate crimes statutes \nat all. As I said, the States shown in gray have no protection at all \nfor crimes committed because of a person's sexual orientation. Many of \nthose States that have hate crimes laws are inadequate because they do \nnot include all of the categories, including sexual orientation, gender \nand disability.\n  We have one particular State, Utah, where a judge found the hate \ncrime law to be incomplete because it specified no classes of victims--\nthe State included itself as having a hate crimes law. The judge was \nforced to dismiss the felony charges against two defendants who \nallegedly beat and terrorized people in a downtown city. The case was \neffectively dismissed because the state hate crime law was so vaguely \ndrafted that it failed to provide any of the protections that other \nstate hate crimes law do that clearly define classes of people who are \nprotected by race, religion, national origin, ethnic background, \ngender, sexual orientation, or disability.\n  The reality in the United States today is that either we believe we \nhave some responsibility to protect our fellow Americans from these \nkinds of extraordinary actions based upon bigotry and prejudice or we \ndon't.\n  We have taken action in the past. We have done it when the action was \nbased upon bigotry and prejudice and denial of the right to vote. We \nhave taken action when prejudice and bigotry have denied people public \naccommodation. We have taken action against bigotry and prejudice when \npeople have been denied housing. We have taken action against bigotry \nand prejudice toward people with disabilities.\n  Now we are asking the Senate to take action when there is violence \nagainst American citizens based upon prejudice and bigotry. That is why \nthis vote tomorrow is so important. That is what the issue is about. It \nis very basic and fundamental, and it is enormously important.\n  It is part of a continuing process of the march towards a fairer and \nmore just America. We have been trying to free ourselves from the \nstains of discrimination on the basis of race. We are making progress \nin terms of religion, national origin, and ethnic background. We are \ndoing it with regard to gender, disability, and sexual orientation.\n  What we are doing with this legislation is saying, at least in these \nareas, protect American citizens from prejudice and discrimination and \nviolence that is being directed towards them. Let us make that a \npriority; let all Americans know that we are not going to fight \nprejudice and discrimination with one hand tied behind our backs. The \nFederal Government should have both hands involved in trying to protect \nour citizens from this form of discrimination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I don't disagree with the Senator that hate \ncrimes are occurring, but they are being prosecuted by State and local \nofficials. That is the point. Many of the cases --and there aren't a \nlot of cases that the Justice Department has provided--are cases where \nthe Justice Department felt there should have been a greater remedy and \nthere should have been greater sentencing. But they are not in large \nmeasure cases where State refused or failed to prosecute the \nperpetrators of these horrendous crimes.\n  The fact is, there are not a lot of cases that can be produced, and \nthe Justice Department has not been able to produce them. I don't \ndisagree that hate crimes are occurring and we should stamp them out, \nbut they are being prosecuted by State and local officials to the \nfullest extent of the law. The Federal Government may disagree on how \nthey prosecute sometimes, but the fact is, they are being prosecuted. \nNo one has shown, certainly not the Justice Department, that these \ntruly horrific crimes are not being prosecuted, let alone on a large \nscale. The fact is, they are being prosecuted.\n  The cases identified by the Justice Department, a handful of cases, \nwere in large measure cases where State officials, investigators, and \nprosecutors got verdicts and sentences. In other words, they were \nbrought and verdicts and sentences were obtained. The Federal \nGovernment would have tried the cases differently or might have sought \na higher or more harsh sentence. But they are not cases where the State \nrefused to prosecute a hate crime.\n  My colleague is right: We should do everything in our power to stop \nhate\n\n[[Page S5356]]\n\ncrimes in our society. But no one to this date has been able to show \nthat there is a widespread, endemic failure at the State level to \nprosecute these crimes. There is no real evidence that the States are \nbeing slovenly in their duties. That is one reason why I think it is \nvery important that we objectively analyze these matters. We will have \nmore time to debate this, hopefully a little more time tomorrow.\n  Finally, when Mr. Holder, the Deputy Attorney General, appeared \nbefore the committee, he could not cite one case, not a single case. \nAfter a month of research, the Justice Department came up with a \nhandful of cases. That was it. Not because they weren't prosecuted at \nthe State level, they were. They just differed with the way they were \nprosecuted. That is not good enough. These are some of the things that \nbother me.\n  I am willing to work with the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts and the distinguished Senator from Oregon and others who \nwant to do something. If the amendment I am offering is not good \nenough, I am willing to work to see if we can find something that will \nbring us together and do a better job, certainly, to stamp out any type \nof hate criminal activity. But I am very loathe to federalize all \ncrimes so that the Federal Government can second-guess State and local \nprosecutors every time a criminal activity occurs. I think one could \nsay in many respects all crimes are hate crimes, even though they are \nnot categorized as such now. They are prosecuted, and that is the \nimportant thing.\n  Mr. President, I will ask unanimous consent, unless there is anyone \nelse who desires to speak.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I mentioned, the cases were provided \nby the Justice Department.\n  Let me give you one case, U.S. v. Kila, 1994, a Federal jury in Fort \nWorth, Texas acquitted three white supremacists of Federal civil rights \ncharges arising from unprovoked assaults upon African Americans, \nincluding one incident where the defendants knocked a man unconscious \nas he stood near a bus stop. For several hours, the defendants walked \nthroughout the town accosting every African American they met, ordering \nthem to leave whatever place or area they were in. Some of these \nencounters consisted of verbal harassment; in others, Black victims \nwere shoved on the streets, their hats knocked off. Throughout their \nmovements through the city, the subjects were using racial epithets and \ntalking about white supremacy.\n\n  The subjects' parade of racial hate erupted into serious violence \nwith the assault on Ali--that is the name of the individual--at the bus \nstop, an assault which knocked him unconscious. According to witnesses, \nAli was punched in the face after he fell to the ground, and kicked in \nthe head. He was transported by ambulance to the hospital, having \nsustained head injuries. He did not have medical insurance. When the \ndoctors asked him to remain for further tests, he left against their \nwishes.\n  The Federal Government became involved in the case when State \nofficials went to the U.S. Attorney's Office asking for Federal \nassistance. The State could only proceed on misdemeanors, and in their \njudgment, the conduct warranted felony treatment, treatment available \nunder Federal law. Some of the jurors revealed after the trial that \nalthough the assaults were clearly motivated by racial animus, there \nwas no apparent intent to deprive the victims of the right to \nparticipate in any federally protected activity.\n  It is this federally protected activity barrier under current law \nthat is unduly restrictive, and must be amended.\n  The Government's proof that the defendants went out looking for \nAfrican Americans to assault was insufficient to satisfy the statutory \nrequirements and effectively the case was dropped.\n  I could go back as far as 1982. Maybe in some cases defendants get \ntried for a misdemeanor, as they did in a Western State case I \nmentioned previously, but they are not getting prosecuted with the full \nweight of the law. That is what we are talking about. In the 1982 case \nthat I referred to, two white men chased a man of Asian descent from a \nnight club in Detroit and beat him to death. The Department of Justice \nprosecuted the perpetrators under existing hate crimes laws, but both \ndefendants were acquitted--despite substantial evidence to establish \ntheir animus based on the victim's national origin. Although the \nJustice Department had no direct evidence of the basis for the jurors' \ndecision, the Government's need to prove the defendants' intent to \ninterfere with the victim's engagement in a federally protected right--\nthe use of a place of public accommodation, was the weak link in the \nprosecution.\n  These defendants committed murder on the basis of hate. Do we need \nmore cases? I am glad to stay here and go through a whole pile of them. \nThese are examples of what we are talking about. This is what is taking \nplace. The question is whether we are going to do something about it. \nThat is the issue that will be presented to this body tomorrow.\n  I will take a moment to read into the Record the letter from Judy \nShepard addressed to the members of the Judiciary Committee:\n\n       Thank you for your hard work and commitment to combating \n     hate violence in America. I appreciate the opportunity to \n     testify before your committee last year. As the mother of a \n     hate crime victim, I applaud your interest in trying to \n     address this serious problem that has torn at the very fabric \n     of our nation. However, I do have concerns with your bill (S. \n     1406) as currently written, and I would like to take this \n     opportunity to discuss them with you.\n       As I am sure you remember from our visit last fall, two men \n     murdered my son Matthew in Laramie, Wyoming in October 1998 \n     because he was gay. Though your amendment is well \n     intentioned, it fails to address hate crimes based on sexual \n     orientation, nor does it include disability or gender. The \n     time has long passed for halfway measures to address this \n     devastating violence. While I appreciate your efforts, the \n     appropriate and necessary response is the Smith-Kennedy \n     measure (S. 622), and I strongly urge you to support this \n     approach.\n       Though forty states and the District of Columbia have \n     enacted hate crime statutes, most states do not provide \n     authority for bias crime prosecutions based on sexual \n     orientation, gender, or disability. Including the District of \n     Columbia, only 22 states now include sexual orientation-based \n     crimes in their hate crime statutes, 21 include coverage of \n     gender-based crimes, and 22 include coverage for disability-\n     based crimes.\n       There is currently no law that allows federal assistance \n     for localities investigating and prosecuting hate crimes \n     based on sexual orientation. As a result, though Matt's \n     killers were brought to justice, the Laramie law enforcement \n     officials told me, as I know they told you last year, that \n     they were forced to furlough five employees to be able to \n     afford to bring the case. The Smith-Kennedy amendment would \n     add sexual orientation, gender and disability to current law, \n     while your amendment would not. I urge you to support the \n     Smith-Kennedy amendment, which is more comprehensive and \n     inclusive.\n       I know that legislation cannot erase the hate or pain or \n     bring back my son, but I believe that passage of this \n     legislation is an essential step in the healing process and \n     will help allow the federal government to assist in the \n     investigation and prosecution of future hate crimes.\n       Again, I respect your commitment to making America a more \n     understanding and just country where hate crimes are no \n     longer tolerated. But I urge you to promptly address my \n     concerns that are shared by so many others, so our nation can \n     be safe for all people, including gay people like my son \n     Matthew.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Judy Shepard.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I don't mean to prolong this, but in the \nhandful of cases they don't like what happened. In that case, I may \nagree with the Senator that there should have been a verdict against \nthe defendants, but a jury in the United States found otherwise. That \ndoesn't mean we should federalize all hate crimes. That is what I am \nconcerned about.\n  I will just put forth my offer to work with the Senator to see if we \ncan find some way of bringing everybody together in a way that will not \nintrude the Federal Government into all the local and State \nprosecutions in this country, which certainly the Senator's amendment \nwould do. That is what I am concerned about. We will chat overnight and \ntalk about it and see what we can do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/19/senate-section/article/S5356-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, today we recognize the date upon which \nslavery finally came to an end in the United States, June 19, 1865, \nalso known as ``Juneteenth Independence Day.'' It was on this date that \nslaves in the Southwest finally learned of the end of slavery. Although \npassage of the Thirteenth Amendment in January 1863, legally abolished \nslavery, many African Americans remained in servitude due to the slow \ndissemination of this news across the country.\n  Since that time, over 130 years ago, the descendants of slaves have \nobserved this anniversary of emancipation as a remembrance of one of \nthe most tragic periods of our nation's history. The suffering, \ndegradation and brutality of slavery cannot be repaired, but the memory \ncan serve to ensure that no such inhumanity is ever perpetrated again \non American soil.\n  Mr. President, throughout the Nation, we also celebrate the many \nimportant achievements of former slaves and their descendants. We do so \nbecause in 1926, Dr. Carter G. Woodson, son of former slaves, proposed \nsuch a recognition as a way of preserving the history of African \nAmericans and recognizing the enormous contributions of a people of \ngreat strength, dignity, faith and conviction--a people who rendered \ntheir achievements for the betterment and advancement of a Nation once \nlacking in humanity towards them. Every February, nationwide, we \ncelebrate African American History Month. And, every year on June 19, \nwe celebrate ``Juneteenth Independence Day.''\n  Lerone Bennett, editor, writer and lecturer recently reflected on the \nlife and times of Dr. Woodson. In an article he wrote earlier this year \nfor Johnson's Publications, Bennett tells us that one of the most \ninspiring and instructive stories in African American history is the \nstory of Woodson's struggle and rise from the coal mines of West \nVirginia to the summit of academic achievement:\n\n       At 17, the young man who was called by history to reveal \n     Black history was an untutored coal miner. At 19, after \n     teaching himself the fundamentals of English and arithmetic, \n     he entered high school and mastered the four-year curriculum \n     in less than two years. At 22, after two-thirds of a year at \n     Berea College [in Kentucky], he returned to the coal mines \n     and studied Latin and Greek between trips to the mine shafts. \n     He then went on to the University of Chicago, where he \n     received bachelor's and master's degrees, and Harvard \n     University, where he became the second Black to receive a \n     doctorate in history. The rest is history--Black history.\n\n  In keeping with the spirit and the vision of Dr. Carter G. Woodson, I \nwould like to pay tribute to two courageous women, claimed by my home \nstate of Michigan, who played significant roles in addressing American \ninjustice and inequality. These are two women of different times who \nwould change the course of history.\n  Sojourner Truth, who helped lead our country out of the dark days of \nslavery, and Rosa Parks, whose dignified leadership sparked the \nMontgomery Bus Boycott and the start of the Civil Rights movement are \nindelibly echoed in the chronicle of not only the history of this \nNation, but are viewed with distinction and admiration throughout the \nworld.\n  Sojourner Truth, though unable to read or write, was considered one \nof the most eloquent and noted spokespersons of her day on the \ninhumanity and immorality of slavery. She was a leader in the \nabolitionist movement, and a ground breaking speaker on behalf of \nequality for women. Michigan recently honored her with the dedication \nof the Sojourner Truth Memorial Monument, which was unveiled in Battle \nCreek, Michigan on September 25, 1999.\n  Truth lived in Washington, D.C. for several years, helping slaves who \nhad fled from the South and appearing at women's suffrage gatherings. \nShe returned to Battle Creek in 1875, and remained there until her \ndeath in 1883. Sojourner Truth spoke from her heart about the most \ntroubling issues of her time. A testament to Truth's convictions is \nthat her words continue to speak to us today.\n  On May 4, 1999 legislation was enacted which authorized the President \nof the United States to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Rosa \nParks. I was pleased to coauthor this fitting tribute to Rosa Parks--\nthe gentle warrior who decided that she would no longer tolerate the \nhumiliation and demoralization of racial segregation on a bus. Her \npersonal bravery and self-sacrifice are remembered with reverence and \nrespect by us all.\n  Forty-four years ago in Montgomery, Alabama the modern civil rights \nmovement began when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat and move to \nthe back of the bus. The strength and spirit of this courageous woman \ncaptured the consciousness of not only the American people but the \nentire world.

Mr. President, I want to announce my unqualified \nsupport for the recent signing of the Multi-Year Procurement contract \non Boeing's F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet. This is a good day for U.S. \nnational defense, the Navy, the American taxpayers, and the city of St. \nLouis.\n  This announcement secures the production of the Super Hornet, which \nis in St. Louis, for the next 5 years. Valued at $8.9 billion for a \ntotal of 222 aircraft over 5 years, this contract will ensure that the \nNavy will have these planes and, in addition, U.S. taxpayers will save \nover $700 million. It is definitely a ``win-win'' situation.\n  The U.S. Navy's award winning Super Hornet Program continues to be \nrecognized throughout the Department of Defense and industry as the \nstandard by which all other tactical aviation programs should be \nevaluated. Since the program's inception, the Super Hornet has met or \nexceeded all cost, weight and schedule goals and requirements.\n  The Boeing Corporation, which is the prime contractor, in partnership \nwith the Navy has introduced a 21st Century strike fighter that will \nensure the Navy's carrier airwing is more than able to defeat today's \nthreat and the projected threats of the first 30 years of this century. \nA balanced approach to survivability, revolutionary methods of design \nand manufacture, and a very cost-conscious approach to achieving and \nmaintaining multi-mission superiority over the threat has given the \nNavy a new tactical aircraft that supports Navy budget realities.\n  Mr. President, in addition to affordability, comparable performance, \nenhanced range, carrier bring back, more weapons stations, future \ngrowth and better survivability were major consideration for the next \ngeneration of carrier-based strike fighters. The Super Hornet has met \nthe muster in every category.\n  The Navy has not been shy about its support for this project, and I \nwhole-heartedly agree with my good friend Admiral Jay Johnson, the \nChief of Naval Operations, who recently stated: ``The F/A-18E/F Super \nHornet is the cornerstone of the future of Naval aviation. . . . It \nwill provide twice the sorties, a third the combat losses and forty \npercent greater range. We can't wait to get it to the fleet!''\n  This contract is also a testimony to the excellent job the workers of \nSt. Louis do every day. Without their dedication and commitment to \nquality, the Super Hornet would not be able to win such an important \ncontract.\n  In conclusion, I thank the people who made this contract a reality--\nnamely the people of St. Louis, the Boeing Corporation, the U.S. Navy, \nand my fellow Senators who joined me in my support of this wonderful \nproject.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/19/senate-section/article/S5357-3", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5357-S5358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HOURS OF SERVICE PROVISIONS IN H.R. 4475\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to address the Hours of \nService provision in H.R. 4475, the Department of Transportation \nappropriations bill. As directed by Congress, the Department of \nTransportation, and most recently the new Federal Motor Carrier\n\n[[Page S5358]]\n\nSafety Administration (FMCSA), set out to examine the hours of service \nstandard for motor carrier drivers that had been in effect since the \n1930s.\n  As I stated in the Surface Transportation Subcommittee's hearing in \nSeptember 1999, I am concerned about fatigued drivers on the road. The \nfatigue related accident I profiled at this hearing occurred August 31, \n1999 in Atlanta, and resulted in deadly consequences for the drivers of \nthe truck. The accident occurred in the early morning hours and \nthankfully, no other automobiles were directly involved. However, daily \ncommuters felt the effects during morning and afternoon rush hours, and \nthe tragedy and frustration from incidents such as this accident \nresulted in Congress directing DOT to examine hours of service \nregulations.\n  Admittedly, I have concerns about the effects of the proposed rule, \nbut I do not believe that the appropriations bill is the proper vehicle \nthrough which to express concerns. I would like to remind my colleagues \nthat the DOT has only issued a proposed rule. DOT is still accepting \ncomments on this rule through October 31, 2000--an extension of the \noriginal date--and continues to hold hearings on the issue throughout \nthe country. I believe these hearings have brought, and will continue \nto bring, potential problems to the attention of DOT officials. For \nexample, during emergencies, utility drivers must restore service to \ncustomers. How do these rules apply to such drivers in these special \nsituations?\n  Congress directed DOT to evaluate the hours of service rules. Is this \nthe best proposal? I am not convinced so, but I do believe DOT should \nbe able to move forward with the prescribed process. The American \ndriving public deserves the continuation of the hours of service reform \nprocess. The truck drivers want this collaborative process to continue. \nAs this point, why should the Senate attempt to short-circuit the \nefforts of the FMCSA to reform the hours of service rule as directed by \nCongress?\n  I do not support the prohibition on moving forward with the hours of \nservice process, and I urge the conferees on H.R. 4475 to remove the \nhours of service provision from the final bill. Let's work together in \nthoroughly considering the best way to ensure the safety of automobile \nand truck drivers traveling America's roads.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/19/senate-section/article/S5358-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER OF THE YEAR AWARD\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is with great honor today \nthat I rise to recognize one of the finest men in the Alaska Army \nNational Guard, Sergeant Edwin D. Irizarry. Sergeant Irizarry's hard \nwork and dedication to the Army National Guard in Alaska have earned \nhim the title of the ``Noncommissioned Officer of the Year.'' Mr. \nPresident, this is no small award. It is only awarded to those who show \noutstanding leadership and extraordinary accomplishments in their duty. \nSergeant Irizarry epitomizes the commitment and unselfish honor of the \nmen and women in Alaska's Army National Guard.\n  This is a great honor for Alaska. The commitment to be in the Guard \nrequires an individual to work hard and sacrifice their own personal \ntime to protect the very communities where they live. Sergeant Irizarry \nlives and works in Ketchikan, with his wife and family. Ketchikan is a \nbeautiful town in southeast Alaska where I was fortunate to have been \nraised. I know the terrain that the Guard uses is no walk in the park. \nMountains and a channel of water hug the town in this great place. To \nbe stationed in Ketchikan one must learn to adapt to the fast changing \nclimate and diverse environment that exists in this region. Ketchikan \nand Alaska are truly indebted to the many fine soldiers like Sergeant \nIrizarry who protect and assist in communities throughout the last \nfrontier.\n  Sergeant Irizarry serves as role model and inspiration to the over \n300,000 men and women in our country's National Guard. Without the \ntalent and support given to our armed forces by the National Guard and \nindividuals like Sergeant Irizarry, our country would not be where it \nis today. I take great pride in congratulating Sergeant Irizarry for \nhis Guard career and for being an example for all of us to \nfollow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/19/senate-section/article/S5358-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PRIVATE RELIEF BILL FOR MARINA KHALINA\n\n Mr. WYDEN.

SUSAN WARGO\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have the pleasure to stand today \nand celebrate the career of a very fine public school teacher. She is \nMrs. Susan Wargo, a third grade school teacher at Franklin Sherman \nElementary School in Fairfax County, Virginia. She is retiring this \nyear, after teaching school for 28 years. She and her husband Mike, \nwill be relocating to Aiken, South Carolina.\n  I know about Mrs. Wargo because she teaches my granddaughter, Mattie\n\n[[Page S5359]]\n\nBarringer. Mattie loves Mrs. Wargo, and its not hard to figure out why. \nShe has captured Mattie's imagination and won her heart. Mattie has \nlearned ancient history, economics, math, and literature from Mrs. \nWargo, but she could have learned those things from anybody. Mrs. \nWargo's lasting contribution to Mattie's education is the atmosphere \nshe created in her classroom. She embraced her students, made them feel \ncomfortable, taught them how to learn, and got them to accomplish great \nthings--more than they ever thought they were capable of doing. Mrs. \nWargo is that amazing teacher that we all can remember: the one that \ncared about us, that took an interest in us, that rooted for us, and \nmade us passionate to learn.\n  I had a teacher like Mrs. Wargo when I was a young boy--her name was \nMrs. Pickard and I am glad my granddaughter was lucky enough to have \nsuch a teacher so early in her education. Teachers like Mrs. Wargo \nimmeasurably enrich our lives. My daughter Lana--Mattie's mother--tells \nme that when talking about Mattie in a parent-teacher conference, Mrs. \nWargo's voice seemed to break just slightly with emotion as she spoke \npassionately about Mattie's talents and potential. My daughter came \naway from that conference amazed at this great teacher.\n  It is hard to express these feelings we have about great teachers. \nMattie did a much better job than I have done here in a recent letter \nto Mrs. Wargo. She wrote: ``When I came to this school, you made me \nfeel special. You always make me feel good about myself. I'll miss \nyou.''\n  With those words, I am delighted to pay tribute to Mrs. Wargo, and to \nher colleagues like her who serve in the public schools. Mrs. Wargo, my \nfamily thanks you for your many gifts to Mattie. We want you to know \nthat the good you have done so far in your life has been noticed, and \nmuch appreciated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/19/senate-section/article/S5359-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO LT.

Lt. \nGeneral Short will retire on July 1, 2000, after an outstanding career \nin the United States Air Force. During a 35 year career, General Short \ndistinguished himself as a fighter pilot, warfighter, and trusted \nleader.\n  Throughout his career, General Short commanded at all levels, both \noverseas and in the continental United States. A 1965 graduate of the \nU.S. Air Force Academy, he is a command pilot with more than 4,600 \nflying hours in fighter aircraft, including 276 combat missions in \nSoutheast Asia. His impressive list of accomplishments include command \nof the 4th Aircraft Generation Squadron, 334th Tactical Fighter \nSquadron, 4450th Tactical Group, 355th Tactical Training Wing, 67th \nTactical Reconnaissance Wing and the 4404th Composite Wing.\n  During his last assignment, General Short commanded the Allied Air \nForces Southern Europe, Stabilization Forces Air Component, and Kosovo \nForces Air Component, Naples, Italy, and the 16th Air Force and 16th \nAir and Space Expeditionary Task Force, U.S. Air Forces in Europe, \nAviano Air Base, Italy. As commander of these forces, he was the air \nprincipal subordinate commander and the joint and combined forces air \ncomponent commander for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) \nSouthern Region. He also was responsible for the planning and \nemployment of NATO's air forces in the Mediterranean area of operations \nfrom Gibraltar to Eastern Turkey and air operations throughout the \nBalkans. General Short led the 16th Air Force during what was, without \nquestion, the most demanding period in its history--a time when it \nfulfilled a NATO mission of peace enforcement in Bosnia-Herzegovina and \nlater, participated in a NATO-led air war, which removed Slobodan \nMilosevic's Serbian military and police forces from Kosovo.\n  A consummate professional, General Mike Short's performance of duty \nduring the past thirty-five years of service personify those traits of \ncourage, competency and integrity that we expect from our military \nofficers. His career reflects a deep commitment to our country, to \ndedicated and selfless service, and to excellence. On behalf of the \nUnited States Senate and the people of this great Nation, I commend him \nfor his exemplary service and offer heartfelt appreciation for a job \nwell done. We wish him and his family Godspeed and all the best in \ntheir future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/19/senate-section/article/S5359-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF JAMES STALDER\n\n Mr. SANTORUM.

He initially joined the firm in \nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania before transferring to the National \nHeadquarters in New York, where he served as Director of Tax Research \nand Technical Services for the Ohio Valley Area. In 1988, he was \nappointed Managing partner of the Price Waterhouse office. Since July \n1998, Mr. Stalder has been Managing Partner of the \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP office.\n  Upon retiring, Mr. Stalder will commence a deanship at Duquesne \nUniversity in Pittsburgh. He will assume the position of Dean of the \nA.J. Palumbo Undergraduate School of Business and the John F. Donahue \nGraduate School of Business. Judging by Mr. Stalder's proven \nleadership, it is clear that he will be a great asset to Duquesne.\n  Mr. Stalder has served as President of the Pennsylvania Institute of \nCertified Public Accountants and as a member of the Council of the \nAmerican Institute of Public Accountants. He is also a Life Trustee of \nCarnegie-Mellon University where he has been a member of the faculty of \nthe Graduate School of Industrial Administration since 1981. A graduate \nof The Pennsylvania State University, he also serves as a member of the \nUniversity's Smeal College of Business Administration Board of \nTrustees. Moreover, Mr. Stalder was instrumental in the creation of the \nPennsylvania Tax Blueprint Project, which is developing micro \nsimulation economic impact models to enable the Governor and \nlegislators in Pennsylvania to measure and intelligently debate \nalternative tax reform proposals. In addition, Mr. Stalder has served \nas Chairman of the Greater Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce and in many \nother leadership roles in similar organizations. I commend Mr. Stalder \nfor his demonstrated service to leadership in these organizations.\n  Mr. Stalder has received numerous awards for outstanding service to \nhis community. Among these is the Distinguished Public Service Award, \nthe top award presented to an individual by the Pennsylvania Institute \nof Certified Public Accountants, which ``honors CPAs who have truly \nmade a difference through active participation in public service.\n  Mr. Stalder will be an excellent addition to the administration at \nDuquesne.

Mr. President, in assessing the situation in \nZimbabwe today, permit me to quote a long-time supporter of that \ncountry's ruling party in reference to that party: ``If I give my name, \nthey might hear and come for me at night.'' Such is the pervasive level \nof fear that has permeated Zimbabwe over the past several months and \nthreatens that country with a degree of political instability not seen \nsince white-minority rule gave way to the creation of the Republic of \nZimbabwe. The increasingly autocratic regime of Robert Mugabe, \nthreatened by the growth of a viable democratic opposition, is \nresponding the way dictatorial regimes the world over generally do, \nwith violence aimed at subverting the will of the people.\n  Permit me to quote from the June 3 issue of The Economist for a sense \nof what is going on inside Zimbabwe today:\n\n\n[[Page S5360]]\n\n\n       Intimidation is rampant in the countryside. . .Peasants are \n     told that their votes are not secret and that they will \n     suffer if they do not give them to the ruling party. People \n     suspected of supporting opposition parties have been \n     threatened, beaten and in some cases killed. Rural clinics \n     and hospitals have been ordered to refuse treatment to \n     opposition supporters. Teachers in the countryside have been \n     singled out for attack, dragged from their classrooms and \n     beaten in front of their students. Some female teachers have \n     been stripped naked. More than 260 rural schools have been \n     closed by the violence.\n\n  As chairman of the International Republican Institute, which has \nmaintained a presence in Zimbabwe along with its counterpart National \nDemocratic Institute, I am appalled at developments in that southern \nAfrican country. Parliamentary elections, widely expected to result in \na resounding victory for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change \nand thus threaten the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic \nFront's 20-year hold on power, are being systematically undermined by \nthe kind of campaign violence and intimidation that has been all too \ncommon in other countries that resisted the path of democratization. \nThat is unfortunate, for Zimbabwe, like other strife-torn countries of \nAfrica, has the potential to provide its people a far better quality of \nlife than can ever enjoy under one-party rule.\n  Those parliamentary elections, Mr. President, as with the defeat of \nthe constitutional referendum in February, would have provided ample \nevidence that the majority of Zimbaweans are tired of corruption, vast \nunemployment, 60 percent inflation, and the fuel and energy shortages \nthat have become a part of life in a once wealthy nation. The recent \ndecision by the International Republican Institute to withdraw its \nelection observers, however, as well as the United Nation's withdrawal \nof its election coordinator, should be seen for what it is: a very \nclear warning sign that President Mugabe has no intention of permitting \nfree and fair elections, and fully intends to continue his campaign of \nexacerbating ethnic divisions in Zimbabwe for his personal benefit. \nThat President Mugabe refuses to even accredit U.S. Embassy personnel \nto act as observers is a stinging and unfortunate rebuke to the \ninternational community. The recent jailing of an opposition activist \nwith whom I had the privilege of meeting in my office only two months \nago not only augurs ill for the future of Zimbabwe, but hurts me deeply \nfor the promise this fine woman showed in that meeting.\n\n  The deterioration of the political situation in Zimbabwe is the \ndirect result of the unwillingness of President Mugabe to countenance \nany level of political opposition that threatens his hold on power. And \nmake no mistake, that some ruling party members have come under attack \nby the opposition does not place both sides on an equal moral footing. \nOn the contrary, Amnesty International and other foreign observers have \nbeen very clear that the government and its supporters are responsible \nfor the violence that has wracked a country that had enjoyed 20 years \nof peace, flawed though it was by the socialist policies of Mr. Mugabe. \nThe 30 or so deaths and hundreds of injuries that have occurred may, I \nfear, be only a precursor to greater violence should the Movement for \nDemocratic Change continue to attempt to mount a credible campaign \nagainst one-party rule.\n  Mr. President, some may look at the seizure of white-owned farms by \nblack squatters openly and vociferously encouraged by President Mugabe, \nand the murder of some of those farmers, through the prism of the \nformer era of colonial and white-minority rule. That would be a tragic \nmistake. The deteriorating situation in Zimbabwe is directly tied to \nPresident Mugabe's autocratic rule and desperate attempt to hold back \nthe tides of history, which appear to favor democracy. Mugabe's \nrejection of South African President Thabo Mbeki's efforts at brokering \na quasi-reasonable resolution of the land-reform issue was further \nevidence of his growing penchant for petty tyranny as a substitute for \nenlightened government.\n  It is imperative that the United States, the European Community and, \nmost importantly, the Organization of African Unity act forcefully in \npressuring Mugabe to reverse his current dictatorial policies and allow \nfor the conduct of free and fair elections. His failure to do so should \nbe widely condemned. What ails Zimbabwe is not racial tension, but the \nage-old problem of a dictator who fails to read the writing on the \nwalls. As with others before him, he will find, I suspect, that his \nworld will become more and more confined, more and more restrictive and \nhis actions more and more desperate. At a time when Sub-Saharan Africa \nhas become synonymous with civil strife and the international community \ndebates the ongoing wars in Sierra Leone and Congo, while conflict \ncontinues in Angola and ethnic violence continues in and around Rwanda \nand Burundi, Zimbabwe should have been a beacon of political stability \nand economic development. Instead, it descends into the darkness of \ntyranny. It is hopefully not too late to reverse the situation there, \nbut the signs are not encouraging.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/19/senate-section/article/S5360-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:09 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4578.

A bill to establish the California Trail Interpretive Center \nin Elko, Nevada, to facilitate the interpretation of the history of \ndevelopment and use of trails in the setting of the western portion of \nthe United States; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                   california trail interpretive act\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the California \nTrail Interpretive Act.\n  The nineteenth century westward emigration on the California National \nHistoric Trail, which occurred from 1840 until the completion of the \ntranscontinental railroad in 1869, was an important cultural and \nhistorical era in the settlement of the West. This influx of settlers \ncontributed to the development of lands in the western United States by \nAmericans and immigrants and to the prevention of colonization of the \nwest coast by Russia and the British Empire. More than 300,000 settlers \ntraveled the California Trail and many documented their amazing \nexperiences in detailed journals. Under the National Trails System Act, \nthe Secretary of Interior may establish interpretation centers to \ndocument and celebrate pioneer trails such as the California National \nHistoric Trail. In Nevada, Elko County alone contains over 435 miles of \nNational Historic Trails.\n  Mr. President, recognition and interpretation of the pioneer \nexperience on the Trail is appropriate in light of Americans' strong \ninterest in understanding our history and heritage. Those who pursue \nWestern Americana, and thousands do, will find physical evidence of the \ndocumented hardships facing the original pioneers. One pioneer journal \nbemoaned the death of an elderly lady traveling west with her family. \nHer grave and its marker are in evidence in the Beowawe Cemetery near \nthe trail river crossing known as Gravely Ford for those searching for \nhistorical confirmation. And, if the present-day explorers choose to \nwalk part of the California Trail, they may do so at this place. To the \neast of this river crossing is around five miles of undisturbed trail \nthat leads down from what is known as ``Emigrant Pass''.\n  This Act authorizes the planning, construction and operation of a \nvisitor center. The cooperative parties include the State of Nevada, \nthe Advisory Board for the National Historic California Emigrant Trails \nInterpretive Center, Elko County, the City of Elko, and Bureau of Land \nManagement.\n  This interpretive center will be located near the city of Elko, in \nnortheastern Nevada. The location is the junction of the California \nTrail and the Hastings Cutoff. The ill-fated Reed-Donner party spent an \nadditional 31 days meandering over the so-called Hastings Cutoff route; \nprecious time wasted that kept them from crossing the deadly Sierra \nNevada before winter struck in 1846.\n  This act will recognize the California Trail, including the Hastings \nCutoff, for its national historical and cultural significance through \nthe construction of an interpretive facility devoted to the vital role \nof Pioneer trails in the West in the development of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2749\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``California Trail \n     Interpretive Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to direct the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection\n\n[[Page S5362]]\n\nAgency, the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of Agriculture, and \nthe Secretary of the Interior to participate constructively in the \nimplementation of the Las Vegas Wash Wetland Restoration and Lake Mead \nWater Quality Improvement Project, Nevada; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n    las vegas wash wetland restoration and lake mead water quality \n                        improvement act of 2000\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the Las \nVegas Wash Wetland Restoration and Lake Mead Water Quality Improvement \nAct of 2000. This bill is important for Nevada's families and for the \nenvironment, because water is our most precious natural resource.\n  My bill is the product of a visionary, locally-led initiative \ndesigned to develop and implement a plan that would enhance and protect \nwater quality in the Las Vegas basin.\n  Importantly, my bill would safeguard southern Nevada's water supply \nand improve the unique desert wetlands environment of the Las Vegas \nWash.\n  I would like to review some of the history that contributed to the \ndevelopment of this bill.\n  In 1998, in response to a recommendation by a citizens' water quality \nadvisory committee, the Las Vegas Wash Coordination Committee was \nformed to develop a comprehensive Adaptive Management Plan (AMP) for \nthe Las Vegas Wash ecosystem.\n  The AMP, which was developed by the Las Vegas Wash Coordinating \nCommittee over the past two years and approved early this year by the \nSouthern Nevada Water Authority, represents a vision for how local, \nState, and Federal stakeholders can work together to achieve shared \nwater quality and ecosystem restoration goals in the Las Vegas basin.\n  First and foremost, the AMP is a locally-driven strategy. The \nstakeholder working group, coordinated by the Southern Nevada Water \nAuthority and comprised of 28 groups, contributed their varied \nperspectives and good ideas to the development of this plan.\n  A draft of the AMP was published for public comment in October 1999. \nIn January 2000, the Southern Nevada Water Authority finalized and \napproved the AMP.\n  Chief among the recommendations in the AMP was the call for \ndevelopment of a partnership consisting of local, State, Federal \nagencies with interests in the Las Vegas Wash ecosystem.\n  I view this plan as a Nevada solution to a tremendous local challenge \nof accelerated erosion and deteriorating water quality.\n  I commend the local, State, and Federal stakeholders that helped \ncreate the AMP for their hard work, cooperation, and dedication to \nimproving Southern Nevada's environment for Nevada's families today and \nfor future generations.\n  The Federal government, by virtue of its land ownership in Nevada and \nresponsibilities at Lake Mead, has an obligation to help make the plan \nwork.\n  In addition, the Federal government is uniquely responsible for the \nperchlorate contamination which contributes to the groundwater \ncontamination that pollutes Las Vegas Wash run-off.\n  My bill directs the relevant Federal agencies to participate in \nefforts to restore Las Vegas Wash and protect Lake Mead's water \nquality. These agencies include: the Environmental Protection Agency, \nthe Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of Reclamation, the National \nPark Service, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, the Fish and \nWildlife Service, and the Army Corps of Engineers.\n  I hope that the Senate will move quickly to consider and pass this \nbill so that Federal agencies can become full partners in the effort to \nrehabilitate and conserve the Las Vegas Wash desert ecosystem and to \nimprove water quality in southern Nevada's most heavily used watershed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 2751. A bill to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to convey \ncertain land in the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit, Nevada, to the \nSecretary of the Interior, in trust for the Washoe Indian Tribe of \nNevada and California; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n                washoe tribe land conveyance legislation\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Washoe Tribe \nLake Tahoe Access Act.\n  In 1997, I helped convene a Presidential Forum at Lake Tahoe to \ndiscuss the future of the Lake Tahoe Basin. Together with President \nClinton, Federal, State, and local government leaders, we addressed the \nprotection of the extraordinary natural, recreational, and ecological \nresources of the Lake Tahoe region. Goals and an action plan developed \nduring the Lake Tahoe Forum were codified as the ``Presidential Forum \nDeliverables.'' These Deliverables included supporting the traditional \nand customary use of the Lake Tahoe Basin by the Washoe Tribe. Perhaps, \nmost importantly, the Deliverables include a provision designed to \nprovide the Washoe Tribe access to the shore of Lake Tahoe for cultural \npurposes.\n  Mr. President, the ancestral homeland of the Washoe Tribe of Nevada \nand California included an area of over 10,000 square miles in and \naround Lake Tahoe. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that the \nmembers of the Washoe Tribe have the opportunity to engage in \ntraditional and customary cultural practices on the shore of Lake Tahoe \nincluding spiritual renewal, land stewardship, Washoe horticulture and \nethnobotany, subsistence gathering, traditional learning, and \nreunification of tribal and family bonds as was envisioned by the \nparties involved in the Lake Tahoe Presidential Forum.\n  Mr. President, this Act will convey 24.3 acres from the Secretary of \nAgriculture to the Secretary of the Interior to be held in trust for \nthe Washoe Tribe. This is land located within the Lake Tahoe Basin \nManagement Unit north of Skunk Harbor, Nevada. The land in question \nwould be conveyed with the expectation that it would be used for \ntraditional and customary uses and stewardship conservation of the \nWashoe Tribe and will not permit any commercial use. In the unlikely \nevent this land were used for any commercial development purpose, title \nto the land will revert to the Secretary of Agriculture. It is my \nsincere hope that Congress will pass this bill thereby making the \nPresidential Deliverables of the Lake Tahoe forum a reality by ensuring \nthat the Washoe Tribe once again enjoy access to Lake Tahoe.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2751\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. WASHOE TRIBE LAND CONVEYANCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the ancestral homeland of the Washoe Tribe of Nevada \n     and California (referred to in this section as the ``Tribe'') \n     included an area of approximately 5,000 square miles in and \n     around Lake Tahoe, California and Nevada, and Lake Tahoe was \n     the heart of the territory;\n       (2) in 1997, Federal, State, and local governments, \n     together with many private landholders, recognized the Washoe \n     people as indigenous people of Lake Tahoe Basin through a \n     series of meetings convened by those governments at 2 \n     locations in Lake Tahoe;\n       (3) the meetings were held to address protection of the \n     extraordinary natural, recreational, and ecological resources \n     in the Lake Tahoe region;\n       (4) the resulting multiagency agreement includes objectives \n     that support the traditional and customary uses of Forest \n     Service land by the Tribe; and\n       (5) those objectives include the provision of access by \n     members of the Tribe to the shore of Lake Tahoe in order to \n     reestablish traditional and customary cultural practices.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to implement the joint local, State, tribal, and \n     Federal objective of returning the Tribe to Lake Tahoe; and\n       (2) to ensure that members of the Tribe have the \n     opportunity to engage in traditional and customary cultural \n     practices on the shore of Lake Tahoe to meet the needs of \n     spiritual renewal, land stewardship, Washoe horticulture and \n     ethnobotony, subsistence gathering, traditional learning, and \n     reunification of tribal and family bonds.\n       (c) Conveyance.--Subject to valid existing rights and \n     subject to the easement reserved under subsection (d), the \n     Secretary of Agriculture shall convey to the Secretary of the \n     Interior, in trust for the Tribe, for no consideration, all \n     right, title, and interest in the parcel of land comprising \n     approximately 24.3 acres, located within the Lake Tahoe Basin \n     Management Unit north of Skunk Harbor, Nevada, and more \n     particularly described as Mount Diablo Meridian, T15N, R18E, \n     section 27, lot 3.\n       (d) Easement.--\n\n[[Page S5363]]\n\n       (1) In general.--The conveyance under subsection (c) shall \n     be made subject to reservation to the United States of a \n     nonexclusive easement for public and administrative access \n     over Forest Development Road #15N67 to National Forest System \n     land.\n       (2) Access by individuals with disabilities.--The Secretary \n     shall provide a reciprocal easement to the Tribe permitting \n     vehicular access to the parcel over Forest Development Road \n     #15N67 to--\n       (A) members of the Tribe for administrative and safety \n     purposes; and\n       (B) members of the Tribe who, due to age, infirmity, or \n     disability, would have difficulty accessing the conveyed \n     parcel on foot.\n       (e) Use of Land.--\n       (1) In general.--In using the parcel conveyed under \n     subsection (c), the Tribe and members of the Tribe--\n       (A) shall limit the use of the parcel to traditional and \n     customary uses and stewardship conservation of the Tribe and \n     not permit any commercial use (including commercial \n     development, residential development, gaming, sale of timber, \n     or mineral extraction); and\n       (B) shall comply with environmental requirements that are \n     no less protective than environmental requirements that apply \n     under the Regional Plan of the Tahoe Regional Planning \n     Agency.\n       (2) Reversion.--If the Secretary of the Interior, after \n     notice to the Tribe and an opportunity for a hearing, based \n     on monitoring of use of the parcel by the Tribe, makes a \n     finding that the Tribe has used or permitted the use of the \n     parcel in violation of paragraph (1) and the Tribe fails to \n     take corrective or remedial action directed by the Secretary \n     of the Interior, title to the parcel shall revert to the \n     Secretary of Agriculture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/19/senate-section/article/S5363-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 124--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE CONGRESS \n WITH REGARD TO IRAQ'S FAILURE TO RELEASE PRISONERS OF WAR FROM KUWAIT \n    AND NINE OTHER NATIONS IN VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI submitted the following concurrent resolution; which \nwas referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 124\n\n       Whereas in 1990 and 1991, thousands of Kuwaitis were \n     randomly arrested on the streets of Kuwait during the Iraqi \n     occupation;\n       Whereas in February 1993, the Government of Kuwait compiled \n     evidence documenting the existence of 605 prisoners of war \n     and submitted its files to the International Committee of the \n     Red Cross (ICRC), which passed those files on to Iraq, the \n     United Nations, and the Arab League;\n       Whereas numerous testimonials exist from family members who \n     witnessed the arrest and forcible removal of their relatives \n     by Iraqi armed forces during the occupation;\n       Whereas eyewitness reports from released prisoners of war \n     indicate that many of those who are still missing were seen \n     and contacted in Iraqi prisons;\n       Whereas official Iraqi documents left behind in Kuwait \n     chronicle in detail the arrest, imprisonment, and transfer of \n     significant numbers of Kuwaitis, including those who are \n     still missing;\n       Whereas in 1991, the United Nations Security Council \n     overwhelmingly passed Security Council Resolutions 686 and \n     687 that were part of the broad cease-fire agreement accepted \n     by the Iraqi regime;\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 686 \n     calls upon Iraq to arrange for immediate access to and \n     release of all prisoners of war under the auspices of the \n     ICRC and to return the remains of the deceased personnel of \n     the forces of Kuwait and the Member States cooperating with \n     Kuwait;\n       Whereas United Nations Security Resolution 687 calls upon \n     Iraq to cooperate with the ICRC in the repatriation of all \n     Kuwaiti and third-country nationals, to provide the ICRC with \n     access to the prisoners wherever they are located or \n     detained, and to facilitate the ICRC search for those \n     unaccounted for;\n       Whereas the Government of Kuwait, in accordance with United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 686, immediately released \n     all Iraqi prisoners of war as required by the terms of the \n     Geneva Convention;\n       Whereas immediately following the cease-fire in March 1991, \n     Iraq repatriated 5,722 Kuwaiti prisoners of war under the \n     aegis of the ICRC and freed 500 Kuwaitis held by rebels in \n     southern Iraq;\n       Whereas Iraq has hindered and blocked efforts of the \n     Tripartite Commission, the eight-country commission chaired \n     by the ICRC and responsible for locating and securing the \n     release of the remaining prisoners of war;\n       Whereas Iraq has denied the ICRC access to Iraqi prisons in \n     violation of Article 126 of the Third Geneva Convention, to \n     which Iraq is a signatory; and\n       Whereas Iraq--under the direction and control of Saddam \n     Hussein--has failed to locate and secure the return of all \n     prisoners of war being held in Iraq, including prisoners from \n     Kuwait and nine other nations: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) the Congress--\n       (A) acknowledges that there remain 605 prisoners of war \n     unaccounted for in Iraq, although Kuwait was liberated from \n     Iraq's brutal invasion and occupation on February 26, 1991;\n       (B) condemns and denounces the Iraqi Government's refusal \n     to comply with international human rights instruments to \n     which it is a party;\n       (C) urges Iraq immediately to disclose the names and \n     whereabouts of those who are still alive among the Kuwaiti \n     prisoners of war and other nations to bring relief to their \n     families; and\n       (D) insists that Iraq immediately allow humanitarian \n     organizations such as the International Committee of the Red \n     Cross to visit the living prisoners and to recover the \n     remains of those who have died while in captivity; and\n       (2) it is the sense of the Congress that the United States \n     Government should--\n       (A) actively and urgently work with the international \n     community and the Government of Kuwait, in accordance with \n     United Nations Security Council Resolutions 686 and 687, to \n     secure the release of Kuwaiti prisoners of war and other \n     prisoners of war who are still missing nine years after the \n     end of the Gulf War; and\n       (B) exert pressure, as a permanent member of the United \n     Nations Security Council, on Iraq to bring this issue to a \n     close, to release all remaining prisoners of the Iraqi \n     occupation of Kuwait, and to rejoin the community of nations \n     with a humane gesture of good will and decency.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/19/senate-section/article/S5363-2", "month": "06",

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an \namendment to the Senate Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug \nAdministration and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill that seeks to \nprovide much needed assistance to our nation's apple and potato \nfarmers. In the past three years, due to weather related disasters, \ndisease and the dumping of Chinese apply juice concentrate, our \nnation's apple producers have lost over three-quarters of a billion \ndollars in revenue. Likewise, potato producers in much of the country \nhave struggled to overcome adverse weather conditions which have \nreduced the value of or, in some cases, destroyed their crops. This has \nleft many growers on the brink of financial disaster.\n  In the past two years, Congress has assisted America's farmers by \nproviding substantial assistance to agricultural producers. However, \napple and potato producers received little, if any, of that assistance. \nThe $115 million in assistance we are proposing will help these \nproducers, and ensure that apple and potato growers will be able to \nprovide the United States and the world with a quality product that is \nsecond to none.\n  Mr. President I am proud to introduce this legislation that will \ndirectly assist our nation's apple and potato growers, and I urge all \nSenators to support me in this matter.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2001\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       McCAIN AMENDMENT NO. 3458\n\n  Mr. WARNER (for Mr. McCain) proposed an amendment to the bill (S. \n2549) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2001 for military \nactivities of the Department of Defense, for military construction, and \nfor defense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe \npersonnel strengths for such fiscal year of the Armed Forces, and for \nother purposes, as follows:\n\n       On page 239, following line 22, add the following:\n\n[[Page S5365]]\n\n     SEC. 656.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Local Law Enforcement \n     Enhancement Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. ____02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The incidence of violence motivated by the actual or \n     perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, \n     sexual orientation, or disability of the victim poses a \n     serious national problem.\n       (2) Such violence disrupts the tranquility and safety of \n     communities and is deeply divisive.\n       (3) State and local authorities are now and will continue \n     to be responsible for prosecuting the overwhelming majority \n     of violent crimes in the United States, including violent \n     crimes motivated by bias. These authorities can carry out \n     their responsibilities more effectively with greater Federal \n     assistance.\n       (4) Existing Federal law is inadequate to address this \n     problem.\n       (5) The prominent characteristic of a violent crime \n     motivated by bias is that it devastates not just the actual \n     victim and the victim's family and friends, but frequently \n     savages the community sharing the traits that caused the \n     victim to be selected.\n       (6) Such violence substantially affects interstate commerce \n     in many ways, including--\n       (A) by impeding the movement of members of targeted groups \n     and forcing such members to move across State lines to escape \n     the incidence or risk of such violence; and\n       (B) by preventing members of targeted groups from \n     purchasing goods and services, obtaining or sustaining \n     employment or participating in other commercial activity.\n       (7) Perpetrators cross State lines to commit such violence.\n       (8) Channels, facilities, and instrumentalities of \n     interstate commerce are used to facilitate the commission of \n     such violence.\n       (9) Such violence is committed using articles that have \n     traveled in interstate commerce.\n       (10) For generations, the institutions of slavery and \n     involuntary servitude were defined by the race, color, and \n     ancestry of those held in bondage. Slavery and involuntary \n     servitude were enforced, both prior to and after the adoption \n     of the 13th amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, through widespread public and private violence \n     directed at persons because of their race, color, or \n     ancestry, or perceived race, color, or ancestry. Accordingly, \n     eliminating racially motivated violence is an important means \n     of eliminating, to the extent possible, the badges, \n     incidents, and relics of slavery and involuntary servitude.\n       (11) Both at the time when the 13th, 14th, and 15th \n     amendments to the Constitution of the United States were \n     adopted, and continuing to date, members of certain religious \n     and national origin groups were and are perceived to be \n     distinct ``races''. Thus, in order to eliminate, to the \n     extent possible, the badges, incidents, and relics of \n     slavery, it is necessary to prohibit assaults on the basis of \n     real or perceived religions or national origins, at least to \n     the extent such religions or national origins were regarded \n     as races at the time of the adoption of the 13th, 14th, and \n     15th amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\n       (12) Federal jurisdiction over certain violent crimes \n     motivated by bias enables Federal, State, and local \n     authorities to work together as partners in the investigation \n     and prosecution of such crimes.\n       (13) The problem of crimes motivated by bias is \n     sufficiently serious, widespread, and interstate in nature as \n     to warrant Federal assistance to States and local \n     jurisdictions.\n\n     SEC. ____03. DEFINITION OF HATE CRIME.\n\n       In this title, the term ``hate crime'' has the same meaning \n     as in section 280003(a) of the Violent Crime Control and Law \n     Enforcement Act of 1994 (28 U.S.C. 994 note).\n\n     SEC. ____04.

Parking Space for Trucks. (a) Findings.--Congress \n     finds that--\n       (1) in 1998, there were 5,374 truck-related highway \n     fatalities and 4,935 trucks involved in fatal crashes;\n       (2) a Special Investigation Report published by the \n     National Transportation Safety Board in May 2000 found that \n     research conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety \n     Administration suggests that truck driver fatigue is a \n     contributing factor in as many as 30 to 40 percent of all \n     heavy truck accidents;\n       (3) a 1995 Transportation Safety Board Study found that the \n     availability of parking for truck drivers can have a direct \n     impact on the incidence of fatigue-related accidents;\n       (4) a 1996 study by the Federal Highway Administration \n     found that there is a nationwide shortfall of 28,400 truck \n     parking spaces in public rest areas, a number expected to \n     reach 39,000 by 2005;\n       (5) a 1999 survey conducted by the Owner-Operator \n     Independent Drivers Association found that over 90 percent of \n     its members have difficulty finding parking spaces in rest \n     areas at least once a week; and\n       (6) because of overcrowding at rest areas, truckers are \n     increasingly forced to park on the entrance and exit ramps of \n     highways, in shopping center parking lots, at shipper \n     locations, and on the shoulders of roadways, thereby \n     increasing the risk of serious accidents.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress and the President should take immediate steps \n     to address the lack of safe available commercial vehicle \n     parking along Interstate highways for truck drivers.\n       Sec. 348. Study of Adverse Effects of Idling Train Engines. \n     (a) Study Required.--The Secretary of Transportation shall \n     provide under section 150303 of title 36, United States Code, \n     for the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study on \n     noise impacts of railroad operations, including idling train \n     engines on the quality of life of nearby communities, the \n     quality of the environment (including consideration of air \n     pollution), and safety, and to submit a report on the study \n     to the Secretary. The report shall include recommendations \n     for mitigation to combat rail noise, standards for \n     determining when noise mitigation is required, needed changes \n     in Federal law to give Federal, State, and local governments \n     flexibility in combating railroad noise, and possible funding \n     mechanisms for financing mitigation projects.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall \n     transmit to Congress the report of the National Academy of \n     Sciences on the results of the study under subsection (a).\n       Sec. 349. Within the funds made available in this Act, \n     $10,000,000 shall be for the costs associated with \n     construction of a third track on the Northeast Corridor \n     between Davisville and Central Falls, Rhode Island, with \n     sufficient clearance to accommodate double stack freight \n     cars, to be matched by the State of Rhode Island or its \n     designee on a dollar-for-dollar basis and to remain available \n     until expended; $2,000,000 shall be for a joint United \n     States-Canada commission to study the feasibility of \n     connecting the rail system in Alaska to the North American \n     continental rail system; $400,000 shall be allocated for \n     passenger rail corridor planning activities to fund the \n     preparation of a strategic plan for development of the Gulf \n     Coast High Speed Rail Corridor; and $250,000 shall be \n     available to the city of Traverse City, Michigan \n     comprehensive transportation plan.\n       Sec. 350. (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 saved \n     approximately 3,800 lives in providing the essential service \n     of maritime safety.\n       (2) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 prevented 111,689 \n     pounds of cocaine and 28,872 pounds of marijuana from \n     entering the United States in providing the essential service \n     of maritime security.\n       (3) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 boarded more than \n     14,000 fishing vessels to check for compliance with safety \n     and environmental laws in providing the essential service of \n     the protection of natural resources.\n       (4) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 ensured the safe \n     passage of nearly 1,000,000 commercial vessel transits \n     through congested harbors with vessel traffic services in \n     providing the essential service of maritime mobility.\n       (5) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 sent \n     international training teams to help more than 50 countries \n     develop their maritime services in providing the essential \n     service national defense.\n       (6) Each year, the United States Coast Guard ensures the \n     safe passage of more than 200,000,000 tons of cargo cross the \n     Great Lakes including iron ore, coal, and limestone. Shipping \n     on the Great Lakes faces a unique challenge because the \n     shipping season begins and ends in ice anywhere from 3 to 15 \n     feet thick. The ice-breaking vessel MACKINAW has allowed \n     commerce to continue under these conditions. However, the \n     productive life of the MACKINAW will end in 2006.\n       (7) Without adequate funding, the United States Coast Guard \n     would have to radically reduce the level of service it \n     provides to the American public.\n       (8) The allocation to the Committee on Appropriations of \n     the Senate of funds available for the Department of \n     Transportation and related agencies for fiscal year 2001 was \n     $1,600,000,000 less than the allocation to the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the House of Representatives of funds \n     available for that purpose for that fiscal year. The lower \n     allocation compelled the Subcommittee on Transportation of \n     the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate to recommend \n     reductions from the funding requested in the President's \n     budget on funds available for the Coast Guard, particularly \n     amounts available for acquisitions, that may not have been \n     imposed had a larger allocation been made, or had the \n     President's budget not included $212,000,000 in new user fees \n     on the maritime community. The difference between the amount \n     of funds requested by the Coast Guard for the Acquisition, \n     Construction, and Improvements account and the amount made \n     available by the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate \n     for those acquisitions conflicts with the high priority \n     afforded by the Senate to Acquisition, Construction, and \n     Improvements procurements, which are of critical\n\n[[Page S5382]]\n\n     national importance to commerce, navigation, and safety.\n       (9) Due to shortfalls in funds available for fiscal year \n     2000 and unexpected increases in personnel benefits and fuel \n     costs on the 2000 operating expenses account, the Commandant \n     of the Coast Guard has announced reductions in critical \n     operations of the Coast Guard by as much as 30 percent in \n     some areas of the United States. If left unaddressed, these \n     shortfalls may compromise the service provided by the Coast \n     Guard to the public in all areas, including drug interdiction \n     and migrant interdiction, aid to navigation, and fisheries \n     management.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the committee of conference on the bill H.R. 4425 of \n     the 106th Congress, making appropriations for military \n     construction, family housing, and base realignment and \n     closure for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2001, or any other appropriate committee \n     of conference of the second session of the 106th Congress, \n     should approve supplemental funding for the Coast Guard for \n     fiscal year 2000 as soon as is practicable; and\n       (2) upon adoption of this bill by the Senate, the conferees \n     of the Senate to the committee of conference on the bill H.R. \n     4475 of the 106th Congress, making appropriations for the \n     Department of Transportation and related agencies for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 2001, provided there is \n     sufficient budget authority, should--\n       (A) recede from their disagreement to the proposal of the \n     conferees of the House of Representatives to the committee of \n     conference on the bill H.R. 4475 with respect to funding for \n     Acquisition, Construction, and Improvements;\n       (B) provide adequate funds for operations of the Coast \n     Guard in fiscal year 2001, including activities relating to \n     drug and migrant interdiction and fisheries enforcement; and\n       (C) provide sufficient funds for the Coast Guard in fiscal \n     year 2001 to correct the 30 percent reduction in funds for \n     operations of the Coast Guard in fiscal year 2000.\n       Sec. 351. For the purpose of constructing an underpass to \n     improve access and enhance highway/rail safety and economic \n     development along Star Landing Road in DeSoto County, \n     Mississippi, the State of Mississippi may use funds \n     previously allocated to it under the transportation \n     enhancements program, if available.\n       Sec. 352. Section 1214 of Public Law 105-178, as amended, \n     is further amended by adding a new subsection to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(s) Notwithstanding sections 117 (c) and (d) of title 23, \n     United States Code, for project number 1646 in section 1602 \n     of Public Law 105-178--\n       ``(1) the non-Federal share of the project may be funded by \n     Federal funds from an agency or agencies not part of the \n     United States Department of Transportation; and\n       ``(2) the Secretary shall not delegate responsibility for \n     carrying out the project to a State.''.\n       Sec. 353. Additional Sanction for Revenue Diversion. Except \n     as necessary to ensure public safety, no amount appropriated \n     under this or any other Act may be used to fund any airport-\n     related grant for the Los Angeles International Airport made \n     to the City of Los Angeles, or any inter-governmental body of \n     which it is a member, by the Department of Transportation or \n     the Federal Aviation Administration, until the \n     Administration--\n       (1) concludes the investigation initiated in Docket 13-95-\n     05; and\n       (2) either--\n       (A) takes action, if necessary and appropriate, on the \n     basis of the investigation to ensure compliance with \n     applicable laws, policies, and grant assurances regarding \n     revenue use and retention by an airport; or\n       (B) determines that no action is warranted.\n       Sec. 354. Hereafter, the New Jersey Transit commuter rail \n     station to be located at the intersection of the Main/Bergen \n     line and the Northeast Corridor line in the State of New \n     Jersey shall be known and designated as the ``Frank R. \n     Lautenberg Transfer Station'': Provided, That the Secretary \n     of Transportation shall ensure that any and all applicable \n     reference in law, map, regulation, documentation, and all \n     appropriate signage shall make reference to the ``Frank R. \n     Lautenberg Transfer Station''.\n\n                                TITLE IV\n\n                       DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY\n\n                       bureau of the public debt\n\n            supplemental appropriation for fiscal year 2000\n\n      gifts to the united states for reduction of the public debt\n\n       For deposit of an additional amount for fiscal year 2000 \n     into the account established under section 3113(d) of title \n     31, United States Code, to reduce the public debt, \n     $12,200,000,000.\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Transportation \n     and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/19/senate-section/article/S5382-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   MEASURE PLACED ON CALENDAR--H.R. 8\n\n  Mr. HATCH.
