Mr. President, I rise this morning to respond to a series \nof ads that are being run in my State by the National Republican \nCongressional Campaign Committee. These ads are false. They are what \ncan only be charitably termed misleading, and they diminish the \ncredibility of the National Republican Congressional Campaign \nCommittee.\n  That is not just my conclusion, Mr. President. That is the conclusion \nof the major newspaper of my State, the Fargo Forum, which has written \nan editorial in which it says:\n\n       Politics is often a down and dirty business, but \n     the National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee's \n     early TV ads 13 months before the election, and even \n     before State Republicans have an endorsed congressional \n     candidate, are a new low in the campaign gutter. They're \n     false on every level. Decent North Dakota Republicans \n     should tell the national group to clean up its act.\n\n  Well, amen to that because the National Republican Congressional \nCampaign Committee ought to be ashamed of the ads they are running in \nNorth Dakota. They are claiming that Democrats are raiding the Social \nSecurity trust fund here in Washington. They must have forgotten they \nare in control in the House of Representatives and they are in control \nin the Senate. It is not Democrats who are determining the spending \npriorities in the House of Representatives. The Republicans are in \ncontrol. They are deciding the budget outcome in the House of \nRepresentatives. If ever there was a case of the pot calling the kettle \nblack, this is it because we know that the majority party themselves \nare, in fact, raiding Social Security.\n  That is not just the conclusion of the senior Senator from North \nDakota. That is the conclusion of the Washington Post which had a major \nnews story with the headline ``GOP Spending Bills Tap Social Security \nSurplus.'' It is the Republican Party's plan that is tapping the Social \nSecurity surplus.\n  For them to then run ads claiming the Democrats are doing it is just \na giant diversionary tactic. They are trying to avoid responsibility \nfor what they are doing. It is not only the Washington Post that has \nmade this point. We also have the Congressional Budget Office. The \nCongressional Budget Office, which they control, has sent a letter \nwhich says very clearly that the Republican spending plans have tapped \nSocial Security for $18 billion. In other words, they are raiding the \nSocial Security accounts for $18 billion. That is their plan, that is \ntheir responsibility, and to avoid accountability apparently they have \ndecided, or their campaign consultants have decided, that the best \ndefense is an offensive attack.\n  So in my State of North Dakota, 13 months before the election, they \nare running ads that the major newspaper in my State says are ``a new \nlow in the campaign gutter. They are false on\n\n[[Page S13196]]\n\nevery level.'' And, indeed, they are. They are false on every level. \nThe people of America who are being subjected to these ads ought to \nknow exactly what is going on and who is doing what with respect to the \nbudget of the United States.\n  One of the things I find most ironic is that the National Republican \nCongressional Campaign Committee which is sponsoring these ads are the \nvery same folks who sponsored a constitutional amendment a number of \nyears ago that had as its base that they would raid the Social Security \ntrust fund in order to balance the budget. These folks who trumpeted \nthis constitutional amendment to balance the budget had as a definition \nof a balanced budget the raiding of the Social Security trust fund.\n  Now they have the chutzpah to come before the American people and run \nads saying the Democrats are raiding the Social Security trust fund \nsurplus. And the Democrats are not in control. We don't control the \nU.S. House of Representatives. We don't control the Senate.\n  Again, the major newspaper in my State has called these ads false on \nevery level.\n  Maybe it is helpful to review the record of who has done what with \nrespect to budget policy.\n  I am on the Budget Committee. I am on the Finance Committee. I am \nknown in the Budget Committee as the ``deficit hawk.''\n  I have been involved in every effort to get our fiscal house in \norder. I believe deeply in the need for fiscal discipline. That is \nprimarily why I ran for the Senate. I saw back when I ran in 1986 that \nthings were running amuck; that the deficits were growing; that we were \ngetting deeper in debt, and this country was in real trouble. I \nbelieved then and I believe now that it is threatening the national \nsecurity of the United States.\n  If we go back and review the record of the Reagan years, he inherited \na deficit of about $80 billion. Very quickly, under Reaganomics the \ndeficit exploded up to over $200 billion a year. In fact, during this \ntime we tripled the national debt. This trickle-down economics was a \ndisaster.\n  Then we saw in the Bush years, again, the deficit took off like a \nscalded cat. It went from $150 billion a year up to $290 billion a \nyear.\n  That is the record of our friends on the other side of the aisle. \nThey were in charge. They were in control. Reaganomics was carrying the \nday.\n  We saw headline after headline about how the Republicans in the House \nand the Senate in conjunction with boll weevil Democrats were passing \nReaganomics and Reaganomics exploded the deficit and exploded the debt. \nThat is the record.\n  When the Clinton administration came in in 1992, we passed a plan in \n1993 that reduced the deficit--a 5-year budget plan. We can go back and \ncheck the record. It is not a matter of running television ads. It is a \nmatter of fact. Facts are very clear.\n  The deficit under that 5-year plan declined each and every year. The \ndeficit went down from $290 billion in the last year of the Bush \nadministration to $255 billion. And each year that deficit was reduced \nin the 5 years of that budget plan.\n  By the way, we passed that budget plan without a single Republican \nvote--not one, not one. In 1997, we agreed on a bipartisan plan to \nfinish the job.\n  There I commend our colleagues on the other side of the aisle because \nwe did join together in 1997 for a balanced budget plan to finish the \njob. But the truth is most of the heavy lifting had been done by the \n1993 plan. But we didn't have a single Republican vote--not one.\n  I heard another ad this morning, this time attacking Bill Bradley and \nAl Gore. This was run by some committee called the National Republican \nCouncil. I never heard of it. But they were running ads attacking Bill \nBradley and Al Gore saying they had voted for increased spending and \nincreased taxes.\n  Do you know they were here and they were fighting for the 1993 plan \nthat eliminated this deficit? That is the fact. The fact is Federal \nspending in real terms, as measured as a percentage of our national \nincome, is at its lowest level since 1974. Back in 1993 when we passed \nthat plan, Federal spending was 22 percent of our national income. It \nis now down to 19 percent of our national income.\n\n  So the truth about Mr. Bradley, who voted for that 1993 plan, and the \ntruth about Mr. Gore, who was Vice President and argued for that 1993 \nplan, is that in real terms they supported a reduction in Federal \nspending. That is the truth. That is the truth of the matter.\n  But I guess political consultants don't have to worry about the \ntruth. They are more interested in scoring rhetorical points. They \ndon't have to worry apparently about the factual record.\n  Let's look at the factual record. Here is the history going back 20 \nyears in Federal receipts and Federal outlays.\n  The blue line shows expenditures of the Federal Government. The red \nline is the income of the Federal Government, the receipts. You can see \nduring the Reagan years there was an enormous gap between the two. That \nis why we had these budget deficits because we were spending more than \nwe were taking in.\n  In 1993, right here when we passed the plan, again, without a single \nRepublican vote, that cut spending. You can see the blue line--the \nspending line--is coming down, and it raised revenue. Yes, it did. We \nraised taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent in this country; raised income \ntaxes on the wealthiest 1 percent. And it was that combination of \ncutting spending and raising revenue that eliminated the deficit.\n  That is how we balanced the budget. Thank God we did. Thank God there \nwas a Bill Bradley who was courageous enough to stand on this floor and \ncast a tough vote to get our fiscal house in order. Thank God there was \nan Al Gore as Vice President of the United States who had the courage \nto stand up and support a plan to get our fiscal house in order after \nthe disasters of the Reagan and Bush administrations when it was all \ntalk about fiscal responsibility and it was all deficits and debt. That \nis their legacy.\n  If we want to debate, I am ready to debate this anytime anywhere with \nanyone about what happened and when and what the results have been. But \nthey have these smear ads running in my State and smear ads running \nnationally that distort the truth.\n  That is going to get a response because we are not going to allow \npeople to tell falsehoods about what occurred. Too many people took \nreal risks in order to get the fiscal house of our country back in \norder, and the record is abundantly clear about who did what.\n  This is the reality. In 1993, a 5-year budget plan was passed that \nworked, that cut spending in real terms, that raised revenue, and that \nbalanced the budget. The result is a dramatically strengthened \neconomy--the longest record of economic expansion in our history, and \nan economic performance that is the envy of the world.\n  The inflation rate is the lowest in 33 years. Here we went. In 1993, \nthe plan was passed. Inflation came down. The unemployment rate is the \nlowest in 41 years. The central reason was the budget plan that was \npassed in 1993 that moved us toward a balanced budget and towards \nfiscal discipline to getting our fiscal house in order.\n  Debt held by the public is coming down dramatically. In 1993, the \nfirst year of the plan, publicly held debt in comparison with our gross \ndomestic product was 50 percent. If we stay on the course that we have \nset now, we will have this debt down to 9 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct in 2009. We can eliminate publicly held debt in 15 years.\n  That is the course we are on. That is the course the Democrats \nestablished. That is the course which is the result of the 1993 plan \nthat brought fiscal discipline back to this government and led to an \nincredible economic expansion.\n  Welfare caseloads: Another benefit of getting our fiscal house in \norder.\n  This is also not only a result of a good economy, but it is also a \nresult of welfare reform, which in fairness I should say was done on a \nbipartisan basis. We had help from our Republican friends, and many of \nus felt strongly that welfare reform was required, and, indeed, it has \nproduced incredibly positive results. Welfare caseloads are the lowest \nthey have been in 29 years.\n  Republicans, this year, have engaged the Congress in a series of what \nI can\n\n[[Page S13197]]\n\nonly call sort of baffling gimmicks, in order to try to make it look to \nthe American people that they are not raiding Social Security.\n\n  They are running ads that the major newspaper in my State has \ndescribed as ``a new low in the campaign gutter. They are false on \nevery level.'' That is what the Republican Congressional Campaign \nCommittee is instituting in my State. The facts show something quite \ndifferent.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says the non-Social Security surplus \nfor the year we are working on, fiscal year 2000, is $14 billion. What \ndoes that mean? That means if we take out the Social Security surplus, \nwe have $14 billion of what I call a true surplus in fiscal year 2000. \nIf we take the House and Senate committee actions to date, the Budget \nCommittee directives to CBO spent $18 billion of that.\n  Emergency spending: The Republicans have labeled a whole series of \nspending initiatives ``emergencies'' to avoid the requirements of \nfiscal discipline--$13 billion is declared emergencies, including the \ncensus. The census is provided for in the U.S. Constitution. We have \nbeen instituting the census for 200 years in this country, and they \ndeclare it an emergency. They declared the low-income heating program \nin this country an emergency--a program we have had for 24 years. That \nis absolutely nonsense.\n  Social Security administrative costs: They have taken those and don't \nwant to count them, debt service costs and others. Add this up, and \nthey are into Social Security by $21 billion. They are raiding Social \nSecurity by $21 billion and are trying to hide the raid by running \ntelevision ads that some clever campaign consultant told them is their \nbest strategy for avoiding their own responsibility. To try to avoid \ntheir own accountability, they are claiming the Democrats are \ninstituting it. The problem with that: Democrats are not in control. \nRepublicans are in control, and this is what they are instituting. They \nare raiding Social Security. The record is abundantly clear.\n  One of the last times I came to the floor was when the Republicans \ncame up with the gimmick--and they have come up with a whole series of \nthem to try to avoid the charge that they are instituting precisely \nwhat they claim Democrats are instituting--of having a 13th month. They \ncame up with kind of a clever idea to get around the problem by \ndeclaring a 13th month in this country. The last time I checked the \ncalendar, there were only 12 months. But the Republicans decided they \nwould come up with a 13th month to make it look as though they were not \nraiding the Social Security trust fund surplus. That is a novel idea. I \ncame to the floor and wondered, what would they call it? ``Spend-\ntember''? Would they call it ``Fictionary''? What would we call a 13th \nmonth?\n  Why stop there? Why not have 14 or 15 months? What would be the \nadditional month that would be added? Would we have two Augusts or two \nDecembers? I favored two Octobers because I enjoy baseball; we could \nhave two World Series. Maybe we could have two Decembers so we could \ncelebrate Christmas twice.\n  I know it sounds far fetched, but this is the headline in the \nWashington Post: ``GOP Seeks to Ease Crunch with 13-Month Fiscal \nYear.'' That is the length to which they go to avoid accountability and \nresponsibility. That is what happened.\n  That is not the only gimmick they came up with. They got the 13th \nmonth. They have the census emergency--the census we have been \ninstituting for 200 years they claim is an emergency. They declared \nLIHEAP an emergency, the low-income heating program. We have had that \nprogram for 24 years. They proposed delaying earned-income tax credit \npayments to people. They were even chastised by their own leading \nPresidential candidate. He made it very clear they were way out of tune \nwith the American people when they proposed that gimmick.\n\n  That is what is going on to cover this mismanagement and to cover \nthis fiscal irresponsibility. The National Republican Congressional \nCampaign Committee is running television ads in my State claiming \nDemocrats are raiding Social Security. That dog doesn't hunt. That is \nnot going to fly. We are going to respond very forcefully when people \ntry to misrepresent the record.\n  As I began, I conclude: The major newspaper in my State called these \nads ``a new low in the campaign gutter. They are false on every \nlevel.''\n  That is the truth. I hope the National Republican Congressional \nCampaign Committee will stop running these ads because they are false. \nThey are irresponsible. They are misleading. They ought to be stopped. \nThat is the record. That is the fact. I hope people, as they evaluate \ncandidates in this next election, will inquire: What is the record of \ncandidates on the question of spending Social Security surpluses, on \nraiding Social Security trust funds?\n  I am prepared to answer that question. Every budget plan I have \noffered, every budget plan Senate Democrats have offered, has \nmaintained the Social Security surplus. We haven't touched the Social \nSecurity surplus. We wouldn't engage in a raid of the Social Security \nsurplus. That is true of the plan Senate Democrats offered in the \nFinance Committee. That is true of the plan Senate Democrats offered in \nthe Budget Committee. For anyone to say anything else is an absolute \nfalsehood.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft).

Mr. President, I want to respond to some of the comments \nmade on the floor relative to where we are going with the budget. I \nspecifically want to talk about the issue as it relates to a committee \nof which I am chairman. The committee I chair is the Commerce, Justice, \nState, and the Judiciary Subcommittee. The President of the United \nStates opted to veto our bill. In his veto message, his representation \nwas that we simply had not spent enough money. That was essentially \nwhat it came down to.\n  His representation on the other bills he has vetoed is also that we \nhave not spent enough money as a Congress. In fact, in listening to the \nPresident and the proposals he puts forward, we find he is talking \nabout spending billions and billions more than what the Congress \nsuggested we spend.\n  The Senator from North Dakota has come to the floor and said that the \nRepublicans have used gimmicks, that we have forward-funded, which we \nhave, which is not a gimmick; it has been done in the Congress before \non many occasions; that we have declared items emergencies, which we \nhave. In fact, the Senator from North Dakota supported, I suspect \nrather strongly and with enthusiasm, the declaring of the agricultural \nsituation as an emergency. It has been declared an emergency every year \nsince I have been here, so I don't know why it is an emergency. But it \nhas been declared an emergency. It is a way of funding agricultural \nissues, and there are severe strictures in the agricultural community \ntoday.\n\n  The Senator from North Dakota didn't mention where we are going to \nget the extra money the President asked for. Where are we going to get \nit? The Republicans have allegedly used gimmicks so we could not take \nit from Social Security--which we have not, by the way; we have managed \nnot to take any money from Social Security. Where is the President \ngoing to get it from? The President is going to get it from Social \nSecurity because the only other option is to raise taxes and we have \nalready seen a vote in the House of Representatives--415-0 I think was \nthe vote--saying they were not going to raise taxes. So that is not an \noption. It is not even on the table.\n  The President makes these proposals: We are going to raise spending \nhere; we want more money here; we want more money here. The Democratic \nMembers, on the other side of the aisle, say: Hooray, hooray, more \nmoney for this, more money for that. When Republicans say, Isn't that \ncoming out of Social Security? there is just this silence from the \nother side of the aisle.\n\n[[Page S13198]]\n\n  Of course, it is coming out of Social Security because we have no \nother resource from which to draw those funds than Social Security. So \nthere is a lot of gamesmanship coming from the other side of the aisle \non this issue. There always has been, on Social Security, of course. \nThere are literally generations, now, of Members of the other side of \nthe aisle who have demagogged the issue of Social Security. As many of \nus have tried to put forward substantive Social Security responses, we \nhave found this President, who allegedly wants to address Social \nSecurity, has failed to do so in a substantive way. But we hear now he \nwants to raid Social Security to pay for his new spending and they will \nnot even admit to that. The statements from the other side of the aisle \nare hollow on that issue, to say the least. But let me go back to the \nspecifics of this proposal.\n  The President has vetoed the Commerce-State-Justice bill, which has \nunder it the Justice Department, the Commerce Department, and the State \nDepartment. It also has a lot of agencies such as the Small Business \nAdministration, FCC, FTC, SEC, elements of Government which are \ncritical to the day-to-day operation of the Government and to our \nmaintaining a sound economy and safe society. But the President has \nvetoed this bill. Why has he vetoed it? Basically, he has vetoed \nit because we did not spend enough money in some of the programs he \nwanted and because we did not include language he wanted in a couple of \nareas. He has vetoed it specifically on the allegations we do not spend \nenough money on the COPS Program.\n\n  Let's look at that for a second. This Congress authorized 100,000 \ncops to be put on the street under the President's request, in a \nbipartisan way. We have paid for every one of those police officers in \nthis appropriations bill. Not only have we paid for every one of those \npolice officers, we paid for an additional 10,000 or 15,000 police \nofficers in this bill. So we can go up to 110,000 or 115,000 police \nofficers under this bill.\n  What does the President say? He says that is not enough. He says he \nwants 130,000 to 150,000 police officers, even though there are only \n100,000 authorized. That in itself is a bit of a reach, to ask for an \nextra 30,000 to 50,000 officers when they are not even authorized. But \nwhat is really inconsistent about this, and what really shows what a \nsham statement this is, the administration, although they have the \nmoney for 100,000 officers since we paid for 100,000 officers in our \nbill, has only been able to get out of the door enough money to fund \n60,000 officers. In other words, down there in the White House they are \nnow asking for another 30,000 to 50,000 officers when they cannot even \nundertake the day-to-day administrative event of paying for the full \n100,000 we gave them in the first place. They are still 40,000 officers \nshort from the original authorized number.\n  It takes 18 months to get this through the system, to get an officer \non the street after they have agreed to pay for that officer. So they \nare literally a year and a half away at the minimum from even reaching \nthe 100,000 level. So we said, OK, we agree more officers on the street \nmakes sense so we will go over the 100,000 number; we will give you \nanother 10,000 officers. Then the President vetoes it, saying he hasn't \nenough, when his administration has not even put out on the street the \nfirst 100,000. How blatantly political can this administration be? How \nhypocritical can this administration be? They did not veto this bill \nover police officers who were not there. They vetoed this bill because \nthey want to put out a press release that they are vetoing bills. It \nhad nothing to do with the actual substance of how many police officers \nwe have on the street or how many police officers we paid for because \nwe paid for every police officer they put out there, and we are willing \nto pay for another 40,000, another 55,000 if they could put them out. \nBut they cannot because they are not able to do it. It is pure hocum, \nthis language that they want more police officers, and they vetoed it \nover the lack of funding in this account. It is just a pure political \nthing.\n  Then they said they vetoed it because they did not get enough money--\nno, not because they didn't get enough, because we did not give them \nthe money for the U.N. We did not give them the money for the U.N.\n  Every dollar they asked for, for the U.N., is in this bill, every \ndollar for U.N. fees is in this bill. Every dollar for arrearages is in \nthis bill. Yes, there is not the full money they asked for for \npeacekeeping, but every other account in the U.N. is fully paid for in \nthis bill. Why can't they get it out? Why can't they send it up to the \nU.N.? Why can't they pay England the arrearages we owe them? Why can't \nthey pay France the arrearages we owe them? That is where this money \ngoes. It doesn't stay in the U.N. Most of it flows to other countries \nthat have picked up our obligations. Because they have a bunch of \nactivists down at the White House who are focused on a very narrow \nissue of international Planned Parenthood and are unwilling to release \nthe money to fund the world organization known as the U.N., which is a \nmajor international organization, because they are willing to hold up \nfunding over an extraordinarily narrow issue dealing with Planned \nParenthood lobbying internationally. It does not have anything to do \nwith the United States.\n\n  Not only that, but the language which they are holding up the funding \nover is language which was in existence, which this Government operated \nunder during the Reagan administration and during the Bush \nadministration. It is, to say the least, genuinely innocuous language. \nBut they have activists down there at the White House, activists who \nare willing to take down the U.N. and our relationship with the U.N. \nover this narrow piece of language.\n  It is unbelievable they would blame the Congress, which has fully \nfunded the arrearage issue, when it is just a small group of extreme \nactivists serving at the White House who are tying up the release of \nthis money. The money is there. The money is physically there. Every \ndollar, every cent, is on the table and ready to be sent to the U.N. to \npay the arrearages. The only thing that stops us is, I suspect, one or \ntwo internationalists, activists at the White House who have decided to \nmake a cause celebre for themselves over this really obscure piece of \nlanguage which, by the way, as I mentioned, was the law of the land in \nthe United States for the Reagan and the Bush administrations.\n  So the idea the Congress has in any way interfered with the ability \nto pay the arrearages is, again, pure hocum. This is a classic example \nof the situation where the individual shoots his parents and throws \nhimself before the court and asks for mercy because he is an orphan. \nThe White House has decided to shoot its parents--in this case the \nU.N.--and then claim it has no role in the event and is pure when, in \nfact, it is the reason we cannot pay the arrearages. That is just pure \nhocum.\n  We now know the two major reasons they vetoed this bill; the COPS \nreason has no substance to it, and the U.N. language is their problem, \nnot our problem. We put the money in. They are the ones who are holding \nthis up.\n  Then they listed a whole series of little different items, one of \nwhich I found most interesting. In the Senate we took up two different \nhate crime proposals to move this bill through so we could actually get \nit to conference. Then in conference it became absolutely clear there \nwas no way an issue such as hate crimes, as massive as it is, could be \nhandled in our conference. We had two competing ideas. So we put them \naside and sent them back to the authorizing committee. Ironically, the \namendments were offered by the chairman and ranking member of the \nauthorizing committee, so one would hope the authorizing committee \ncould straighten this issue out and we, as appropriators, would not \nhave to straighten it out.\n  What does the White House say? It says it wants the hate crimes \nlegislation on this bill. This is an appropriations bill. This is a \nbill that funds the FBI, DEA, and the INS. Those are real law \nenforcement issues. They are going to undermine the ability of the FBI \nto do its job, the ability of the INS to do its job, the ability of the \nDEA to do its job, so they can get hate crimes legislation? They are \ngoing to undermine the ability of U.S. attorneys to do their jobs, the \nability of U.S. marshals to do their jobs, the ability of the U.S. \ncourt system to do its job, so they can get hate crimes legislation? \nThey are going to undermine the FEC, FTC, and the FCC so they can get \ntheir hate crimes legislation?\n  How outrageous. What sort of priority is this from this White House?\n\n[[Page S13199]]\n\n What sort of priority puts language on hate crimes ahead of the FBI, \nDEA, INS, ahead of the U.S. attorneys, ahead of the U.S. marshals, the \nFCC, FEC, FTC--what type of priority is it when they know in order to \nget that language they have to go through an authorizing committee \nanyway? It is beyond belief they would put at risk the law enforcement \nagencies of this country in order to get hate crimes language, which in \nthe first place is a State issue.\n  I note the State of Wyoming--the Senator from Wyoming is on the \nfloor--is doing one heck of a job in pursuing that issue at the State \nlevel.\n  It is first a State issue. The irony of it is, he is undermining the \nentire law enforcement community of the United States because he wants \na new criminal act on the Federal books.\n  Is there a total disconnect at the White House? There appears to be. \nThe veto of this bill--and there are a lot of other miscellaneous \npoints--but the veto of this bill has nothing to do with the substance \nof this bill. It was done purely for political reasons so the President \ncould look as if he was in charge or he could look as if he was \nstanding up to the Congress.\n  The practical effect of vetoing this bill, however, is to undermine \nlaw enforcement across this country, to make it impossible for us to \npay our U.N. arrearages, and to make it extremely hard for these \nagencies, which are so critical to the functioning of our country, to \ncontinue to function in an effective way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and thank the Senator from Wyoming \nfor the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIdaho, the chairman of the majority policy committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I especially thank the Senator from Wyoming \nfor coming to the floor this morning to discuss with all of us some \nvery important issues and building a perspective that I do not think \nthe American people hear or have an opportunity to read or understand \nas it relates to the politics inside the beltway and what is good or \nnot so good for the American people.\n  We just heard the chairman of a key appropriations subcommittee who \nspent the last 6 months crafting an appropriations bill to run a major \nportion of our Government while the President was out traveling around \nthe world and traveling around this country not engaged and not focused \non the budget. When the appropriations bill to fund these key areas of \nGovernment finally arrived at his desk, the President vetoed it and \nsaid: I didn't get my way.\n  I am always frustrated by an executive branch of Government that does \nnot come to the Hill and sit down with us and work out our differences \nin the proper forum but chooses to set the stage of politics over the \nkey issues that are substantive when it comes to law enforcement and \nsafe streets and safe communities for our families and our country.\n  I have struggled with this President over the last several months, \nespecially when he decided to allow terrorists out of prison. That is \nexactly what happened. I do not know of any other way to say it. This \nPresident personally decided that he was going to offer clemency to \nconvicted terrorists. What were they convicted of? Violation of Federal \nfirearms laws. That is law enforcement. Those are Federal laws violated \nby people who killed others and violated Federal explosive and firearms \nlaws. And this President says he is for law enforcement by putting more \ncops on the street, then he totally demoralizes or destroys the very \nfoundation of law enforcement by saying: Arrest them and put them in \nprison and I will let them out because it is ``politically correct'' to \ndo so.\n\n  Shame on you, Mr. President; shame on you and your politics at this \nmoment because somehow you cannot have it both ways, at least I hope \nyou cannot, but you are trying. You are also trying to make the use of \na firearm a major political issue. Yet you offer clemency to those who \nviolate the very laws you ought to be enforcing. Shame on you, again, \nMr. President.\n  The Senate worked its will and did an excellent job with those \nappropriations bills. I do not deny the executive branch the right to \nparticipate. They have a legitimate role to play in the shaping of the \nbudget. But in the final analysis, it is the Constitution that says it \nis the right and the appropriate role of the Congress to appropriate \nmoneys, and it is the responsibility of the Executive to administer \nthose moneys within the policy and the framework established for the \nCongress of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased you are finally going to lay off Social \nSecurity. Remember what our President said 2 years ago? Save Social \nSecurity; don't spend a dime of the surplus. Then this year in his \nstate of the budget message he says: Well, gee, there is so much money \nthere, why don't we spend a little of it. We will save 60 percent and \nwe will spend the rest over the next 15 years and, oh, by the way, I \nalso want to raise taxes during a time of unprecedented surpluses in \nour country because I have so many great ideas that I want for people, \nand I want to spend all this money and I want to raise your taxes to do \nit and I also want to spend some of the Social Security money to do so.\n  Thank goodness the Congress, the Republican Congress, stood up and \nsaid: No, Mr. President. The House passed a provision to provide a \nlockbox so that Social Security surpluses would be dedicated to Social \nSecurity and would pay down the liabilities of Social Security and \nstrengthen the ability of that great system to support its obligations \nin the outyears.\n  We tried to pass it in the Senate, and guess who opposed it. The \nDemocrats. They filibustered it and would not allow a vote and \nconstantly said: We are all for Social Security. Why would they not \nguarantee that its moneys would be assured a lockbox provision? The \nAmerican people said they wanted it. The seniors of America, \nrecognizing the importance of Social Security to their very existence, \nsaid that is the right thing to do, but the President said: No, I want \nto spend about 30 percent or 40 percent of the Social Security surplus \nover the next 15 years.\n  Just in the last month, it is fair and important to say the President \nhas finally agreed that he will leave Social Security surpluses alone \nand, thank goodness, Mr. President, you have agreed with us because \nthat would have been a phenomenal fight because we were committed and \ndedicated, even though it was filibustered in the Senate by my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, we are going to protect the \nSocial Security surplus. Period. End of statement.\n  Let's talk about the rest of the budget we are battling. A couple of \nweeks ago, I was amazed to see the President kind of quietly come out \nand then not so quietly say: We need more money to spend besides the \nrecord surpluses we have.\n  I have served Congress and the people of Idaho longer than I want to \nadmit--19 years. I am amazed that only last year did I begin to see a \nslight surplus and this year a substantial surplus. Never at a time of \nsurplus have I ever heard of a President asking for a tax increase. But \nthis President did because of all these great new social ideas, that \nsomehow is going to help people by taking more money away from them and \nthen giving it back to them in politically correct ways.\n  I am not sure that ever helps the American family to take money away \nfrom them and then try in some form to decide what is the right way to \ngive it back. We said: No, Mr. President.\n  Finally, just this last week, after having tried for well over 6 \nmonths, the President is slowly backing away from the tax idea, \nalthough yesterday he came through the backdoor again and said: Well, \nlet's adjust some fees and let's see if we can come up with a little \nmore revenue. Shame on you, Mr. President. America's taxpayers are \nbeing taxed at an all-time rate--high rate. While you are saying it is \nonly a tobacco tax, a tax is a tax is a tax.\n  And, of course, while I do not smoke, and I wish that others would \nnot--there are many who do who should not--yet we are going to tax \nthem. Well, we are not going to tax them because I don't think this \nCongress will stand for it.\n  I have always understood the politics of surplus is more difficult \nthan the politics of deficit spending. When I\n\n[[Page S13200]]\n\nfirst came to Congress in 1980, we had deficits, and they grew very \nrapidly over fights on budget priorities. But it was not until 1994, \nwhen the American people said: Enough of deficits. I'm sorry; a \nDemocrat-controlled Congress is out of control, with a President who \nwants to spend more money, and we're going to change those dynamics, \nand they elected a more conservative Congress, a Republican Congress.\n  We said we were going to balance the budget by the year 2002 and we \nwould shape a process that would take us there. Thank goodness for a \nstrong economy and for a fiscally responsible Congress and a monetary \nsupply that stayed in sync. We are now at a balanced budget. We had it \nlast year. We now have a balanced budget and surpluses this year. And I \nsee more wrangling over budgets and spending priorities than I have \never seen in all my years here.\n  I understand the politics of surplus are difficult. But why shouldn't \nwe be giving back to the American people some of their hard-earned \nmoney? It is their money. But, no, we have had a President who has \ninsisted on constantly spending it. We put a marvelous tax package \ntogether this year, going right at middle America, to enhance the lives \nof our citizens, to improve the condition of America's families and \ncommunities, and this President vetoed it because he wants to prescribe \nhow the money gets spent because somehow we have a White House that \nsays: I know better. I know I can outthink the American family. I can \nshape a school system better than the American family and the American \ncommunity because somehow I abide by this unique knowledge of knowing \nhow to do it better.\n  I disagree with you, Mr. President. Thank goodness, we have a \nCongress that does. That does not mean we are not going to work out our \ndifferences. The President has a right to participate. But I do not \nthink he has a right to do one thing and say another, and do another \nthing and say something else. And that is what he has done with law \nenforcement. That is what he is doing in education. That is clearly \nwhat he has done on Social Security. That is what he is now trying to \ndo with the budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank my colleague from Wyoming for acquiring this time \nto speak on these key issues. It is very important the American people \nsee the difference. Politics should not be the business of hypocrisy. \nIt ought to be the business of fact. Saying one thing and doing another \nshould not stand. Yet we have had about 7 long years of it with this \nPresident.\n  Mr. President, I say no to those kinds of attitudes and reactions, \nand I think it is important that some of us speak out on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, it has been an interesting morning to listen to the \nSenator from North Dakota talk a little bit about the economy and about \nspending. There are interesting figures in terms of growth. I do not \nhappen to have one of the charts. I guess it is getting to be where you \nhave to have a chart to speak, but I hope not.\n  Let's go back to the second half of the 1970s, when we had a \nDemocrat-controlled Government. All spending grew 12.2 percent \nannually; nondefense discretionary spending grew 15 percent.\n  In the first half of the 1980s, all spending grew 10 percent, but \nnondefense discretionary spending was only 2.8 percent. Defense was \nwhere the money went--10 percent.\n  Then we scoot on down to currently. All spending grew in the second \nhalf of the 1990s, with this Republican-controlled Congress, 2.8 \npercent totally; nondefense discretionary spending was 1.4 percent.\n  If our goal over time is to control the size of Federal Government, \nif our goal is to be efficient, if our goal is to control spending, \nthen these are the numbers; these are the figures. Really, spending is \nthe key.\n  Of course, our friend on the other side of the aisle talked about \nhaving the largest tax increase in the history of the United States--\nwhich was true in 1993 with the Clinton tax increase. But what we \nreally ought to talk about is the size of Government.\n  There is a great deal of talk about going into Social Security. Let \nme read this short letter dated September 30 from the Congressional \nBudget Office.\n\n       Dear Mr. Speaker: You requested that we estimate the impact \n     of the fiscal 2000 Social Security surplus using CBO's \n     economic and technical assumptions, based on a plan whereby \n     net discretionary outlays for the year will be $592 billion.\n\n  That is the cap we put there.\n\n       CBO estimates this spending plan will not use any of the \n     projected Social Security surplus for the year 2000.\n\n  We keep talking about that differently. That is the way that is. So \none of the things that is interesting--I will not take long today, but \nwe have differences of view here. We have differences of view in the \ncountry. There is nothing wrong with that. That is what the political \nsystem is about: To bring together people who have different views \nabout attaining goals, even, indeed, different views about goals. So we \nought to have legitimate arguments. That is what this system is about.\n  But we ought not to spin it off into things that we are not really \nable to document. We ought not to spin it off into motives and \ndifferent kinds of political things. We ought to talk about the basic \ndifferences we have, and then decide whether we want more Federal \nGovernment or less; decide whether we want to spend more, send more of \nthe decisions back to the State and local governments as opposed to one \nsize fits all on the national level.\n  These are the real issues.\n  Mr. President, we ought to be talking about some of the positive \nthings we have done this year.\n  Surplus: 2 years in a row with no deficit, for the first time in 42 \nyears. Pretty good stuff. We even have a non-Social Security surplus \nthis year. We reduced Federal spending as a percentage of growth.\n\n  Unfortunately, we still have taxes as the highest percentage of gross \nnational product we have had since World War II. Those things are hard \nto reconcile. Growth now is a little over 2 percent, compared to 10 \npercent in the early 1980s.\n  So these are the kinds of things we have done. We passed tax relief \nhere. Unfortunately, the President chose to veto it.\n  Our budget goals, of course, for the rest of the year are: No \nGovernment shutdown; no new taxes; pay down the debt; protect Social \nSecurity. We are going to do those things. We are going to do it in the \nnext 10 days.\n  Social Security: We talked a lot over the last few years about ``save \nSocial Security first,'' but we have a plan to do that with individual \naccounts, taking the money off the table and letting it belong to the \npeople who have paid it in, to earn additional money by having it \ninvested in equities.\n  Those are the things we are prepared to do and have done.\n  Education: We have done a lot this year for education. We have \nincreased spending for education, more than the President asked for. We \nhave more flexibility in educational decisions so that parents and \nschool boards and States can make those decisions.\n  I can tell you what is needed in Greybull, WY, is quite different \nthan what is needed in Pittsburgh. And that is the way it ought to be. \nWe have done that. We have done a number of things.\n  National security: For the first time, more money is going to defense \nthan we have had before. We have had more deployments over the last few \nyears in foreign countries than ever, and yet this administration has \nreduced the dollars that go there. We have changed that.\n  Health care, the Patients' Bill of Rights: We passed it here. \nHopefully, we will get it passed.\n  A balanced budget on Medicare changes: We are working on that.\n  Rural provisions in Medicare: We will get that done.\n  Financial modernization is ready to come to the floor for the first \ntime since the 1930s.\n  We have a lot of things to talk about and be proud of in this \nsession. I am very pleased we have done it. Despite the partisan \nrhetoric and the tactics, we have had achievements in the budget, in \nSocial Security, in education, in\n\n[[Page S13201]]\n\ndefense, in tax relief, health care, and in finance and banking. I \nthink we ought to move forward and make the most of those advantages \nthat we have had.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Speaking about a bipartisan spirit, it was unnerving this \nmorning to come to the floor and hear some of the partisan attacks I \nheard, mostly aimed at President Bill Clinton, in particular at his \nbudget priorities, which Democrats share. At some point in the \ndiscussion this morning, it approached a near-hysterical level.\n  I will talk about what the differences are. I think we can breach \nthose differences and resolve our problems.\n\n  Putting 100,000 teachers in the classrooms to reduce class size, \neveryone in America wants us to do that, I believe. We have already put \n30,000 of those teachers in the classrooms, and we are simply asking to \ncontinue the program. This Republican budget would mean sending pink \nslips to those teachers. That is wrong. We ought to sit down and \nresolve it.\n  Secondly, in continuing our efforts to put more police on the \nstreets, we have seen a tremendous reduction in the crime rate. We know \none of the reasons is putting more community police on the streets. \nSurely we can find a compromise with the Republicans on this point.\n  Then, paying our U.N. dues. How can we lead the world if we don't at \nleast do that, while encouraging and demanding reforms at the United \nNations? I thought it was resolved. It has not been resolved. Funding \npeace agreements, that has not been resolved. We can't be the world \nleader if we don't do that.\n  I think these differences are important.\n  There are also environmental riders, giveaways to big special \ninterests. They are wrong. We should sit down and resolve them.\n  The one that really is extraordinary, with the partisanship that \nsurrounds it, is the Social Security issue. Republicans say they have a \nlockbox and the Democrats want to go into Social Security and destroy \nit. In some ways, it is rather laughable. Going back to 1994, House \nmajority leader Dick Armey said: I would never have created Social \nSecurity.\n  If we look back at the record, we will find the Republicans voted \nagainst a retirement benefit for the people of this country when Social \nSecurity was voted on. They voted against Medicare. Now they are going \nforward with TV commercials telling people they are the party that is \ngoing to protect a program they didn't even like and didn't even want. \nIt doesn't even pass the laugh test.\n  Here is the deal. They have a lockbox. They say: We are never going \nto touch it. That is good. However, they forgot to tell you something--\nthey have the key. They have opened it up, and they have taken $18 \nbillion out of it already, according to their own Congressional Budget \nOffice. That is not Barbara Boxer saying it. It is their own \nCongressional Budget Office that stated they have gone into Social \nSecurity for $18 billion.\n\n  So why don't we just sit down and talk--talk about the legislative \ngraveyard that has been created in the Senate. What is in there? HMO \nreform. People can't get the health care they need and deserve. That is \nin the garbage heap. Sensible gun laws, the juvenile justice bill, that \nis in the graveyard. They put the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in \nthere; campaign finance reform; judicial appointments; long-term \nprotection of Medicare and Social Security; minimum wage is in the \nlegislative graveyard. As Senator Mikulski said, these were lost \nopportunities to us. So I feel very strongly that we have more work to \ndo. We should sit down with the President and resolve these \ndifferences.\n  Lastly, I hope we can move forward on some of these judgeships. Judge \nRichard Paez and Marsha Berzon were nominated years ago, voted out of \nthe committee on a bipartisan vote. Judge Paez has been waiting almost \n4 years to get a vote. Marsha Berzon has been waiting almost 2 years. \nLater, when I get to talk about these nominees in detail, I will tell \nyou the strong Republican support they have--Republican Congress \npeople, Republican sheriffs, and Republican law enforcement officials \nin the State of California. These are good nominees.\n  I have put a hold on a particular nominee the majority leader wants \nfor the TVA. I have no problem with that nominee. I voted him out of \ncommittee. He has been waiting 27 days for a vote, Marsha Berzon has \nbeen waiting 2 years, and Richard Paez has been waiting almost 4 years.\n  I see the majority leader on the floor, and I promised that when he \narrived I would stop this talking in morning business. So I will do \nthat. I urge everyone to come to the table in a bipartisan spirit, do \nthe unfinished business, resolve the budget differences, and get moving \nwith some of these appointments that have been waiting for years, \nsimply for an up-or-down vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. ROTH. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard. The clerk will \ncontinue to call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk continued to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S13202]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CHAFEE\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nhonoring a distinguished public servant and a revered Member of the \nUnited States Senate, Senator John Chafee, who died Sunday evening at \nBethesda Naval Hospital.\n  While John Chafee was elected to the Senate in 1976, his public \nservice began years before when he interrupted his education at Yale \nUniversity to enlist in the Marine Corps during World War II, serving \nin the original invasion forces at Guadalcanal. He later returned to \ncomplete his education, receiving a bachelors degree from Yale in 1947 \nand, in 1950, a law degree from Harvard.\n  In 1951, John Chafee was called again to serve his country, returning \nto active duty to command a rifle company in Korea. Later, John Chafee \nserved six years in the Rhode Island House of Representatives, where he \nwas elected Minority Leader. He served as Governor of Rhode Island for \nthree terms and in 1969 was appointed Secretary of the Navy.\n  As a Senator, John Chafee continued his proud legacy of leadership \nand accomplishment. I worked with Senator Chafee perhaps most closely \nin the U.S. Senate in his capacity as Chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee where he labored tirelessly on behalf of many \ncritical environmental initiatives, including efforts to strengthen the \nClean Air Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n  Senator Chafee has been recognized for his important contributions in \nthe area of environmental protection throughout his service in the U.S. \nSenate and has received nearly every major environmental award. He was \nalso a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee where he worked \nhard to expand health care coverage for women and children and to \nimprove community services for persons with disabilities.\n  John Chafee was a well-respected member of this body who engendered \nthe affection of every member with whom he served. He had a unique \nability to achieve consensus under very difficult circumstances. His \nunfailing courtesy and civility provided a positive and unifying force \nin the Congress which will be sorely missed by his colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  The Senate was a better place because of John Chafee and his devoted \npublic service. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to \nhim and to extend my deepest and heartfelt sympathies to his family.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I join my colleagues today in mourning the \nloss of our colleague, John Chafee. John was a good and honorable man \nwho served his state and his country with distinction. A devoted public \nservant and member of this body for 23 years, Senator Chafee's \ninfluence extended beyond the aisles and transcended partisan rhetoric. \nHis accomplishments as a lawmaker and his unquestionable influence \namong his peers stand as a testament to his ability.\n  Senator Chafee will long be admired and remembered for his devotion \nto this country both as a soldier and public servant. His distinguished \nservice in the military, including serving in the Marines at \nGuadalcanal and commanding a rifle company in Korea, were indicative of \nthe man who would never shy away from duty or responsibility.\n  His record as a legislator, governor, and senator in Rhode Island \nindicate the amount of trust the people of Rhode Island put in John.\n  Although political views may vary from person to person, it is easy \nto put these differences aside and to recognize men of strong character \nand integrity. These are qualities which were abundant in John, and his \nsteadying influence in the United States Senate will be truly missed.\n  My thoughts and prayers extend to his family and all those whose \nlives Senator Chafee touched.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in paying tribute to \nthe memory of our friend and colleague, Senator John Chafee.\n  Senator Chafee was the living embodiment of Senate decorum. He always \nhonored this body through his thoughts, deeds and actions. His ideas \nand messages were delivered thoughtfully and respectfully. He truly \nfollowed his heart and soul while representing the people of Rhode \nIsland and this great nation.\n  His honorable service in both World War II and the Korean Conflict, \nas well as his distinguished tenure as Secretary of the Navy, reflect \nhis profound respect for America's armed forces and his deep love of \ncountry.\n  I am especially appreciative for all he did to advance causes near \nand dear to the state of Florida. He took time to visit the Florida \nEverglades, and his work on this important issue will ensure the \npreservation of this unique natural system, and will always be a part \nof his lasting legacy.\n  Senator Chafee devoted his life to public service. He will be \nremembered as a thoughtful and patriotic American who cared \npassionately about those he served, the issues he fought for, and the \ninstitution of the United States Senate. He was not only a fellow \nRepublican, but a colleague who was respected on both sides of the \naisle. He will be sorely missed in the U.S. Senate.\n  My heartfelt sympathies go to his wife Ginny, to their five children \nand 12 grandchildren, and to his staff here in Washington and \nthroughout Rhode Island.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I extend my sympathies to the \nfamily of John Chafee.\n  It has been my privilege to serve with John Chafee for but 3 of the \nyears of his long and distinguished career in the Senate. But I will \nmiss him. I do miss him.\n  I want to say publicly how much I appreciate the many times he came \nup to me and told me how much he appreciated me and how glad he was \nthat I was here.\n  I thank him publicly for the many times he came to me and talked \nabout environmental issues and told me he had a good environmental bill \nthat he wanted me to be on. Many times, I was on them with him.\n  I appreciated his looking out for me in that regard, and in so many \nother ways. It was a great pleasure and a high privilege to serve with \nhim in the Senate.\n  I wish his wife and his family my very best and pray God's comfort be \nwith them in this time of their bereavement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/27/senate-section/article/S13202-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 434, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 434) to authorize a new trade and investment \n     policy for sub-Sahara Africa.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that during the \nSenate's consideration of the trade bill, all first-degree amendments \nmust be relevant to the trade bill or the filed amendment No. 2325, and \nany second-degree amendment be relevant to the first-degree it proposes \nto amend.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I object.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I object.\n  Mr. LOTT. I truly regret the objection to a reasonable consideration \nof this very important pending trade bill. This is obviously a vital \npiece of trade legislation. As I indicated last week on the floor, this \nis something in which the President has been very interested. He \ndiscussed it with me personally last week on, I think, Tuesday and \ntwice since we have discussed it in telephone conversations. I am not \ndoing it just because the President asked for it. I am doing it because \nI think it is the right thing to do.\n  I think it would be good for our country, help to create jobs. This \nis very carefully crafted legislation that the chairman of the \ncommittee and ranking member have worked on. I think it would be just \nvitally important to our friends in Central America and the Caribbean, \nas well as a major step symbolically and other ways to have African \nfree trade.\n  I want to get this bill done. There are legitimate objections to it. \nThe Senator from South Carolina is going to\n\n[[Page S13203]]\n\nuse every rule in the book that he has access to, and there are lots of \nthem. He has staff members who will make sure he knows them all. I \nunderstand that. But I am sure everybody can understand I have to take \nadvantage of the rules available to me also because I do not want this \nto become a debate about farm policy, sanctions policy--one Senator \njust suggested we should offer fast track on this bill. I agree; I \nthink fast track should be done. That is another very important trade \npolicy. But it will completely bog down this bill.\n  I think we need to be serious about this bill. I plan now to fill up \nthe tree and file cloture. The cloture vote will be Friday. We will see \nif the Senate wants this trade bill or not. If we do not get cloture, \nthen it is clear what is going on and we will just have to move on to \nsomething else.\n  My consent would simply keep the Senate on the subject of the African \ntrade and trade benefits for the Caribbean Basin countries. Obviously, \nwith objection from the Democrats, they do not want this subject matter \nto be the pending issue. I think it is unfortunate, but I understand.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2325\n\n              (Purpose: To provide a substitute amendment)\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Roth and others, I call \nup amendment No. 2325 and ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment and begin \nreading the text.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott], for Mr. Roth, for \n     himself, and Mr. Moynihan, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2325.\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I think it is unfortunate we have to take \nthis step. I have discussed it with the Democratic leader. Let me \nemphasize he did not agree with this at all, but we did discuss our \nsituation and our mutual concerns and our mutual desires to try to find \na way to move this trade legislation forward. Filling up the tree is \nnot a new practice. It is one I haven't used, I don't think, this \nyear--maybe once. It is a practice that has been used in the past by \nmajority leaders when it is necessary to try to get to a conclusion.\n  I do not know exactly when our adjournment for the year will come, \nbut it is obvious we do not have a lot of time left. We do have some \nother issues we would like to have a chance to consider. Again, that is \non both sides of the aisle.\n  The cloture motion vote will occur on Friday, October 29. I will \nnotify all Members of the exact time, after consultation with the \nDemocratic leader.\n  In the meantime, I ask consent the mandatory quorum under rule XXII \nbe waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I say to the Senate, I would be willing to withdraw the \nlast amendment pending. I will be glad to come back in an hour and \nwithdraw that, allowing Members' amendments to be offered if they were \nrelevant to the trade bill, and this would allow us to make some \nprogress on the bill. I would offer that idea to the minority leader \nwhen he returns, and I am glad to yield to the Senator from Minnesota\n\n[[Page S13204]]\n\nif he would like to ask any questions or make a comment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I heard the majority leader mention he did not want to \nsee amendments that he did not think were directly related, such as \nagriculture. As the majority leader knows, for the last 5 weeks I have \nasked him when I would have the opportunity. The majority leader said \nhe thinks this is the first time he has filled up the tree, or second \ntime. I think there may be other times, but I would have to check. I do \nnot remember an opportunity in the last 4 or 5 weeks, or longer than \nthat, to have an amendment out here that I think will speak to the pain \nof farmers.\n  When might I have an opportunity to introduce this amendment that I \nthink would make a difference for family farmers in Minnesota who are \nbeing driven off the land? If the majority leader is filling up the \ntree and therefore I cannot do this, can he tell me when I might have \nan opportunity? Will he make a commitment there will be a piece of \nlegislation out here that I can amend?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am not sure when that might occur. I told the Democratic \nleader just a few minutes ago, if it were just an amendment by Senator \nWellstone on agriculture, I would be prepared to have that discussion, \nthat debate, and a vote. But that is not the end of the string. We have \na lot of innovative thinkers here on both sides of the aisle who are \nnow working feverishly with their very competent staffs to develop \nother amendments.\n\n  If it were just an amendment by the Senator from Minnesota, I think \nprobably that could be done. I think if we would open the door, there \nwould be no end to it.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the majority leader be willing to entertain a \nfreestanding bill I might introduce and have debate on? We have to do \nsomething, I say to the majority leader, about what is going on in farm \ncountry.\n  Mr. LOTT. First of all, I will be willing to discuss that with the \nSenator. I would have to also discuss it with the chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee and its members. I could not just unilaterally \nreach an agreement. But, again, I personally would not have a problem \nwith that.\n  I do not know what his amendment would be, but I am sure I would vote \nagainst it. But we could have a discussion. I would need to check with \nboth sides and I will talk with the Senator to see if it is possible, \nto see if we can do that in some freestanding way.\n  Having said that, I want to be sure the record has been made at this \npoint. Last Friday, the President of the United States signed the \nAgriculture appropriations bill--I believe last Friday. It provides \nfunds for agricultural needs all across this great land, in my State \nand that of the Senators from Minnesota and New York. We have lots of \nagriculture in New York. I don't know if you are aware of that, but I \nhave been very impressed when I have been up there, some of the areas \noutside of Long Island. I found there is a lot of agriculture up there \nand all across this country.\n  We did get the Agriculture bill. In that bill was a very significant \namount of funds for disaster-related problems. Some of them have been \ncaused because of the depressed prices, some because of drought, some \nbecause of floods--all the different problems we have. Others say it \nwas not enough; it should have been more. Some others would say it was \nnot targeted in the right way. We can debate that endlessly, I believe.\n  But the President, upon review--and I believe he took the full 10 \ndays--decided the right thing to do was go ahead and get this bill \nsigned and get that disaster money to the farmers, the men and women \nwho live on the farms in this country, as quickly as possible. It is \nnot as if this is an issue we have not addressed and we will not \naddress next year.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I appreciate the leader's graciousness. I will not \ntake up any more time with questions to him.\n  Having just heard the majority leader's report about disaster relief, \nhe may want to reconsider his view about whether or not he would vote \nfor or against an amendment or piece of legislation I would introduce \nbecause I say to the majority leader in the form of a question: I am \nquite sure that, as the majority leader travels around the country in \nrural America, he understands that the financial assistance package did \nnot deal with the price crisis. People are going to be driven off the \nland and we have to change the policy.\n  I appreciate what he said. I guess it is less a form of a question, \nbut perhaps I will get his support because I am sure the majority \nleader wants to see the Senate take some action that will make a \npositive difference for family farmers.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me say in answer to the Senator's comments, I have \nlearned from past experience that you should never say exactly what you \nare going to do until you have seen the details of an amendment or a \nbill because it could be different or it could be something that, in \nthe end, you find would be acceptable. I have a suspicion I might not \nuse that approach, but I had to reserve final judgment until I saw its \ncontent. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the managers' amendment \nto H.R. 434. That substitute includes the Senate Finance Committee-\nreported bills on Africa, an expansion of the Caribbean Basin \nInitiative, an extension of the Generalized System of Preferences, and \nthe reauthorization of our trade adjustment assistance programs.\n  It is critically important that we move this legislation. Let me say \na few words, in particular, about the Africa trade portion of the bill.\n  The last decade has been a period of great change in Africa. Some of \nthese changes have been quite heartening to those of us who have been \nwatching the countries in that continent for many years. The failed \neconomic policies of socialism and central planning have begun to give \nway to market reforms, bringing economic growth and an improvement of \nliving standards with it. There have been positive changes on the \npolitical front as well. The tragedy of apartheid has, thankfully, come \nto an end in South Africa. At the same time, democracy has begun to \nflower in South Africa and in a number of other sub-Saharan countries.\n  The picture, however, is not all positive. As we know all too well, \nthe countries in Africa continue to suffer through more than their \nshare of difficulties. War, disease and hunger are still very \nsignificant parts of the story of that region. Africa is a continent \nthat is on the brink of a new and more positive future, but still has a \nnumber of significant hurdles that it must overcome.\n  For the Senate, the question is what we can do--what this great \ncountry can do--to help the African nations obtain the peace and \nprosperity that they have been working so hard to achieve. In other \nwords, what can we do to help them complete the work that they have \nalready begun.\n  The manager's amendment is clearly not a panacea; the challenges that \nthe Africans face are too great for any single piece of legislation or \nany single act to cure. This legislation is, however, an important \nstart towards building an economic partnership between the United \nStates and the countries of sub-Saharan Africa. This partnership, in my \nview, is a significant first step towards giving the African nations \nthe opportunities they need to continue the progress that many of them \nhave made over the past decade.\n  I am proud of the support that this legislation has received among \nthe African-American community and among the Africans themselves. I say \nthis because a few of my colleagues have suggested that the African-\nAmerican community and the African nations themselves are divided in \ntheir support for the African Growth and Opportunity Act. I am standing \nhere to say that nothing could be further from the truth. If there was \nany doubt, it should have been put to rest with the Roll Call ad which \nran last week. The ad, appropriately, stated the following:\n\n       To the United States Senate, Setting the Record Straight. \n     We endorse legislation that provides social and economic \n     opportunity in Africa and we, the undersigned, are working \n     together to achieve this goal. Can we count on you?\n\n[[Page S13205]]\n\n  The signatories to this Roll Call ad are a very distinguished \ncollection of religious, civic, political and business organizations \nand individual leaders. I will name just a few: the NAACP, the Southern \nChristian Leadership Conference, the African Methodist Episcopal \nChurch, the National Council of Churches, AfriCare, the Council of \nNational Black Churches, which represents 65,000 churches and \n20,000,000 members, and the U.S. Conference of Mayors.\n  The list of individuals signing this ad includes such notables as \nBishops Donald Ming and Garnett Henning of the African Methodist \nEpiscopal Church, Mrs. Coretta Scott King, Mr. Martin Luther King III, \nAmbassador Andrew Young, former mayor David Dinkins, the Honorable \nKweisi Mfume, and Mr. Robert Johnson, the head of Black Entertainment \nTelevision. I want to note that Mr. Johnson testified eloquently about \nthe need to create new economic opportunities in Africa when he \nappeared before the Finance Committee last year. He, like the others \nlisted in this ad, have spoken powerfully on the pressing importance of \nthis legislation.\n  Let me read a quote in the ad from just one of these individuals. \nThat individual is the very distinguished Rev. Leon Sullivan of the \nnearby city of Philadelphia. Rev. Sullivan is quoted in the ad as \nsaying that:\n\n       The African Growth and Opportunity Act will open new \n     markets for American products and will create additional jobs \n     for Americans and Africans. For every $1 billion in exports \n     to Africa, 14,000 jobs are created or sustained in the United \n     States. Those are powerful and important words.\n\n  Let us not forget that this legislation is also good for Africa. That \nis why every single one of the 47 African nations covered under this \nthe legislation have publicly stated their support. Let me repeat that, \nbecause it is important. Every single one of the countries covered \nunder this legislation supports this legislation. I think it is fair to \nsay that these countries have the judgment to decide what is in their \ninterest. In this instance, they have spoken loudly and clearly. The \nAfrican Growth and Opportunity Act is good for Africa.\n  I am proud to say that President Clinton is also a strong supporter \nof this legislation. He recently said, and it is quoted in the Roll \nCall ad, that:\n\n       Our administration strongly supports the African Growth and \n     Opportunity Act which I said in my State of the Union Address \n     we will work to pass in this session of Congress.\n\n  That, Mr. President, is exactly why we are here. We are here to work \non a bipartisan basis to work for passage of an important piece of \nlegislation that is good for the American people and good for Africa.\n  I was honored to have representatives of many of the groups and \nindividuals I mentioned join me in a press conference this past week to \nexpress their support for this legislation. What these individuals and \ngroups understand--and stated at the press conference--is that Africa \nhas for too long been neglected in our trade policy. They also \nunderstand that the African Growth and Opportunity Act is the right \nlegislation to begin the strengthening of our economic relationship \nwith that continent.\n  Let me emphasize that these individuals and groups support the \nAfrican Growth and Opportunity Act and not the HOPE bill. They support \nthis bill because it is good legislation. It is the right thing to do. \nIt is good for the American people, and it is good for the people of \nAfrica.\n  There is, of course, much more that is part of the manager's \namendment. The enhancement of the CBI program is long overdue. It is \nalso a vital step to strengthening the economic compact begun with that \nregion by President Reagan with the original CBI initiative. The \nreauthorizations of the Generalized System of Preferences and Trade \nAdjustment Assistance programs are also of critical importance. These \nmeasures are essential for ensuring that the benefits of the global \neconomy are felt as broadly as possible and to ensure that workers and \nfirms displaced by trade receive the assistance and training that they \nneed.\n  The effort to move the bill enjoys broad bipartisan support. But, it \nis long overdue. The House of Representatives passed the Africa \nlegislation by an overwhelming vote of 234-163 in July of this year. It \nis now time for the Senate to Act.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. \n434, as amended. The time to act is now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate our revered \nchairman for his achievement in a partisan setting. I think it is \ngenerally agreed that this Congress has not been one governed from the \ncenter. Here we have major legislation brought to the floor by near \nunanimous vote of the Committee on Finance and with extraordinary \nsupport across the country.\n  I wish to make two points, the first to the question of Trade \nAdjustment Assistance. It goes back 37 years as an integral measure in \nour trade policy. As Dean Acheson might say, I was present at the \ncreation. I was an Assistant Secretary of Labor, one of three delegates \nwho negotiated the Long-Term Cotton Textile Agreement which was \nnecessary to win the votes in the Senate for authorizing what became \nthe Kennedy Round. When we came back with that agreement, the issue \narose, if we were to open up trade, there would inevitably be persons \ndisplaced--just as jobs were created, jobs would be lost. There is \nnothing complex in the calculation nor very complex in identifying just \nwhom you are talking about.\n  We started Trade Adjustment Assistance. It has worked. We included a \ncomparable provision in the NAFTA implementing legislation. In Fiscal \nYear 1998, we had 150,000 workers eligible to receive Trade Adjustment \nAssistance; last year, we had 200,000 eligible workers. Those are \nrounded numbers.\n  This is an active program. There are families who are displaced in \nthe world economy, and they are living off this transitional benefit--\n200,000 eligible workers. That is not a small number. The authorization \nfor this program, that has been integral to our trade policy for 37 \nyears, expired on June 30. The appropriation expires on Friday; on \nSaturday, it is no more. And when it can come back, how it comes back--\nhave we seen many things started of late in this Congress or the \nprevious ones? No.\n  Now, those are lives of American workers we are talking about, just \nas President Kennedy talked about them. John Pastore of Rhode Island \nwas very vigorous on this matter, and many Members of the Senate who \nare marked in history by their capacity to see the large national \ninterest.\n  One other matter: The chairman noted the meeting which the Committee \non Finance had with the group of presidents, vice presidents, and \nforeign ministers from Central America, ranging from Trinidad and \nTobago all the way up to Honduras. It took place just off the Senate \nfloor in the LBJ Room. It was a special occasion.\n  They came here as representatives of elected governments asking to \ntrade. They weren't asking for foreign aid. They weren't asking for \nmilitary assistance. They were simply asking to become part of the \ntrading system of the western hemisphere in that Monroe Doctrine \ncontext about which the chairman spoke.\n  It already seems to have happened long ago. In the 1980s, we spent $8 \nbillion sending arms to Central America, with precious little to show \nfor it. A good enough outcome in the end, but the weaponry was \neverywhere, on all sides--a fantastic miscalculation, in my view, in my \nview at the time.\n  I will give my colleagues a moment's recollection. It was 1983. I was \nin El Salvador in the capital of San Salvador having breakfast with the \npresident and provost of the University of Central America, a Jesuit \ninstitution. At that time, the United States was going through enormous \nefforts to prevent the Sandinistas in Nicaragua from smuggling arms to \ntheir rebel counterparts in El Salvador.\n  I asked the President and the provost, with whom I had a relationship \nthrough a professor at the University of Chicago, ``Father, are the \nSandinistas sending weapons to El Salvador?'' He said, ``No.'' I said, \n``No? Well, surely they had been.'' He said, ``Yes.'' I asked, ``And \nthey don't any longer?'' He said, ``No. You do.''\n  Every day, the skies over Salvador were filled with American planes \nbringing in weaponry, which was promptly divided--half for the \ngovernment, a quarter for the rebels, and a quarter for\n\n[[Page S13206]]\n\nthe international arms market. And what a better thing now to be \ntalking about trade. And we have stability. If we want to ensure it, \nthere has to be an economic basis. This legislation does so and, again, \nand finally, there are 200,000 American families entitled to trade \nadjustment assistance, which expires on Friday after a 37-year run as \npart of the American safety net as a condition of expanding trade. \nLet's not let them down. We can do this if only we will do it together, \nas we did in the Finance Committee. I only hope the same can be \nrepeated on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I see my friend from South Carolina \nwho is seeking recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNew York. I have been trying to get the floor. I tried earlier today to \nbe recognized to speak on this bill. It was the objection I had made, \nof course, to the motion to proceed, due to the strong feelings I had \nwith respect to trade. Incidentally, on yesterday, I could not be \npresent. Amongst others, the distinguished Senator from Minnesota more \nor less carried the day. I am obligated to him. Senator Wellstone did \nan outstanding job. He asked that, if I could ever get the floor --and \nI tried twice this morning and could not get the floor--to please ask \nunanimous consent that he be recognized when I had completed my \nremarks. I have talked to fellow Senators and there is objection to \nthat. I wanted to let him know that I remembered the promise made. I am \nnot making the request because I know it will be objected to.\n  That brings us right to the unsenatorial, more or less, procedures \ninto which we have bogged down by. In a line, the distinguished \nmajority leader says what we ought to have had was fast track and, \nwithin a breath, he gives us fast track. We have fast track on this \nbill. You cannot put up an amendment. He ``filled up the tree,'' and he \nsays, ``oh, but I am so considerate that I will be glad to help you out \nif I can give you permission to give you relevant amendments.'' Of \ncourse, he decides what is relevant.\n  What about relevance with respect to the Finance Committee? What they \nare calling a trade bill is actually a foreign aid bill, because you \nhave the Secretary of State calling around on the bill, not the \nSecretary of Labor for jobs--I don't think she had the gall to do it. \nBut the Secretary of State, with pride, is calling the various Senators \nbecause this is a foreign aid bill. It is a one-way street. It is \nunilateral. It does not have the labor side agreements. It does not \nhave the environmental side agreements that were included in NAFTA. It \ndoes not include the reciprocity that we got from the Mexicans when we \npassed NAFTA. I have prepared amendments that would be relevant, but \nyou can't tell around here. I don't think that I should have to stand \nas a Senator and beg another Senator permission to put up an amendment. \nThat is the most arrogance I have ever seen since I have been here, \nsome 33 years. It has gotten really raw in this particular body, when \nyou try to debate the most important subject that you can possibly \nimagine, which is hollowing out not only our industrial strength, but \nthe middle class of our society and the strength of our democracy, and \nyou have to beg to put up an amendment in order to satisfy what the \nmajority leader says what is relevant.\n  Could it be the minimum wage amendment that the Senator from \nMassachusetts has been trying to get up since the beginning of the \nyear? Well, it is not for Africa, not for the Caribbean Basin \nInitiative, but more for the workers of America. I say why not? Don't \nwe have trade adjustment assistance in the bill? If that is relevant so \nis minimum wage. Doesn't minimum wage have relevance to the welfare, \nthe pay, the being of American workers?\n  The question in my mind is what rules are we under? I presided for 6 \nyears under Heinz's precedent. I presided for 4 years under Jefferson's \nrule. When I got to the Senate, we threw away the rule book because it \nis whatever the majority leader says. That is the rule. That is what \nhappens up here--we all understand that--in order to facilitate \nlegislation. But when it gets to this point of arrogance it is totally \ncounterproductive. Here you have been trying to get up the bill all \nyear long, and then you put it up in the last few days and say we are \nall trying to get out of town, let's not have any debate, let's take it \nor leave it as the Finance Committee has it, and thereupon, let's have \ncloture, let's have fast track.\n  Well, with respect to the minimum wage amendment, I would gladly put \nit up. I understood today--and the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts can speak for himself--but I talked to him the day before \nyesterday and advised him that if he didn't, I would, because I think \nit is just as important as trade adjustment assistance.\n  I see that the distinguished Senator from Texas is on the floor. I \nunderstood he said this would create 400,000 jobs. That's very peculiar \nbecause I understood the distinguished Senator from New York indicating \nthat we are going to have to put 200,000 on trade adjustment \nassistance--in other words, we are going to put them out of a job, we \nare going to give them welfare. What a wonderful thing it is; we \nstarted it some 37 years ago. Has this body got any idea what is going \non? Are we really creating jobs, or are we decimating the jobs? One \nbrags that we put them on; the other brags that we put them out. And \nthere we are, with respect to relevant amendments.\n  Mr. President, there is another relevant amendment. This is the Time \nmagazine for this week. It is an article called, ``The Fruit of Its \nLabor.'' I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record in \nits entirety.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From Time Magazine, October 1999]\n\n                         The Fruit of Its Labor\n\n                           (By Adam Zagorin)\n\n       Washington.--If you are an underwear mogul, you surely \n     cannot lack confidence. So it is with Bill Farley. The \n     handsome physical-fitness buff has under his belt brands like \n     BVD, Munsingwear and his flagship, Fruit of the Loom. He rubs \n     shoulders with the rich and powerful, and recently co-chaired \n     a lunch that raised more than $500,000 for George W. Bush. \n     Muscles rippling, Farley, 57, has also shown up wearing a \n     tank top in Fruit of the Loom advertising. He once even put \n     himself forward as a candidate for President of the United \n     States.\n       These days, however, Farley's political focus is squarely \n     on Congress, where Fruit's adventures in lobbying offer a \n     choice example of how the game is played. Fruit of the Loom \n     is a tattered company, suffering from bad performance and \n     poor management and lobbying heavily for a bill that would \n     ripen its bottom line.\n       How likely is it that the company's case will be heard on \n     the Hill? Well, last year alone Fruit handed out more than \n     $435,000 in soft-money donations, a figure that puts \n     contributions by the firm (1998 sales: $2.2 billion) ahead of \n     those of such giants as Coca-Cola, Exxon and Bank of America. \n     Most of Fruit's plums go to Republicans, including $265,000 \n     to the National Republican Senatorial Committee, run by \n     Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell, the principal opponent of \n     campaign finance reform.\n       This week, with Congress having for now killed campaign \n     finance reform, McConnell and other Republicans will get on \n     with other business, such as an amendment to an African trade \n     bill that would allow apparel produced in the Caribbean Basin \n     to enter the U.S. duty free, provided it is assembled from \n     U.S. fabric.\n       Fruit's lobbyists--along with those from competitors like \n     the Sara Lee Corp., which makes Hanes underwear, and \n     retailers like the Limited and the Gap--are pushing hard for \n     passage. Fruit officials claim the measure, which Bill \n     Clinton supports, will create jobs, and deny that the \n     company's donations can buy influence. Says Ron Sorini, a \n     Fruit lobbyist: ``There's absolutely no correlation between \n     our soft-money donations and those who decide to vote in \n     favor of this bill.''\n       Whether there is or not, Farley's much coveted tariff break \n     comes at a cost. Eliminating duties on apparel from the \n     Caribbean will run U.S. taxpayers at least $1 billion in \n     lost revenue over five years--a figure that, by \n     congressional rules, must be made up with cuts in other \n     programs.\n       Fruit confirms that the bill is expected to deliver a quick \n     $25 million to $50 million to the bottom line, adding to \n     savings achieved after moving some 17,000 of its U.S.-based \n     jobs, mostly to the low-wage Caribbean Basin, and \n     reincorporating in the tax haven Cayman Islands. The jobs \n     cuts were spread across the South, especially Kentucky, where \n     earlier in this decade Fruit was one of the largest \n     employers. ``They are trying to win in Washington what \n     they've been unable to achieve in the marketplace,'' says \n     Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public \n     Integrity, a watchdog group. ``They're now trying to secure \n     advantages from Congress at a time when they're in dire \n     financial straits.''\n\n[[Page S13207]]\n\n       Dire is right. After a major inventory snafu, Fruit's \n     financial elastic stretched again last month, when it had to \n     make a $45 million interest payment on accumulated debt of \n     $1.3 billion. Its stock, traded at $48 a few years ago, now \n     sells for less than $4. The board, its confidence in Farley \n     shaken, managed to shunt him into the role of nonexecutive \n     chairman in August, and the company is searching for a new \n     CEO. Farley retains a role in large measure because he still \n     controls 28.5% of Fruit's voting shares. He has also arranged \n     for the company to guarantee loans to himself worth $65 \n     million.\n       Fruit of the Loom's favorite trade bill has led to a rare \n     split between Kentucky's two conservative Republican \n     Senators. While McConnell is expected to support the tariff \n     cut, his colleague Jim Bunning has no intention of backing \n     the measure. Asks Bunning: ``How many more jobs do we have to \n     lose until we wake up and smell the Caribbean coffee?''\n       Yet for Bill Farley, the aroma is nothing if not enticing. \n     By one count, he's tried to get versions of the bill through \n     Congress six times in recent years. Perhaps seven's the \n     charm.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I don't know whether the distinguished \nmajority leader would agree that this is a special interest bill, but \nthe public domain thinks it is a special interest bill. The leading \nnews magazine in the world thinks it is a special interest bill. \nTherefore, campaign finance reform would be relevant.\n  Why do I say that?\n  ``The Fruit of Its Labor.''\n  It is on page 50.\n  ``How a company that exports jobs pushes for a Capitol Hill \nhandout.''\n  ``The politics of underwear.''\n  I quote:\n\n       If you are an underwear mogul, you surely cannot lack \n     confidence. So it is with Bill Farley. The handsome physical-\n     fitness buff has under his belt brands like BVD, Munsingwear \n     and his flagship, Fruit of the Loom. He rubs shoulders with \n     the rich and powerful, and recently co-chaired a lunch that \n     raised more than $500,000 for George W. Bush. Muscles \n     rippling, Farley, 57, has also shown up wearing a tank top in \n     Fruit of the Loom advertising. He once even put himself \n     forward as a candidate for President of the United States.\n\n  Maybe that is where Trump got the idea. I always wondered where that \nrascal could think he could be President.\n  But, in any event, reading on:\n\n       These days, however, Farley's political focus is squarely \n     on Congress, where Fruit's adventures in lobbying offer a \n     choice example of how the game is played.

Perhaps seven's the \n     charm.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask the same question as the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kentucky, Mr. Bunning. How many more jobs do we have to lose until \nwe wake up and smell the Caribbean coffee? Is there any question in \nanybody's mind? As we used to say in the law, any reasonable and \nprudent man--and now woman--can see that this is not a special interest \nbill. And with campaign finance reform, which is mentioned in this \narticle and which is mentioned in this particular bill, it would be \nrelevant--not under the majority leader's rule of relevancy.\n  Ask the majority leader when he comes to the floor. I can offer the \ncampaign finance reform, or I can offer the minimum wage. Then we will \nall agree to move right along and vote on the amendment. I will agree \nto a time agreement. We are not holding anybody up. We can vote both of \nthose amendments this afternoon. We don't have to worry about cloture \non Friday. We are ready to roll. We, like the majority leader, want to \nget out of town. We have a lot of work to do. Don't put on this act \nabout how reasonable and thoughtful and so pressured we are in trying \nto reconcile all of the particular problems there are in the closing \ndays. Don't give me any of that. Let's get to the reality.\n\n  We have a special interest bill; we have a bill affecting workers. I \nwant to put up another bill affecting the workers that have been up all \nyear long and all last year--minimum wage. The majority leader won't \ncome out and say it is relevant. When he comes out and says it is \nrelevant, I will put up the amendment; we can vote in 10 minutes' time. \nWhen he says a special interest bill, Shays-Meehan is relevant; we can \nvote in 10 minutes. The House has voted on it overwhelmingly.\n  We couldn't get a vote on account of the so-called rules of the \nmajority leader with respect to when we can call something and when we \ncan't call anything around here. They won't give us a freestanding \nShays-Meehan without the cloture and everything else.\n  I have been interested in campaign finance reform since I voted for \nthe Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974. We had that bill up, and we \nhad a good bipartisan cross-section vote for the measure saying one \ncannot buy the office. We have come full circle. What we are saying in \nWashington today is, the trouble is, there isn't enough money to buy \nthe office. Do you know what? We have amendments. Mr. President, $1,000 \nisn't enough; we ought to be able to buy it quicker with $3,000 and \n$5,000, $10,000. We have moved in the opposite direction from the \noriginal intent of cleaning up politics in this land of ours by stating \ncategorically one could not buy the office.\n  I can still see the Senator from Louisiana, Russell Long. He said, \nevery man a king--everybody, regardless of economic circumstance or \nbackground, could aspire for the Presidency of this land of ours. \nListen to Elizabeth Dole. One can be a former Secretary of Commerce, \none can be a Secretary of Transportation and Secretary of Labor, one \ncan have been head of the American Red Cross, every kind of track \nrecord, but unless the candidate has the money, the candidate doesn't \nstand a chance--money is what talks.\n  We are saying it is a real problem. On the one hand, we have too many \nlimits, we ought to have more money in this; or, on the other hand, let \ntaxpayers, let the public, pay for our politics; let's have public \ncampaign finance. We have had about three votes on it.\n  I remember when I first introduced it, it was a joint resolution. \nThere was\n\n[[Page S13208]]\n\none line, and it is in now, but I can't get it up. I have been waiting \nfor a good joint resolution to come over, Senator. If it comes over, I \nwill offer it. They told me I couldn't offer it to campaign finance \nreform because mine was a joint resolution and it was a simple bill, \nwith three readings to be signed. A joint resolution, of course, and \namending the Constitution, is not to be signed by the President.\n  That being the case, I put in this particular one-line amendment that \nthe Congress of the United States is hereby empowered to regulate or \ncontrol spending in Federal elections. I had a dozen good Republican \ncolleagues--my senior colleague and others--joined as cosponsors way \nback; this has to be almost 20 years ago. We can't get that, except for \nthe distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter. So the \nHollings-Specter amendment was so salutary that the States said, wait a \nminute, add that the States are hereby empowered to control or regulate \nspending in Federal elections.\n  So we added that. We have gotten a majority vote, but we never have \ngotten the two-thirds necessary. It would pass. I am not worried about \nit at any next election. It would easily come about.\n  We relied upon looking at the last five of the six amendments. They \npassed in an average of 17 months.\n  Does the distinguished Senator have a question? I am just feeling \ngood about this particular measure.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, I do have a question. I \npersonally am in agreement with the different issues the Senator has \nraised--campaign finance reform, minimum wage, being able to amend \nbills. I agree with the Senator in that regard.\n\n  However, the Senator from Texas and I have a matter on the floor. I \nask the Senator about how much longer he will speak. I know the Senator \nhas a lot of capacity, but if he could give an idea so we could either \ninterrupt at this time or come back at whatever time the Senator \nindicates.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I suggest the Senator come back because I am just \nbeginning to cover the subjects. We have a luncheon in the next 15 \nminutes, and I will complete my thoughts.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator will finish in the next half hour?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Senator from Nevada.\n  What happens if we can get up campaign finance and get an up-or-down \nvote on Shays-Meehan? I have my doubts about its constitutionality. I \nhave voted several times for McCain-Feingold. I voted against the most \nrevised or limited McCain-Feingold for the simple reason it was similar \nto half a haircut; it was worse than none at all. It said the parties \ncouldn't take soft money but everyone else could take soft money.\n  Immediately, my adversary, Tom Donohue at the Chamber of Commerce, \nsaid we had not participated financially sufficiently in campaigns. So \nI am getting up a kitty of $5 million. The Chamber of Commerce will get \nup a kitty of $5 million and pick some 8 or 10 senatorial races and \ngive them at least $100,000.\n  Mind you me, the Chamber of Commerce no longer represents Main Street \nAmerica, no longer represents the middle-size or small business; rather \nthe international, the transnational, the gone overseas crowd, such as \nthe Farley group that has already transferred 17,000 jobs offshore. It \nis headquarters to the Cayman Islands. I don't know whether those are \nforeign contributions. I had better look into that. It strikes me they \nare talking about the Chinese. I am wondering whether the Chinese have \nany worse position that the Cayman Islanders to make contributions. I \nthink we ought to call Janet Reno and say here is an example of foreign \ncontributions by the Cayman Island Farley to the campaigns--$500,000 \nfor George. Poor George W. will never get through the year. They will \nfind these things I am talking about. Poor fellow, he hasn't gotten \ninto the Washington go-round. This crowd will chew anyone up.\n  See how the logic applies. We are all talking about the Attorney \nGeneral not doing enough on some antiquated contribution; that happened \nway back. I am talking about what is being made now in this week's Time \nmagazine, the Cayman Island contributions to poor George W. in Texas, \nand he probably doesn't even know it--when one runs a mammoth national \ncampaign. We will have to look into that.\n  We have a special interest bill. We need a vote on Shays-Meehan to \nfind out whether it is constitutional or to make sure, along with it, \nto constitutionalize Shays-Meehan by coming right along and taking the \nHollings-Specter amendment to constitutionalize it.\n  As I was about to say before examined by my distinguished friend from \nNevada, we have found that of the last eight amendments to the \nConstitution, seven have passed in 17 months' time.\n  There is no debate, and they all relate to elections. There is no \ngreater cancer on the body politic than the campaign finance practices \nin this land.\n  Everybody talks about the amount of money. I would say a word about \nthe amount of time. As a full-time Senator, I am supposed to be giving \nfull time to the problems of the people of South Carolina. But I found \nmyself last year giving full time to my particular problem of staying \nin office, by going all over the country, trying to collect funds from \nanybody and everybody who thought I could be a pretty good Senator.\n  This was the seventh time I have been elected to the Senate. I am \nstill the junior Senator. I am working hard on my way up.\n  Be that as it may, when I first got elected back 33 years ago, it was \na little budget, somewhere, I think, around $400,000 or $500,000. I had \nto collect $5.5 million last year.\n  In a small State where they are all Republicans, such as Delaware and \nSouth Carolina, we have that Dupont crowd. We have them. They are the \nbest of the best. But all my State has gone Republican as did the \nSouth: two Republican Senators in Texas, two in Alabama, two in \nMississippi, and two in Tennessee. October of last year I was the last \nremaining statewide Democrat in office except for my friend the \ncomptroller, Earl Morris. He and I were the last two: city councils, \nmayor, the Governor, the legislature--all Republican. With this \nrecording of every contribution in and every contribution out, there \nwere a lot of Republican friends who wanted to participate. But we put \nthat burden on them. They would have to, literally, explain why they \ngave that fellow Hollings $100 or $1,000, whatever the contribution \nwas.\n  Rather than become involved--if we want to know what cuts off people \nhave from involvement in the process in America today, it is just this \nparticular requirement. I voted for that requirement. I think it ought \nto be made public. But it can get bad, and it does, and has gotten bad \nin my State.\n  We can correct this. We can constitutionalize whatever is the intent \nof Congress. You do not have to get that distorted opinion of Buckley \nv. Valeo for the simple reason that they said money amounted to speech. \nThose with money had all the speech they wanted, but those who did not \nhave money could get lockjaw. They could just shut up and sit down. \n``You are not in the swim, Liddy Dole; you are not in the race at all. \nYou can forget about it.'' The party has already arranged and crowned \nGeorge W. in Texas, and he has $50 million to $60 million. He doesn't \nneed the public money, and everybody thinks that is great.\n  I think that is not great at all. I think when it has gotten to be \nthat bad, when you have enough money, like Perot, to start a party, and \nyou have enough money to control the party as is being done now on the \nRepublican side, we have to clean this thing up and get back to not \nbeing able to buy the office. So I would have campaign finance reform \nas a very strong amendment and make sure there is no question.\n  Time magazine thinks it is relevant, but the Senator from Mississippi \ndoes not think it is relevant. If he can come out and if he will make \nthe proposal that he does think it is relevant, we can agree on a time \nagreement on Shays-Meehan, 5 minutes to a side, and vote. Do not come \nweeping and wailing that, Oh, we have so many things to get done, we \nhave the appropriations' bills, we have this bill, we have that bill, \nand everything like that. This is not a time-consumption strategy on \nthe part of the Senator from South Carolina. This is to bring to the \nfore that which has been prevented from\n\n[[Page S13209]]\n\neven being debated in this body. The most deliberative body in the \nhistory of the world can no longer, under the process, deliberate. You \nhave to walk up to the table and find out how to vote.\n  I was here with Senator Mansfield. Senator Mansfield would think that \ndemeaning, to put there how a Senator is supposed to vote. Senator \nDirksen would absolutely oppose nonsense of that kind. But that is how \nwe all are going. You have to do it this way and get on message. You \ncannot debate what the public wants debated. You can only debate what \nthe polls show to be debated.\n\n  Everybody is running all over the world talking about education \nbecause it shows up in the polls. But we only control 7 cents of every \neducation dollar; the 93 cents, that is the State and local \nresponsibility. Bless them, I am a leader on that subject. You name \nanother Senator in this body who has put up a 3 percent sales tax and \npassed it for public education. You name another one who has come in \nwith a system of technical training that would even equal--much less be \nbetter than--ours.\n  I have worked in the vineyards over the years for education so I do \nnot demean the need for improving the quality of education, namely, \ndoubling the pay of teachers. So you get what you pay for. If we start \nattracting the best and the brightest, they do not need retraining; \nthey need money. They need to be paid. The average pay, I think, in \nSouth Carolina, is around $27,000 or $28,000. Maybe it has gone up to \n$31,000. Don't hold me to the exact figure. But I know that is \nrelevant. That doesn't pay for the children to go to college. I go to \nthe graduations and they come across the stage. ``Senator, I would like \nto have taught, but I am not able to get into teaching because I cannot \nsave enough money to get my children through school and college. So \nwhat do I do? I get into international studies, business course and \notherwise.''\n  Mr. President, we have the Kathie Lee sweatshop bill here before us, \nwhere 17,000, according to Time Magazine, have gone from Kentucky in \nthe last few years. I have the exact figures. I had a talk the weekend \nbefore last to the northern textile industry. The Senator from Delaware \nhad all of his textile people there, Drew Potter and otherwise. I was \nglad to talk to the northern textile industry people.\n  I want to make a record of this particular situation because this is \nhow bad it can get, how politics can really take over. I have been the \nprincipal sponsor of five textile bills that have passed this Senate, \nfour of them have passed the Senate and the House of Representatives \nand gone to the President of the United States. One was vetoed by \nPresident Carter, two by President Reagan, and one by President Bush. I \nremember when President Bush implied, in his commitment to the talk in \nGreenville, that he was for textiles. When asked how come he vetoed it, \nhe said, ``C'est la vie.'' He not only wants to import the textiles, he \nwants to import the language. That is how far off we have gotten.\n  I could not get invited. I tried last year. Here is a fellow who has \ngrown up and held just about every office at the local level: \nLieutenant Governor and Governor and Senator elected seven times. But I \ntried. They have a little lunch or evening meal, I think it is, at the \nPiedmont Club, these new young executives. I said: You know, I ought to \nmake an appearance there because they have a new group and everything \nelse. I could not get invited. They never could find a time.\n  I had some old-time leaders say: We will arrange it for you. I could \nget invited, thanks to Karl Spilhaus and the leadership of the northern \ntextile industry. At least I can get invited now to the northern \ntextile industry, but I could not get invited to my own backyard.\n  Here, as the cosponsor and voter for the right to work bill, I am out \nhere trying to protect organized labor because--where are they? I heard \nthat Ms. Evelyn Dubrow is finally back in town. She is the best of the \nbest. She just won the Presidential Medal last month. I congratulate \nher. She has been outstanding over the years. Maybe if I explain this \nbill long enough, we might be able to pick up some votes.\n\n  I see others waiting. I said I would take at least 15 minutes. My \ngood friend from Minnesota, who really held the fort down yesterday, \nhas been trying to get recognized to say a few words. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Ohio is here. I \nask unanimous consent that I follow the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Minnesota for \nhis courtesy. I say to him and the Senator from California, I plan on \nspeaking probably 12 minutes.\n  Yesterday, I filed an amendment to H.R. 434, the African Growth and \nOpportunity Act, which amendment would improve our Nation's ability to \nretaliate against illegal trade practices by foreign governments. \nDespite efforts to reduce European trade barriers against American \nagriculture, despite repeated rulings by international trade bodies \nthat European trade barriers are illegal, there still remains a \n``fortress Europe'' mentality against free and fair trade.\n  The amendment I have filed is designed to strengthen the one and only \nallowable weapon in our arsenal against WTO noncompliance, the only \nweapon we have when a country is found to be in violation of the WTO \nand repeatedly refuses to comply. The only weapon we have, the only \nmethod of forcing compliance, is tariff retaliation.\n  The amendment I filed enjoys widespread bipartisan support. In fact, \nthe bill I filed is similar to the amendment and now has 24 sponsors. \nIt is bipartisan.\n  This amendment has strong backing by our very diverse agricultural \ncommunity, and this is certainly no surprise. Ask any corn grower or \ncattle producer or pork producer. They know and understand their well-\nbeing depends on expanding our export markets. We have the greatest \nagriculture in the world. We do it more efficiently and cheaper and \nbetter than anyone in the world today. All our farmers say is: Give us \na chance to sell; give us a chance to compete. That is what this \namendment is about.\n  It is my hope the Senate, by adopting this amendment, will take a \nstand for our farmers and ranchers and send a strong signal to the \nEuropean Union that their gross violations of international trade law \nsimply must stop.\n  Specifically, the European Union, despite years of efforts to find a \nfair solution, continues to defy the World Trade Organization's rulings \nagainst its ban on U.S. beef imports and its banana import rules. Both \ncases are important not just for the specific producers and the \ndistributors impacted by these two cases, but it is important for every \nAmerican business, particularly small businesses, seeking a fair shot \nat the European market.\n  To appreciate the magnitude of Europe's current actions against \nAmerican agriculture, it is important to put it in the context of \nrecent history. Both these specific trade cases took several years to \nwork through the WTO and were undertaken at great expense to the U.S. \nGovernment, and the producers in the businesses are at the heart of \nthis dispute.\n  Here are the essential facts. This is the story.\n  The E.U. first imposed their ban on U.S. beef with growth hormones in \n1985 and officially banned all U.S. beef in 1989. When the United \nStates sought rulings on this ban, either through the WTO or the \nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade process, the result was the \nsame: The E.U.'s ban was found to be without merit and in violation of \ninternational trade rules. That was the ruling repeatedly, time after \ntime. First through the GATT process and then through the WTO, the \nresults were the same.\n  In other words, the WTO, and before that the GATT, found against the \nEuropean Union for violating trade laws. However, in spite of these \nrepeated rulings, the E.U. has refused to comply, and to this very day, \nto this hour, to this minute, they continue to refuse to comply. In \nspite of these rulings, the E.U. has refused to change its practices. \nIn spite of these rulings, they continue to thumb their nose at the WTO \ndecision.\n\n[[Page S13210]]\n\n  The real question is whether or not the WTO rulings are enforceable, \ndo they mean anything, and every nation that is a member of the WTO has \na vested interest in making sure the rulings are enforceable, they do \nmean something, and they do matter. That is what this amendment is \nabout.\n  In the face of noncompliance by the E.U., the United States only has \none remedy, and that remedy is tariff retaliation. We have no other way \nto go. This is prescribed, it is allowed, and it is provided for in the \nWTO rules. This is the only recourse a country has when another country \nrefuses to comply.\n  Under current WTO rules, the United States can retaliate against a \nbeef ban by imposing tariffs on European imports at a total amount \nequal to the amount of financial pain being inflicted on our U.S. beef \nindustry. The WTO determined in this particular case that the E.U. beef \nban was inflicting $116.8 million per year in economic damages to U.S. \nfarmers.\n  Although the WTO's $116 million figure is significant, our cattle \nindustry strongly believes this is a very conservative estimate. They \nbelieve the actual impact is closer to $1 billion annually.\n  Let me talk for a few moments about the other case, the banana case. \nWith bananas, the E.U. imposed import quotas and licenses in the early \n1990s. While the United States produces bananas in Hawaii, we also have \na significant stake in the distribution and sale of bananas \ndomestically and internationally.\n  Seven times, the WTO ruled that the European Union's attempts to \nobstruct U.S. banana distribution violated WTO rules--seven different \nrulings. The WTO determined that the banana policy of the E.U. is \nresulting in $191.4 million worth of economic damage annually to U.S. \ninterests. Again, the impacted U.S. companies believe the actual damage \nis more than $1 billion annually. Again, the United States, with regard \nto bananas, as was the case with beef, has the authority to impose \nretaliatory tariffs against E.U. products.\n  Let me recap where we are in the story. With both bananas and beef, \nthe European Union repeatedly has been in violation of the WTO rulings. \nThe European Union has refused, in spite of these rulings, to change \nits policies.\n  The WTO procedures provide a waiting period of 15 months for a nation \nthat is found to be in violation of rules to comply. In other words, \nnothing happens--even as the ruling comes out, nothing happens for 15 \nmonths. What happened here in 15 months was nothing, absolutely \nnothing. The European Union, again, continued for that 15-month period \nof time not to comply. On the beef and banana cases, we waited these 15 \nmonths, and the European Union still didn't comply. So at that point, \nthe United States simply had no choice but to impose tariffs in \nretaliation--tariffs that are fully allowed under the WTO.\n  The purpose for allowing the United States to impose tariffs is, of \ncourse, to compel compliance with the WTO rulings. It has been 6 months \nsince tariffs on European imports were imposed in response to the \nbanana case, and it has been 3 months since tariffs were imposed in \nresponse to the beef ban. So we had the 15-month waiting period. We had \nsome other time that elapsed, and then we had the 6 months and the 3 \nmonths in the banana and beef cases. After all this, are the Europeans \nmaking any effort to comply with either ruling? We know the answer. The \nanswer is, no, on both counts. They still are not in compliance, and \nthey still give absolutely no indication that they are going to come \ninto compliance.\n  This is not just about beef. It is very important. It is not just \nabout bananas. It is about whether the WTO is going to mean anything. \nAnd it is whether or not the rulings of the WTO are going to mean \nanything. I think we have to look at the big picture and put this in \nperspective.\n  While the European Union, the E.U., continues its fortress mentality \nand thumbs its nose at the WTO rulings, other WTO member nations \nfinding themselves on the wrong side of a WTO ruling have acted \nresponsibly.\n  Members of the Senate may ask: Well, what has happened in other cases \nwhen other countries have been found to be in noncompliance, to have \nviolated the WTO, and the ruling has come down, and they lost their \ncase and they have lost their appeal? What have they done? The answer \nis, they have done what you would expect them to do. They have \ncomplied.\n  The United States has lost four separate WTO cases. In each case, \nafter losing, we complied. Canada has lost and they complied. Korea \nlost and Korea complied. Japan lost and Japan complied. Everybody but \nthe E.U.--all of these countries that lost their cases came into \ncompliance. In fact, every nation found in violation of a WTO ruling \nhas come into compliance--every nation--except for the nations of the \nEuropean Union.\n  Retaliation is the only authorized tool to bring a country into \ncompliance with WTO rulings. That is the point of this amendment, to \nmake this authorized retaliation more effective and to get the job \ndone.\n  What is a nation to do if its current list of imports subject to \nretaliatory tariffs is not working to move the offender such as the \nE.U. into compliance? The solution, I believe, is to seek other \nproducts to target and at tariff levels that will impose the kind of \npain that will cause the European Union to see compliance as the \nremedy. This is a process known as ``carouseling.'' That is what this \namendment is about.\n  In both the case with bananas and the case with beef, we came forward \nwith a list of products that we were retaliating against and the duties \nwere imposed. Nothing has happened. What our amendment provides--and I \nwill discuss this in greater detail later when I formally offer this \namendment--is that if the first list of items on which we are imposing \ntariffs to retaliate against the E.U., quite candidly, does not inflict \nenough pain to get their attention, then we need to carousel or change \nthe list.\n\n  The amendment provides that at least one of the items must be \nchanged. It provides that many can be changed, but at least one has to \nbe changed. The whole idea is, if this is the only way we can get their \nattention, the only remedy we have, the only tool we have, the only \nstick we have is this type of retaliation, we must make sure it is \neffective and we must make sure the correct products are being chosen \non which to inflict the pain to get the attention of the E.U. That is \nwhat this amendment is all about. It is a rather modest amendment, but \nit is an amendment that we believe will significantly make a \ndifference.\n  To date, the administration has refused to carousel products in \neither case. They do have, currently, the authority to do it, although \nthey are not compelled to do it. As long as the E.U. remains unwilling \nto comply with WTO rulings, it becomes more imperative that the tool of \nretaliation be used effectively. Our amendment would do that by \nrequiring the United States to change retaliation lists periodically to \ninflict pressure, pain, on the noncomplying party to comply--in this \ncase, the E.U.\n  The ramifications of the E.U.'s noncompliance with the entire WTO \ndispute settlement process is staggering. If the E.U. is successful, if \nthey get away with this, then we can expect them to continue this \ntactic on other products and other commodities, and the entire WTO \nprocess will mean nothing, at least as far as the E.U. is concerned.\n  The issue today is beef and bananas, but tomorrow it could be grains, \napples, peaches, potatoes, perhaps even computers. Who knows? A lot is \nat stake. We must ensure our retaliation does, in fact, result in \ncompliance. We must ensure that it works.\n  This amendment would require the carouseling--or the rotating--of \nproducts on a list of goods subject to retaliation when a foreign \ncountry or countries have failed to comply with a previous WTO ruling. \nThis amendment would help ensure the integrity of the WTO dispute \nsettlement process because it would provide the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative with a powerful mechanism to place considerable pressure \non noncomplying countries to actually comply.\n  In conclusion, it is my hope that in the near future, my fellow \ncosponsors and I will have an opportunity to have a more detailed \ndiscussion of this amendment and the issues involved and that the \nSenate will overwhelmingly approve our amendment.\n  It is time, frankly, to break down the barriers of fortress Europe in \nthe name of fairness for American farmers.\n\n[[Page S13211]]\n\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor. And I do thank my colleague \nfrom Minnesota for his courtesy.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, let me repeat, in about 2 \nminutes, what I suggested today about the legislation before us, the \nseveral trade bills.\n  I think while those who argue, with the WTO meeting that is coming up \nin Seattle, that we might be able to have some enforceable labor \nprovisions and environmental provisions, and, for that matter, think \nabout a fair shake for farmers in this trade regime, now bring to the \nfloor of the Senate some trade agreements where there is no enforceable \nlabor standards whatsoever, no enforceable environmental standards--\nzero--the message of this legislation to working people in this country \nis: If you should want to organize and bargain collectively to make a \ndecent wage, those companies are gone. And the message to people in \nother countries, the Caribbean and African countries, is: The only way \nyou get investors to your country is if you are willing to work for \nless than 30 cents an hour, or whatever.\n  This is hardly legislation that leads to the uplifting of living \nstandards of working families in our country, much less poor and \nworking people in other countries.\n  I am opposed to these trade bills and have had a chance yesterday to \nlay out my case. And Senator Hollings has spoken today. Others may have \nspoken, as well.\n  But what I want to do right now is speak to another issue which I \nthink is almost more important than the legislation before us.\n  We now have legislation out here, and the ``tree'' has been filled \nwith amendments, so there is no opportunity whatsoever for those of us \nwho have been saying for a while that we wanted to have an opportunity \nto offer some amendments, some legislation that we think will make a \ndifference for the people we represent, there is no opportunity for us \nto be able to do so. That is what is at issue.\n  If the majority leader, to whom I spoke about this earlier, was \nserious about trying to get this legislation passed, getting the \nnecessary votes for cloture, then certainly we wouldn't have a piece of \nlegislation on the floor with the tree filled with no opportunity for \nSenators to offer amendments. The majority leader wants to argue they \nhave to be relevant amendments. Who gets to define relevant? One \nwonders whether or not, if we had amendments to have enforceable labor \nstandards, that would be viewed as relevant.\n  For me, it has been, now, about 6 weeks. This is why I deferred to \nthe Senator from Ohio. First of all, he was on the floor first and I \ndidn't want to precede his speaking. Secondly, I want to take a little \nbit of time. I think probably I will wait for a more timely time to \ntake more time because one way or the other I am going to force a vote \non some agricultural initiatives. The Chair and others can vote for or \nagainst it, but I have, for the last 6, 7 weeks, asked the majority \nleader, when will I have an opportunity to offer legislation I think \nwill fix not all that is wrong but at least could make a positive \ndifference? Other Senators can disagree. But we take responsibility for \nwhat we do, and we vote one way or the other. We debate one way or the \nother, and then we are held accountable.\n  The exchange I had with the majority leader today about this has been \ngoing on for quite some time. The majority leader said he was pretty \nsure if I introduced an amendment, he probably would be opposed to it. \nThat is fine. It think the more important point, which is what I tried \nto explain--I don't choose to debate the majority leader; he is not \nhere--is that nobody in the Senate, Democrat or Republican, should be \nunder the illusion, because we passed a financial assistance package, \nemergency package, that we have, in fact, dealt with the price crisis. \nI don't know of any producers who feel good about this bailout \nlegislation every year. People are sick of it. They want us to get to \nthe root of the problem.\n\n  They don't think the farm policy is working. I don't think it is \nworking. I don't even choose to point the finger. I thought Freedom to \nFarm was ``freedom to fail.'' I never liked it. I thought it was a big \nmistake. I thought it was great for the packers and the grain \ncompanies. I didn't think it was good for family farmers. Others take a \ndifferent position.\n  It seems to me the point is, looking forward not backward, whether or \nnot we are willing to talk about some modification, some adjustment, \nsome changes. If Senators don't think taking the cap off the loan rate \nmakes sense, then what else? If Senators don't think a moratorium on \nthese mergers and acquisitions, which is what I will talk about today--\nthat is the amendment I wanted to introduce to this legislation, which \nthe majority leader shut me out from doing right now--makes sense, then \nperhaps Senators will have other proposals.\n  In farm country in Minnesota--maybe it isn't that way in Montana--\nalmost everybody I know thinks there is a correlation between monopoly \npower, the power of a few companies that muscled their way to the \ndinner table and have control, and their low prices. The farm retail \nspread grows wider and wider, a lot of our producers face extinction, \nand the packers are in hog heaven. IBP makes record profits, and pork \nproducers are going under.\n  I thought I could introduce this amendment today, which I will \nexplain.\n  Mr. President, I came to the floor probably for the sixth or seventh \ntime today to ask the majority leader when I would have an opportunity \nto submit an amendment to introduce legislation that I believe will \nspeak at least in part to the economic convulsion that is taking place \nin agriculture. We have too many family farms that are going under the \nauctioneer's hammer. There are too many of our producers who are being \ndriven off the land.\n  If I had to pick one ``issue'' that means the most to me right now \njust in terms of the emotion of it, it would be what is happening to \nour producers. What is happening to our producers is they are being \ndriven off the land. This is not only where they work. It is where they \nlive. I think it is all quite unnecessary. I think if we were willing \nto change some of the policies, this wouldn't be happening.\n  I am determined one way or another to force the Senate to vote up or \ndown on several initiatives that I believe would make a difference. If \nthere are other Senators who have a better idea than having a \nmoratorium on these mergers and acquisitions that are leading to more \nmonopoly power by these conglomerates and driving farmers off the land, \nor have a better idea of taking the cap off the loan rate, or creating \na farmer loan reserve, or extending the payment period on the loan rate \nso that farmers have some leverage vis-a-vis these huge conglomerates, \nthen come out on the floor of the Senate with your ideas. If there are \nSenators who believe we should leave in the next week or two without \ntaking any action whatsoever to deal with the price crisis, to deal \nwith what is really going on in agriculture, then come on out and make \nthe argument.\n\n  I appreciate the exchange with the majority leader. But, to tell you \nthe truth, I think what is going on in the countryside doesn't have \nmuch to do with whether or not the majority leader says something that \nis fairly clever, or I say something that is fairly clever, or we have \na kind of back and forth discussion. That is fine. Each of us is saying \nwhat we believe. Each of us is representing what we think is right.\n  The only thing I know is that October 25, 1999, at the Bird Island \nElevator in Renville County, wheat was $2.89 a bushel; corn was $1.43 a \nbushel; soybeans were $4.04 a bushel; and this is way below the cost of \nproduction. These farmers can work 19 hours a day, be the best managers \nin the world, and they are still going to go under.\n  If U.S. Senators want to come out on the floor and amend the \n``freedom to fail'' bill, feel free to do so. But let's have the \ndebate. More importantly, let's all come out here with some \nlegislation, some change in policy, that will make a difference so we \ndon't lose a whole generation of family farmers.\n  In Minnesota, farm income has decreased 43 percent since 1966, and \nmore than 25 percent of the remaining farmers may not be able to cover \nexpenses, or won't be able to cover expenses in 1999.\n\n[[Page S13212]]\n\n  That is why I take it so personally when I am essentially told again: \nWe are going to shut you out. We are going to bring this legislation to \nthe floor. We are going to fill up the tree, and we are going to make \nsure, Senator Wellstone, that you can't come out here with an \namendment, or with legislation that you think would help farmers in \nyour State.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote against cloture, whether or not they \nare for this trade legislation, just because of the way business is \nbeing conducted in the Senate. The way business should be conducted in \nthe Senate is that when we have a piece of legislation, Senators must \nbe able to come out with amendments they believe are an important part \nof their work to represent people in their State. If other Senators \ndon't agree, they can come out and disagree. If other Senators want to \ncome out and say you have no business bringing legislation to the floor \nof the Senate that deals with agriculture because we are on a trade \nbill, then I would ask you: When have I had the opportunity over the \nlast several months or for the last year? The majority leader alluded \nto some of my colleagues who think that because we passed the financial \nassistance package we have dealt with the problem. Spend one second in \nMinnesota, come on out to northwest Minnesota, or west central \nMinnesota, or southwest Minnesota, or southeast Minnesota, and meet \nwith some of our producers. Look in their faces and see grown men and \nwomen break down and cry. Why don't you come out to do that? Since, \nagain, we are not going to take any action--this legislation is now \nfilled up with amendments--people in greater Minnesota don't know and \nhave any idea what ``fill up a tree'' means. It means, once again, we \ncan't come out here and fight for the people in our State.\n\n       Dear Farm Aid: My husband and two of our sons live on the \n     farm in Missouri. My husband has loved the farm ever since he \n     was a little boy. It would just kill him if he loses it. And \n     in fact it might just kill him. I am so very concerned. We \n     have been farming several years, and we have gone in and out \n     of bankruptcy. That is why we cannot get financing to save \n     our farm.\n       I will make a long story short. I am not used to this. We \n     have no place to go. Our farm may be sold at the end of \n     September on the courthouse steps. Many lives will be \n     affected. I am really worried about what will happen if we \n     can't hold onto our farm. We have worked our entire lives and \n     made many improvements to the farm. I do not know how you can \n     help. You cannot give farmers a price for what they sell, but \n     anything you can do would be appreciated. The banks are \n     demanding $200,000 from us. Time is very critical. If you can \n     save our family farm, we will be forever grateful. You may \n     even save one's life.\n\n  Actually, we can do something about the price. When we talk about \ntaking the cap off the loan rate, we are saying to farmers, get more \nleverage in the marketplace to get a better price. When we talk about \nfarmer on reserve, we are talking about farmers being able to withhold \ntheir grain until they get a decent price. When we are talking about \nthe need to take antitrust action and a moratorium on the acquisitions \nand mergers, we are simply saying to our livestock producers when there \nis less concentration of power, there is a much better chance of \ngetting a decent price.\n  When a farmer is at an auction and there are three buyers for what is \nbeing sold, one does not get a very good price.\n\n       Dear Farm Aid: We are at our wit's end. This farm has been \n     in our family since 1908. We are one of the only original \n     homestead families still surviving. We fought off foreclosure \n     three times since the 1980s. We have four children and we \n     don't live a fancy lifestyle. We built a new home 6 years \n     ago. Or rather we tried to build a home 6 years ago. We still \n     hope to have siding on the house one day. We got running \n     water 3 years ago, and fortunately we have electricity. We \n     were able to purchase a window for the house in 1997, and \n     some day the house will have flooring and sheet rock. This is \n     our only luxury. We don't have any retirement, life insurance \n     or health insurance.\n\n  I repeat: We don't have any retirement, life insurance or health \ninsurance.\n\n       Our farm has been listed for sale 5 times but so have all \n     our neighbors' farms. There is not employment in this area \n     and the nearest city is 78 miles from us [Montana farm.] Yet \n     we do not want to leave. We owe the bank $39,000 currently \n     and we know they will not release any income for our land \n     payment that is due this January. Therefore, we face \n     foreclosure in 2000. We don't know which way to jump. Should \n     we declare bankruptcy? We cannot afford a lawyer. We don't \n     even have money for groceries. We are not ignorant and we are \n     not bad farmers. We cannot compete against the large \n     companies. Last year we couldn't even sell our grain and it \n     had to go under the CCC loan. We delivered the grain for loan \n     repayment but it didn't bring enough to cover the CCC loan \n     and we owe an additional $1,765 on that, as well. What can we \n     do? Should we concede defeat and lose our legacy? Our son \n     would have been the 6th generation to work this land. Where \n     will he go? We can no longer qualify for conventional loans. \n     What's next? What do we do? We are so scared. In 1 year we \n     can lose what has taken 92 years to build. We have tightened \n     our belts as far as we can. We live on less than $3,000 a \n     year.\n\n  Senators, are you listening to that?\n\n       Please tell us what we should do. We live on less than \n     $3,000 a year. Please tell us what we should do.\n\n  What we should do, come early February when we come back in session, \nbefore spring planting season, is have 10,000 farmers and rural people \ncoming to the Capitol and rocking the Capitol. That is what we need to \ndo. We need to have farmers, rural people, the religious community, \nlabor and supporters coming right here--people are not going to come by \njet because they don't have the money--buses of people coming from the \nMidwest, the South, and other agricultural States, joined by allies, \nhave face-to-face meetings in every Senator's office, every \nRepresentative's office, be he or she a Democrat or a Republican. That \nis what we are going to need to do.\n\n  It is clear to me with a week to go we are not going to take this \naction. I can't even get an up-or-down vote on one amendment. I can't \neven get an up-or-down vote. I can't even get a debate. On this piece \nof legislation, the tree is filled. No amendments can be introduced.\n  But today won't be the day because the Senate right now is waiting \nuntil the cloture vote on Friday. The first opportunity I get to get \nthe floor when we do need to do a lot of business, I will be out here \ntalking for hours about agriculture--for hours.\n  A Kansas farmer's daughter:\n\n       My father is a farmer and the bank is foreclosing on his \n     farm. Due to circumstances beyond his control he has been \n     unable to make his mortgage payments. He was able to \n     forestall the sale scheduled for June 9, 1999. I don't know \n     how much longer he can put them off. He has been farming \n     since he got out of the army in 1945. He is 77 years old and \n     he is still trying to make a living. He has no life insurance \n     and I am fearful that his health will not hold out. Is there \n     any help for him? What can be done to help him maintain his \n     farm?\n       All appeals have fallen on deaf ears.\n\n  Including the deaf ears of the Senate.\n  At this moment, I hold the majority party accountable for not \nenabling us to come to the floor with amendments to try to change the \nsituation for the better.\n\n       All appeals have fallen on deaf ears. This farm has been in \n     our family since the 1800s. We don't want to lose it. But it \n     seems one way or the other my father's life will be taken. \n     Either the stress and his health will kill him, or losing the \n     farm will kill him. Please help.\n\n  I am going to repeat that so often on the floor of the Senate. We \ndebate statistics. It is all abstractions. It is all party strategy. \nSeveral hours ago when I came out ready to go with this good bill to \nimpose a moratorium on large agribusiness mergers and establish a \ncommission to review large agricultural mergers and the concentration \nof market power with Senator Dorgan, the majority leader came out and \nthrough several motions filled up the tree.\n  That is what we are talking about--filling up the tree. Don't let \nSenators have any amendments. Then I heard the majority leader say: We \ncertainly don't want to have something dealing with agriculture.\n\n       It seems one way or the other my father's life will be \n     taken. Either the stress and his health will kill him or \n     losing the farm will kill him. Please help.\n\n  I guess this woman in Kansas isn't going to get any help today from \nthe Senate. Won't get any help tomorrow. Since the majority leader has \nfilled up the tree, there is not opportunity for any amendments at all, \nno opportunity to bring legislation to the floor to try to make a \ndifference. No opportunity.\n\n       Please help.\n\n  I am going to read this again quickly because several other \ncolleagues have come to the floor. This woman is talking about her dad. \nHe is a World War II\n\n[[Page S13213]]\n\nvet. He is 77 years old. He is trying to make it on the farm. She says:\n\n       What can be done to help him maintain his farm?\n\n  With these record low prices and record low income.\n\n       All appeals have fallen on deaf ears. This farm has been in \n     our family since the 1800s. We don't want to lose it but it \n     seems one way or the other my father's life will be taken. \n     Either the stress and his health will kill him or losing the \n     farm will kill him. Please help.\n\n  There is no help from the Senate today because the majority leader \nhas filled up the tree and I don't have the right to come to the floor \nwith an amendment to try to help this woman, this farmer or other \nfarmers in our country. When are we going to do something about \nagriculture? Are we sleepwalking through history? I see my colleague, \nSenator Grassley from Iowa. He knows what is going on in the \ncountryside. I know he knows. But I just believe the Senate does not. \nWe are going to go with the current policy? Do Senators not believe \nthat we need to make perhaps some modification, maybe some adjustments \nwhen farmers are getting prices way below the cost of production? When \nthe men and women who produce the food and fiber for our country cannot \neven make a decent living, do we think we should not be doing anything \nabout this?\n\n  Iowa farmer:\n\n       I am a hog farmer and as you know times are tough. I want \n     to make some changes in my farm business that would \n     necessitate an off farm job. I do not have much choice. I \n     have to get an off farm job, or I will have no farm. I'm 54 \n     years old, I'm healthy, and I have a BA in history. When I go \n     to the employment agencies, I feel like the counselors do not \n     know how to help me. The only jobs out in my area are low \n     paying factory or sales jobs. Do you have any suggestions? I \n     feel that time is running out.\n\n  I hear that so often. I hear that so often from farmers. They say, \n``I feel like time is running out.''\n  That is the way I feel, as a Senator from the State of Minnesota. I \nfeel that time is running out. I feel that time is not neutral. I feel \nif we stand still and we do not pass any legislation that will make a \ndifference and we do not change this failed farm policy, a whole \ngeneration of producers are going to be wiped out in my State of \nMinnesota. The majority leader fills up the tree, denying me and \ndenying other Senators an opportunity to come out here with legislation \nwe think would help people in our States.\n  By the way, I am pleased to debate this with any Senator, the \nmajority leader and others.\n  An Illinois farmer wife:\n\n       Dear Farm Aid: My mother and father-in-law saved and \n     borrowed enough money in 1945 to buy an 80-acre farm in \n     Illinois. They farmed with horses, milked cows, raised hogs \n     in the Timber Creek Bed and raised 12 children. My husband \n     now has had the farm turned over to him since his parents \n     have passed away and his sister was killed in a car accident \n     2 years ago. My husband is, has always been, a very hard \n     worker.\n\n  Boy, I tell you, this sounds like my mother, Mensha Daneshevsky. If \nshe really liked somebody, this was her ultimate compliment. She would \nsay, ``He's a hard worker'' or ``She's a hard worker.'' My mother is no \nlonger alive. I tell you, family farmers in Minnesota and around the \ncountry are hard workers.\n\n       We both work at jobs full-time, our other jobs outside the \n     farm. We were both raised on a farm and we both love to farm. \n     We cash rent three other farms close by to get along, but \n     we are still having an awful time. The prices are so low \n     that we just cannot seem to make ends meet.\n\n  That is the point. I cannot believe it when Senators come out here on \nthe floor, or at least one Senator today, and talk about this emergency \nfinancial crisis bill we passed, this disaster relief bill we passed, \nas if this is a response. It does not have anything to do with low \nprices.\n  All that money we have been spending, more than we ever spent before \nin the ``freedom to fail'' bill, is only enabling people to live to \nfarm another day. There will be no ``other day'' for these farmers \nuntil we deal with the price crisis. I am told by this majority party \nthat I cannot bring an amendment to the floor to try to enable this \nfamily to make a living?\n\n       Prices are so low that we cannot seem to make ends meet. If \n     it wasn't for our jobs in town we would have lost everything \n     my husband's parents worked so hard for. We are doing all we \n     can, but we just cannot get out of debt. In fact, we are \n     going deeper and deeper into debt every year. My husband and \n     I have shed many tears and had many sleepless nights trying \n     to figure out just what to do to save our family farm. We do \n     not want to lose it. Do you have any help for us or anything \n     else that we can do? We lost over $20,000 this year. It \n     breaks my heart to see my husband work so hard and get so \n     tired of working two jobs and still not making it. Please \n     help us. If we could just get a break, even on this year, \n     things would be easier. Thank you for listening and I hope \n     you will be able to help my husband save his deeply loved \n     family farm.\n\n  I have hours of stories, especially from Minnesota farmers. I am \ngoing to pick the right time on the floor of the Senate to go through \nall of that, especially when the Senate most needs to do business.\n  But this is what I hear over and over and over again. ``Thank you for \nlistening and I hope you will be able to help my husband and save our \nfarm.''\n  The answer is: I can't. I can't. I can't help save family farmers in \nmy State or in other States because the Senate, and in particular--I \ndon't usually come out on the floor and do this, but I am doing it \ntoday--the majority party which filled up this legislation with \namendments has turned its back on agriculture. I heard today we do not \nwant to deal with agriculture.\n  When are we going to deal with agriculture? Exactly how much longer \ndo you think these people have? How many farmers do we want to see \ndriven off the land? How much more pain do we want to see? How many \nmore families do we want to see shattered before we do something?\n  This is about the angriest I have ever been since I have been on the \nfloor of the Senate because I was ready to do this amendment. I say \nthis to my colleague from Iowa, who is a good friend, he has nothing to \ndo with anything I am talking about. But I was ready to have a debate. \nI was ready to bring out this amendment. I was going to say I think we \nought to have a moratorium on these acquisitions and mergers because \nthey are taking place at such a breathtaking pace, and I think what is \nhappening is we are moving to monopoly and our family farmers cannot \nget a break. Let's have a study of this and let's put a moratorium on \nit for 18 months.\n  I tried. I have an amendment that is I don't know how many pages. It \nis well thought out. My colleague from Iowa could agree or disagree. We \neven had some discussion. He raised some questions I thought were \nimportant questions. But as long as we have legislation out here with \nthe tree filled and no opportunity to do the amendment, there is just \nno opportunity to do it.\n\n  I would not be out here today saying this, but this is the sixth or \nseventh time. For the last several months, I have been saying: When do \nwe have the opportunity to have this debate? It is hard to go home and \nmeet with people and know people are hoping for some change and know \nthis disaster package we passed does not do anything but enable people \nto survive. But then what about next year and next year? People want to \nknow: Do I have a future? Do my children have a future? What is going \nto be done?\n  Basically, what we get out here today on the floor of the Senate is a \nparliamentary maneuver which basically denies any Senator from coming \nout here with amendments.\n  Therefore, I do not know what is going to happen, but I certainly \nhope my colleagues will vote against cloture. Then, of course, it \nbecomes a game again. Then the President, who wants this legislation, \nwill not get the legislation. Then some people can say that is good; we \ndon't care one way or the other anyway. Or people can point the finger \nand some people can say: Those who voted against cloture, they are the \nones who killed it, and many of them were Democrats.\n  It goes on and on and on, this grand political strategy.\n  Look, I don't support this legislation. I was out on the floor the \nother day stating my reasons why. But, frankly, I think there is a \nlarger question. That has to do with whether or not we are going to \nhave debate on issues that are important to the lives of people in our \ncountry and whether we are going to have the opportunity to represent \nand fight for people in our States. Today certainly is not such a day.\n\n  I have at least a 2-hour historical analysis, but not today--I got \nthe attention of my friend from Iowa--at\n\n[[Page S13214]]\n\nleast a 2-hour historical analysis of concentration in the food \nindustry. I will go back to the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, and some \nof the work of Estes Kefauver. I will talk about the Farmers Alliance, \nthe populist movement, the gilded age, Teddy Roosevelt, and what we \nshould be doing. As a matter of fact, tomorrow I have the opportunity \nto testify about Viacom buying up CBS. It is pretty incredible. There \nwe have concentration in the media, telecommunications, which deals \nwith the flow of information in a representative democracy. I think \nfood is a pretty precious commodity.\n  I will summarize what this amendment would have done, if adopted.\n  This amendment represents comprehensive legislation. I would have \noffered this with Senator Dorgan--he would be out here, Senator Harkin \nwould be out here, and other Senators would be out here--to deal with \nthe problem of market concentration in agriculture. Anybody who does \nnot think we do not have a problem of market concentration in \nagriculture just does not know what is going on in the countryside. If \nanything, we are looking to put free enterprise back into the food \nindustry.\n  Given this concentration, given the mergers, given the \nanticompetitive practices, and given the failure of our antitrust \nauthorities to remedy the situation, we need to do something.\n  A moratorium on these large agribusiness mergers is something the \nCongress can do right now. This would apply to mergers and acquisitions \namong firms that do at least $10 million of business annually. It would \napply to mergers and acquisitions that, under current law, must already \nbe filed with the Justice Department and FTC; namely, the mergers and \nacquisitions in which one party has net revenue or assets over $100 \nmillion and the second party more than $10 million. The moratorium \nwould last 18 months or until the Congress enacted comprehensive \nlegislation to address the problem of concentration in agriculture, \nwhichever occurred first. We also would set up an agriculture antitrust \nreview commission to study the nature and consequences of concentration \nin the agricultural sector.\n  We have a long history in our country, a glorious history, of \nordinary people who have been willing to take on concentrations of \nwealth, of economic power, and of political power that are unhealthy \nfor democracy. They were some of our greatest leaders: Thomas \nJefferson, Andrew Jackson; think about the New Deal, the Progressive \nera, Teddy Roosevelt, and the People's Party of the late 1800s.\n  The populist platform of 1892 at the nominating convention in Omaha \ndeclared:\n\n       The fruits of the toil of millions are boldly stolen to \n     build up colossal fortunes for a few unprecedented in the \n     history of mankind.\n\n  The People's Party founder, Tom Watson, thundered:\n\n       The People's Party is the protest of the plundered against \n     the plunderers.\n\n  The late 1800s and the early 1900s is the way it seems to me in this \ncountry now. I keep referring to my colleague from Iowa because he is a \nfriend. I do not know what his experience is, but when I speak, for \nexample, to pork producers--there may be several hundred there--it \nseems as if I am in the late 1800s when the deck was stacked against \nproducers. It really does. They work hard. There are just a few packers \nwho pretty much control everything. The producers do not understand why \nthey cannot even make a living and IBP is making millions.\n\n  Come on, what is going on? Where is the competition? Let's give our \nproducers a fair shot, a fair shake. That is all they are asking. I \nhave not met anyone in the countryside--and this transcends all party \ndifferences--who does not believe there is some correlation between the \nconcentration of power and the low prices they receive.\n  Everybody thinks this is a problem, and we are sitting on our thumbs. \nI am told today by the majority leader, in filling up the tree: We \ndon't want these amendments such as agriculture; that is unrelated; \nthat is not relevant.\n  An amendment on agriculture is relevant to me. It is relevant to \nMinnesota. It is relevant to family farmers in the Midwest. It is \nrelevant to rural America. If I cannot meet the majority leader's \ndefinition of relevant, then I will just have to come to the floor \nwhenever I can and take as many hours as I can to talk about what is \nrelevant.\n  There is nothing more relevant to me right now than the pain and \nagony of family farmers in my State of Minnesota, and there is nothing \nmore urgent, from my point of view, than for me to try, even if I \nlose--I may very well. Cargill, IBP, ConAgra, and Monsanto have a fair \namount of clout, but I think it is worth trying to take them on. I \nreally do. At least I am going to try to fight for it, and at least I \nam going to try to continue to force this question in the Senate. If I \ncannot get an up-or-down vote and keep getting blocked, then I will \njust have to figure out ways to block the Senate as we try to do our \nbusiness because to me this is the relevant question.\n  What is relevant to me is that on the present course, we lose a \ngeneration of producers. We can change the course. We can change some \nof our policy. We can make some modifications. We can make some \nadjustments. We can get the price up. We can give our producers some \nprotection against these monopolies. We can do something that will make \nmuch more sense on trade policy, and we can make a difference.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on the Africa trade bill, which is now \nbefore the Senate, we are in a parliamentary position in which all the \namendments offered have been offered by the Republican side. Such a \nposition had to be taken by the majority leader because of failures to \nget time agreements and commitments from the other side, meaning the \nDemocrat side, on a limitation on amendments and time agreements on \nthose amendments so we could bring this bill to a vote.\n  I hope our Democrat friends will heed the necessity of this \nlegislation from President Clinton's State of the Union Address that \nthis was one of the most important goals of his administration. Since \nthe Republican majority in the Congress is often criticized by the \nPresident for not working closely with the President--and I think those \ncharges by the President of the United States are overblown most times, \nbut those charges are still made. So in the present environment in \nwhich one of the President's prime pieces of legislation is before the \nSenate, with a determination by our majority leader to help get this \npart of the President's program into law, I would think the Democrat \nminority would be embarrassed that they are taking actions that make it \ndifficult to get one of the President's programs through this Congress \nfor the President's signature.\n  I hope, as one Senator--not speaking for the majority leader, just \nspeaking for myself--they will reach agreement on these very important \namendments so we can bring this bill to finality and get it sent to the \nPresident, not because it is one of the President's major goals, not \nthat it shows the President's charges against the Republican majority \nare many times unfounded, not for any of those reasons, as legitimate \nas that might be, but because the substance of this legislation is very \nimportant for the economy of the United States and the economy of the \ncountries that it applies to--because free trade strengthens economies, \nfree and fair trade creates jobs, not only in the United States, but \nalso economies that practice free trade anywhere around the world are \nstronger economies because of it. That is the goal we seek in this \nlegislation.\n  We have heard we have a lot to fear from free trade. In the last few \nmonths, we have heard from many quarters that free trade is harmful \nbecause it destroys jobs. We have heard free trade is not fair trade \nbecause it causes investments to shift overseas. We have heard that the \nAfrica trade bill will do both of these things, as well as cause \nillegal transshipment that we cannot do anything about.\n  When you look at the facts, none of these three arguments that are \nused against this piece of legislation has any merit. First, let's look \nat the claim that free trade destroys jobs. The 50-year history of the \nmultilateral trade negotiations, first under the General Agreement of \nTariffs and Trade, and now under the World Trade Organization, called \nWTO for short, shows the enormous positive effect on the world economy \nof liberalizing trade by reducing tariffs and getting rid of nontariff \ntrade barriers.\n\n[[Page S13215]]\n\n  We have had eight series, or rounds as they are called, of \nmultilateral trade negotiations since GATT first started in 1947. We \nare about to launch a new round, the ninth one, at the WTO Ministerial \nConference in Seattle in about 5 weeks.\n  During the first round, the Geneva Round it was called, in 1947, we \nnegotiated 45,000 tariff concessions affecting one-fifth of world \ntrade.\n  In the sixth round, which was called the Kennedy Round, we slashed \ncustom duties on average of 35 percent.\n  During the last round, the Uruguay Round, starting in the middle \n1980s, ending in 1993, we reduced or eliminated many nontariff trade \nbarriers.\n  The results of this trade liberalization have been nothing short of \nastounding--creating jobs, expanding the world economic pie, creating \nbetter economies in various countries around the world, enhancing \npolitical opportunities and, most importantly, political stability. The \nexpansion of free trade that has followed this 50-year period of trade \nliberalization has spurred one of the greatest bursts of wealth \ncreation the world has ever seen.\n  In 1947, when we started postwar trade liberalization, the total \nvalue of world exports was about $50 billion. Today, the total value of \nworld exports is $7 trillion, more than 3\\1/2\\ times the total budget \nof the United States.\n  Free trade has enriched every American family. According to the \nPresident's own 1998 economic report, the added economic benefit to \neach American through expanded trade is $1,000 per year or $4,000 per \nyear for a family of four, as we measure families in America. This is \nequivalent to an annual $4,000 per family tax cut. Where can one get a \n$4,000 tax cut these days? Even the tax cuts now being debated in the \nCongress do not come anywhere close to this amount of money to enhance \nfamily income and disposable income.\n  The facts that show the benefits of free trade seem to be so \ncompelling that in explaining them, I don't know where to begin.\n  Let me mention a recent example that comes from NAFTA. According to a \nSeptember 1998 report published by the nonpartisan Congressional \nResearch Service, approximately 191,000 jobs were certified, between \nJanuary 1, 1949, and August 12, 1998, as potentially suffering NAFTA-\nrelated loss--affecting 191,000 workers. That is on the negative side. \nWe have always said that free trade will cause some job dislocation. \nThat is why we have programs such as trade adjustment assistance--to \nease the transition that is sometimes necessary when we have open \nmarkets.\n\n  On the positive side, there has been much more gain. Let's go back to \nthat Congressional Research Service study I cited. The number, 191,000 \nworkers affected negatively by NAFTA over 4 years, represents less than \nthe number of jobs created in any single month in 1997. In contrast, \nthen, on the positive side, more than 1 million new jobs were created \nfrom new exports to Mexico and Canada after NAFTA was enacted into \nlaw--more than 1 million new jobs.\n  Next let's look at the claim that is made by opponents of this \nlegislation or free trade generally that it causes investment to shift \noverseas. That claim, too, has little or no merit. Section 512 of the \nNAFTA Implementation Act required the President to provide a \ncomprehensive assessment of the operation and effects of NAFTA to \nCongress. The President's report shows that the amount of new United \nStates investment in Mexico is very low. Again, the specific facts are \ncompelling. In 1997, direct United States investment in Mexico was $5.9 \nbillion compared to United States domestic investment in plant and \nequipment of $864.9 billion. In other words, United States investment \nin Mexico was less than 1 percent of all United States domestic \ninvestment in plant and equipment in 1997. So much for that giant \nsucking sound we were supposed to have heard continuously from south of \nour border.\n  Free trade has been so good for our economy. If all these predictions \nabout economic disaster haven't come true when we have liberalized \ntrade in the past, it is clear we shouldn't fear tearing down barriers \naround the world, as we have for the last 50 years with the good \nresults we have for the 50 years, without the expectation that those \nbeneficial impacts would continue. We should, then, embrace such an \nopportunity.\n  Let me get specifically to the Africa trade bill. The fear that the \nAfrica trade bill will cause a huge influx of illegal textile \ntransshipments from Asia, as has been stated on the floor of the \nSenate, just is not true. I cite the International Trade Commission \nstudy, our own Government. It looked at the transshipment issue. Here \nis what our International Trade Commission found:\n  Assuming we will get illegal transshipments in a worst case scenario, \nthe ITC study shows that U.S. apparel shipments would drop by one-tenth \nof 1 percent and result in the loss of less than 700 jobs. Again, to \nput this number in perspective, the U.S. economy has created about \n200,000 jobs each month this year.\n  Remember, the ITC study guesstimate of 700 jobs is based on a worst \ncase scenario. It is highly unlikely, then, that sub-Saharan Africa \nwill see this level of export growth in the near term. They don't have \nthe infrastructure. They don't have the trained workforce. They don't \nhave good transportation. And the Africa bill has strong anti-\ntransshipment provisions.\n  One might say, then, why the big deal about the Africa trade bill? \nBecause trade is better than foreign aid and because, when you want to \nbuild up the economies of the developing nations, you start someplace. \nThis is how we can best help them to help themselves.\n  Participating countries will have to commit to full cooperation with \nthe United States to address and take any necessary action to prevent \ntransshipment. The spirit of this legislation is that there not be \ntransshipment. In addition, the U.S. Customs Service has effective \nprocedures to thwart illegal transshipments, as Customs jump teams have \nproven to be successful in doing in both Hong Kong and Macao. And there \nare many other provisions aimed at preventing transshipments. So free \ntrade works. Free trade creates jobs and prosperity in the United \nStates, adding $4,000 every year in economic benefits to each American \nfamily at home. Free trade keeps the peace by building interdependence \namong nations, and by bringing political stability to nations that \nheretofore have relied upon dictators and relied upon a government-\ncontrolled economy. Finally, free trade will help Africa break the \nshackles of poverty by bringing economic freedom to the most \neconomically unfree and also the poorest regions in the world. So I \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important piece of \nlegislation.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment, \nNo. 2335, be temporarily laid aside in order for Senator Reid of Nevada \nto offer an amendment. I further ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of that amendment, amendment No. 2335 become the pending \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2336\n\n (Purpose: To amend the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 1998 with respect to export controls on high performance \n                               computers)\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2336.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . ADJUSTMENT OF COMPOSITE THEORETICAL PERFORMANCE \n                   LEVELS OF HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTERS.\n\n       Section 1211(d) of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 1998 (50 U.S.C. App. 2404 note) is amended--\n       (1) in the second sentence, by striking ``180'' and \n     inserting ``30''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end, the following new sentence: ``The \n     30-day reporting requirement shall apply to any changes to \n     the composite theoretical performance level for purposes of \n     subsection (a) proposed by the President on or after June 1, \n     1999.''.\n\n\n[[Page S13216]]\n\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was born and raised on the southern tip of \nthe State of Nevada, in a little mining town called Searchlight. When I \ngrew up, there wasn't a single telephone anyplace in the town. No one \nhad a telephone. In the home I was raised in, there was no hot water. \nWe had no indoor toilets; they were outdoor toilets. It was primitive--\nwell, I would not say primitive, but we weren't very modern there. That \nis the way it was with a lot of people in rural Nevada at that time.\n  Today, it is hard for me to comprehend what has taken place in the \nadvancement of science. I can go home at night and see if I have \nreceived any e-mail on my computer. It is easy to do. I open my \ncomputer and it says, ``You've got mail.'' I open that up and find out \nwho has contacted me by e-mail, and it is like magic. I press a button \nand I can reply to that person as quickly as I can type that message \nout. That message is sent quicker, of course, than the speed of light. \nIt is gone. It is amazing. I can check to find out the weather on my \ncomputer. I can communicate and buy a CD, or anything else I want, on \nmy computer. I can't imagine how that can happen, but it happens.\n  I rise today in total awe of what is happening in science and \ntechnology in America. The amendment I have offered is an amendment \nthat is critical to maintaining our Nation's lead in the high-tech \nsector. Specifically, this amendment is crucial to the computer \nindustry, the industry that allows me to communicate, for example, with \nall five of my children. It is easy to do. It is easier to do than \nseeing if they are home by virtue of a telephone. It is easier to do \nbecause it is very convenient. They can send me a message when I want a \nmessage sent. I can send them a message when I have the time. I can \nhave a good time with my children over the Internet. I sent one of my \nboys, who is the athlete of the family, an e-mail last weekend saying \nthat I think the Redskins are going to do well if they get a new coach. \nHe was an athlete at the University of Virginia. It is the first time I \ncan remember that the University of Virginia soccer team has not been \nranked in the top 10; they are in the top 20. I suggested to my son \nthat it might not be a bad idea to get a new coach for the soccer team \nat Virginia.\n  This is done so quickly. He will communicate back to me when he has \nthe time. I am in total awe of what is going on in the high-tech \nsector.\n  This amendment relates to an issue I have been interested in for \nquite a long time and, in particular, have done a lot of work on this \nsession with some of my colleagues. What I am concerned about is \nbipartisanship. For once in this legislative session, we are doing \nsomething that is bipartisan. I have to say it appears the underlying \nbill is generally bipartisan, even though some disagree with it.\n  I want to talk about the U.S. computer industry. According to an \narticle in Computers Today, one of the many computer trade journals, \ndated July of last year, American computer technology has led the world \nsince the first commercial electronic computer was employed at the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania in 1946. The advancements that have been \nmade are unbelievable. I can remember, before I came back to \nWashington, going to the Clark County Courthouse and being shown around \nby the person who was in charge of the computers for the county. It was \na whole floor of that large building. Of course, it had to be really \ncold because computers needed constant cool temperatures. Well, today, \nwhat was done on the whole floor of that Clark County Courthouse can be \ndone on a computer the size of a briefcase.\n\n  The industry is constantly changing with new companies and new \nproducts emerging every day. A statistic I find fascinating is that \nmore than 75 percent of the revenues of computer companies comes from \nproducts that didn't exist 2 years ago. That statistic shows they will \ncontinue to grow and change rapidly.\n  Through research and development that is largely due to another issue \nI have strongly favored, the research and development tax credit--and I \nthink it should be permanent--the computer industry has been able to \nremain competitive for these many years. The challenge we now face is a \nchallenge that, frankly, we haven't lived up to in the past as a \nCongress, and that is to allow our export control policies to change \nwith the times and not to overly restrict our Nation's computer \ncompanies.\n  In the free enterprise system, entrepreneurs have never been so in \ncharge of what is going on than in the computer industry. They have led \nthis Nation forward economically. We have to give them the freedom that \nthey can continue, in this free enterprise system, to sell the product. \nWe need to stop trying to control technology by politics. We have to \nstart controlling technology by allowing the businesses to go forward. \nThe technology we are regulating, computers with performance levels of \n2,000 to 7,000 millions of theoretical operations per second, or MTOPS, \nis readily available from many foreign companies. Companies from \ncountries such as China and other tier III countries are moving into \nthis field rapidly.\n  Not too long ago, I secured funding through Congress for a \nsupercomputer at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. We were so \nproud of that computer. It required its own room. It is now about as \npowerful as my laptop computer. The supercomputer is no longer the same \nsupercomputer it was then, in 1988 or 1989, when it came to UNLV. That \nis exactly, though, the kind of computers we are still regulating \npolitically.\n  Computers that are now considered supercomputers operate more than 1 \nmillion MTOPS, or about 500 times the current level of regulation. Last \nmonth, Apple began producing a computer that exceeds the current \nthreshold and, as a result, Apple is unable to sell its new G4 computer \nsystems in over 50 countries.\n  The bottom line is that by placing artificially low limits on the \nlevel of technology that can be exported, we may be denying market \nrealities and could very quickly cripple America's global \ncompetitiveness for this vital industry. If Congress doesn't act \nquickly, we will substantially disadvantage American companies in an \nextremely competitive global market.\n  On July 23, 1999, at my urging, and the urging of some of my \ncolleagues, the President proposed changes to the U.S. export controls \non high-performance computers. Since that announcement, the President's \nproposal has been floating around Congress for a mandated review period \nof 180 days, or 6 months. When the President made his proposal, the new \nlevels would have been sufficient; however, we are still regulating \nunder the old levels, and therefore hindering companies such as Apple \nfrom competing in tier III countries with other foreign companies.\n  The amendment I am offering simply reduces the congressional review \nperiod from 180 days to 30 days to complement the administration's \neasing export restrictions by amending the National Defense \nAuthorization Act of 1998.\n  I would like to share an example of how outdated today's restrictions \nare. I was at a meeting recently where Michael Dell, President of Dell \nComputers, stood up and pulled from his hip holster a little pager. \nUnder current export controls, this little pager, normally smaller than \na computer mouse, can't be exported to tier III countries because it is \nconsidered a supercomputer. That is wrong.\n  I am going to withdraw my amendment. I am going to do it because I \nhave had conversations with the chairman of the Banking Committee. I \nfortuitously was able to have lunch with the ranking member of the \nBanking Committee, and I met also with Senator Enzi, who has worked \nvery hard on this issue, and also Senator Johnson, who has worked very \nhard on this issue. They indicated they are very impressed with the \nneed to change this time period. They want to do it under the Export \nAdministration Act. I, frankly, have been convinced by them that their \nintentions are well considered. They have thought this out over a long \nperiod of time. I want to work with them and the majority leader and \nthe minority leader to do whatever we can to, this year, move the \nExport Administration Act. It is vitally important that we do that.\n  We need to allow the entrepreneurs in America who have made this \neconomy the vibrant, untiring economy that it is the freedom to sell \ntheir products because if we don't allow them to have that freedom to \nsell their\n\n[[Page S13217]]\n\nproducts, other foreign companies, some of which will be actually \nAmericans moving over and setting up foreign companies, will be selling \nproducts that we should be selling with American-manufactured goods.\n  I am going to withdraw my amendment with the notice that I am going \nto work very hard with my friend, the chairman of the Banking Committee \nand the members of the Banking Committee to do whatever we can to move \nthis very important piece of legislation. It is more than just my \namendment. What the Banking Committee wants to move is more important \nthan my amendment. I am concerned about the material that I have in \nthis amendment. I think this is very important.\n  I look forward to working with the chairman of the Banking Committee \nand the other members of the Banking Committee to see what we can do to \nmove the Export Administration Act in this Congress. With all the \nturmoil we have had in recent months with the partisanship, I believe \nwe need to move this legislation in a bipartisan fashion. It can be \ndone. We need to show the business community of America that we can \nmove forward.\n  It is vitally important to everyone. The people who buy these \nproducts don't look to see who manufactures them, whether they are \nDemocrats or Republicans. The people who work putting these computers \ntogether, no one knows whether they are Democrats or Republicans. But \neveryone knows when we have a good economy that we, the Congress, \nshould get some consideration in a positive fashion for that. If \nsomething goes wrong, we deserve the blame. I think with things going \nso well we have to do everything we can to make sure the economy \ncontinues to move forward.\n  I am going to do what I can to help this piece of legislation that we \nhope will come up as early as this week or next week and have it passed \nin this Congress and not next Congress. I mean this year of this \nCongress and not some subsequent year.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank our colleague from Nevada for his \namendment and for withdrawing it, and for joining our effort to try to \npass the Export Administration Act.\n  As some of our colleagues will be aware, there have been 11 failed \nattempts to pass a new Export Administration Act since the last one \nexpired.\n  We now find ourselves in a position where despite the Cox report, \ndespite concerns that have been raised about lost American technology, \nand despite the growing obsolescence of the residual permanent law the \nadministration is forced to operate under, we have not reauthorized the \nExport Administration Act. I think it is a terrible indictment of the \nCongress that we have not done that.\n  That is the bad news.\n  The good news is that under Chairman Enzi we have put together an \nexcellent bill. Chairman Enzi has done something I am not aware of any \nMember of the Senate ever doing. He has gone over and sat through \nmeetings of the current bodies of the executive branch that make \ndecisions related to export licensing. So he has, through practical \nexperience, come to understand the process. He has provided leadership \nwhereby we have put together a bill. He has provided leadership where \nwe literally sat down with everybody who has any interest in this bill. \nWe have had numerous meetings. We have let people submit concerns in \nwriting. I believe we are on the verge of having a bill that is \nuniformly supported.\n  What our bill tries to do is simple to say and very difficult to \nachieve. We have a conflicting interest. We want to sell things on the \nworld market which embody new technology because those are items that \nwe have a comparative advantage in producing, and they are items that \nare high-wage items in the production process.\n  Finally, they represent commodities that will dominate the future of \nthe world economy. So we want to be the leader in selling these types \nof goods.\n  On the other hand, we have legitimate concerns about technologies. If \nthey are in the hands of people who may be potential terrorist nations \nor potential enemies of the United States, they could end up hurting \nour national security.\n  We have taken those two conflicting concerns, and we have put \ntogether a bill. The two major features of it are the following:\n  One, we define a brand new concept called mass marketing. It is a \nvery simple and powerful concept. It says if an item is for sale at \nRadio Shack, if you can buy it over the web site of Dell Computers, if \nit is generally being marketed in the United States and around the \nworld--though you might wish that it is possible that all of this could \nhappen without it falling into the hands of a potential adversary--the \nbottom line is there is no practical way at that point that you can \nkeep anybody from getting the technology.\n  So we take mass marketed items out of the process and, hopefully, \nreduce the number of different items that are under licensing in any \ngiven year from about 10,000 to 1,000 so that we could put the focus of \nattention where it belongs.\n  Second, under current law, if companies are accused and found guilty \nof wrongdoing in China, despite numerous accusations, all of which \ncarry some penalties, the maximum fine under current law would be \n$132,000, which for corporate America is a relatively insignificant \namount of money. Under our bill, we have a $10 million fine per \nviolation. We also have for a conscious, knowing violation where \nindividuals are involved, prison sentences of up to 10 years, and in \naggravated cases, life in prison.\n  So there is a dramatic strengthening of current law.\n  I agree with our colleague from Nevada. This needs to be adopted this \nyear. I believe we have eliminated opposition to it.\n  It simply is now our task to provide leadership where we can bring \nthe bill to the floor later this week, or early next week, and get an \nagreement that this is not going to become a vehicle for a bunch of \nunrelated amendments.\n  Having said that, let me stop before I sit down. I want to say a \ncouple of words about the African trade bill.\n  First of all, I congratulate the chairman of the Finance Committee \nfor his leadership on this bill. I endorse the African trade bill. Our \nPresident went to Africa, did an extensive tour, and talked about what \nwe could do to try to break the bonds of poverty--this crushing, \ngrinding poverty--that people in sub-Saharan Africa face. I think the \nPresident rightly understood, if we take all the important aid provided \nby all the countries in the world and combine them, we have about $40 \nbillion a year. There are 700 million people in sub-Saharan Africa, so \nif they get all the foreign aid provided by all the countries in the \nworld, we will have relatively little impact on them, and there is \nrelatively little evidence that foreign aid has produced economic \ndevelopment in areas where no economic development ever existed before.\n  As a result, the President proposed bringing in the most powerful \ntool for economic development ever to evolve in the history of mankind; \nthat tool is trade. The President proposed we open up a fiber trade \nagreement in textiles with sub-Saharan Africa. I remind my colleagues, \nunder existing agreements internationally, by the year 2005, under the \nMultifiber Agreement, we will no longer have quotas on tariffs anywhere \nin the world. We are not talking about a permanent advantage for sub-\nSaharan Africa; we are talking about giving them a little bit of a head \nstart.\n  Let me briefly define the problem. The average per capita GDP of \ncountries in sub-Saharan Africa is $490 a year; 40 percent of the \npeople in sub-Saharan Africa earn less than $1 a day. The current \nestimates are, we import about .86 percent of textiles and apparel \nimported into America from sub-Saharan Africa. The International Trade \nCommission has estimated that if they devoted their productive capacity \nto textiles, under this agreement, still within 10 years we couldn't \nexpect more than 2 percent of our textile imports to come from sub-\nSaharan Africa. We are talking about expanded trade, and we are talking \nabout trade with countries that have no significant capacity to impact \nAmerican imports of textiles.\n  I believe this bill is needed. I think it is a step in the right \ndirection. I remind my colleagues, for any country in sub-Saharan \nAfrica to take part in this program, they have to do the following \nthree things: they have to make progress toward a market-based economy, \nthey have to institute a democratic society, and they have to open\n\n[[Page S13218]]\n\ntheir trading system. These are all actions that will mean stronger \neconomic growth in Africa, that will mean greater human happiness in \nAfrica, and that will ultimately mean a greater demand for American \ngoods and services.\n  I believe this is an important bill. I believe it should be adopted. \nI am hopeful we will adopt it today. I intend to vote for cloture and \nfor final passage.\n  There is one provision in this bill in the Senate that is not in the \nHouse bill. That is a provision that requires, for textiles and apparel \nto be imported from Africa, they have to be made out of American fabric \nand yarn. That same agreement is in the Caribbean Basin Initiative, \nwhich I support. But the problem with Africa is that given the \ntransportation costs, and given that their ability to market products \nis basically based on using longer strand cotton and basically \nproducing different types of textiles that would be relatively new to \nthe American market, I believe the provision in the Senate bill for all \npractical purposes kills the African trade bill.\n  I am not going to offer an amendment to strike this provision because \nit is not in the House bill. I hope it will be dropped in conference. \nWe are talking about a relatively small effort to benefit 700 million \nhuman beings. The worst thing that could come out of it is that we \nwould have greater diversity in the textile goods that would be for \nsale in American stores and they would be at lower prices. I can't see \nanything but good that can come out of this. Anywhere in the world, \nwhen we can encourage people to move toward a market-based economy, \ntoward a democratic society, and toward open trade, we are doing things \nthat benefit them and benefit the world.\n  These are important bills before the Senate. I am for them. Trade is \nvitally important. It is an amazing thing to me that, due to ignorance \nand prejudice, we continue to restrict the importation of goods and \nservices into America. Why we should give government the ability to \nimpose a tax on working Americans and deny them the ability to \npurchase, with the fruit of their own labor, better and cheaper goods \nif they are produced abroad, I don't know. That the greatest trading \nnation in the world would continue textile laws that cost every working \nAmerican family of four $700 a year is an absolute outrage. Something \nneeds to be done about it. This is not going to solve that problem, but \nit is the right thing to do. I hope it will become the law of the land \nthis year. I am hopeful it will.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I, too, thank the Senator from Nevada, Mr. \nReid, for helping to raise the consciousness of the Senate and the \nconsciousness of the Nation to the increases in productivity that we \nhave gotten through technology and the rate at which it is moving. I \nthank him for his recognition that we have a bill that will not only \nsolve some of the problems of technology but go hand in hand with our \nneed for national security.\n  This is a bill that has been before the Banking Committee and, before \nthat, before the International Trade and Finance Committee, of which \nSenator Johnson is the ranking member on that subcommittee. He and I \nhad an opportunity this year to spend a lot of time pursuing a bill to \nincrease our world trade while preserving national security, making \nsure they run down parallel tracks instead of crossing tracks where the \nlocomotive might wind up in a train wreck.\n  I thank the chairman of the Banking Committee, the senior Senator \nfrom Texas, for working with me to focus the committee on the need to \nreauthorize the Export Administration Act. I appreciate the assistance \nthat has given in helping to put together a balanced product that we \nreported out of the Banking Committee.\n  I am remiss if I do not mention Senators Sarbanes and Johnson again. \nThey deserve our thanks for the constructive and thoughtful input they \nput into the bill to make it truly bipartisan.\n  I thank every single member of the Banking Committee. We worked \ntogether for a period of 9 months to be sure all of the concerns of \nnational security and commerce were covered in this bill on which we \nare working. The members not only devoted a lot of time to it; they \nassigned staff to it. We had one of my offices--I don't have very many \noffices--dedicated to this bill. At any hour of day, and often night, \none could walk into that office and there would be a group of people \nmeeting to make sure their concerns and their solutions were being \nrepresented. We had some great discourse that led to a solution that I \nthink can pass both the House and the Senate. We worked with the \nmembers of the Defense Committee, Intelligence Committee, Commerce \nCommittee, and the Governmental Affairs Committee, and I think the bill \nis better because of everyone's involvement in it.\n\n  The first 9 months I was on the job as chairman of the subcommittee I \nspent dedicated to this bill. At first, I did not envision I would have \nto put in quite as much work on the issue as I did. I now realize there \nwas a lot to learn about export controls.\n  It has been mentioned there were attempts to reauthorize the Act, \nwhich expired in 1994. Since 1994, this country has been operating \nunder Executive orders on something so entirely crucial to the United \nStates. But during that period of time, we have tried to reauthorize \nit. During that time, 11 separate measures have failed; in fact, they \nfailed to even make it out of committee.\n  But one of the nice things about the Senate is that there is a lot of \ndocumentation, even on things that fail. We have gone back and looked \nat that documentation. We have talked to the people who were involved \nin the issues each of those 11 times. We were able to find out what the \npitfalls were before and have worked to come up with a solution.\n  As mentioned, I visited the Bureau of Export Administration and I \nobserved some of their activities and processes. I sat in on committee \nmeetings.\n  During the time we were working on this, the Cox and Dicks report \nalso came out, and so did the Deutch Commission report that talked \nabout problems that have been identified with foreign countries getting \nsecrets from this country. These commissions and committees looked into \nways to solve that.\n  As soon as their reports were filed with the Intelligence Committee, \nbefore any public documentation came out on it, I went over to the \nIntelligence Committee and I read those reports to see if the efforts \nwe were making had any parallel with the suggestions that were coming \nout from these people who were looking at some very detailed and often \nsecret situations. I am pleased to say, out of the recommendations of \nCongressman Cox and Congressman Dicks there were 17 different areas of \nlegislative possibility. We covered 15 of those in the act and part of \nthe other two.\n  The subcommittee and full committee held a total of 6 hearings that \nconsisted of 25 witnesses who helped us identify critical areas \nrelating to export controls as well. We also met with various high-tech \nand industry groups. We met with several Members of Congress. I have \nmentioned the Departments we met with, and a lot of the other executive \nagencies it seems have some involvement in exports and securities or \nboth, and we met with them as well.\n  We also had an opportunity to meet with many people in the business \ncommunity. It has been my goal to have an open-door policy for \neveryone, and we will continue that policy through the time the bill \nfinally gets passage. Throughout the hearings held this year on the \nExport Administration Act, there were many calls to reauthorize the \nexpired act. Only a few people have questioned the need for us to \nreauthorize that act. They asked what problems have been identified \nwith the current system.\n  There are several reasons for reauthorizing the Export Administration \nAct. The first is the U.S. Government's inability to convince other \ncountries, even our strongest allies, to improve their export control \nregimes. Only if the EAA is reauthorized can the United States exercise \na legitimate leadership role to strengthen the multilateral export \ncontrols that seek to curb dangerous dual-use items. We cannot do it by \nourselves; we have to have help from other countries. Our ability to \nconvince other countries to impose similar controls on their exports is \ncompromised by the fact that Congress has allowed the EAA to expire.\n\n[[Page S13219]]\n\n  In our June 24 hearing, Richard Cupitt, who is the associate director \nof the Center for International Trade and Security, agreed with this \nassessment by saying:\n\n       The inability of the U.S. Government to craft a firm \n     legislative foundation for its own controls on the export of \n     dual-use goods, technologies, and services over the last \n     decade. . .has compromised U.S. leadership initiatives.\n\n  Another reason for the reauthorization is the lack of penalties for \nviolations of export controls under the implementing Executive order--\nvery strict. If the outdated EAA of 1979 had stiffer penalties than the \nExecutive order's maximum penalty of $10,000, we would be in better \nshape. A reauthorization will also give enforcement officers the \nauthority to use the tools they need to be effective.\n  I now have a person on my staff, who has been loaned to us, who has \nbeen working on the export enforcement, so we can make sure enforcement \nwill be adequate. She has run some numbers for us on some of the \nindictments that have been handed down on things that happened during \nthis period between 1994 and now. You have heard some of those \nnumbers--16 indictments, potential fine of $132,000 on a contract that \nwas $5.4 million. A microdot in the budget--less than the advertising \nbudget spent. Fines need to be increased.\n  Additionally, it is important we deal with the issue of export \ncontrols in a comprehensive reauthorization instead of allowing some \nissues to be addressed by a patchwork of inadequate measures. I suspect \nover the next few days and over the next few months, if we do not get \nthis passed, you will see parts of the bill that solve a particular \nproblem put on as an amendment to something else to take care of an \nimmediate critical need. There are a lot of them involved in the bill.\n  There is a very delicate balance that is maintained through this \nbill. All of it needs to go through together. If one person gets \neverything he or she wants, there is no reason to participate in the \nrest of the bill. All of them have worked together to make sure their \ninterests were covered as well as being able to live with the other \ninterests involved here.\n  We have received great cooperation from the administration because \nthey understand the need to reauthorize the Act. Under Secretary \nReinsch has even said:\n\n       The EAA is held together right now by duct tape and bailing \n     wire.\n\n  It is also questionable whether export controls are permitted under \nthe International Economic Emergency Powers Act.\n  The bill before us today represents a compilation of thoughtful \ncomments gathered from industry, the administration, Members of \nCongress, on and off of the committee. However, it is not a hodgepodge \nof conflicting ideas and competing interests. The bill is interwoven \nwith several basic themes throughout: Transparency, accountability, \ndeterrence, multilateral cooperation, and enforcement. It strikes a \nbalance by recognizing the need for export controls on very sensitive \nitems for national security purposes while relaxing those controls on \nitems that have foreign availability or mass market status and thus are \ndifficult to control effectively. It allows enforcement to concentrate \non what can be effectively enforced. It gives each of the departments \nand agencies an equal stake and a fair shake. The compromise for the \ninteragency dispute resolution process represents a fair procedure that \ndefaults to decision. Yet it provides any department's representative \nthe opportunity to appeal a decision without going through the \nbureaucratic hassle of convincing his or her boss of the need to appeal \na decision in a relatively limited amount of time.\n  Transparency, accountability: The reporting requirements in the EAA \nof 1999 instill accountability and transparency in the export control \nprocess and multilateral negotiations. The criteria for foreign policy \ncontrol provisions foster an accountable system, very similar to that \nin the EAA of 1979.\n  The bill encourages the administration to strengthen multilateral \nexport control regimes since multilateral controls are more effective. \nIt also maintains the sanctions provisions for those who violate \nmultilateral export control regimes and contribute to the proliferation \nof missile, chemical, or biological weapons.\n  The bill remains tough on terrorism, requiring licenses for the \nexport of certain items to countries designated as supporting \ninternational terrorism. Additionally, it includes penalties that deter \nviolations of export control law and the authorities to effectively \nenforce the provisions set forth in the bill.\n  It has been mentioned this is supported in a bipartisan way. This \nbill came out of the full Banking Committee unanimously. Our country \nneeds this bill, and the people on that committee recognize the need. \nThe more they were involved in it, the more they recognized the need.\n  I want to mention the patience the House folks have had during this \nprocess. The problem has been more deeply studied in the House, \nperhaps, than on the Senate side. The suggestions for what needed to be \ndone came from the House side, but they have been waiting, watching, \ndiscussing, following, and commenting on the process we have had on \nthis side. They have spent a lot of time with Senator Johnson and me, \nto see if the solutions we came up with met the suggestions they have \ngiven. They have waited, but they are ready to go.\n  This bill cannot be done piecemeal. It needs to be done immediately \nfor the security of our country and for the furtherance of our \ncommerce. I ask for your support.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Nevada for raising the consciousness \non this level and giving us an opportunity to comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Chair for recognizing me.\n  Mr. President, I want to comment on the legislation pending before \nthe Senate which is the Caribbean Basin Initiative trade bill along \nwith the African trade bill.\n  I remind my colleagues, it came out of the Senate Finance Committee \nwith a unanimous vote. In essence, we did it on a voice vote. At a time \nwhen this Congress and perhaps this Senate is becoming better known for \nwhat we have not done, we are presented with an opportunity to do \nsomething extremely significant in the area of trade for a large part \nof the world with which the United States deals.\n  When we write about what we did or did not do in this first session \nof this Congress, it will be clearly pointed out that we did not do \nSocial Security reform, as the Presiding Officer well knows, because of \nhis involvement in an effort to reform that system.\n  We did not do Medicare reform, as the speaker certainly knows, \nfollowing the efforts of the National Commission on Medicare.\n  We did not do campaign finance reform, and we all remember those \narguments.\n  We have not done Patients' Bill of Rights legislation because of the \ndifferences of opinion and the politics involved in that legislation.\n  I do not know of any environmental legislation that has worked its \nway through this body with a resounding vote of support, nor do I \nremember particularly any major education efforts that have been \nsuccessfully navigated through this body this year.\n  I have a great fear this body is becoming more known for what we have \nnot done rather than what we have done. I wonder what the American \npeople think of the distinguished Members of this body with whom I have \nthe privilege of serving and why we cannot get together and work out \nour differences in the interest of the American public. Why do we spend \nso much of our time debating whose fault it is that nothing is getting \ndone as opposed to working together? We can always have the debate over \nwho did it. At least under those circumstances we would be arguing \nabout success: Look what we did; no, look what we did, rather than \narguing about failure and whose fault it is that nothing was done.\n  We have one last opportunity of great significance in this Congress \nto pass legislation that is bipartisan in its origination, that is \nstrongly supported by the administration, which, when it came before \nthe Senate Finance Committee after the hearings and after the debate, \nwe reported out by a voice vote.\n  The question then becomes: What is the problem now? Some will argue \nit is the Republicans' fault because they\n\n[[Page S13220]]\n\nhave filled up the tree. That ought to go over well in my State of \nLouisiana when I tell people we did not pass this bill because the \nRepublicans filled up the tree. They are going to say: What in the \nworld are you talking about?\n  I daresay some are going to say: We did not complete action on this \nbill because we were not able to offer amendments to it in the nature \nof other important efforts, such as minimum wage or agricultural \nprovisions, or other trade legislation that some want to offer. Because \nthey cannot offer it now, we are not going to continue our progress on \nthis legislation.\n  I daresay, the American people would say: What in the world are you \ntalking about?\n  Here is a trade bill that affects U.S. jobs, U.S. industry; it helps \npeople who have been loyal to the United States in other parts of the \nworld. It clearly helps Central American nations which not too many \nyears ago were Marxist countries, Communist dictatorships that have \ngradually been brought into the family of nations with the assistance \nof the United States, and we want to continue having their support on \nthings that are important for the people of this country.\n  This legislation is a way of doing that--by working out bilateral \ntrade agreements with these countries to the south of us that will help \nthem economically. When we help them economically, they help us. When \ncountries in Central America can do a little bit better economically, \nthey buy more of what we produce.\n  From my own State of Louisiana, they could buy more rice, more \nsoybeans, more manufactured goods. They would ship it through the Port \nof New Orleans, the Port of Baton Rouge, and the Port of Lake Charles \nbecause they have more money and better jobs. They are helped and we \nare helped. It is a win-win situation.\n  The question is: Why don't we do it? What is the problem? The problem \nis politics. The problem is political posturing about whose fault it is \nthat it is not getting done. Most of the debate is going to be why we \ndid not do it and blame each other for failure. Then, again, the \nAmerican people are going to say: What in the world are they talking \nabout?\n  My State is particularly affected by this. I have heard arguments \nthat it is bad for American jobs. My State has lost thousands of jobs \nin the stitch-and-sew industry. It used to be in Louisiana that \nthousands of minimum wage employees, many of them minorities, were \nworking in the stitch-and-sew industry for many of these large \ncompanies that manufacture items we are talking about today. Many of \nthem were arbitrarily dismissed, arbitrarily fired. Many of them lost \ntheir jobs right before Christmas a couple of years ago when most of \nthe companies moved out of my State and went to Central American and \nLatin American countries and located down there. That has already \nhappened. It did not happen because of this bill. This bill was not \nbeing considered then. It happened because of the existing state of the \nworld.\n  I have worked with our people. We have helped them find other jobs. \nFortunately, because of the economic conditions of our State and the \neconomic conditions of the United States, the vast majority of these \npeople who lost jobs in the so-called stitch-and-sew industry have \nfound jobs in more sophisticated, if I can use that term, industries in \nthe United States that represent the future of the United States in \nterms of jobs in the high-tech industries as opposed to something like \nstitch and sew.\n  What we have been able to do is use some of the training programs and \nretrain these people to get them into other manufacturing segments, to \nget them into high technology, to get them into computers, to get them \njobs where they now find they are much better off than they were \nsitting behind a sewing machine stitching and sewing underwear.\n  I argue the future of U.S. employees is not in the stitch-and-sew \nindustry. If we have to somehow preserve jobs in the stitch-and-sew \nbusiness, we are not being very bullish on America. I argue that is not \nthe future of this country. The future of this country is highly \ntrained men and women who can do the jobs for the 21st century, and \nthat is not in the stitch-and-sew industry.\n  It is interesting. I love my dear friend and colleague from South \nCarolina who was reading this article in Time about how these companies \nhave, in fact, moved out of the United States. He is absolutely right. \nOne of the things I noticed when I was looking at the article the \ndistinguished junior Senator from South Carolina was pointing out is \nthe article had a picture of the State of Kentucky, and the caption \nunder the article is: ``Fruit of the Loom eliminated more than 7,000 \njobs in the past 6 years. Here would-be workers attend a job fair held \nby new arrival Amazon.com.''\n  That is particularly important because it says that while stitch-and-\nsew jobs are moving out of this country, high-tech jobs, better jobs, \nbetter paying jobs, more sophisticated jobs, jobs that require more \ntraining and a better educated workforce are moving in.\n  The people who were leaving the Fruit of the Loom jobs were moving, \non the other hand, into jobs that Amazon.com was providing in that area \nusing those workers and retraining them for the 21st century.\n  That, I argue, is the future of the United States. The future workers \nof this country are not going to sit behind a sewing machine. If that \nis the future of this country, I daresay it is not a very bright \nfuture. The future is highly trained jobs in highly technical \nindustries which pay well and have a future.\n  We are not going to be able to compete with the poorest of the poor \nin terms of who can pay the lowest wages. We should be concentrating on \neducating our workers for the 21st century and then, at the same time, \ntrying to do what we can in the textile industry.\n  The reason I believe it is so very important and necessary to pass \nthis bill is because we say in this trade bill, particularly in the \ntextile industry: Look, we are not going to have the stitch-and-sew \njobs, but, by God, we are the best manufacturer of textiles and cloth \nand fabric.\n  We have the best technical ability to weave and dye the fabric. And \nthis bill, for the first time, says: Look, if we are going to give \nthese countries some advantages, at least we want it to be a two-way \nstreet, to at least say, if you are going to be able to do these \nproducts in your country, with lower paying jobs, at least use fabric \nthat is manufactured and woven and dyed and assembled in this country. \nWe will send it to you. We will manufacture the fabric, you will use \nthose fabrics to manufacture garments, and then you have the ability to \nexport those products back to this country.\n  Mexico can do it now. China will be able to do it. Unless we have \nsomething like this, we are not going to get any part of the business.\n  This legislation, when it talks about the products that are covered, \nclearly says: Apparel articles assembled in the Caribbean basin and \nsub-Sahara Africa from fabrics wholly formed and cut in the United \nStates from yarns wholly formed in the United States.\n  What that says to the cotton farmers in my State of Louisiana and \nthroughout the South is that we are going to use their cotton. Without \nthis legislation, we are not going to be using their cotton. The fabric \nwill come from overseas, as well as the finished product. At least this \nlegislation says we will use their cotton.\n  This legislation also says it has to be assembled in this country. It \nhas to be woven in this country. If it is going to have a color to it, \nit is going to have to be dyed in this country. So we are getting \nsomething out of this that we do not have now, that in the absence of \nthis legislation we will not have. Therefore, I think it is very clear \nthis is something that is important to do. The House thought it was.\n  You talk about how bad the House is divided. The House passed this \n234-163. Now it is before this body. For those who argue they don't \nlike the process, I don't like the process, either. I would probably \nlike to offer a Medicare reform bill to this legislation. People are \nlooking for a wagon to jump on to get something passed they would like \nto have passed. I understand that. The problem is that you are \naffecting the merits of good legislation that was bipartisan when it \nleft the Senate Finance Committee, that passed by voice vote in the \nSenate Finance Committee, and that merits our support.\n  So my point is that other countries are going to benefit, but we are \ngoing\n\n[[Page S13221]]\n\nto benefit. If we do not have this legislation, other countries will be \nable to have access to our market with no requirements on using U.S. \nfabric at all. I think we owe it to the workers of this country who are \nstill engaged in some aspect of this industry to come up with a fair \nproduct and fair package like this is.\n  I intend to support this legislation. I think it is the right thing \nto do. I hope my colleagues will join me in that effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo).

Mr. President, I am going to speak a few minutes about an \nissue that is very important to me; that is, the condition of school \nbuildings with the federal impact aid, particularly on the school \nbuildings on Indian reservations which are in very dire condition. I \nhope there is something we can do about it.\n  As you know, there have been many bills introduced in this Congress \nto try to help school districts and make sure school districts have \nenough funds for school construction and renovation, modernization, and \nso forth. But as you also know, when schools try to raise money, \nbasically they do so by bonding, which is paid for by local property \ntaxes. That is essentially the way schools in our country are financed; \nit is a time-honored approach to school construction.\n  The problem is, in this heated debate, one group of children is \ncontinually left out in the cold; that is, students who live on \nfederally owned land, usually on an Indian reservation or a military \ninstallation.\n  In my State of Montana, there are about 12,000 children who fall into \nthis category; that is, children who live on a military installation or \non an Indian reservation, where there is either none or there is very \nlittle private property to support school funding, particularly school \nconstruction. These schools are located in areas where much of the \nlocal property just cannot be taxed. Why is that? Because it is Federal \nproperty.\n  In many cases, the local schools have to educate the children of the \nfamilies who live on the property, and these are so-called Federal \nstudents who could come from military families, from civilian families, \nor could come from Native American families. Some schools are off \nreservations, but a lot of the kids live on reservations, and vice \nversa. This causes a tremendous problem in financing school \nconstruction.\n  I believe we have a responsibility. After all, the Federal Government \nhas a trustee responsibility with respect to Indian reservations. More \nthan that, more fundamentally, we have a moral obligation to be sure \nall children in our country have not only equal access to education but \ngenerally have the same accessibility to good schools and relatively \nup-to-date schools. We are not asking for the Taj Mahal but just basic \nsolid construction.\n  Congress has recognized its responsibility in many respects for these \nschools through payments authorized under title VIII of the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act. That is the impact aid provision. These \ndistricts are supposed to receive impact aid to compensate school \ndistricts for the burden of educating children whose parents do not \nhave to pay local property taxes due to Federal activities; namely, \nbecause they live on an installation or an Indian reservation.\n  The bulk of the impact aid payments do help with salaries and \nutilities and other day-to-day costs of running the schools, but this \nis the catch: When it comes to replacement or renovation of buildings, \nthese schools still have an additional problem; that is, impact aid \ncannot begin to pay both the salaries and utility bills and the day-to-\nday costs, and also pay for the modernization of schools because they \njust cannot issue the construction bonds to pay for them.\n\n  There have been several bills introduced in this body dealing with \nschool construction, but none of them deal with this problem; that is, \nthe problem of impact aid on reservations and installations.\n  I am asking for something that is pretty simple. I am asking for a \nslight increase, from the present $7 million that goes to impact aid \nschool construction to $50 million. That is all. That is not very much \nmoney. Mr. President, $7 million is currently spent on impact aid \nschool construction, and I am asking that it be raised to $50 million. \nVery simple.\n  I can give lots of stories, lots of examples, of just the dire \nconditions these school districts face. For example, I talked to the \nsuperintendent of the Harlem school district. Harlem is in north \ncentral Montana. He says his district is so crowded that his students \nare now using a closet. Guess what was in that closet. In that closet \nwas a snowblower that they hauled out whenever there was a bad \nsnowstorm.\n  So that closet is now a classroom. The snowblower is out in the hall. \nThe students are in the closet. I think this is not right. It is no \nplace to put kids. There is no place to put kids in the closet of a \nschool and put the equipment out in the hallway. In addition, if they \ntry to bring in a portable classroom, then there would be no \nplayground. That is just not right.\n  A few days ago, I received a letter from the principal of the \nelementary school in Box Elder, MT. His student population is growing \nvery rapidly because there is new housing on the nearby Rocky Boy \nIndian Reservation. In fact, virtually all of the 300 or so students in \nhis school are Federal students.\n  He has classrooms in portable buildings and in basement rooms with no \nwindows and only one exit door. He tells me he would be afraid to send \nhis own small children to that school, but he has to. This is a \ndisgrace.\n  Last year, the Box Elder school received--get this--$13,000 in \nFederal impact aid construction funding; $13,000, that is all.\n  That is about the average for schools in this situation. I might say, \n$13,000 is a pittance. That is not even enough for half of a paint job \nin the school, let alone for reasonable reconstruction or renovation.\n  I have some photos I would like to display. These photos are \nrepresentative of not only my State but could represent almost any \nState in the Nation that has Federal impact aid. This is a picture of \nan out-of-code electric installation at Babb Elementary School in \nBrowning. There are no fire sprinklers in the basement where the \ninsulation is located. Over in the left corner, we see a socket and \nwiring dangling. It is uncovered. It is obviously a fire hazard. This \nis all they can do.\n  Now I have another photograph of a doorway at Babb. This is a doorway \nin the school. This photo doesn't begin to represent how bad the \nsituation is. Sometimes pictures overstate something. In this case, the \nphotograph understates.\n  The next photo is that of a lunchroom. This is down in the basement \nof the school. Again, it doesn't look all that bad; but I have been \nthere; it is worse. Then there is a photo taken in the local high \nschool in the same community. There is a leaky ceiling. Things are \nstarting to fall apart. Again, this school can't find the money to pay \nfor it.\n  Imagine for a moment that we in the Senate met in a facility that \nlooked like this or our offices were in rooms such as this or we had \nelectrical equipment so obviously out of code. We would change it. We \nwould do something very quickly because we wouldn't stand for it.\n  What kind of message does this send to children throughout our \ncountry--the message that we don't have enough respect for them, enough \nrespect for their parents, enough respect for education to do something \nabout this. We have a huge Federal surplus and the biggest, most \nwealthy country in the world. Yet we turn our back on a lot of kids in \nour country. Obviously, it is to their peril but even more to the peril \nof our country.\n  The bill I will introduce will raise the authorization from $7 \nmillion to $50 million--not very much but a first step that is needed. \nWe also make a change in the eligibility rules. Right now schools with \npopulations made up of 70, 80, or even 100 percent Federal students \ncannot ask for impact aid construction\n\n[[Page S13222]]\n\nfunds if the percentage of the federally impacted population for the \nwhole district is less than 50 percent. That is, obviously, a standard \nthat is much too high.\n  The bill introduced by me and Senator Hagel will decrease the \ndistrict minimum to 25 percent. That will affect a lot of schools in \nthis district.\n  I have a chart that shows how many States would be affected by \nchanging the eligibility standard from 50 percent to 25 percent. You \ncan see that virtually every State in the Nation would be affected, \nwhich means every State gets a little bit, if it is enacted at the $43 \nmillion increase from the current $7 to $50 million.\n  This is obviously a problem in our State. It is obviously a problem \nin other heavy Federal impact aid States, such as Nebraska, Senator \nHagel's State. But this isn't a parochial problem. This isn't a \npartisan problem. This is a national problem.\n  I ask that we step up to the plate, exercise our responsibility and, \nwhen we take up the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, make this \nchange so that a needy portion of our school population gets a modicum \nof assistance. Then after that, I hope we can go further.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/27/senate-section/article/S13222-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13222-S13243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             AFRICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT--Continued\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the trade \nlegislation package which constitutes the manager's amendment to H.R. \n434, the African Growth and Opportunity Act. This trade legislation \nwill provide economic opportunity to millions of people in the United \nStates and throughout the world.\n  Under this package, African and Caribbean nations will be able to use \ntrade as a tool to spur economic development where foreign aid and \nother means clearly have not worked. Stronger economies in these two \nregions of the world will, in turn, lead to bigger markets for U.S. \nexports, and consequently more and better paying jobs for American \nworkers.\n  On the issue of open foreign markets for U.S. products, I would like \nto express my support for an amendment on carousel retaliation being \noffered by my colleague from Ohio, Senator DeWine. If the newly formed \nWorld Trade Organization and the promise of a rules-based system of \ninternational trade is to survive, then we cannot--and should not--\ntolerate flagrant disregard for internationally agreed trading rules by \nother WTO members such as the European Union. We need to use the tools \nthat are now available to us to ensure that our trading partners comply \nwith WTO decisions. And its important to those of us who believe in \nfree trade that the U.S. Trade Representative and the Department of \nCommerce use all the tools available to them to guarantee that we have \nfair trade. Too often we have amendments like Senator DeWine's \namendment-- which I have co-sponsored--because the U.S. trade \nrepresentative has not been as aggressive as they should be and they do \nnot use the tools they have been given by Congress.\n  This is very important, because trade is the economic lifeblood of \nthe United States. Twelve million American jobs depend directly on \nexports. And exports are a major reason why our economy continues to do \nso well. In fact, one-third of our economic growth since 1992 can be \nattributed directly to exports.\n  Ohio is a textbook example of why international trade is good for \nAmerica. When I was Governor, I had four goals in the area of economic \ndevelopment--agribusiness, science and technology, tourism and \ninternational trade. We pursued each of these aggressively in order to \nmaximize Ohio's business potential, especially in the trade arena.\n  For example, Ohio has outperformed the nation in terms of the growth \nof exports to our NAFTA trading partners. Since 1993, U.S. exports to \nCanada have grown 54 percent and U.S. exports to Mexico have grown 90 \npercent, while Ohio exports to Canada have grown 64 percent and Ohio \nexports to Mexico have grown 101 percent.\n  Thanks in part to such trade-liberalizing agreements as NAFTA and the \nUruguay Round of GATT, overall Ohio exports have risen 103 percent in \njust the last decade.\n  And because export-related jobs tend to require higher-skilled \nworkers and provide higher-paying salaries, when America's exports of \ngoods and services increase, so do the number and quality of American \njobs. Just in Ohio, the increase in exports has created 182,000 jobs \nover the past ten years. And these export-related jobs tend to pay, on \naverage, 15% more than a typical private sector job.\n  Eliminating trade barriers has not only helped Ohio companies sell \nmore overseas, but it has also allowed more foreign companies to invest \nin Ohio, creating more, good paying jobs for Ohioans. According to Site \nSelection magazine, from 1991-1997, Ohio had more growth in non-U.S. \nowned firms than any other state--some 300 new manufacturing facilities \nand plant expansions took place during that time.\n  In addition to creating more, better-paying jobs, trade openness has \nan enormous impact on the earnings for average Americans who invest in \ncompanies that increase their international trade presence. These \nearnings help increase the amount of money people have to reinvest in \nthe growth of our economy or to invest in their savings, retirement and \neducation funds.\n  This chart lists 35 of the biggest U.S. corporations as measured in \nmarket value. None of these companies is majority-owned by a family or \nindividual. In other words, they are all in the stock market. For 25 of \nthese 35 companies, trade makes up more than one-third of their global \noperations, and for 12 of these companies, international trade accounts \nfor more than half of global sales or revenues--including Cincinnati-\nbased Procter and Gamble, which can attribute about 51 percent of its \nglobal sales to international operations. Thus, in the case of Procter \nand Gamble, there is a genuine interest on the part of thousands of \nemployees, and even more thousands of individual shareholders, in the \nability to expand internationally.\n  In my State of Ohio, there are many more companies that understand \nthat robust two-way trade is the key to creating more jobs and \nincreased investment. These are companies like--Cincinnati Milacron, \nFederated, American Electric Power, The Limited, Inc. and Intimate \nBrands, TRW Inc., Chiquita Brands, The Andersons, Battelle, \nElectraForm, General Electric Jet Engines, Lincoln Electric, NCR, R.G. \nBarry Corporation and hundreds of other small businesses, many of which \ntraveled with me when I was governor, on nine trade missions around the \nworld.\n  In Ohio and across America, the future of companies like these is a \ncrucial link to the vitality of our communities because of the jobs \nthey support and their contribution to the local tax base. In addition, \nthese companies provide philanthropic support to local hospitals, \nschools and colleges and universities as well as countless charities \nand institutions.\n  The support these companies provide is linked directly to the overall \nquality of life in many of our communities. For example, Atlanta would \nbe a much different city without the civic and charitable contributions \nof a company like Coca-Cola. Companies like Coca Cola--their workers, \ntheir stockholders--know that 95% of their potential customers for \ntheir products live outside the United States, and that's why trade \nexpansion is so fundamental to the economic future of all Americans.\n  Many of my colleagues may ask why the average American should care \nabout the importance of trade and the expansion of markets overseas. \nThe reason they should care is because it's average Americans who are \nthe stakeholders--the millions upon millions of individual investors.\n  Indeed, according to a survey in this past Sunday's Washington Post, \nnearly half of all Americans are invested in the stock market. Twenty-\ntwo million American households, or roughly 22%, are invested in \ncorporate America through employer-sponsored retirement plans. And \nthose Americans referred to as ``Generation X''--individuals in their \n20s--reportedly hold 80 percent of their assets in stocks. Baby \nboomers, who own about half of all outstanding stock, have about 57 \npercent of their assets in equities.\n\n[[Page S13223]]\n\n  As these figures show, international trade does matter to the average \nAmerican. The economic stimulus sparked through increased international \ntrade and investment allows millions of Americans to plan for their \nchildren's college education, for retirement nest eggs and for long-\nterm financial security.\n  While the passage of this legislation is important to the economic \nfuture of America's workers and citizen stock-holders, it will also \nprovide a lasting impact on the economic and political development of \nour African and Central American trading partners--an impact that is \nsure to fulfill our hopes for world peace and prosperity.\n  With respect to increased U.S. trade and investment in the nations of \nAfrica and the Caribbean, it is far better to stimulate the economies \nof the nations of these two regions than to simply offer these nations \nforeign aid year after year. Increasing investment and trade \nopportunities in these regions means that more people can work and \nraise their own standard of living.\n  It's like the old adage ``give a man a fish, and he eats for a day. \nTeach a man to fish, and he will eat for a lifetime.''\n  International trade not only allows nations to become productive \nmembers of the world community, but it is probably the best way to \nensure international stability.\n  In fact, back in 1994, U.N. Secretary General Boutrous Boutrous-Ghali \nvisited Columbus, Ohio and I said to him that ``nations that trade \ntogether, stay together and help sustain world peace.''\n  Promoting peace and prosperity through trade was one of the aspects I \npursued on each of my nine foreign trade missions when I was Governor \nof Ohio, including trips to India, Thailand, Chile, Hungary and China.\n  Unfortunately, that particular aspect of international trade is too \noften ignored. We ignore the impact of international trade on stability \nand peace in the world.\n  What amazes me, Mr. President, is that so many so called \nprotectionists lament about deplorable conditions in the world's poor \nnations, and this Nation, the United States of America, doesn't respond \nto the needs of people in Africa and other parts of the world. Yet it \nis these protectionists who are content to criticize free trade \nproponents for wanting to take down trade barriers, invest in poorer \nnations, and provide the tools for economic growth, jobs, and self-\nreliance in those countries. There is no way the U.S. Government can \nprovide the billions of dollars needed for these countries to develop \nand raise the standard of living for their people. It can only be done \nthrough private investment. The leaders of 47 African nations know this \nfact, and that is why they want us to support this trade measure.\n  As Senator Breaux pointed out earlier today, international trade also \ncontributes to the political stability of the countries in the world. \nThink about what has happened in South America since we opened up our \neconomic relationships with them over the last number of years.\n  This trade legislation will help drive an economic expansion in \nAfrica, as well as for our neighbors in the Caribbean and Central \nAmerica. In addition, it will provide for the future of an energetic, \nexport-driven American economy. It will sustain and create good-paying, \nhigh-quality jobs in Ohio and across America and allow millions of \nAmericans to save and invest for their children's education and their \nretirement security. This legislative package stands on its own merits. \nIt was unanimously reported out of the committee, and I really believe \nit deserves the support of our colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I came momentarily to the floor to hear \nmy distinguished colleague from Louisiana try to justify that Bill \nFarley article in Time magazine, which I referred to earlier. His \njustification, of course, was not the matter of campaign finance \nreform, which is the major thrust of the article; interestingly, the \nthrust that, look, we ought to be getting rid of these jobs, says that \nthese textile workers now can go to the high-skilled, better-paying \njobs, and that is the future of America.\n  Let me go right to the other comment made by my distinguished \ncolleague from New York, who joined with it, about trade adjustment \nassistance, and what a wonderful program it is. Thirty-seven years ago, \nas he said, as Dean Acheson would say, he was at the table. He is \nright. He had a distinguished career of service there as the Assistant \nSecretary of Labor negotiating the trade adjustment assistance \nagreement. Everybody will agree with that.\n  But 38 years ago, I was at the table, and I was at the table for the \nseven-point textile program of President Kennedy. It was a very \ninteresting exercise because what we had found out was that they were \nreally about to do away with the industry, we thought, when it included \nsome 10-percent import penetration. I had come up to testify before the \nold International Trade Commission, and testifying before that \nInternational Trade Commission, we thought we had made a good \nimpression.\n  At that particular time, 38 years ago, we were confronted with Tom \nDewey, who was then representing the Japanese. He chased me all around \nthe hearing room, and my friend, Charlie Daniel, at that time an \noutstanding contractor/builder/civic leader, says: Now, Governor, let's \ngo by and see the chief. That was President Eisenhower. We called on \nWilton B. Parsons, and Jerry Parsons ushered us in and President \nEisenhower said: Don't worry, you will win that case.\n  In June, the International Trade Commission ruled against us. At that \nparticular time, we realized we were totally lost unless we could get \ninvolved in the campaign, which wasn't too difficult because then-\nSenator John F. Kennedy from Massachusetts understood very clearly the \nimportance of the textile jobs.\n  I am going right back to the Senator from Louisiana saying the future \nof the country is to get rid of these jobs. I am laying the groundwork \nof the historical record about the importance and the significance of \nthese jobs.\n  The case was in talking to then-Senator Kennedy. We met with him. And \nmy friend, Mr. Feldman, was his legislative assistant. We obtained a \nletter on August 30, 1960. You can imagine, this was in the heat of the \n1960 campaign between Kennedy and Nixon.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 30, 1960.\n     Hon. Ernest Hollings,\n     Governor of the State of South Carolina, State Capitol \n         Building, Columbia, SC.\n       Dear Governor Hollings: I would, of course, be delighted to \n     discuss with you and with textile industry leaders the \n     problems of the textile industry and the development of \n     constructive methods for showing the growth and prosperity of \n     the industry in the future. The critical import situation \n     that confronts the textile industry which you so eloquently \n     describe in your letter is one with which I am familiar. My \n     own State of Massachusetts has suffered and is suffering from \n     the same conditions. The past few years have been \n     particularly difficult for this industry. There seems to have \n     been a basic unwillingness to meet the problem and deal \n     constructively with it. During the first six months of this \n     year imports of cotton cloth are twice what they were during \n     the same period in 1959, the highest year on record. \n     Similarly alarming increases are occurring on other textile \n     and apparel products. Since 1958 imports have exceeded \n     exports by constantly increasing margins. There are now \n     400,000 less jobs in the industry than there were 10 years \n     ago. It is no longer possible to depend upon makeshift \n     policies and piecemeal remedies to solve the problems which \n     the industry faces.\n       As you know, I supported the establishment of the Special \n     Senate Sub-committee for the Textile Industry, under the \n     chairmanship of Senator Pastore, of which Senator Strom \n     Thurmond is a member. In an effort to help develop \n     suggestions to improve the competitive position of the \n     industry in the United States and world markets, this \n     Subcommittee for the first time undertook a broad \n     investigation of the problems of the United States textile \n     industry and offered a number of constructive \n     recommendations. With only minor exceptions, the Eisenhower \n     Administration has failed to implement these recommendations.\n       I agree with the conclusions of the Pastore Committee that \n     sweeping changes in our foreign trade policies are not \n     necessary. Nevertheless, we must recognize that the textile \n     and apparel industries are of international scope and are \n     peculiarly susceptible to competitive pressure from imports. \n     Clearly the problems of the industry will not disappear\n\n[[Page S13224]]\n\n     by neglect nor can we wait for large scale unemployment and \n     shutdown of the industry to inspire us to action. A \n     comprehensive industry-wide remedy is necessary.\n       The outline of such a remedy can be found in the Report of \n     the Pastore Committee. Imports of textile products, including \n     apparel, should be within limits which will not endanger our \n     own existing textile capacity and employment, and which will \n     permit growth of the industry in reasonable relationship to \n     the expansion of our over-all economy.\n       We are pledged in the Democratic Platform to combat sub-\n     standard wages abroad through the development of \n     international fair labor standards. Effort along this line is \n     of special importance to the United States textile industry.\n       The office of the Presidency carries with it the authority \n     and influence to explore and work out solutions within the \n     framework of our foreign trade policies for the problems \n     peculiar to our textile and apparel industry. Because of the \n     broad ramifications of any action and because of the \n     necessity of approaching a solution in terms of total needs \n     of the textile industry, this is a responsibility which only \n     the President can adequately discharge. I can assure you that \n     the next Democratic Administration will regard this as a high \n     priority objective.\n       Additionally, we shall make vigorous use of the procedures \n     provided by Congress such as Section 22 of the Agricultural \n     Adjustment Act and the Escape Clause in accordance with the \n     intention of Congress in enacting these laws.\n       Lastly, I assure you that should further authority be \n     necessary to enable the President to carry out these \n     objectives, I shall request such authorization from the \n     Congress.\n       I hope that these thoughts are helpful to you in your own \n     deliberations and I reaffirm my interest in discussing \n     problems of mutual concern with you.\n       With all good wishes, I am\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                  John F. Kennedy.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in the letter he said he supported the \nspecial Senate subcommittee of the textile industry under the \nchairmanship of Senator Pastore. He said he agreed with the conclusions \nof the Pastore committee that sweeping changes in our Federal trade \npolicy were not necessary:\n\n       Nevertheless, we must recognize that the textile and \n     apparel industries are international in scope and peculiarly \n     susceptible to competitive pressure from imports. The \n     problems of the industry will not disappear by neglect, nor \n     can we wait for a large-scale unemployment and shutdown to \n     inspire us to action. So a comprehensive industrywide remedy \n     is necessary.\n\n  They had a national security provision in the law at that particular \ntime. Before then-Senator Kennedy and later-President Kennedy could \nactually implement any kind of comprehensive industrywide remedy, he \nhad to have a finding that the industry was important to our national \nsecurity.\n  We brought the witnesses. It was a Cabinet committee that was formed \nfor the witnesses to attest to. It was Secretary Dean Rusk of the \nDepartment of State, Secretary McNamara with the Department of Defense, \nSecretary of Commerce Hodges, Secretary of Labor Goldberg, Secretary of \nthe Treasury Dillon, and Secretary of Agriculture Freeman, with whom I \nserved as Governor.\n  They had the hearings, and they concluded at the close of those \nhearings that next to steel, textiles was the second most important to \nour national security. In a line, you needed steel in order to make the \nweapons of war and the tools of agriculture. Therein lies the steel \nproblem, because that is the World Bank singsong. They run the world \naround telling these emerging Third World countries that they cannot \nbecome a nation state until at first they obtain a strong manufacturing \nsector, particularly in steel.\n  That is why, incidentally, you have the dumping. We have an \noverproduction in the world of steel. They are dumping here in the \nUnited States at less than cost. We have had the hearings, and they \nvoted on the House side. We tried to get a vote on this side and get \nthe bill passed for action by the White House itself.\n  But back to the second most important industry that I would like the \nSenator from Louisiana to remember, because I remember when he had a \nsubstantial investment by Fruit of the Loom down there in Louisiana \nbefore it left, and now it looks as if it has all gone to the Cayman \nIslands. But you couldn't send them to war in a Japanese uniform. This \nis back in 1960. Today, you might say a Chinese uniform, because the \nChinese have gone just 8 years ago from a $5 billion deficit in the \nbalance of trade to a $55 billion deficit in the balance of trade, \nmostly in textiles and clothing.\n  So we have to go to conflict with our friends in the People's \nRepublic. We have to call up Beijing and say: Wait a minute. Before we \nhave this standoff, please send us some uniforms because we have to be \nprepared in order to go to battle. We can't go in Chinese uniforms. We \nhave to be able to distinguish the troops.\n  As a result of that finding, then-President Kennedy, on April 24, \n1961, promulgated his seven-point program.\n  He did all of the things that dealt with that and followed on into \nthe Kennedy Round, as the distinguished Senator from New York has \npointed out, the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act, one-price cotton, and \nreciprocity, which stabilized the industry for several years ongoing \nuntil really the 1970s, and then, of course, the 1980s and early 1990s \nwith all the vetoes by President Reagan and President Bush. There has \njust been a deluge. With President Clinton, the deluge turned into a \nwaterfall more or less with NAFTA.\n  For those who say that these things, as the distinguished Senator \nfrom Ohio said, are going to create millions of jobs in the United \nStates and the world around, let us be accurate. It will create \nmillions of jobs in the world around. It is going to create millions of \n``jobless.'' We have lost over 1 million manufacturing jobs since NAFTA \nhere in the United States. There are 420,000 textile jobs lost all over \nthe country, 31,700 in the State of South Carolina alone.\n  There is no education in the second kick of a mule.\n  What we have on foot is another NAFTA without the advantages. At \nleast in NAFTA, we had the side agreements on labor rights. At least in \nNAFTA, we had the side agreements on the environment. At least in \nNAFTA, we had reciprocity.\n  Now this one-way street down to the Caribbean and over to the Sahara \nis totally out of the whole cloth. It will start a deluge. We know \nabout the Chinese and their influence in the sub-Sahara.\n  I will never forget, 5 years ago we had a resolution brought up about \nhuman rights. They had voted in the assembly to have hearings on human \nrights in the People's Republic of China. The Chinese representatives \nwent down into Africa where they have some influence. I was there 25 \nyears ago. They were building the railroad from inner Zaire, the old-\ntime Belgian Congo, out to the coast. They had their work crews all \nover, their minions all over. They have influence, and it was proved at \nthat time because they changed the vote. They never had that hearing \nthat the United Nations wanted to have on human rights in the People's \nRepublic.\n  We know, looking at Matsui, the shirts coming through at this moment \nfrom Matsui. There is not a shirt factory there. They have been \ninundating the American market.\n\n  We go to Customs. They say: Senator, they have been inundating the \nmarket, but we restrict it. Customs agents ask if we want to stop drugs \nor stop textiles. Of course, the obvious answer is, heavens, stop the \ndrugs. They say: Until you get the other agents, that is about all we \ncan try to keep up with.\n  The Customs Department has estimated $5 billion already in \ntransshipments, illegal entry of textile goods in the United States, as \nwe speak. We know the sub-Sahara is not going to benefit by it at all \nwith respect to the jobs. It is going to be similar to our minority \nbusiness enterprise section in the Department of Commerce. They \nimmediately got minority, a black front; then they got the white money \nand the folks behind it. And with the front, they make a lot of money \nand get the set-aside contracts through hard experience in Mexico.\n  I refer particularly to the fabric manufacturers down there. The \nSenator from Louisiana says we ought to be getting rid of the industry. \nWe ought to remember we are going to get something we didn't have \nbefore; namely, with all the cotton goods and everything else we are \nsending, our fabric and the apparel, shirts for example, will come back \nwith American-made fabric. That is what can come back free of duty, \nfree of restriction. But so can the Chinese-made fabrics. So can the \nTaiwanese. So can the Korean.\n  All one needs to do is cross the border at Tijuana in lower \nCalifornia into\n\n[[Page S13225]]\n\nMexico and one will think they are in Seoul, Korea. They are not at all \nbashful about investing there.\n  The Fabric Resource List of Mexico, appearing in Davison's blue book, \nI refer to pages 345 to 358 under Fabric Resource List.\n  Mr. President, we can see the opportunity and to whom it is being \ngiven. Very interestingly, the commitment when we passed NAFTA, from \nthe individuals at the time that the ATMI came in, they say they are \nnot going to take their plants down there.\n  I refer to an article in the Capital City's Media, back in 1993. The \nlead article and lead sentence of the article entitled ``Hell No, We \nWon't Go'':\n\n       That was the battle cry Monday by the directors of the \n     American Textile Manufacturers Institute, who in a last-ditch \n     effort to solidify congressional support for NAFTA, pledged \n     not to move any jobs to Mexico if the act was passed. The \n     ATMI board, made up of firms representing every facet of the \n     textile industry, voted 37-6 in favor of the resolution which \n     said companies would not move jobs, plants or facilities from \n     the United States to Mexico as a result of the North American \n     Free Trade Agreement.\n\n  Just in the past year Dan River built an integrated apparel \nmanufacturing plant in Mexico. Another U.S. corporation, Tarrant \nApparel purchased a denim mill in Pueblo, Mexico; DuPont and Alpek \nbuilt a plant in Altimira, Mexico, and formed a joint venture with \nTeijin; Guilford and Cone Mills created a Mexican industrial park known \nas Textile City; and Burlington Industries is to build a new Mexican \nplan to produce wool products.\n  It reminds me of John Mitchell, the former Attorney General. He said: \nWatch what we do, not what we say.\n  Now we know what they do. They go down into Mexico and they invest \nvery heavily. Our friend from Louisiana says the jobs are not important \nand they moved to higher skilled jobs. I know we have restrictions on \nthe importation of cotton because he says: Look at the cotton. They \nhave quota programs and they have payments they receive for the use of \nU.S. cotton. That goes back to the One Price Cotton Program we got way \nback under President Kennedy.\n  The statement made by the Senator from Louisiana is that we are going \nto get something that we didn't have. The Caribbean and sub-Sahara are \ngoing to get something they didn't have. We are going to lose. Yes, we \nhave protection for American cotton producers and they are buying from \nAmerican cotton producers. But if you go down into Mexico and the \nplants all go down there, they don't have to worry about coming back in \nwith respect to American-made fabric because they can go ahead and \nproduce it and bring it back in any way. We are going to be losing that \nbusiness. Last fall, they had section 807 and 809 and everything else \nthe companies themselves approved. That is not productive at all \nbecause they are moving down there. That is why they are moving the \nfabric plants. And there are no restrictions on those under the NAFTA \nagreement.\n  With respect to the export nature of the job, there is a book written \nby our friend, Eamonn Fingleton. He wrote the book some 10 years ago \nentitled ``Blind Side.'' He pointed out at that particular time that \nthe little country of 125 million Japanese was outproducing the 260 \nmillion productive Americans. In manufacturing today, Japan still \noutproduces us. They were talking about the growth of the economy \nbecause they know how to build up an economy.\n  Who predicted by the year 2000 the GNP, or gross domestic product, of \nJapan would exceed that of the richest United States of America? They \nstill could reach it in spite of the turndown of the banking industry \nand otherwise. They haven't yielded one bit on market share this past \nyear in spite of the turndown in the Japanese economy, the automobile \nindustry. The Japanese automobile industry has taken over again a \nlarger share of the American market. They continue to do so and they \ncontinue to invest here, as we know, because we have the Japanese \nplants in my State of South Carolina.\n  We continue to weaken what President Kennedy and others knew was \nnecessary to build a strong economy, as if resting on a three-legged \nstool. One leg is our values; that is unquestioned. The second leg is \nthe military strength, which is unquestioned--the remaining superpower. \nThe third leg, economics, having been fractured in the last 10 years. \nWe have gone from 26 percent of our workforce and manufacturing is down \nto 13 percent. We are losing and hollowing out the industrial center, \nthe middle class of America. I do not have the ratings of the \nparticular jobs they have at Amazon, but I have a good idea of it. I do \nnot believe they are paying as much at Amazon and these other \nindustries as they are in textiles. The average textile wage in the \nUnited States is around $8.37 an hour. The needle trades, Senator \nBreaux pointed out, in Kentucky, Fruit of the Loom eliminated more than \n7,000 jobs in the past 6 years. Here, ``Would-be workers attend a job \nfair held by the new arrival, Amazon.''\n\n  You do not stand in line to get a job at Microsoft. They have 22,000. \nYou stand at the bank or you stand at the country club. You have to not \nonly have the high intellect, but you have to have the connections. \nAnybody who is lucky enough to get a job at Microsoft, they ought to go \nsay their prayers at night and thank heavens because it is wonderful. \nEvery one of those 22,000 are millionaires.\n  That is not the jobs we are talking about, those superduper jobs. We \nare talking about the 250,000 working at General Motors. We are talking \nabout the 1.6 million still left, maybe 2 million--I can't get the \nexact figure--of textile jobs left in America. These jobs are important \nto our national economy. They not only have a national security portion \nof being able to produce the garments and the uniforms but more \nparticularly to maintain middle America. That is where it is so \nimportant. I am going to get the exact pay scale there. I know PSC \nCorporation, in my own capital city of Columbia, SC, has already \nshipped out some 500 jobs to India. I forget the exact name of the \ntown. But they can start up the computers in India and get the \ninformation back there, and they tell me my light bill is being \nprocessed over in India for me right now. That is the trend, the global \ncompetition. That is the global development. That is the reality. How \ndo we confront it? Do we maintain a strong manufacturing sector and \nstrengthen that economic leg to our national security?\n  Go right back to Alexander Hamilton in the earliest days. In the \nearliest days, you had that doctrine of market forces, comparative \nadvantage, and David Ricardo. That is what they said, Adam Smith--you \ngo ahead, the little fledgling colony that now had won its \nindependence, you produce best what you can and ship it back to the \nmother country and the mother country in turn will produce and ship \nback what we can produce best--the doctrine of comparative advantage.\n  Alexander Hamilton said, ``No way.'' He wrote the book, ``Reports On \nManufactures.'' In that particular book he told the Brits to bug off. \nHe said: We are not going to remain your colony.\n  As a result, the second bill that ever passed this national Congress, \nin which we stand this afternoon--the first being the U.S. seal--the \nsecond bill on July 4, 1789, was a tariff bill, protectionism of a 50-\npercent tariff on 60 different articles, including our iron and \ntextiles and other things we were beginning to build up--our \nmanufacturing capacity.\n  Now we hear, to my amazement, the cry on the floor of the Senate: Get \nrid of it. We are going to become a service economy. We are going to \nhave nothing but software. We are going to have millionaires and \ncountry clubs and bread lines and that is going to be America. They had \nthat right after World War II. They told the Brits: Don't worry. \nInstead of a nation of brawn, we are going to be a nation of brains. \nInstead of producing products, we will provide services. Instead of \ncreating wealth, we are going to handle it, become a financial center.\n  The mother country has gone to hell in an economic handbasket. London \nis nothing more than an amusement park. They do have the two levels of \nsociety and they put it on every night on educational TV, public \ntelevision: ``Upstairs Downstairs.'' Everybody grins and smiles and \nsays: Oh, those were wonderful days. We can all be maids and servants \nin the kitchen or we can be plantation owners. That is where we are \nheaded. That is where we are headed with this cry of ``free trade, free \ntrade,'' that is enunciated by everybody who does not have an interest \nin the future of the United States.\n\n[[Page S13226]]\n\n  That ``everybody'' includes the banks. They first financed these \ncompanies, these multinationals, under the Marshall Plan that we sent \noverseas. Then the think tanks and consultants, then the lawyers, then \nthe retailers. ``You can get a cheaper product,'' and everything else \nof that kind. Then the consumer groups and what have you. So they all \ncome in and say ``free trade, free trade,'' until you get to \nintellectual property and ``Oh, no, wait a minute. We have to have \ntrademarks; we have to have copyright; we have to have protectionism.''\n  They are for protectionism. Jack Valenti in the movies, he will run \nover here and knock down the desks and everything else. Wait a minute, \nHollywood is the biggest protectionist center in the world; \nprotectionism, as they spew out their violence. They killed our TV \nviolence bill momentarily. We keep coming back and we will bring it \nback again. But I can tell you here and now they want protectionism for \nthe banks, for the insurance companies, for the rich, for the software \npeople but nothing for the sweat of the brow. That is what gets me, \nwhen the Senator from Louisiana says now what we need to do is go get a \nhigh-skilled, better paying job. That is the future of America.\n  There is a different future. I hate to disabuse his mind on that \nparticular score. There is a book written about this. As Fingleton \npoints out now in his more recent book, ``In Praise of Hard \nIndustries,'' he takes down, chapter and verse: With respect to \nexports, there is no contribution whatsoever. It is almost negligible. \nThe idea of the software and the high-tech industry --in fact, it was \ngoing broke itself in semiconductors until, what did we do? We gave \nthem aid. We put in Sematech and we put in voluntary restraint \nagreements--give President Reagan credit for that--to save that \nparticular industry, or you would not be seeing any Intel on that stock \nmarket, going up yesterday. The Government gave it a chance to survive. \nThat is all the textile industry is asking this afternoon is for a \nchance to survive.\n  Two-thirds of the clothing I am looking at is imported. Do we want to \nsend the rest of it down there? We have shown all the fabric plants \nthey can manufacture if they go down there, and they will go. Do they \nwant to do that for the sub-Sahara, not having any side agreements or \nunderstanding about labor rules, not having an understanding about the \nenvironment, not having any reciprocity?\n  Let me get to the restrictions. This industry is terribly restricted. \nThey should understand it right now. That is, I hold in my hand \n``Foreign Regulations Affecting U.S. Textile and Apparel Exports.'' \nThat was, a few years ago, in one book. Now they put it out in \ndifferent, separate items with respect just to the United States, and \nthey do not put it in a book because they think we were the only ones \nwho had any restrictions whatsoever. But can't we do away with the \nrestrictions, not only on the textile industry but the restrictions \nthat they have with respect to the Caribbean Basin Initiative? I have \nthe various products.\n  Mr. President, knit fabrics, Rwanda. Of course, 100 percent on knit \nfabrics, 100 percent on apparel. Mali, we have restrictions there. You \ncan turn to the restrictions with the other countries: Gabon, 30 \npercent on apparel compared to our 10 percent in the United States; \nEthiopia, 80 percent compared to our 10 percent. We have already given \nthem the advantage by far.\n  My hangup is, we have given the advantage to the Koreans, the \nPeople's Republic of China, the Taiwanese, the Japanese, the \nMalaysians. They have the investments in these countries, and they will \nhave a few jobs to give out, but they will literally take the remaining \none-third of the American market and put out of business a wonderful \nbasic industry important to our national security.\n  I say ``a wonderful'' because I watched in the early days when they \ngot the dust and lint in their faces and hair. That is why they called \nthem lint heads. That is not the case anymore. There is no one in the \ncard room. It is mechanically, electronically controlled. In the weave \nroom, where they had 125 people, there are fewer than 15 now. They have \nmodern machinery.\n  The main point is it has afforded jobs for minorities and for women. \nYou hardly found women in the fabric or textile plants; you found them \nin sewing. Now they represent over 50 percent of employees. It is a \ngood paying job. If the husband has a job and if a woman can make $8.30 \nan hour, that can help put the boys through Clemson University. That is \nwhat they are doing in my backyard in South Carolina.\n  They have invested, on average, $2 billion a year for some 15 years. \nBut now they look at this measure--which is really foreign aid, a \ngiveaway to make a record to build a library for the President and for \nthe idle rich over on the other side of the aisle who believe in money \nand market and not the country itself. They will give anything away. \nAll they want now, like their software crowd after we started the \nInternet, after we gave them the education at Stanford, after all the \nother protections, now they want to do away with the estate tax, do \naway with the capital gains tax, do away with the immigration laws; let \nthem all come in so we can get them even cheaper labor; let's do away \nwith State tort laws, Y2K; let's just do away with the Government. That \nis the crowd over on the other side of the aisle. I take the floor \nbecause that is where we are headed. This industry is watching closely \nbecause they do not want to be in a position of not getting their money \nback.\n  We have these wonderful textile shows--the machinery boys come from \nall over the world--in Greenville, SC, at the center. They want to stay \nahead of the curve, and they want to be productive, and they are \nproductive, and they do compete. I categorically claim the U.S. textile \nindustry is the most productive in the entire world, bar none. But they \ncannot afford to remain productive with this initiative because they \nwill not get their money back.\n  They know the transshipments. They know how the Chinese built these \nparks in Vietnam. That is why you find the Burlingtons and the Cone \nMills and the Guilfords all going down there because they want to stay \nin business and they have to make money. So they have to break their \npledge not to move plants, not to move jobs, and they all are headed \ndown there.\n  I do not know who is going to be able to hold on in the United States \nif this measure passes. The ATMI--that crowd is defunct, I can tell you \nthat. I can say that advisedly because I have gotten every award they \ngive. Otherwise, the AAMA, the American Apparel Manufacturers \nAssociation--and a man by the name of Larry Martin, a wonderful \nindividual, with whom I have worked for the enactment of textile bills \nover the last 30 years --ought to be renamed the Central American \nApparel Manufacturers. They do not have U.S. apparel manufacturers.\n  It is just like our friend from the Cayman Islands. It is gone. Fruit \nof the Loom, Sara Lee, Limited--``The fruit of its labor, the politics \nof underwear.'' That is the particular article that came out. They are \nready to go. They are now in the Cayman Islands. And I will ask Janet \nReno to look into this: I say to the Senator from North Dakota--they \nare talking about Chinese contributions. I am wondering about these \nCayman Islands contributions. I don't think George W. knows, but he \nalready has $400,000 from Bill Farley and Fruit of the Loom, according \nto this article. They are down in the Caymans.\n\n  Don't give me this cheese board they have up here, how wonderful this \nis and everybody but Hollings is for the measure. Why do you think they \ncould not get the black caucus over there or why couldn't they get \nJesse Jackson, Jr., for this bill? Why not go for the Jackson bill? \nThat is what he was for, not for this particular measure. Why did the \nblack ministers in Boston march on the industries? Because they are not \ntaken over with the bum's rush of that corporate business banking crowd \nthat wants to make an even bigger profit.\n  Former Secretary of Labor, little Bobby Reich, put out a book. I wish \nyou all would read that book. On page 179, you will find out the \nFortune 500 has not created a new job in the United States of America \nin the last 10 years. That book is about 6 or 7 years old, but is still \non point, and will be for sometime to come. They are not creating the \njobs. They are firing everybody. The companies I am referring to are \nall listed on the charts. They are getting\n\n[[Page S13227]]\n\nrid of the jobs and getting rid of the industry. That is what we have \nin the balance this afternoon.\n  I emphasize that it is one way, and it is not NAFTA and the nice plea \nthat it has worked so well down in Mexico so let's extend it to sub-\nSahara, let's extend it to Central America. We are not, if I have \nanything to do with it, going to pass this Kathie Lee sweatshop \nmeasure. It has not worked in El Salvador.\n  The Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, wanted to put a child labor \namendment on this measure. Of course, now that they have filled up the \ntree and have given fast track to this measure, we cannot offer an \namendment for labor rights, for the environment, for reciprocity. We \nare going the way of Mexico.\n  Let me momentarily hold up with one observation about NAFTA because \nthe claim was made at that time in the debate that they would create \n200,000 jobs. It has not created new jobs. We have lost 420,000 textile \njobs. They said we are going to have better wage rates. Actually, the \ntake-home wage of the country we were trying to help, Mexico, is less \nin 1999 than in 1994 and 1995 when we passed NAFTA.\n  Then they said it was going to help the immigration problem because \nthey are going to have so many jobs. The immigration problem has \nworsened.\n  I know better than any. I handle the immigration appropriation. We \nhave a school for the Border Patrol agents. We have literally graduated \nthousands of Border Patrol Spanish-speaking agents for the Border \nPatrol down in my hometown. And the immigration problem is, again, even \nworse. Ask the Senators from California, Mrs. Feinstein and Mrs. Boxer.\n  And then drugs. Oh, yeah, we were going to solve the drug problem. \nThat has gotten worse.\n  So NAFTA is not a good example of a positive experience with a trade \nagreement. It is like they keep talking about deregulation of the \nairlines. I could go on for 2 or 3 hours about that one. We are in an \nFAA authorization bill now.\n  We used to come specifically with the town, the mayor, the tax base, \nbuild the airport, get the facilities, go out and get Captain \nRickenbacker and Eastern Airlines, and come to the CAB and get the \nrights; and it was a working deal. You got good service. The community \ncontrolled the so-called slots, and everything else of that kind. It \nworked.\n  But they got this urge to deregulate, deregulate, and we have now \ncome full swing, full circle. The regulated are buying up the \nderegulated. You don't get the service. You have all kinds of costs.\n  I bought a ticket a few weeks ago for my wife. The day before we did \nnot think the plane was going to fly on account of Hurricane Floyd. We \nfound out it was, so we bought the ticket. It was $748, round trip, \nfrom Washington, DC, to Charleston, SC, and back--$748 dollars. I will \nshow you the ticket.\n  So don't talk about the improvements, and everything else like that, \nwith either deregulation or this singsong the money crowd puts on with \nrespect to NAFTA and how well it has worked and how everybody is for \nit.\n  Everybody is not for this. Those who are looking and have studied and \nworked in the trade field realize we are going the way of England and \nthat we just can't afford it any longer. I almost say we, more or less, \nhave given away the store, as they say, in the community chest. As they \nsaid to me back in those Governor days: Governor, what do you expect \nthem to make? The airplanes and the computers? Let them make the shoes. \nLet them make the clothing. And we will make the airplanes and the \ncomputers.\n  My problem is they are making the shoes, they are making the \nclothing, they are making the airplanes, they are making the computers. \nThat Boeing crowd from Washington is beginning to sober up because \ntheir bus is being dumped. Ask these airlines whether they are buying \nBoeing or Lockheed. No, no, no. They are being dumped on account of the \nprice and financing, and everything else of that kind. And the \ncompetition is government; and the policy is set by that government.\n  Senators say look before you open up Conrad Manufacturing. You have \nto have a minimum wage, clean air, clean water, Social Security, \nMedicare, Medicaid, safe working place, safe machinery, plant closing \nnotice, parental leave--I could keep going on and on. They can go down \nto Mexico now for 58 cents an hour, and there is none of that.\n  So what is happening in the job policy where you can save as much as \n20 percent on your manufacturing cost, which is 30 percent of volume? \nIf you move your manufacturing to a low-wage country, and just keep \nyour executive office and your sales force, and you have $500 million \nin sales, saving 20 percent moving to that low-wage country, before \ntaxes you can make $100 million. Or you know what, you can continue to \nwork your own people and go bankrupt.\n  That is the job policy of the national Congress. That is the job \npolicy we are discussing this afternoon on the floor of the Senate. \nThat is what we are talking about: How can we say this is for the \npeople, how we say this is going to create jobs, knowing full well it \nis going to result in a loss of jobs.\n  That is why the labor people, and that is why so many African \nAmericans, that is why all are beginning to get stirred. That is what \nmakes Pat Buchanan make sense until lately when he began to talk that \nnonsense about Hitler. That is the worse thing that ever happened to \nthis particular debate because he was talking sense at the time before \nhe wrote his silly book about Hitler and all these other things. But he \nis talking about the passing army. That is labor in America. They \nrealize they are hearing all this pretty talk from Washington and how \nwe are going to do this and how we got to go do that--global economy, \nglobal competition, and everything else of that kind--and they keep \nlosing out.\n  They are wondering what is happening when the Republicans and \nDemocrats say the same thing. And so Buchanan comes out, and was the \nbest voice we had in a national sense. I have been talking trade while \nthat boy was in Gonzaga. Is that the name of the high school around \nhere, Gonzaga High School? Gonzaga High School--I was working on this \nwhen he was at Gonzaga High School beating up everybody. I know him and \nlike him. I get along with him very well. But he has poisoned the well \non this particular score because he loses credibility on the most \nimportant issue next to the budget. The second most important is the \neconomy and trying to maintain middle America.\n  And they tell me--the Senator from Louisiana--all they have to do is \nget in line and go to Amazon. The fact is that those jobs are not \npaying as much. These retail jobs just do not provide the same pay. In \nfact, they make them independent contractors to avoid paying their \nhealth costs and everything else.\n  In fact, take the example--and I will sit down and yield to my \ncolleagues because I have plenty more to cover--with respect to Oneida \nknitting mills down in Andrews, SC, they had to close the first of the \nyear. We bought them less than 35 years ago, a fine little plant. They \nhad 487 employees, with the average age of 47 years old.\n  Tell them to get retrained and get skilled tomorrow morning--\nWashington's approach and the approach of the Senator from Louisiana--\nget that skill as a computer operator and go apply to Amazon as a 47-\nyear-old. Do you think Amazon is going to employ the 47-year-old or the \n21-year-old computer operator? They are sidelined, deadlined. They are \nout.\n  This is the issue they ought to be debating in this Presidential \nrace. But since the pollsters are all on education, education, \neducation, and the Governors, education, education, the size of the \nclass, more this, more that, reeducate, reteach, everything else like \nthat, they are not talking about the real problem that we at the \nWashington level are talking about.\n  On education, the federal government only spends 7 cents on the \ndollar; the other 93 cents comes from the local level. So we are not \ngoing to do much on that. But here, when we can do something, we are \ndoing the wrong thing and going in the wrong direction.\n  They put up these cheese boards around how the Citicorp and that rich \ncrowd is all for it. All they are doing is trying to make money. They \nare not trying to create jobs.\n  Read Bobby Reich's book. He's right, the Fortune 500 are not creating \njobs at\n\n[[Page S13228]]\n\nall. We supposedly are trying to, but at the same time we are canceling \nout these efforts with this job policy.\n  We have to phase out right now the Multifiber Arrangement. We are \ngoing into the fifth year of it. The real hard part is going to be \nhitting. I can tell you right now, after this election in November \n2000, the next President who is going to come on is going to have some \nreal problems. And, Senator, you and I, hopefully, if the Lord is \nwilling, will be here. And we ought to be doing something about it now.\n  We certainly ought not to be taking this bum's rush that comes out of \nthe Finance Committee. Because that is what they do to me every time. \nThat is what they did on NAFTA. That is what they did on GATT. They \nwait until the last 10 days of a particular session. Then they come out \nand they grease it and they give it fast track. They file it. They put \nin two amendments. They fill up the tree. They file cloture. And say: \nHa, ha, ha, we are going off to the party. Struggle as you will. But we \nhave it fast tracked. And this is going to pass whether you like it or \nnot.\n  We have to get out here and get at least some amendments with respect \nto the labor and environmental rights, with respect to the reciprocity. \nI hope we will look closely at what has happened here.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe 1998 Ratios of Imports to Consumption from the International Trade \nCommission, this two-sheet listing.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                 1998 ratios of imports to consumption\n\n                              [In percent]\n\nCertain industrial thermal-processing equipment and certain furnace48.9\nTextile machinery and parts........................................67.0\nMetal rolling mills and parts thereof..............................46.6\nMachine tools for cutting metal and parts..........................48.1\nMachine tools for metal forming and parts thereof..................55.3\nSemiconductor manufacturing equipment and robotics.................51.9\nBoilers, turbines, and related machinery...........................44.4\nElectrical transformers, static converters, and inductors..........43.2\nMolds and molding machinery........................................44.8\nAircraft engines and gas turbines..................................70.3\nAutomobiles, trucks, buses, and bodies and chassis of the foregoing40.6\nMotorcycles, mopeds, and parts.....................................48.5\nAircraft, spacecraft, and related equipment........................45.7\nOffice machines....................................................47.2\nMicrophones, loudspeakers, audio amplifiers, and combinations there77.9\nTape recorders, tape players, video cassette recorders, turntables, and \n  compact disc players............................................100.0\nRadio transmission and reception apparatus, and combinations thereo57.9\nTelevision apparatus, including cameras, camcorders, and cable \n  apparatus........................................................68.5\nElectric sound and visual signaling apparatus......................49.9\nElectrical capacitors and resistors................................69.5\nDiodes, transistors, integrated circuits, and similar semiconductor \n  solid-state devices..............................................45.2\nElectrical and electronic articles, apparatus, and parts not elsewhere \n  provided for.....................................................49.1\nAutomatic data processing machines.................................51.6\nOptical goods, including ophthalmic goods..........................51.5\nPhotographic cameras and equipment.................................63.8\nWatches...........................................................100.0\nClocks and timing devices..........................................62.2\nDrawing and mathematical calculating and measuring instruments.....71.4\nLuggage, handbags, and flat goods..................................79.7\nMusical instruments and accessories................................57.2\nUmbrellas, whips, riding crops, and canes..........................81.1\nSilverware and certain other articles of precious metal............59.9\nPrecious jewelry and related articles..............................55.8\nMen's and boys' suits and sportcoats...............................47.5\nMen's and boys' coats and jackets..................................62.5\nMen's and boys' trousers...........................................50.4\nWomen's and girls' trousers........................................56.4\nShirts and blouses.................................................62.9\nSweaters...........................................................76.4\nWomen's and girls' suits, skirts, and coats........................59.0\nRobes, nightwear, and underwear....................................68.8\nBody-supporting garments...........................................42.8\nNeckwear, handkerchiefs, and scarves...............................46.7\nGloves, including gloves for sports................................76.1\nHeadwear...........................................................54.1\nLeather apparel and accessories....................................67.2\nFur apparel and other fur articles.................................81.7\nFootwear and footwear parts........................................84.2\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.

He was talking about exports and how he got Ohio, as \nGovernor, prepared for exports. As a Governor, I have done the same \nthing. For both Ohio and South Carolina, there isn't going to be \nanything left to export. This was last year's statistics. I can tell \nyou the trend is overwhelming in the wrong direction.\n  Look at the deficit in the balance of trade. It is going to \napproximate this year $300 billion. We are not talking about exports as \na wonderful thing. Let's look, as they used to say when my children \nwere growing up, Big John and Sparky, all the way through life, make \nthis your goal; keep your eye on the doughnut and not the hole. We have \nthe eye on the hole.\n  Export, export, that is the singsong. Citibank, Citicorp, and all \nthose other financial institutions listed up there, that banker board \nand what have you; export, export. What we have to watch is the \nimports. That is the doughnut. That is the problem we have.\n  When you are spending over $100 billion more than you are taking in, \nyou're going to create a huge economic problem. We should know: the \nfiscal year just ended, September 30, less than 30 days ago, and we \nhave spent $103 billion more than we took in, we are still running over \n$100 billion deficits, deficits, deficits. All right. We finally got on \nto that at least to save Social Security. Now they are talking exports, \nwhen they ought to be talking imports because with this particular \ntrend, we don't have anything to export.\n  Exporting movies, exporting software, exporting insurance policies, \nexporting bank accounts--come on--where is the work there? All you have \nis this computerization and everything else. You will have your country \nterribly enfeebled. It is all a bum's rush to let us help the sub-\nSahara foreign aid, let us help the Caribbean Basin nations. But they \nwon't have reciprocity down there. They will all move in on those poor \nlittle islands, like we called up that little Felicia in Antigua after \nthe poor airmen got killed in the barracks. Don't you remember, at \nLebanon? The marines, I should say, got killed in the barracks at \nLebanon.\n\n[[Page S13229]]\n\n After we lost some 278 marines, they ran down and got suits off the \nGulf coast and said: We are invading Granada because Antigua asked us \nto.\n  We know what is going to happen. Look at the sheet: Kathie Lee \nsweatshop in El Salvador. If you try to get a union there, they will \nkill you. They will kill you. I can tell you right now. Workers fired \nand blacklisted if they tried to defend their rights. Workers paid 15 \ncents for every $16.96 pair of Kathie Lee pants they sold; starvation \nwages, locked bathrooms, forced overtime; pregnancy tests; workers \nillegally fired and intimidated; death threats. To have the audacity to \nstand on the floor of the Senate and call this a win-win bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I've already stated my opposition to \nthis Africa trade bill. At best, it does virtually nothing for Africa, \nand at worst it actually harms African economies while doing little for \nthe United States.\n  Instead, the Senate should support legislation that works with the \ncountries of Sub-Saharan Africa to diversify and strengthen African \neconomies and fight the real enemies of economic progress on the \ncontinent: the overwhelming debt burden and the devastating AIDS \nepidemic.\n  There are many sound policy reasons for opposing this bill, which \ncarries the slightly Orwellian title, the Africa Growth and Opportunity \nAct or AGOA. These reasons have been well articulated during this \ndebate.\n  But today I come to the floor to talk about who supports AGOA--a long \nlist of wealthy corporations who will reap huge benefits if AGOA \nbecomes law.\n  I don't think my colleagues will be surprised to learn that many of \nthese corporate interests are also powerful political donors who know \nhow to use the current campaign finance system to lobby Congress when \ntheir interests are at stake.\n  Many supporters of AGOA can be found among the members of Africa \nGrowth and Opportunity Act Coalition, Inc. I'm not making this up Mr. \nPresident. This corporation was established, according to its website, \nto ``demonstrate to the United States Senate that there is significant \npublic support behind enacting the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act \n(H.R. 434).''\n  I argue that the support this coalition really demonstrates is not \nbroad-based support from the American public, but the very narrow \nsupport of the few but powerful members of the coalition themselves--\nAmoco, Chevron, Mobil, The Gap, Limited Inc., Enron, General Electric, \nSBC Communications, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Caterpillar and Motorola, to \nname just a few.\n  Our campaign finance system allows these companies to be heard on the \nissue of Africa trade not only because of their business concerns, but \nbecause of the legal loophole they have at their disposal to influence \nthis policy debate--unregulated, unlimited soft money contributions.\n  This coalition has the weight of millions of dollars of soft money \nbehind it, Mr. President.\n  We know these corporations have the wealth and clout to be heard in \nCongress on this bill, so the only question is--what does AGOA offer \nthem?\n  AGOA provides millions in benefits to help corporations invest in \nAfrica--corporations that are often already investing there in the \nfirst place, and many corporations that, not coincidentally, comprise \nthe AGOA coalition.\n  AGOA is a huge windfall for many American corporations, but it does \nlittle or nothing for African nations or African people or working \nAmericans.\n  It doesn't make an effort to stimulate African economies by helping \nsmall businesses in Africa, or adequately guard against transhipment of \ngoods through Africa, which will rob Africans of the benefits AGOA is \nsupposed to intend.\n  Essentially it offers the status quo, plus a multi-million dollar \nbonus in tariff reductions for American corporations that already do \nbusiness on the continent.\n  Mr. President, just to give an idea of the soft money donations that \ngive the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act Coalition, Inc., so much \nclout, I'd like to Call the Bankroll on this industry coalition, as I \ndo from time to time on this floor, for the benefit of the public and \nmy colleagues.\n  First the total numbers. The companies that are members of this \ncoalition gave a total of $5,108,735 in soft money to the political \nparties in the `98 election cycle. Over $5 million in one cycle, Mr. \nPresident. That is an extraordinary figure. Our parties have received \nover $5 million in financial support from this industry coalition that \nwas organized to lobby for this bill. Are we really comfortable with \nthat? Does that not give us just a little pause?\n  Two major U.S. retailers and coalition members, Gap Inc. and The \nLimited Inc., have a particularly strong interest in passing AGOA, \nsince they can benefit from importing cheap textiles. Let's look at \ntheir soft money contributions specifically.\n  During the 1997-1998 election cycle, Limited, Inc. gave the political \nparties $553,000 in soft money donations, and in just the first six \nmonths of 1999, Limited Inc. gave the parties more than $160,000 via \nthe soft money loophole.\n  The Gap also played the soft money game during this period, with more \nthan $185,000 in the 1998 election cycle and nearly $54,000 already \nduring the current election cycle.\n  And that's not all, Mr. President, not by a long shot.\n  I'd also like to turn my colleagues attention to the wealthy donors \nwho would like to secure enactment of the Caribbean Basin Initiative or \n``CBI'', which was combined with the AGOA in the managers' amendment.\n  The soft money donations from one donor with a huge stake in seeing \nCBI passed are particularly interesting, and bear mention during this \ndebate.\n  Fruit of the Loom stands to gain $25 to $50 million from so-called \nCBI-NAFTA parity, which essentially removes tariffs on the goods Fruit \nof the Loom imports from its places of production in the Caribbean \nbasin.\n  Fruit of the Loom stands to gain at least $25 million, Mr. President, \nand the loss from eliminating duties on apparel from the Caribbean will \nrun U.S. taxpayers at least $1 billion in lost revenue over five years, \naccording to an article from this week's Time Magazine.\n  Mr. President, this article, entitled ``The Fruit of Its Labor,'' has \nalready been printed in the Record. I ask my colleagues to read it.\n  What might a corporation do to lobby for this kind of major change in \nour trade laws, Mr. President?\n  Under today's campaign finance rules, they might consider making some \nhefty soft money contributions, and in fact that's just what Fruit of \nthe Loom did.\n  Fruit of the Loom gave nearly $440,000 in soft money during the last \nelection cycle.\n  The company has been an active donor in the current election cycle as \nwell, especially surrounding key moments in the life of CBI \nlegislation.\n  On June 14 of this year, just over a month before CBI/NAFTA parity \nlegislation was introduced in the Senate on July 16, Fruit of the Loom \ngave $20,000 to the Republican Senate-House Dinner Committee.\n  On July 30, 1999, two weeks after the bill was introduced, the \ncompany gave the National Republican Senatorial Committee $50,000.\n  I state these facts for those who might wonder whether political \ncontributions are ever intended to effect what we do here on this \nfloor, and for those who question whether there is an appearance of \ncorruption caused by the soft money system.\n  I offer up the facts, and I ask my colleagues and the public to be \nthe judge of a system that allows these unlimited soft money \ncontributions to occur--contributions that would appear to any logical \nobserver to have a potentially corrupting effect on this vitally \nimportant trade debate.\n  Now, one might think, Mr. President, that the business community \nwould be solidly behind this soft money system that allows it so much \naccess and opportunity to influence the legislation that comes out of \nthis body. The amount of money that businesses spend on political \ndonations is a small investment indeed for the kind of return that \nlegislation like the AGOA and the CBI offers.\n  But recently we have seen some very significant cracks in business \ncommunity support for this system. Perhaps\n\n[[Page S13230]]\n\nmost notable, was the emergence this year of the prestigious business \nand academic think tank, the Committee for Economic Development, as a \nsupporter of reform.\n  The CED came out in March with a strongly worded report that \ndenounced our current system and proposed a series of reforms. Its \ncomprehensive report and recommendations reached the following \nconclusion: ``No reform is more urgently needed than a ban on national \nparty `soft money' financing.''\n  When we debated the McCain-Feingold soft money ban recently, the \nSenator from Kentucky dismissed the CED report. He called CED and I'm \nquoting here, a ``little known business group'' and ``a business group \nwhich until a few months ago no one had ever heard of.''\n  Let me tell the Chair and my colleagues a little about the CED, this \n``little-known'' group.\n  CED was founded in 1942. It's trustees are chairmen, presidents, and \nsenior executives of major American corporations, along with University \nPresidents. CED's early work was influential in shaping the Bretton \nWoods Agreement, which established the World Bank and the International \nMonetary Fund. CED Trustees were prime movers behind establishing the \nMarshall Plan, the President's Council of Economic Advisors, and the \nJoint Economic Committee.\n  With respect to the Marshall Plan, the Senator from Kentucky might be \ninterested in knowing that the President's Committee on Foreign Aid, \nestablished by President Harry Truman and led by Averell Harriman, \nincluded five CED Trustees. Among these was Paul G. Hoffman, chairman \nand President of The Studebaker Company who happened to be the founder \nof CED. Hoffman was ultimately selected by President Truman as the \nfirst administrator of the Marshall Plan.\n  Interestingly, Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg, a prime mover of the \nMarshall Plan in Congress, rejected President Truman's first choice of \nUndersecretary of State Dean Acheson as the plan's first administrator. \nHe argued that the person in that post needed ``particularly persuasive \neconomic credentials'' and that Congress wanted an administrator from \n``the outside business world . . . and not via the State Department.'' \nIn the end, Senator Vandenberg himself selected Paul Hoffman to run the \nMarshall Plan, noting that he was to be the ``business head of a \nbusiness operation.''\n  According to SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, ``CED has played a leading \nrole in fostering public sector policies and private sector policies \nthat have helped make America's economy the strongest in the world and \nits companies the most competitive.''\n  Mr. President, at this point, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record letters praising CED's work from Presidents Eisenhower, \nJohnson, Carter, Reagan, and Bush.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Gettysburg, PA,\n\n                                                  October 1, 1963.\n     Hon. Sigurd S. Larmon,\n     Chairman, Information Committee, Committee for Economic \n         Development, New York, NY.\n       Dear Sig: I am delighted to respond to your query. The \n     Committee for Economic Development provides a means by which \n     many able and public spirited men in American business can \n     join their talent and experience to advance the economic \n     welfare of the country. For 20 years the business leadership \n     represented by C.E.D. has sought out the best experts it can \n     find on each given problem to help them develop the best ways \n     to promote a growing and stable economy and rising living \n     standards. I thought its contributions to the nation \n     invaluable when I was in the White House, today I believe \n     they are equally so.\n       With warm regard,\n            As ever,\n     Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                    Washington, December 10, 1964.\n     Mr. Alfred C. Neal,\n     President, Committee for Economic Development, New York, NY.\n       Dear Mr. Neal: Thank you for your kind letter of November \n     25. I have enjoyed and profited from my contacts with the \n     Committee for Economic Development, and I am pleased to know \n     that this feeling is shared by you.\n       Whenever the CED feels that it can be helpful to the \n     country and the Administration, I hope that you will not \n     hesitate to communicate your views.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lyndon B. Johnson.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                     Washington, November 8, 1978.\n     Mr. Robert C. Holland,\n     President, Committee for Economic Development, Washington, \n         DC.\n       To Robert C. Holland: The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, \n     which I signed into law earlier this month, will make \n     possible the first overhaul of the Federal personnel system \n     in 95 years.\n       This historic step would not have been possible without \n     broad public support. The statement by the Committee for \n     Economic Development on ``Revitalizing the Federal Personnel \n     System'' was an especially timely and thoughtful contribution \n     to the national debate on civil service reform. The trustees \n     of CED can be justly proud of their accomplishment.\n       I wish you and your fine organization continued success in \n     bringing a responsible perspective to the public dialogue.\n\n     Jimmy Carter.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                         Washington, May 14, 1982.\n       I welcome the opportunity to extend my congratulations to \n     members of the Committee for Economic Development as you \n     commemorate your fortieth anniversary.\n       These four decades since your organization's founding \n     encompass a period of economic growth unequalled in our \n     country or anywhere else in the world, and the value of the \n     free enterprise system as a system which can spread its \n     benefits across our entire society has been demonstrated.\n       One of the reasons for our achievements is the opportunity \n     we have in this nation to examine and discuss economic issues \n     freely. In the public forum, we accept ideas from all sides, \n     and we share, sift, propose, and criticize, thereby unlocking \n     the ingenuity and initiative of our best minds.\n       I applaud the timely focus of the Committee for Economic \n     Development on the issue of productivity as the key to the \n     economic future of the United States. My Administration's \n     economic recovery program includes strong incentives for \n     business investment to modernize plant and equipment. Our aim \n     is higher productivity, more jobs, and increased \n     competitiveness for American industry in markets at home and \n     abroad.\n       One of the great glories of America is the willingness of \n     busy citizens to take time from their important personal \n     interests to devote their energies and abilities to the \n     public welfare.\n       The CED is a prime embodiment of this spirit of \n     voluntarism. Your members bring priceless knowledge and \n     experience from corporate and academic life to our public \n     policy forums.\n       I share your pride in forty years of valuable service to \n     the nation and know that you will use this celebration to \n     renew your dedication to the progress of our country.\n\n     Ronald Reagan.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                         Washington, May 21, 1992.\n       Greetings to all those who are gathered in New York to \n     celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the Committee for Economic \n     Development. I am pleased to join with America's former \n     Secretary of State, George Shultz, in welcoming our visitors \n     from abroad.\n       From its inception in 1942 through the recent end of the \n     Cold War, the CED and its trustees have made significant \n     contributions toward the social and economic development of \n     the United States and other nations around the globe. After \n     World War II, your recommendation proved valuable in \n     assessing the needs of postwar Europe and in formulating the \n     Marshall Plan. Today, your support of both current and \n     prospective international agreements on trade is helping to \n     promote greater economic opportunities for peoples in both \n     hemispheres. Because America's productivity, prosperity, and \n     strength depend on a well-educated and highly skilled work \n     force--one that will be able to compete in the expanding \n     global market-place--I especially applaud your support of \n     education programs such as Head Start and America 2000.\n       As with the end of other epic struggles, new opportunities \n     and challenges lie ahead now that America and its allies have \n     won the Cold War. Indeed, your work remains very important as \n     we chart a new course for ourselves in an increasingly \n     interdependent world.\n       Barbara joins me in congratulating the Committee on its \n     anniversary and in sending best wishes for the future.\n\n                                                      George Bush.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me quote from President Bush's \nletter, sent on the occasion of CED's 50th anniversary in 1992. He \nsaid: ``From its inception in 1942 through the recent end of the Cold \nWar, the CED and its trustees have made significant contributions \ntoward the social and economic development of the United States around \nthe globe.''\n  So, far from being little known and obscure, CED has been a leading \nvoice of the business community in its interaction with government for \nover 50 years. It is a nonpartisan group that has had a significant \nrole in government policy in education, job training\n\n[[Page S13231]]\n\nand employment, international economics, and budget and fiscal issues. \nCED Trustees have held numerous high level government posts, and come \nfrom both political parties. The current Chairman of CED, Frank Doyle, \nis the retired Executive Vice President of General Electric, who has \nserved as a U.S. Representative to the OECD and the European Community.\n  It's also fascinating, Mr. President, that the Senator from Kentucky \nimplied during our campaign finance debate that CED's endorsement of \ncampaign finance reform was insignificant because he has gone to great \nlengths to try to dissuade it from its view. Indeed, this summer, the \nSenator from Kentucky wrote to up to 20 business executives to urge \nthem to resign from CED because of its position on campaign finance \nreform. The Senator from Kentucky charged that CED's position was part \nof a campaign to ``eviscerate private sector participation in \npolitics,'' and ``ban corporate political activism.'' He criticized CED \nfor aligning itself with groups like the Sierra Club on this issue.\n\n  The chairs of the subcommittee that developed the CED report, which \nby the way was adopted without dissent either from the subcommittee or \nfrom the 56 member Research and Policy Committee that gave it CED's \nofficial imprimatur, replied to the Senator from Kentucky that they \nthought it ``entirely appropriate for groups with diverse interests to \nspeak out jointly on an issue that they believe threatens the vitality \nof our participatory democracy.'' And they flatly rejected the charge \nthat they want to silence the private sector.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of Senator \nMcConnell's letter, along with the response from the CED's leaders, as \nprinted in the New York Times, be reprinted in the Record along with a \nNew York Times news story and editorial about this exchange. I also ask \nunanimous consent that a New York Times story concerning the president \nof CED, Charles Kolb, who was a lawyer in the Office of Management and \nBudget and in the Department of Education under President Bush, also be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                [From the New York Times, Sept. 1, 1999]\n\n                       A Letter and Its Response\n\n       Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, chairman of the \n     National Republican Senatorial Committee, wrote to 10 \n     business executives on July 28 suggesting that they resign \n     from a group promoting overhaul of campaign finance laws, \n     which prompted a reply on Aug. 23 by three leaders of that \n     group. Following is a letter sent to an executive, with the \n     recipient's name deleted by the advocacy group, the Committee \n     for Economic Development, and the group's reply:\n\n\n                         mr. mcconnell's letter\n\n       I was astonished to learn that . . . has lent its name, \n     prestige and presumably financial backing to the Committee \n     for Economic Development in its all-out campaign to \n     eviscerate private sector participation in politics, through \n     so-called ``campaign reform.''\n       This week, the Committee for Economic Development joined \n     hands with Ralph Nader and the Sierra Club in taking out a \n     full-page ad in The Hill, demanding new campaign finance laws \n     that would ban corporate political activism and render the \n     Republican Party powerless to defend probusiness candidates \n     from negative TV attacks by labor unions, trial lawyers and \n     radical environmentalists.\n       To legitimize its claim to represent the corporate \n     community in advocating anti-business speech controls, the \n     Web site of the Committee for Economic Development \n     prominently lists . . . as one of the trustees that is \n     ``engaged in implement[ing] their policy recommendations.''\n       If you disagree with the radical campaign finance agenda of \n     the Committee for Economic Development and resent its abuse \n     of your company's reputation, I would think that public \n     withdrawal from this organization would be a reasonable \n     response.\n       Thank you for considering my great concern over these \n     developments.\n\n\n                         the committee's letter\n\n       We are responding to your letter of July 28 to several \n     trustees of the Committee for Economic Development (C.E.D.) \n     urging them ``to resign from C.E.D.'' because of our recent \n     policy statement on campaign finance reform.\n       Your letter refers to a full-page ad that C.E.D. and other \n     organizations sponsored urging the Senate to work toward \n     meaningful campaign finance reform. We make no apologies for \n     expressing our views and associating with groups such as \n     AARP, the League of Women Voters, and the Sierra Club. In our \n     view, it is entirely appropriate for groups with diverse \n     interests to speak out jointly on an issue that they believe \n     threatens the vitality of our participatory democracy. In \n     fact, we find it ironic that you are such a fervent defender \n     of First Amendment freedoms but seem intent to stifle our \n     efforts to express publicly our concerns about a campaign \n     finance system that many feel is out of control. Efforts to \n     secure funding for the Republican Party should not be based \n     on silencing other organizations.\n       You also accuse C.E.D. of an ``all-out campaign to \n     eviscerate private sector participation in politics.'' We \n     respectfully submit that you have misread our report. First, \n     it is disingenuous to imply that a business organization such \n     as C.E.D. wants to silence the private sector or is anti-\n     business. Second, if C.E.D.'s recommendations were enacted \n     tomorrow, there would be more, not less, money available to \n     finance elections. These funds would come primarily from \n     individual contributions--either directly or through \n     political action commitees--not through loopholes in existing \n     laws that have created today's unregulated, apparently \n     limitless, flood of soft money. Our proposal would restore \n     the principle that campaign contributions should be made by \n     individuals not corporations or unions.\n       We know that a majority of the House and the Senate \n     supports campaign finance reform. That sentiment is also \n     shared by a growing number of business community leaders. We \n     hope that you will reconsider your opposition and enable the \n     issue to be discussed and voted on this fall in the Senate.\n       Those of us at C.E.D. applaud your many years of public \n     service. We respect and share your commitment to the First \n     Amendment. However, many of our trustees happen to disagree \n     with you on this issue.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Sept. 1, 1999]\n\n        Defying Senator, Executives Press Donation Rules Change\n\n                        (By Don Van Natta, Jr.)\n\n       Washington, Aug. 31.--Leaders of a committee of business \n     executives who have endorsed a ban on unlimited campaign \n     contributions said today that their members would not be \n     intimidated by an aggressive letter-writing campaign led by \n     Senator Mitch McConnell, one of the Senate's most ardent \n     opponents of a bill that would overhaul the campaign finance \n     system.\n       In the letters, Mr. McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, \n     accused the group of trying to ``eviscerate private sector \n     participation in politics'' by imposing ``anti-business \n     speech controls.''\n       ``I hope you will resign from C.E.D.,'' Mr. McConnell \n     scribbled near the bottom of one letter sent to an \n     unidentified senior executive of a telecommunications \n     corporation.\n       Leaders of the organization attacked by Mr. McConnell, the \n     Committee for Economic Development, which includes executives \n     of General Motors, Xerox, Merck and the Sara Lee Corporation, \n     refused to identify the executive or the corporation in the \n     letter. But they did say that Mr. McConnell wrote letters to \n     executives who work for companies that have significant \n     issues pending before Congress.\n       None of nearly 20 members of the Committee for Economic \n     Development planned to resign from the committee, as Mr. \n     McConnell urged in the letters sent late last month, \n     committee leaders said.\n       Edward A. Kangas, a co-chairman of the C.E.D. committee \n     that studied the campaign finance system, said today that Mr. \n     McConnell's letter confirmed for him that the organization, \n     which has enlisted more than 100 current and retired \n     executives to endorse new campaign finance rules, was \n     beginning to shape the contentious debate on the subject on \n     Capitol Hill. The letter was first reported on Sunday on the \n     editorial page of The New York Times.\n       ``What we've been doing as a group of business leaders is \n     obviously beginning to have an impact,'' said Mr. Kangas, \n     the chairman and chief executive of Deloitte Touche \n     Tohmatsu, the accounting and consulting firm. ``If we \n     weren't having an impact, he would not be communicating \n     with us.''\n       In his public statements, Mr. McConnell argues that current \n     campaign-finance legislation would infringe on free speech \n     protections of the First Amendment. Critics of the Republican \n     Party's position on the issue, however, say that Republicans \n     are motivated by the knowledge that they hold a commanding \n     advantage in raising campaign money from the private sector.\n       In the letter, Mr. McConnell also wrote that he was \n     ``astonished'' that the corporation of the recipient had \n     ``lent its name, prestige and presumably financial backing'' \n     to the Committee for Economic Development, which he said was \n     lobbying on behalf of a ``radical campaign-finance agenda.'' \n     Mr. McConnell argued that the executive's alliance with such \n     a group had consequently damaged the reputation of the \n     executive's employer.\n       Mr. McConnell wrote the letters in his role as chairman of \n     the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the party's \n     major fund-raising group for Senate candidates. His \n     spokesman, Robert Steurer, said that Mr. McConnell was \n     unavailable for comment, and referred questions to the \n     National Republican Senatorial Committee.\n       Steven Law, executive director of the National Republican \n     Senatorial Committee, issued a brief statement tonight, in \n     which he said: ``Nearly all the companies we contacted had no \n     idea that C.E.D. was throwing their name around in connection \n     with campaign-finance reform and they were outraged that \n     C.E.D. had hijacked their corporate identity to sell a \n     position with which they sharply disagreed.''\n       The executives on the C.E.D. committee are speaking for \n     themselves, and not necessarily on behalf of their companies. \n     Most\n\n[[Page S13232]]\n\n     of their corporations still continue to give large sums to \n     political parties and candidates.\n       Mr. Kangas and other committee leaders said they had \n     recruited more executives in the past several days. They said \n     their goal was to have 300 executives endorse their campaign \n     finance proposals by late autumn.\n       ``I think most of the people at C.E.D. have figured out \n     just how corrupt the campaign finance system is, and this \n     letter is just an example of what they already knew,'' Mr. \n     Kangas said, ``Actually, we are broadening the constituency \n     of business leaders who recognize that the campaign finance \n     system is a real problem. Senator McConnell's letter has not \n     had much impact.''\n       The letter was seen by some as an attempt to intimidate the \n     members with the implied message: Resign and keep quiet or \n     don't count on doing business with Congress. ``The reaction \n     was interesting,'' Mr. Kangas said. ``These guys are running \n     big enterprises of their own. They are not easily \n     intimidated. They looked at the letter and most of them just \n     chuckled and filed it away.''\n       The committee is a 60-year-old business-led public policy \n     and research association based in Manhattan. Its leaders \n     pride themselves that it is fiercely non-partisan.\n       The executives on the committee are urging Congress to \n     prohibit soft money, the unlimited donations that \n     corporations give to political parties. The committee also \n     advocates increasing the limit on individual contributions \n     to $3,000 from the current limit of $1,000.\n       ``The business community, by an large, has been the \n     provider of soft money, said Charles Kolb, the committee's \n     president. ``These people are saying: We're tired of being \n     hit up and shaken down. Politics ought to be about something \n     besides hitting up companies for more and more money.''\n       The committee's members studied the campaign finance system \n     for two years. Committee members said they were horrified at \n     the public perception that big donors receive special favors \n     in Washington. In a report released in March, the committee \n     wrote: ``The suspicion of corruption deepens public cynicism \n     and diminishes public confidence in Government. More \n     important, these activities raise the likelihood of actual \n     corruption.''\n       In a response sent to Mr. McConnell last week, leaders of \n     the committee wrote: ``We know that a majority of the House \n     and the Senate supports campaign finance reform. That \n     sentiment is also shared by a growing number of business \n     community leaders.''\n       Both Warren E. Buffett, the acclaimed value investor and \n     chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, and Jerome Kohlberg, a \n     founder of the leveraged buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts \n     & Company, have tried on their own to persuade chief \n     executives of businesses to embrace campaign finance reform \n     measures. But many, though sympathetic, refused to speak out \n     because they do not want to rankle the legislators on whom \n     they depend.\n       Mr. Kangas said he disagreed with Mr. McConnell's position \n     that campaign contributions were protected by the First \n     Amendment. ``I was a little disappointed that he would \n     suggest that freedom of speech does not apply to us, but it \n     applies to the people who agree with him,'' Mr. Kangas said.\n                                  ____\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 17, 1999]\n\n                     Soft Money's Multifaceted Foe\n\n                        (By Don Van Natta, Jr.)\n\n       Washington.--Charles Kolb may be this city's most unlikely \n     champion of campaign finance reform. A conservative lawyer \n     who worked on domestic policy in the Bush White House, Kolb \n     acknowledges that he never expected to be doing what he is \n     doing now.\n       As president of the Committee for Economic Development, a \n     group of chief executives and academic leaders committed to \n     public policy changes, Kolb leads its fight against soft \n     money, those unlimited contributions to political parties \n     that have come to exemplify the capital's cash-flush \n     influence industry.\n       ``I personally came at this with a deregulatory \n     viewpoint,'' explained Kolb, who is 48, ``But the more I \n     studied it, the more concerned I became about the appearance \n     of influence-peddling, the quid pro quos. There should be \n     access to politicians, but I don't think you need to pay a \n     toll to get it.''\n       He paused to catch his breath. ``I have become something of \n     a radical on this subject,'' he said.\n       Trim and energetic, Kolb may look like just one more sharp-\n     dressed politician or lobbyist--until he opens his mouth. He \n     speaks in eloquent, perfectly formed paragraphs about the \n     need to change a federal election system that some analysts \n     say may cost $3 billion in 2000.\n       As the leader of a fiercely nonpartisan group, Kolb says \n     the organization does not reflect his biases. ``If it did, I \n     wouldn't be doing my job,'' he said. Still, his friends are \n     not surprised that, as a champion of noble causes, he has \n     embraced its position on campaign finance reform.\n       Upon leaving the Bush administration, where he was deputy \n     assistant to the president for domestic policy, Kolb wrote a \n     book whose title communicated its author's intense \n     disappointment: ``The White House Daze: The Unmaking of \n     Domestic Policy in the Bush Years'' (Free Press, 1993). The \n     path that led Kolb to his current post also wound through law \n     and charity.\n       ``I've never worried about answering the question, `What do \n     you want to do with your life?' '' Kolb said. He has a one-\n     word explanation for his good fortune: serendipity.\n       Business executives consider it serendipitous that Kolb \n     took the post at the Committee for Economic Development in \n     September 1997. He is its fourth president in 57 years, and \n     his predecessor held the job for 31 years. Several trustees \n     credited Kolb with invigorating the organization.\n       The committee is an independent research organization that \n     recommends economic and social policies. Its board includes \n     executives of General Motors, Xerox, Merck and Sara Lee.\n       Despite the organization's growing momentum, Kolb has \n     occasionally found it difficult to persuade executives to \n     publicly endorse a soft-money ban. They worry that their \n     endorsement will hurt their corporations on Capitol Hill.\n       ``When Charlie talks with most CEOs, they are very \n     sympathetic, very supportive,'' said Michael J. Petro, the \n     committee's director of business and government policy. ``But \n     then they say, `Let me put you in touch with our Washington \n     guys,' '' who often try to kill the idea.\n       Kolb blamed what he calls the capital's cottage industry of \n     money and influence. ``The people who favor the status quo \n     are the people who hand out the checks and the people who \n     cash the checks,'' he said.\n       Kolb always wanted to practice law. It was what other men \n     in his family had done. He went to Princeton, then to Balliol \n     College at Oxford University, where he received a master's \n     degree in philosophy, politics and economics.\n       At Oxford, he met the academic who had the most influence \n     on his life, Sir Isaiah Berlin, the renowned historian who \n     died in 1997 at 88. ``What he taught me is there is no excuse \n     for arrogance,'' Kolb said. He once invited Berlin to tea in \n     Kolb's dormitory room. ``And for four hours, the leading \n     philosopher of this century sat on my bed and sipped his tea \n     and talked with me.''\n       Kolb earned a law degree at the University of Virginia, and \n     after practicing at two Washington law firms, joined the \n     Office of Management and Budget. He then moved to the \n     Education Department, where he met his wife, Ingrid. (They \n     now have a 2-year-old daughter, Charlotte.) In 1990, he \n     joined the White House, working on domestic economic, \n     education, legal and regulatory issues. After that, he spent \n     five years as general counsel of the United Way.\n       On his desk, Kolb displays evidence of his freedom from \n     partisanship: a canceled check for $250 that Kolb wrote on \n     Nov. 1, 1996, to the re-election campaign of Sen. Mitch \n     McConnell, R-Ky., an ardent opponent of changes in the \n     campaign finance laws.\n       Last summer, McConnell took on Kolb's organization, writing \n     a blistering letter to as many as 20 executives who had \n     endorsed a soft-money ban. McConnell accused the group of \n     trying to ``eviscerate private sector participation in \n     politics'' by imposing ``anti-business speech controls.''\n       At the bottom of most letters, McConnell scribbled a \n     message that some executives regarded as a threat: ``I hope \n     you will resign from CED.''\n       Kolb responded sharply. ``I think it was an abuse of \n     senatorial authority,'' he said. ``It did a lot to convey to \n     the public what this fight is all about.''\n       In the end, McConnell's smash-mouth tactics backfired. \n     Publicity about the letter helped the organization recruit \n     more executives, doubling its ranks. Now, 212 executives have \n     endorsed the soft-money ban. And not one executive resigned.\n       With a smile, Kolb said, ``It is far better to be attacked \n     than to be ignored.''\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, far from having its intended effect, the \nSenator from Kentucky's letter, which many believe smacks of \nintimidation, seems to have emboldened CED and its membership. At last \ncount, 212 business and civic leaders have endorsed the CED report, and \nnot a single member of CED has resigned in response to the Senator from \nKentucky's tactics. Not a single one.\n  It was amazing to me, Mr. President, that we heard Senators on the \nfloor during the campaign finance debate questioning whether our \ncurrent system is corrupting. But the Senate has heard me talk about \nthe corruption of the system a lot. It's no surprise that I think this \nsystem has a corrupting influence on the Congress. But for those who \nare skeptical of this view, perhaps the words of the CED trustee who \nchaired the subcommittee that developed CED's recommendations on \ncampaign finance, will carry more weight. Listen to the words of Mr. \nEdward Kangas, who is the Chairman of Global Board of Directors of \nDeloitte Touche Tohmatsu, in an opinion piece in the New York Times \nthat appeared after the first days of our campaign finance debate here \nin the Senate.\n  ``You could almost hear the laughter coming from board rooms and \nexecutive suites all over the country when Senate opponents of \ncampaign-finance reform expressed dismay that anyone\n\n[[Page S13233]]\n\ncould think big political contributions are corrupting elections and \ngovernment.'' Mr. Kangas continues: ``For a growing number of \nexecutives, there's no question that the unrelenting pressure for five- \nand six-figure political contributions amounts to influence peddling \nand a corrupting influence. What has been called legalized bribery \nlooks like extortion to us.''\n\n  Mr. Kangas doesn't mince words on how the system appears to someone \nwho has been part of it. He says:\n\n       I know from personal experience and from other executives \n     that it's not easy saying no to appeals for cash from \n     powerful members of Congress or their operatives. Congress \n     can have a major impact on businesses. The solicitors know \n     it, and we know it. The threat may be veiled, but the message \n     is clear: failing to donate could hurt your company. You must \n     weigh whether you meet your responsibility to your \n     shareholders better by investing the money in the company or \n     by sending it to Washington.\n\n  This is an incredible indictment of the system that a minority of \nthis Senate is preserving through a filibuster. These words from a \nbusiness leader plainly and powerfully answer the arguments from the \nSenator from Kentucky and others that there is nothing corrupt or \ncorrupting about soft money. This is not some liberal ``do-gooder'' \nspeaking here. This is a respected business person, chairman of the \nBoard of Directors of an international accounting firm, a participant \nin this system.\n  He says, ``The threat may be veiled but the message is clear. Failing \nto donate could hurt your company.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full op-ed by Mr. Kangas appear in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       You could almost hear the laughter coming from board rooms \n     and executive suites all over the country when Senate \n     opponents of campaign-finance reform expressed dismay that \n     anyone could think big political contributions are corrupting \n     elections and government. On Tuesday, those opponents \n     prevailed, blocking a final vote this year on banning soft-\n     money contributions. But the innocent and benign system \n     described by the Senators arguing against reform hardly \n     passed the laugh test for those of us on the receiving end of \n     the soft-money shakedown.\n       For a growing number of executives, there's no question \n     that the unrelenting pressure for five- and six-figure \n     political contributions amounts to influence peddling and a \n     corrupting influence. What has been called legalized bribery \n     looks like extortion to us. The Senators who oppose reform \n     would be far more credible and receive a sympathetic ear if \n     they admitted the high cost of campaign force them to focus \n     on large contributors, rather than defending the system.\n       Congress passed laws that would put corporate executives in \n     jail for offering money to a foreign official in the course \n     of commerce. Now some of its members express bewilderment \n     when people note that there is something unseemly about \n     making large payments to the campaign committees of American \n     elected officials.\n       I know from personal experience and from other executives \n     that it's not easy saying no to appeals for cash from \n     powerful members of Congress or their operatives. Congress \n     can have a major impact on businesses. The solicitors know \n     it, and we know it. The threat may be veiled, but the message \n     is clear: failing to donate could hurt your company. You must \n     weigh whether you meet your responsibility to your \n     shareholders better by investing the money in the company or \n     by sending it to Washington.\n       Increasingly, fund-raisers also make sure you know that \n     your competitors have contributed, implying that you should \n     pay a toll in Washington to stay competitive.\n       Unlike individual donations, most large corporate \n     contributions aren't made as gestures of good will or for \n     ideological reasons. Corporations are thinking of the bottom \n     line. Will the contribution help or hurt the company? Despite \n     the protestations of some Senators, everyone knows big checks \n     get noticed.\n       Like most Americans, corporate executives also now know the \n     issue isn't really free speech. (You'll notice that the First \n     Amendment argument is more often made by the listeners, the \n     politicians, then by the speakers.) Companies don't question \n     their ability to speak forcefully. We have lobbyists and \n     trade associations, and we provide many jobs--all of which \n     help us to be heard. And, as salesmen, we resent the ideas \n     that the only way we can get a chance to make an effective \n     pitch about legislation is to pay a large fee.\n       One clear sign of the growing dissatisfaction of corporate \n     leaders with this pressure is the endorsement by more than \n     200 business and civic leaders of a campaign finance reform \n     plan made by the Committee for Economic Development, a group \n     of chief executives and academic leaders. This group, of \n     which I am a member, is not saying that all political \n     contributions are bad or corrupting. We know campaigns cost \n     money.\n       But we see what should be obvious to everyone. There's a \n     big difference between a $1,000 contribution--the current \n     limit on individuals' donations to a campaign--and a $50,000 \n     or $1 million check filtered through a party as ``soft \n     money.'' The potential for corruption is minimal at $1,000, \n     or even at the $3,000 level to which our reform plan would \n     raise individual contribution limits. But the unlimited \n     amounts that pour through the soft-money loophole are \n     dangerous.\n       Americans understand the influence of money. It's time to \n     give elections back to democracy's shareholders--the voters.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, CED is not the only business \norganization that supports campaign finance reform. The Campaign for \nAmerica is an organization founded by Jerome Kohlberg, former founding \npartner of the firm of Kohlberg, Kravitz. That organization sent us a \nletter during the recent campaign finance debate, signed by, among \nothers, Warren Buffet, Arjay Miller, who is the former President of \nFord Motor Company and Dean Emeritus of Stanford Business School, and \nBob Stuart, former Chair of Quaker Oats. These prestigious business \nleaders write: ``We believe the current soft money system works against \nthe public interest and against the interests of business. . . . \n[B]usiness and industry must have access and say in policy-making. But \nsoft money distorts the process.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Campaign for America and \nthese business leaders appear in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         Campaign for America,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 18, 1999.\n     Hon. Russ Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: As the Senate debates reforming the \n     way federal officials finance their campaigns, we hope you \n     will consider what the appropriate relationship between \n     government and business should be. We believe the soft money \n     loophole creates an improper conduit for corporate and union \n     money to flow in unlimited amounts through increasingly murky \n     channels into the political system. Speaking as business \n     people and as citizens, we urge you to support the McCain-\n     Feingold bill.\n       We believe meaningful reform will require fuller and more \n     timely disclosure of contributions and expenditures. It will \n     require all organizations trying to influence the outcome of \n     elections to play by the same rules as candidates. Above all, \n     meaningful reform will close the soft money loophole. Does \n     McCain-Feingold cure all the ills of our current system? No, \n     but it is a crucial first step.\n       We believe the current soft money system works against the \n     public interest and against the interests of business. \n     Congress must have input from business or it risks \n     legislating in a vacuum; business and industry must have \n     access and say in policy-making. But soft money distorts the \n     process.\n       American business traditionally places its faith in the \n     market. And while it is naive to think that the government \n     won't play a role in shaping the market, the soft money \n     system encourages companies to seek government intervention \n     in the market in an arbitrary and unfair way.\n       Congress enacted a law in 1907 to prevent corporations from \n     using corporate money to exert an undue influence on the \n     political process. In 1947 the Congress passed a similar \n     restriction on unions. The soft money loophole subverts these \n     laws. If soft money contributions are capped rather than \n     banned, the subversion of the principles behind these laws \n     will continue.\n       Some opponents of reform would have you believe the parties \n     will wither and die if the flow of soft money contributions \n     is cut off. But the soft money loophole can be closed without \n     starving candidates or parties of needed resources by \n     adjusting the hard money limits.\n       The Senate has an opportunity to find a consensus on the \n     appropriate process for financing federal campaigns. We urge \n     you to return to our citizens a system that is fair and \n     equitable. We urge you to oppose a filibuster and allow the \n     Senate an opportunity to vote for the McCain-Feingold bill.\n           Respectfully,\n         George T.

Mr. President, business support for campaign finance \nreform is real and it is growing. Businessmen are tired of being the \nfall guys of American politics. They are tired of seeing politicians \nwith their hands out for money. They are tired of the ever increasing \ndemand for ever larger checks. They are tired of the feeling like they \nare being shaken-down for their contributions, like political donations \nare a form of protection money.\n  They are tired of the public's perception that when business wins an \nargument in Congress it wasn't because its position was right but \nbecause they gave big soft money donations to the political parties. \nThat is certainly a risk with this particular Africa trade bill, as my \nCalling of the Bankroll at the beginning of this presentation showed.\n  I want to commend the leaders of the business community for joining \nthis cause, and standing up to the pressure from those who want to \npreserve this corrupt system. In the end, they are on the right side of \nthe issue, not only for business, but for the American people.\n  I have to ask my colleagues, Mr. President, how can this body \ncontinue to allow soft money contributions to flow to the political \nparties' warchests--unregulated, unchecked, and doing untold damage to \nthe public perception of the way we do business in this Chamber?\n  How long can we expect the public to put up with a U.S. Senate that \nrefuses to shut down such an egregious loophole, and chooses instead to \nperpetuate a soft money system that taints everything we do on this \nfloor?\n  That's right. I'll say it again. Everything we do on this floor is \ncalled into question by the soft money system. And that includes this \nAfrica and Caribbean trade bill. The $5 million in soft money \ncontributions by the industry coalition created supposedly to show \npublic support for this bill casts a shadow on this debate. It's the \n800 pound gorilla, as I've said before, that is sitting over there on \nthe floor and that we all ignore.\n  Until we close the soft money loophole, the shadow will get darker \nand darker, and the gorilla bigger and bigger. Until we close that \nloophole, our constituents have every right to be skeptical of whether \nwe work for them, or for the big contributors. Until we close that \nloophole, the concept of one person, one vote--a basic and fundamental \ntenet of our democracy--is in serious jeopardy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment No. 2335 be temporarily laid aside in order for Senator \nAshcroft of Missouri to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I object.\n  Mr. ROTH. I would say, if I might, to my distinguished colleague that \nwhile it takes unanimous consent for me to ask this, the leader of \ncourse could come down and accomplish the same result. So I hope the \ndistinguished Senator will not object.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I regret that objection because I think it \nis important that we be able to proceed with this most important \nlegislation.\n  This is legislation that has the support of both the Republican and \nDemocratic leadership. It has the support of the White House and the \nPresident. I am disappointed that we are unable to reach agreement to \nbegin the amendment process so that this most important legislation can \nbe acted upon in the remaining days.\n  I point out to the distinguished Senator from South Carolina that \nthis legislation was reported out by the Finance Committee in June of \nthis year. We had hoped action could be taken earlier, but the schedule \ndid not permit that.\n  Does the Senator from Missouri wish to speak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator from Delaware for his leadership, \nand I thank him for making the attempt to increase our capacity to \nserve America by allowing me to offer an amendment.\n  The measure that I am offering today is a measure that Democratic \nminority leader Senator Daschle, 31 cosponsors, and I had introduced as \nfree-standing legislation earlier this year. All of the cosponsors of \nthe measure have been strong advocates on behalf of American \nagriculture. We are addressing the ability of American agriculture to \nbe represented effectively in trade negotiations.\n  Currently, there is a temporary American Ambassador for agriculture \nin the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative so that America's \nfarmers and ranchers always have a representative at the table when the \nUnited States enters large trade negotiations. If we are worried about \nthe United States' balance of payments, we ought to elevate and try to \nincrease our number of exports.\n  Our farm community outproduces and outworks any farm producers around \nthe world. When trade agreements are negotiated, we need our farmers to \nbe represented there by a consistent, strong voice for agriculture.\n  The Senate Democratic minority leader, Senator Daschle, and I and 31 \ncosponsors introduced this free-standing bill, S. 185, because we \nthought it is essential to U.S. farm and trade policy. It is a bill, \nwhich as an amendment to this measure, ensures that our Nation's \nfarmers and ranchers have a permanent trade ambassador in the Office of \nthe U.S. Trade Representative. Let me express that once more to be very \nclear: We want to have a permanent agricultural trade ambassador in the \nOffice of the U.S. Trade Representative so whenever our Trade \nRepresentatives are making considerations about the kinds of agreements \nthat will govern the relationships between the United States and other \nnations as they relate to trade with agricultural products, an expert, \nclearly focused on, committed to, trained in, and abreast of the \ncircumstances in the agricultural community, will be right there at the \ntable advancing our interests.\n  This is very important, especially as we understand that our \nagricultural productivity far exceeds our ability to consume. In my \nhome State, between a quarter and a third of all the agricultural \nproducts produced must go into the international marketplace. I heard \nthe Senator from Illinois the other day talk about how that in his \nState over half of all the products are grown for shipment overseas. \nFor some commodities, such as soybeans, over half of those commodities \nmust be exported.\n  This is a simple concept. The placement in the Office of the U.S. \nTrade Representative of a permanent trade ambassador for agriculture \nhas broad bipartisan support in the Congress. It is supported by more \nthan 80 national farm organizations. And the administration supports \nit.\n  I talked recently with U.S. Trade Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky in a \nmeeting with the congressional ``WTO Caucus for Farmers and Ranchers.'' \nLet me explain. Senators Larry Craig and Byron Dorgan have assembled \npeople in the Congress who are concerned about agriculture's capacity \nto trade effectively and to get our products overseas. We have \norganized with their leadership this caucus, consisting of both Senate \nand House Members, to address agricultural issues in the upcoming World \nTrade Organization Seattle Round.\n  This fall in Seattle we are going to launch a new round of trade \nnegotiations. We have been seeking as a caucus of Members of the \nCongress to work with our trade ambassador, Ambassador Barshefsky, to \nsay we want to make sure we in the Congress cooperate so that when any \ntrade agreements are finally reached, the Senate is in a better \nposition not only to understand\n\n[[Page S13235]]\n\nthem but also to approve them if at all possible.\n\n  I was delighted that when we discussed this need for a permanent \nagricultural trade ambassador within the Office of the Trade \nRepresentative, Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky endorsed the program \nfully. She said this initiative is very important.\n  I described the fact we have the WTO round of trade talks starting in \nlate November in Seattle. I want to communicate the urgency to get this \nprovision we are offering today enacted into law before the Seattle \nRound kicks off. I think Senator Daschle understands, the other 31 \ncosponsors understand, the members of the WTO trade caucus understand, \nand the White House understands the urgency of having agricultural \nissues fully represented at the table. That is why the administration \nsupports this. That is why I am pleased to have been an original \ncosponsor with the minority leader, Tom Daschle, on this proposal in \nFebruary because we all understand the importance of this proposal.\n  Ambassador Barshefsky went on to say:\n\n       Ensuring that the United States has a permanent trade \n     ambassador will put U.S. farmers in a stronger position in \n     the Seattle round of the WTO negotiations that will begin \n     late this fall.\n\n  Ambassador Barshefsky pointed out that when she assumed the position \nof the U.S. Trade Representative, she appointed Peter Scher as a \nspecial trade negotiator for agriculture. He has been the voice for \nAmerica's farmers and ranchers at the negotiating table, and he has \nbeen doing a wonderful job advocating positions that will advance the \nstrength of their interests internationally. However, his position was \nan administration decision and an appointment as opposed to being a \npermanent position in the law.\n  The bill we introduced and the amendment I am offering today makes \nhis position permanent, subject to Senate approval, of course. Our \nfarmers need a representative in the Office of the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative who will focus solely on opening foreign markets, \nensuring a level playing field for U.S. agricultural products and \nservices, and representing the interests of American farmers, the most \nproductive of all of our sectors of our economy. The opportunity to do \nthat is not only ripe and ready, it is necessary now because we are \nlooking the WTO round in the face. We need to achieve this objective.\n  In September 1998, American farmers and ranchers faced the first ever \nmonthly trade deficit for U.S. farm and food products since the United \nStates began tracking trade data in 1941. This sounds an alarm for \nStates such as my home State of Missouri. We receive over one-fourth of \nour farm income from agricultural exports. Already this year the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture has reported the value of agricultural \nexports has dropped by over $5 billion since this time last year. We \nneed to be promoting and developing ways of exporting more of the food \nand fiber we grow in this country. At best, the total agricultural \nexports will be $49 billion in 1999. This is a reduction from total \nagricultural exports of $60 billion 3 years ago. We cannot afford to be \nin a situation where we are vastly increasing productivity and \nproduction and curtailing our farmers' amount of exports opportunities. \nWe desperately need to enhance the level of exports for our farmers. We \nneed to make permanent the position of agricultural trade ambassador \nwithin the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.\n  Also, our agricultural trade surplus totaled $26.8 billion just 3 \nyears ago. By last year, that amount had dropped by almost 50 percent. \nThis year, our annual agricultural trade surplus will have dwindled to \nabout $12 billion.\n  The bottom line is we need more attention focused on farmers' \ncompetitiveness overseas. We need to make this a policy priority. Our \npriorities need to be reflected in the level of the resources we deploy \nto do this job of opening markets for farmers and ranchers.\n  When I am thinking about the Nation's trade policy, especially about \nagriculture, I ask myself what is good for the State of Missouri. In \nsome significant measure, Missouri happens to be a leader in farming. \nWe are the State with the second highest number of farms--second only \nto Texas. We have just about every crop imaginable. Missouri is among \nthe Nation's top producers in almost all crops. We are second in terms \nof beef cows. We are second in hay production. Missouri is one of the \ntop five pork-producing States. Missouri is also among the top 10 \nStates for the production of cotton, rice, corn, winter wheat, milk, \nand watermelon. With 26 percent of the income in our State coming from \nexports, our Missouri farmers, like farmers from sea to shining sea, \nneed to know that their ability to export will expand over time rather \nthan become subject to foreign protectionist policies that choke them \nout of their market share.\n\n  During the 1996 farm bill debate, in exchange for decreased \nGovernment payments, our farmers were promised more export \nopportunities. It is time for us to deliver on that promise.\n  America's farmers and ranchers need a permanent agriculture \nambassador who will represent their interests worldwide, especially as \nwe face more negotiations in the World Trade Organization, and also as \nwe have regional negotiations with both Central and South America \nprogressing. There are a lot of opportunities that could be opened up \nto our farmers and ranchers in the coming years. We need to have \nsomeone at the door, always pressing for those opportunities.\n  Under the legislation which the minority leader and I and 31 others \nintroduced this year, the agricultural ambassador would be responsible \nfor conducting trade negotiations and enforcing trade agreements \nrelating to U.S. agricultural products and services. Also under the \nlegislation, the ambassador must be a vigorous advocate on behalf of \nU.S. agricultural interests.\n  It is imperative, in my judgment, that U.S. interests always have a \nstrong, clear voice at the table in international negotiations. Foreign \ncountries will always have agriculture trade barriers. We need to send \nthe message to foreign governments we are serious about breaking down \nbarriers to their markets, so that our farmers and ranchers will be put \non more of a level playing field.\n  Canada and Mexico have already concluded free trade agreements with \nChile, for example. Farmers in Canada can send their agricultural \nproducts to Chile, and in most instances Canadian farmers face a zero \ntariff level. Our farmers, on the other hand, are confronted with an \n11-percent tariff. That makes it very difficult for us to be \ncompetitive. The E.U. is negotiating a trade deal with Mexico, Chile, \nArgentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Thus, these countries will \ngive European farmers more access to their markets at the expense of \nU.S. farmers and ranchers. We can not afford to wait. America must \nlead, not follow, especially in our own backyard in the Western \nHemisphere, but certainly even around the world.\n  The agricultural ambassador amendment we are offering today is \nsupported by more than 80 agricultural trade associations. \nAdditionally, State branches of these national associations such as the \nMissouri Farm Bureau Federation and the Missouri Pork Producers Council \nare weighing in with their strong support.\n  We need to utilize every opportunity we have to help our farmers and \nranchers in America. Making permanent the position of U.S. Trade \nRepresentative for agriculture, we are guaranteed the interests of \nAmerican farmers and ranchers will always have a prominent status and \nwill ensure that our agreements are more aggressively enforced.\n  It is with this in mind, and because of what I believe is the \noverwhelming consensus on this measure, the bipartisan nature of it, \nand the pressing need for it for this year's WTO round, which will \nbegin in Seattle later this fall, that I wanted to bring this amendment \nto the floor and offer it. I believe this Senate will overwhelmingly \nendorse this commonsense proposal which has such strong bipartisan \nsupport, which is supported by the Administration, and which would \nrender such great service to the farmers and ranchers of the United \nStates of America who lead America in productivity and who can lead \nAmerica in terms of our balance of trade and exports.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter detailing the list of the national organizations, American \nfarmers, and ranchers supporting the amendment, and I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S13236]]\n\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 October 19, 1999.\n     Hon. John Ashcroft,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Ashcroft: Thank you for introducing S. 185 \n     which establishes a permanent Chief Agricultural Negotiator \n     in the Office of the United States Trade Representative \n     (USTR). Agriculture plays a significant and positive role in \n     the balance of U.S. trade. As we prepare for the next round \n     of negotiations in the World Trade Organization (WTO) it is \n     important that the interests of U.S. agriculture be given \n     special emphasis.\n       Agricultural trade will be a primary focus in the next WTO \n     round. U.S. farmers and ranchers are dependent upon the \n     continued expansion of agricultural exports and opening of \n     foreign markets. The issue of foreign agricultural trade \n     barriers continues to grow and is often unique and difficult \n     to resolve. The result of the next round of negotiations will \n     have a major effect on the future of U.S. agriculture. The \n     enactment of this legislation will send a message to the \n     member countries of the WTO that the U.S. is serious about \n     agriculture. It will place a permanent advocate and \n     specialist at the negotiating table on behalf of U.S. \n     agricultural interests and establish a position that will be \n     responsible for enforcing trade agreements relating to U.S. \n     agriculture.\n       We pledge our support for S. 185 and look forward to \n     working with you to ensure its passage.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Cotton Shippers Association, American Farm Bureau \n     Federation, American Feed Industry Association, American Meat \n     Institute, American Soybean Association, Animal Health \n     Institute, Cenex Harvest States, CF Industries, Chicago Board \n     of Trade, Corn Refiners Association, Inc., Farmland \n     Industries, Inc., Florida Phosphate Council.\n       Idaho Barley Commission, International Dairy Foods \n     Association, National Association of Wheat Growers, National \n     Association of Animal Breeders, National Cattlemen's Beef \n     Association, National Chicken Council, National Corn Growers \n     Association, National Cotton Council, National Farmers Union, \n     National Grain Sorghum producers, National Grange, National \n     Milk Producers Federation.\n       National Pork Producers Council, National Sunflower \n     Association, Nestle USA, Northwest Horticultural Council, \n     Novartis Corporation, The Fertilizer Institute, United Fresh \n     Fruit & Vegetable Association, US Apple Association, US \n     Canola Association, US Dairy Export Council, US Rice \n     Producers Association, US Wheat Associates, US Rice \n     Federation, Wheat Export Trade Education Committee.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, first of all, let me commend the \ndistinguished Senator from Missouri for his leadership on agricultural \ntrade issues. I congratulate him for his knowledge, for his leadership \non these issues, and the effectiveness with which he deals with them. I \nwant him to know I rise in strong support of his amendment.\n  The USTR has had an agricultural ambassador at USTR. In my judgment, \nit has been a most effective tool for furthering our agricultural trade \ninterests. It is my position that making this a permanent position \nwould be good policy, well deserved by the agricultural sector which, \nof course, has consistently fought for trade liberalization.\n  Again, I congratulate the distinguished Senator from Missouri and say \nI look forward to working with him on this critical issue.\n  Mr. President, I will take this opportunity to address some of the \narguments that have been raised during the debate today and earlier. \nThey were worthy arguments that merit our attention. But I do believe \nthe proponents of this legislation have a more than adequate response.\n  One of the questions that has been raised is, Why take this bill up \nnow? Some of my colleagues have questioned why we are. Let me help them \nby putting this in context.\n  Section 134 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, which passed the \nCongress in 1994, just 5 years ago, directed the President to develop a \ncomprehensive trade and development policy for the countries of Africa. \nThat provision originated with Senator Daschle, now the distinguished \nminority leader. In the statement of administrative action that \naccompanied the act, the President made it very clear the first \nmeasures he intended to consider in complying with that congressional \nmandate were measures to:\n\n       . . . remove impediments to U.S. trade with and investment \n     in Africa, including enhancements in the GSP program, for the \n     least developed countries.\n\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished leader here. I am happy to \nyield to the distinguished leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2335 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I now withdraw the pending amendment, No. \n2335.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment is \nwithdrawn.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2340 to Amendment No. 2334\n\n(Purpose: To establish a Chief Agricultural Negotiator in the Office of \n                the United States Trade Representative)\n\n  Mr. Lott. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nSenator Ashcroft and others and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott] for Mr. Ashcroft, \n     for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Burns, Mr. \n     Brownback, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Robb, \n     Mr. Craig, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Helms, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n     Inouye, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Thomas, Ms. \n     Collins, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. McConnell, Mr. \n     Johnson, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Grams, Mr. Allard, Mr. \n     Hutchinson, Mr. Bond, Mr. Enzi, and Mr. Crapo, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2340 to amendment No. 2334.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . CHIEF AGRICULTURAL NEGOTIATOR.\n\n       (a) Establishment of a Position.--There is established the \n     position of Chief Agricultural Negotiator in the Office of \n     the United States Trade Representative. The Chief \n     Agricultural Negotiator shall be appointed by the President, \n     with the rank of Ambassador, by and with the advice and \n     consent of the Senate.\n       (b) Functions.--The primary function of the Chief \n     Agricultural Negotiator shall be to conduct trade \n     negotiations and to enforce trade agreements relating to U.S. \n     agricultural products and services. The Chief Agricultural \n     Negotiator shall be a vigorous advocate on behalf of U.S. \n     agricultural interests. The Chief Agricultural Negotiator \n     shall perform such other functions as the United States Trade \n     Representative may direct.\n       (c) Compensation.--The Chief Agricultural Negotiator shall \n     be paid at the highest rate of basic pay payable to a member \n     of the Senior Executive Service.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before I yield the floor for discussion of \nthis amendment, let me reiterate to my colleagues my hope we can \ncontinue to consider trade-related amendments to this important African \ntrade CBI legislation.\n  I know earlier Senator Reid offered and debated a trade-related \namendment. I think that was the right approach. I thank him for doing \nthat. I encourage all Members who have amendments relating to the \npending subject to work with the managers who are here, ready to work, \nhave their amendments offered and disposed of.\n  Again, this amendment has, I believe, very broad support across the \naisle. I think it is the right thing to do, and I am still anxious for \nus to find a way to get to cloture so we can have the final amending \nprocess and debate on this bill and pass it.\n  This would be a major step for the Senate. Of course, then we still \nhave to go to conference with the House, which has a very different \napproach from ours to this legislation. It will be a tough conference. \nBut this legislation is supported by the managers on both sides of the \naisle, by myself, by Senator Daschle, I believe, and by the President. \nI hope we can continue to look to find a way to move this legislation \nto a conclusion.\n  We can get cloture on Friday, and then I believe by Tuesday or \nWednesday of next week, we could be completed with this legislation. We \nwill continue to work to seek a way to achieve that. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I share the majority leader's desire to \nfinish this legislation. I have indicated publicly I want to work with \nhim to find a way to resolve the matters that are outstanding so we can \nget to final passage. It is regrettable that the tree was filled before \na single amendment could be debated and disposed. The majority\n\n[[Page S13237]]\n\nleader and I have had conversations in the past, and he is, I am sure, \nsensitive to the knowledge that this tactic compels Democrats to oppose \ncloture in order to protect the right of Members to offer an amendment.\n  Filling the tree actually frustrates the majority leader's stated \nintention of speedy passage. We could have had a number of amendments \ntoday. That has been precluded now because we are in this situation \nwhere Senators are prohibited from offering amendments. It is pointless \nto fill the tree now. We could have allowed amendments for at least 2 \ndays while cloture ripened. If amendments and a good debate and votes \nwere allowed, I think we could have built support for cloture. Under \nthe circumstances, however, there will continue to be a pent-up \nfrustration due to the inability on the part of Senators on both sides \nof the aisle to offer amendments.\n  In a sense, filling the tree plays into the hands of the opponents of \nthe legislation. Democrats can never support preemptive filling of the \ntree or preemptive filing of cloture because I think, in large measure, \nit is a real affront to the rights of every Senator who wishes to play \na part in any debate in this body. While I oppose many of the \namendments that could be contemplated and could be offered, I support a \nSenator's right to offer them.\n  The majority leader said today he believed he only filled the tree \nonce before in 1999. In fact, this is the seventh time this year he has \nresorted to this approach. There were six previous occasions: March 8, \n1999, S. 280, the Education Flexibility Act; April 22, 1999, Social \nSecurity lockbox; April 27, 1999, the Y2K Act; April 30, 1999, S. 557, \nSocial Security lockbox; June 15, 1999, Social Security lockbox; and \nJuly 16, 1999, Social Security lockbox.\n  In addition, of course, the majority leader has twice preemptively \nfiled cloture on measures immediately after calling them up and then \nmoved to other business in order to prevent amendments or debate. That \noccurred on June 16, 1999, on H.R. 1259, the Social Security and \nMedicare Safe Deposit Act, and on September 21, 1999, on S. 625, the \nBankruptcy Reform Act.\n  After using these coercive tactics on all of these occasions, I would \nhope we might learn that they do not work. We do not operate under the \nrules of the House. We must insist on Senators' rights to offer \namendments, even if we ultimately will reject those amendments.\n  That is not to say that dilatory tactics that go on and on are \nsomething that I will support. I will support cloture at some point. \nBut I also support strongly the right of a Senator on the other side of \nthe aisle or a Senator on this side of the aisle to offer an amendment, \nrelevant or not relevant, at least initially.\n  I respect the Senator's decisions as I always do. I just differ with \nhim in this case. It seems to me if we want to kill this bill, this is \nthe way to do it. If we want to pass the bill, then it seems to me the \nmajority of Democrats will join with the majority of Republicans in \nfinding a way with which to deal with these amendments and ultimately \npass this legislation. We can do it, but if we are going to do it, we \nhave to take down this tree. It has to happen sooner rather than later \nso we do not waste any more time than we have already.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I can respond for a moment further, this \nis a trade bill. This is a bill the Senate would like to pass, I \nbelieve. We tried to do fast-track legislation. I believe that was last \nyear or maybe the year before. We did not quite get that done.\n  This is a major opportunity for us to do something that will be good \nfor America, good for our individual States and constituents, I \nbelieve, and good for the Central American countries, the Caribbean \narea, and Africa.\n  It is a trade bill. The idea that Senators on both sides of the aisle \nwould bring up issues which would clearly deadlock the Senate and make \nit highly unlikely that we could get to a reasonable conclusion at a \ntime when we are approaching the end of the session--I have already \nbeen told of Senators' desires to offer an amendment dealing with \nsanctions and their support for a sanctions bill on this side. I \nunderstand Senators on the other side said: If you don't offer it, we \nwill offer it.\n  Clearly, that is an issue we do need to get into. The question of how \nwe deal with sanctions, particularly agricultural sanctions, needs to \nbe thought through carefully. The relevant committees would get into \nthat, have hearings, give thought to it, and have a bill reported out \nwhich we could take up, in and of itself, separately in the next \nsession of this Congress next year.\n  I had a Senator indicate he wants to offer fast track to this bill \nwhich, by the way, I support. At least it is a free trade amendment. It \nclearly is one that will cause a great deal of consternation on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle, perhaps on both sides of the aisle.\n  Plus, I was told by Senator Wellstone he wanted an agricultural \namendment. I have been told there is a gun amendment pending, even \nthough we spent 2 weeks debating juvenile justice and gun amendments \nearlier this year. I was told three Senators might be looking at \ncampaign finance reform again.\n  Basically to empty our out basket on issues we have already voted on \nthis year causes tremendous problems and delays in completing this very \nimportant trade legislation.\n  I will be glad, once again, to enter a unanimous consent agreement \nthat we go forward and consider first-degree amendments, relevant \namendments, on the trade bill. There are a lot of amendments that \nSenators want to offer that relate to the bill before us.\n  To the American people, do you understand me? The complaint is: We \ncannot debate gun amendments, agricultural sanctions, and farm \namendments on a trade bill, on a bill that has bipartisan support and \nPresidential urging. I realize it may be within the rules, but I do not \nthink it is a way to get this bill done.\n  I hope we can keep looking for a way to move it forward. I do not \nwant to be in a position of trying to give aid and comfort to the \nopposition to this legislation. Obviously, that is not my preference, \nbut Senator Hollings is going to avail himself of the rules and he will \nbe very willing to help other Senators who want to offer extraneous \namendments if that will be helpful to his cause.\n  He is smiling and I am smiling because I know exactly what he is up \nto. He is doing an excellent job in trying to stop this legislation he \nhas made clear he is opposed to. That is the way the Senate works. If \none feels strongly and one Senator is willing to spend the time and use \nthe rules, he can cause problems and delay a bill.\n  As far as using the tree, I did not invent the process. I must \nconfess, I was surprised it has been used as much as it has this year. \nIt has been a longer year than I thought, perhaps, or maybe it is a \nbetter tool than I had remembered.\n  Still, I will work with the managers of the bill and Senator Daschle, \nand if there is a key to unlock this bill to get it to its conclusion, \nI am willing to look for it. I hope we will not, though, as I said, \nempty out our baskets on both sides of the aisle and come up with \neverything we have been harboring in our heart of hearts over the past \nweeks or months.\n  Let's keep our eye on the bill. This is a big, important bill. There \nare countries all over the world looking at us saying: Will they keep \ntheir word? The President has gone to Central America, I believe, \ntwice--I know for sure once--and said he wants this; we want to help \nthe Caribbean Basin countries and the Central American countries.\n  I know he wants to do that, and so do I. I have been there. I have \nmet with the Presidents. I have met with the Ambassadors. They are \ndesperate for help. The good thing about it is this is a way we can \nhelp them and help ourselves.\n  In my State, we are going to produce the cotton. We are going to put \nthe fabric together and ship it to Central America through a port. They \nare going to finish off the product, send it back to the port, and it \nis going to be available to the American people at a reasonable price.\n  Everybody wins: American product, American workers, American dock \nworkers, Central American jobs, then back to America where American \nconsumers will get a fair price for this material. That is just one \nexample. And there are many others.\n  So I certainly understand what Senator Daschle is saying. I know \nthere is\n\n[[Page S13238]]\n\na pent-up demand to offer these various and sundry amendments. I \nunderstand that, but I do not feel I have any particular obligation to \ngo out of my way to accommodate that.\n  Sooner or later, the time will come when these things are going to \ncome up, one way or the other. I indicated to Senator Wellstone, I \nwould like to know the details of what his amendment is to see if maybe \nit could be brought up freestanding. I am not so sure we would not want \nto just say, OK, bring it up. Let's have some limited debate and vote \non it. But if you open that door, where and when does it end?\n  To spend a week on this bill, I was prepared to do that. To spend 2 \nweeks on it, I am not sure we want to do that. We have to be able to \nbring an end to this by Tuesday or Wednesday of next week.\n  That enables and strengthens the hand of the Senator from South \nCarolina. He knows that we are not willing to run this train endlessly. \nIf we had 2 or 3 weeks, we could grind it down. But I hope that we \nwould not have to do that because we do have some other issues that \npeople on both sides of the aisle do want to do. We need to try to see \nif we can work out a way to do it.\n  Well, I am repeating myself. I understand what Senator Daschle is \nsaying, and I understand the frustration. But the way to get this done \nis to continue to see if we can work out an agreement, and then get \ncloture Friday. Sixty votes; we are going to get probably 52, 53 \nRepublicans who will vote for cloture to go on to the substance of the \nbill. If we can get 6 or 8 or 10 Democrats--just 6 or 8 or 10--that is \nall it would take, and we would be on this bill, and we would be done \nwith it by next Wednesday. That is a worthy goal. I hope we can achieve \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me make the majority leader an offer.\n  He says, if there is a way to work this out, we can do it. I think he \ncould get 30 Democratic votes, maybe even 40, on cloture on Friday if \nwe tear down the tree and allow amendments to be offered.\n  We are talking about two things. We are talking about a Member's \nright to offer amendments, but we are also talking about the worthiness \nof the amendment on this particular issue, as the majority leader has \nstated now on several occasions, rightfully so.\n  I would be willing to join with the majority leader in doing one of \ntwo things. Our predecessors came up with some ingenious ways with \nwhich leadership can deal with amendments they don't want to see \nadded--tabling motions and second degree amendments.\n  I would be willing to work with the majority leader on tabling \nmotions and on second degrees in order to deal with amendments that he \nand I do not believe are meritorious. And I can already see the wheels \nturning. He is thinking: Well, there's going to be a difference between \nwhat he thinks and I think. But I believe we can work that out. I think \nwe could have an understanding, even ahead of time, about what that \nmeans. But it would give Senator Hollings, it would give Senator \nWellstone, it would give Senator Ashcroft, it would give everyone who \nhas an amendment the opportunity to offer amendments. The relevant \nones, the pertinent ones, we ought to support. The ones that are not in \nkeeping with the spirit of this legislation, we might choose to oppose.\n  I am prepared to work with the majority leader to see if we might \nfind a way to accommodate that. I want to see this bill pass. The \nPresident has insisted that we do all that we can to pass it. Our \nranking member and the chairman have done all that they can to get us \nto this point. It passed by voice vote out of the Finance Committee. \nThere ought to be a way we can get this done, if not in the timeframe \nthat the majority leader has suggested, certainly in not too long a \nperiod after that.\n  But I have to oppose cloture under these circumstances. And there \nwill not be, I would hope, a Democratic defection on cloture because we \nare not talking now about CBI; we are talking about a Member's right to \noffer an amendment. And I hope there isn't a Democrat who will say that \nthat right isn't worth protecting under any circumstances.\n  So that is my offer. I am prepared to sit down this afternoon. We can \nfind a way to do this. This isn't it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2340\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to address the pending amendment \nput forward by Senator Ashcroft.\n  Both leaders were previously up and talking on the floor about moving \nthe bill forward. I think the underlying Ashcroft amendment is actually \na pretty good way to move things forward.\n  It is something about which most of the parties agree. It is about an \nambassador position at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. I think \nthat is an important and worthy goal. I do not know of anybody here who \nactually opposes it. I know the chairman of the Finance Committee has \nspoken already in favor of it. Here is a way maybe we can start to move \nthis train forward.\n  I want to address it from a couple of perspectives, if I could, \nbecause I think this is an important aspect for my colleagues to listen \nand learn a little bit about.\n  This is at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office, which is our lead \ntrade negotiator. We are going into the Seattle Round, which the United \nStates will be hosting, of the World Trade Organization. This is the \npremier set of trade talks.\n  Agriculture is the lead issue that is going to be discussed during \nthis round of trade talks. We do not have a permanent ag negotiator at \nthe U.S. Trade Representative's Office. So we are going into trade \nnegotiations, which the United States is hosting, where the lead issue \nis agriculture and we do not have an ambassador with permanent status.\n  That amendment is something I think most people in this body would \nactually support, perhaps unanimously. I hope we can move this bill \nforward.\n  I am glad that we are having some discussions about how we might be \nable to move this bill forward.\n  Here is a pretty simple, commonsense amendment. Most of our States \nhave some agriculture in them. Here would be a representative who could \nhelp us make that trade go forward.\n  This position within the U.S. Trade Representative's Office has been \nestablished on an interim basis. It was not put in on a permanent \nbasis. It was thought: Let's try this for a little period of time. It \nhas proven to be effective.\n  My State of Kansas is a major agricultural exporting State. I think \nwe are sixth in the country as far as agricultural exports. It is a key \npart of our economy. Being able to export food products is an important \npart of what we do, as well. So to be able to have somebody with an \nambassador status to be able to address these sorts of trade \nnegotiating issues at the USTR is important to my State. It is very \nimportant.\n  It is particularly important now when we are having so much \ndifficulty with farm prices. Almost all of that is due to our inability \nto crack into markets around the world. Whether it is dealing with \nChina and some of their trade barriers, whether it is dealing with the \nEuropeans and their trade subsidies, their export subsidies, whether it \nis dealing with tariffs globally, the United States faces high \nagricultural tariffs around the world.\n  The United States has some of the lowest agricultural tariffs. This \ntrade ambassador would make this a central focus. It would be her or \nhis job to make sure we keep focused on that particular issue. That is \nan important one. It is vitally important in this body. It is important \nacross this country, and it is certainly important to my State.\n  I think it would be an important signal for us to send to the other \ncountries around the world that will be convening in Seattle the latter \npart of November, the first part of December; that the United States \nvalues agriculture; that the signal we are sending is: We are going to \nbeef up the status of the people who we have negotiating agricultural \nissues. We are going to do so on a permanent basis.\n  I think, to date, a lot of times other countries have doubted our \nresolve on some issues, maybe questioned our willingness to hang in \nthere. And here\n\n[[Page S13239]]\n\nis the signal to send: No. This is important. We are going to stay in \nthere. We are going to stick with this particular issue.\n  This is another way we can send that signal. This amendment makes \nthis a clear priority for the United States; that we establish this on \na permanent basis.\n  Agriculture is a lead export industry for the United States. Some \nhave different figures, but either the top or the second leading export \nof the United States is agriculture and food products. One would think \nyou would have somebody of an ambassadorial status who would be our \nlead negotiator and could speak with some authority and have not only \nthe title but the status to be able to do so. This amendment is \nstraightforward. This person will exist at the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative's Office and have a permanent ambassadorial rank.\n  It sends an important signal, not only to our trade opponents \nagriculturally around the world; it sends an important signal to our \nagricultural producers in this country. My parents, my brother who \nfarms full time, we say to them, it is important we have somebody of \nstatus dealing with agricultural trade upon which you are so dependent \nfor your livelihood.\n  I think many times farmers in this country, particularly after the \npassage of the Freedom to Farm Act, said Freedom to Farm won't work \nunless you have freedom to aggressively market. Freedom to market means \nwe have to pound open doors around the world to let our farmers and \nproducers have a fair shot. This helps send a signal to our farmers \nthat we meant it.\n  We meant it when we said freedom to farm also means we are also going \nto push freedom to market. Freedom to market means you have to be able \nto get your foot in the door. Right now they can't get their foot in \nthe door in a lot of places. We have sanctions on a number of countries \naround the world. We also have high tariffs on a number of places \naround the world. This sends a signal to our farmers, the agricultural \nindustry, to our agricultural processors, and our agricultural \nexporters that we deem this to be an important topic as well. I think \nit is altogether appropriate for us to want that.\n  We do have people at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office who are \nvery supportive of agriculture, but there are thousands of different \nissues to deal with of an export nature. They go across many different \nindustries. It is impossible for the U.S. Trade Representative to \nconstantly keep a strong focus on the lead export industry in the \ncountry. They have a lot of other matters with which to deal. This will \nhelp keep that focus there within the U.S. Trade Representative's \nOffice as well and do so on a permanent basis.\n  I rise to speak on behalf of this particular industry, on behalf of \nthis particular position. I think it sends the right signal to our \nopponents who are against us in agricultural trade. I think it sends \nthe right signal to our allies who want to open up agricultural trade \nopportunities that we think it is important. I think it sends a good \nsignal to our agricultural producers that we deem this as important and \nthat freedom to farm, to work, has to have freedom to market on top of \nthat. I think that works well.\n  Clearly, a majority of the body wants to pass this bill. A \nsupermajority of this body wants to pass this bill. This is an \nimportant trade initiative the chairman and ranking member have put \nforward. This amendment could help us move forward because it is an \namendment which is probably unanimously supported. So as a facilitating \neffort, to try to move the total package forward, I think this one is a \ngood start. I submit to my colleagues and to the leadership it is a \ngood possibility.\n  I commend the chairman of the Finance Committee for the excellent \nwork he has done on agricultural trade issues, which is important to \nhis State as well, supporting this particular amendment and putting \ntogether a very important trade bill. I hope to be a part of the \nprocess to make sure it moves forward. I hope those who seek to stop it \ncan be heard, but let us have a clear vote on this particular issue so \nwe can have the will of the body be done.\n  I congratulate the chairman and thank him for his efforts and work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished leader came to the \nfloor to withdraw his amendment and substitute the amendment of the \nSenator from Missouri. He remarked, in the first instance, that we have \nto hasten it along. We would like to have had the bill up. We would \nlike to have had fast track.\n  Then he insists on fast track on this particular bill. He filled the \ntree right back up again; namely, we cannot offer amendments. So in one \nbreath he says he would like to have fast track and he is instituting \nfast track on this particular trade measure. He is an outstandingly \ntalented individual, a fine looking gentleman, and so he stands there \nwith that smile, so reasonable and says: I would like to be sure to \ncheck these amendments; we have to make sure they are relevant; I will \ngo along with the Ashcroft agricultural amendment, but I haven't gone \nalong with the Wellstone agricultural amendment.\n  We heard earlier this morning, of course, that the Wellstone \nagricultural amendment is not relevant. You can look at this bill. You \ncan go right on down the list. You can find out that it is trade \nbenefits for the Caribbean Basin Initiative. They have cover over of \ntax on distilled spirits, Generalized System of Preferences, trade \nadjustment assistance affecting the welfare of America's workforce. \nNothing in here on agriculture for the CBI and the sub-Sahara.\n  Senator Wellstone, who has been trying since January to get up an \nagricultural amendment, has been put down. He tried all day yesterday \nand was put down this morning.\n  But if you want to take one of my friend's agricultural amendments--\nnamely, the distinguished Senator from Missouri, who is running for \nreelection--well, wait a minute now, let's withdraw that last amendment \nI had and let's put up the irrelevant agricultural amendment of the \nSenator from Missouri. Irrelevant absolutely.\n  Anybody knows a measure of this kind would go before government ops \nabout an agriculture negotiator in the trade office.\n  And then the argument: We have the President and the leaders and \notherwise and so many cosponsors. Well, I have the minimum wage \namendment the President has been trying to get up all year long. I have \nthe minimum wage amendment the minority leader would like to have a \nvote upon. I have a minimum wage amendment that doesn't have 31 but has \n27 cosponsors.\n  It sort of fits the pattern, is my point, of the reasoned argument of \nthe distinguished majority leader. But no, not that Wellstone \nagricultural amendment. That is irrelevant, and we don't want to waste \nthe time because we would be here 2 weeks. We would be here 2 months. \nWe are not going to stand for that, but let us have the agricultural \namendment of the Senator from Missouri.\n  Well, that is why I was smiling at my distinguished leader. I was \nsmiling at his duplicity. There it is. You can see it for yourself. I \nhate to use the word ``arrogant,'' but there is an element of that in \nthis particular procedure. What it insists upon is: I want my way. I am \ngoing to control it. You can't put up your amendment.\n  And then they act dismayed when we don't vote cloture. Well, we just \nwon't vote on the agricultural amendment now. We can keep on debating, \nif that is the procedure they want to continue and insist upon.\n  There isn't any question in my mind about agriculture. I will never \nforget, some years back we had $21--it got up to $23 billion--the best \nplus balance we have ever had of any commodity is America's \nagriculture. We have soybeans. I put in a grain elevator when I was \nGovernor so I know about farmers. I know about soybeans. I know about \ncotton.\n  I know about exports, and everyone is for America's agriculture, \nexcept we oppose that Freedom to Farm thing that wrecked American \nagriculture--free market forces, free market forces. So they grabbed it \nup, and all the farmers took the money and ran 3 years ago. Now, the \nprice has gone down and they are broke and they need assistance. That \nis why the Senator from Minnesota has been on the floor, to try to get \nsome help for America's agriculture, not that bureaucracy over in the \noffice of the Trade Representative\n\n[[Page S13240]]\n\nfor the purpose of adding another payroll over there. That is the \ntypical Washington political solution: Give another title, add another \npayroll; just move another little bit on the special trade \nrepresentative.\n  And everybody knows that when we come to agriculture, we go to the \nSecretary of Agriculture, and he is there at every table every time we \ndebate because he is steeped in the agricultural needs of the United \nStates of America, and that is why we made good agricultural \nagreements. I want them to point out a bad agricultural agreement, \nother than, of course, NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, \nwhich has the Senators from North Dakota on durum wheat all over the \nfloor here. They are trying to keep them from dumping on the North \nDakota wheat farmers. We all know that. It hasn't worked, and \neverything else like that, but that is exactly what they want--like \nthey are dumping my textiles, killing 420,000 textile jobs since NAFTA. \nAnd there it goes.\n  Then they come around, and let me say that I am glad they removed \nthat sandwich bowl. I will yield in a second. I know there are \nimportant statements to be made, and I need help in trying to stop this \nfreight train, stop this steamroller. I have been up here 33 years, and \nI am still the junior Senator, and I have been trying to get a point of \nimportance with respect to the budget, and nobody listens to me on \nthat. I keep calling it a deficit. The Congressional Budget Office \nkeeps reporting it as a deficit.\n  The law--section 13.301 of the Budget Act--says that the President \nand the Congress cannot report a budget with the Social Security moneys \nin it that would cause it to be a surplus. They violate that, and \nnobody pays attention to us. Of course, they come up and say the \ninterest payments, which exceed the defense budget and the Social \nSecurity budget, and all other budgets--a billion dollars a day. When \nPresident Johnson balanced the budget, it was only $16 billion for the \nentire year. In 200 years of history, the cost of all the wars, from \nthe Revolution right up to World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, \nwe still had less than a trillion-dollar debt, and the interest cost \nwas only $16 billion.\n  Now, without the cost of a war since that time--the gulf war \nincidently was taken care of by the Saudis and others--what has it \nsoared to? To almost $5 trillion or $6 trillion, or something--a \ntrillion-dollar debt and an interest cost the CBO reports as $356 \nbillion. But with interest rates and Mr. Greenspan, it is bound to go \nup. We are seeing all the signs about consumer confidence. We know it \nis going to be over a billion a day.\n  So we have fiscal cancer. So we go down this morning at 8 o'clock and \nborrow a billion and add it to the debt. Tomorrow morning, Friday \nmorning, Saturday morning, Sunday morning, every day for this fiscal \nyear 1999, I will make a bet with anybody, and let them pick out the \nodds, that they will see a billion dollars a day. Why? Because we are \nnot willing to pay for the Government we are getting. We were willing \nto, again, add another $100 billion to the deficit just as the year \nended, not even a month ago, September 30 of this year--$103 billion \nmore. They won't call that bill the Balanced Budget Act or the Social \nSecurity lockbox. I will put it in a lockbox. I got together with the \nAdministrator of Social Security and I said: Write me a bill that will \nbe a true lockbox. I have it. It is hidden in the Budget Committee. \nThey know how to hide it. They don't even want to talk about it. I \ncan't get a hearing on it. I have asked for a hearing. They totally \nignore you.\n\n  But this one says you take that money and immediately redeem it to \nthe credit of Social Security. And don't put in an IOU the first of the \nmonth every month. Put the money back into the Social Security trust \nfund, just as corporate America is required.\n  Now I am back to my friend, Denny McLain. We passed the 1994 Pension \nReform Act and we said: Look, these fast takeover artists come in and \npay off the company debt with the pension fund and then take the rest \nof the money and run. People who have been working 30, 40, even 50 \nyears, are left high and dry with no pensions. So we put in the Pension \nReform Act of 1994 making it a felony to pay off the company debt with \nthe pension moneys.\n  Unfortunately, one of the all-time great pitchers--which is \nsignificant during this World Series fever--Denny McLain of the Detroit \nTigers, became head of a corporation and paid off the debt with the \ncompany fund. He was sentenced to a prison term for a felony. If you \ncan find little Denny in whatever cell he is in, tell him next time to \nrun for the Senate. You get the good government award when you take the \npension money of the people's Social Security fund and pay off your \ndebt, so that you can talk about surplus, surplus, surplus, surplus \nwhen you are spending $100 billion more than you are taking in and you \nhave got deficits, deficits, deficits as far as the eye can see.\n  That is why I told the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee \nI would jump off the Capitol dome when he put up that plan called the \nBalanced Budget Act. They use that jargon and those titles, and the \nsilly press picks up the language and headlines it.\n  So what do we do? We find out, Heavens above, that we are like \nTennessee Ernie Ford, ``another day older and deeper in debt.'' And \nnow, instead of 356, if we only paid out $16 billion on a pay-as-you-go \nbasis, since President Lyndon Johnson's day, we would have $340 billion \nto spend. For what? For agriculture. For what? For the research at the \nNational Institutes of Health. For what? For Kosovo expenses. For what? \nFor all the housing the Secretary of Housing has promulgated, and \neverything else like that.\n  We could go down and provide for all the programs you could possibly \nthink of. You can double WIC, Head Start, any education programs, just \ndouble the education budget. And we can still have what? A tax cut. And \nstill have what? Pay down the debt. With $340 billion--we are spending \n$340 billion. We are forced to spend it. It is a tax--a tax. What you \nare doing is raising taxes. You don't want to say it, but you have to \npay it, you have to borrow it every day, a billion dollars a day. It is \na tax on the American people. With a sales tax, I can get a school; \nwith a gas tax, I can get a highway; with this tax, I get nothing. I \nserved on the Grace Commission on waste, fraud, and abuse. This is the \nbiggest waste ever created in the history of any government. They don't \nwant to talk about that. They want to talk about the sub-Sahara.\n\n  We are building libraries down in Little Rock now. We are headed for \nthe last roundup. So if we can show that we did something in Africa, \nand we did something in the CBI, oh isn't it wonderful? The President \nwants the minimum wage. Leaders want the minimum wage. I have 27 \ncosponsors who want the minimum wage. It is relevant. Trade adjustment \nassistance is relevant to the workforce of America and minimum wage is \njust as relevant to the workforce of America.\n  If the majority leader would come out here and say, all right, I will \nlet you have the agricultural amendment, or rather we should say we \nwill have this agricultural amendment, and the distinguished Senator \nfrom Missouri, if he just calls up our minimum wage, and we will agree \nto 5 minutes to a side, and 10 minutes, and vote. They don't want to \nvote. They want the political cover of parliamentary maneuver, acting \nas if it is serious here, and we could work this out, and this is a big \nresponsibility on my leader, but we have to listen to both sides, and \nwe have to be able to move legislation.\n  We are not going to move any minimum wage. We are not going to move \nany campaign finance reform. Even though they are relevant?\n  Time magazine came out day before yesterday and said it is relevant. \nThey wrote a whole article. I refer again to pages 50 and 51. Everybody \ncan read it.\n  Campaign finance reform is relevant. There isn't any question on this \nparticular bill. The magazines are writing it, but the Senators can't \nsee it. The Parliamentarians can't understand it. They couldn't call \nthat relevant because why? Because the majority leader says you don't \ncall that relevant. You don't call that agricultural amendment of the \nSenator from Minnesota relevant, but call mine: Look I have come all \nthe way back to the floor and withdrawn my part of the tree, and put up \nimmediately my friend's amendment on agriculture, and yes, it's \nrelevant. We are going to be represented in agriculture. I can tell you \nnow, but\n\n[[Page S13241]]\n\nthey are going to have some bureaucracy. And that could be a good \nspeaking point when I run for reelection myself. I hate to have to \nexplain why I have to oppose this to my farmer friends because that is \ngoing to cause the farm problem in America, as if we didn't have a \nspecial Trade Representative with the title of ambassador.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman of our Finance Committee for \nfinally removing that sandwich bowl. I didn't get over there and see it \nin the debate. But I see they have, these folks who are interested in \ntextile jobs: the Bank of America, Bechtel, City Group, Daimler-\nChrysler, Enro, Exxon, Fleur, and Gap that we have on the list of the \nTime magazine which is going overseas. They have gone over. Sara Lee \nand Fruit of the Loom. Actually Fruit of the Loom is already organized \nin the Cayman Islands as a foreign corporation. McDonalds just sells \nhamburgers. They wouldn't care if you came naked to buy a hamburger. \nModern Africa Fund Managers, Philip Morris, Amoco, Bally's Lakeshore \nResort--come on--Mobile, Occidental, Texaco. Where is anybody? The \nAfrican Growth and Opportunity Act is not clear.\n  I could keep on talking down and down the list.\n  I don't know who is going to protect the jobs and the manufacturing \ncapacity of the United States of America. I don't believe in \nobstructionism. I believe in moving forward. I don't believe there is, \nother than budget, a more important issue than the matter of \nmanufacturing capacity here in the United States of America, on which I \nhave gone down before and will go again. But there is no doubt we will \nhave the opportunity to point out how we are losing out. We don't have \nanything to export. We have hollowed out the industrial might of the \nUnited States.\n\n  The reason they don't listen, I take it now, is they have a candidate \nfor the President who is mixing that in with Hitler and World War II \nand everything else and all kinds of nonsense. So we lose credibility. \nAnybody can talk free trade, free trade, dignified, credible, \nrespected, and anybody who talks about protection of the industrial \nstrength of America is some kind of kook. I think they said, ``Unite, \nwe nutcakes.'' Michael Kelly in his column this morning: ``Unite, we \nnutcakes.''\n  So here comes another nutcake who is trying to protect American jobs, \nand is looked upon now by the leadership as getting in the way. Why \ndon't I be more reasonable, and everything else of that kind? Why don't \nthey be more reasonable?\n  Why don't they allow me to put up Shays-Meehan, which passed \noverwhelmingly, and for which we have a tremendous need? Why don't they \nlet me put up the minimum wage, which is relevant to the trade \nadjustment assistance and welfare of the workers? They need it in \nAmerica.\n  Why don't we agree to a time? We are not delaying--5 minutes to a \nside. We can vote this evening on both of those bills, and they can go \nto all of their appropriations bills that they want so we can get away \nfrom this so-called fill up the tree and fast track on this trade bill. \nThey have fast track. They know it. Don't come out and complain and \nsay: We would like to have gotten fast track. Parliamentarily, they \nhave instituted fast tack. That is the position they put the Senator \nfrom South Carolina in, and those in international trade.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to \nproceed as if in morning business for up to 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         privilege of the floor\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Tony \nMartinez, a legislative assistant in my office, be allowed floor \nprivileges during the pendency of this introduction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bingaman pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1806 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  (The remarks of Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Graham, and Mr. Craig \npertaining to the introduction of S. 1814 are located in today's Record \nunder ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, a few minutes ago I was taking the \nopportunity to address some of the arguments that have been raised \nduring the debate on this bill these past several days. Some of my \ncolleagues have questioned why we are taking this bill up now. Let me \nhelp them by putting this in context.\n  Section 134 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, which passed the \nCongress in 1994, directed the President to develop a comprehensive \ntrade and development policy for the countries of Africa. That \nprovision originated with Senator Daschle, now the distinguished \nminority leader.\n  In the Statement of Administrative Action that accompanied the Act, \nthe President made clear that the first measures he intended to \nconsider in complying with that congressional mandate, were measures \nto:\n\n       Remove impediments to U.S. trade with and investment in \n     Africa, including enhancements in the GSP program for least-\n     developed countries.\n\n  Section 134 of the URAA recognized that, as a continent, Africa had \nbeen left behind in trade terms. New approaches were needed to \nintegrate Africa fully into the world economy, to allow Africa to take \nfull advantage of the world trading system, and to ensure that Africans \nthemselves had the opportunity to guide their own economic destiny.\n  Now, 5 years after the Congress originally endorsed the idea, this \nlegislation responds directly to that mandate. The legislation offers a \ndown payment on a new and more constructive relationship with the \nAfrican continent--one as partners with similar interests in expanding \neconomic opportunity and raising living standards in all our countries.\n  The President has for the past 2 years indicated in his State of the \nUnion Address his intent to press ahead with this legislation. He \nidentified this legislation as one of his top trade and foreign policy \ninitiatives. In his trip to Africa this past year, he committed to move \nthe bill as part of a new initiative for Africa.\n  That led to the consideration of this legislation in the 105th \nCongress. The House passed its counterpart legislation in the spring of \nthis past year, the Finance Committee reported out a bill in all \nrespects the same as that we now have before us, but time ran out \nbefore the Senate could act on the bill.\n  This year the House once again acted, this time in June. By that \npoint, the Finance Committee had already reported out the legislation \nnow on the Senate floor. The Africa bill is timely--indeed, it is past \ntime we acted on this important measure.\n  The same holds true for the CBI. A proposal for establishing parity \nbetween the preferences granted Mexico under the NAFTA and those \ngranted the Caribbean and Central America has been before Congress in \none form or another almost since the NAFTA was implemented in late \n1993.\n  In the 105th Congress, there was considerable effort invested by both \nthe Ways and Means and Finance Committees in moving counterpart bills. \nThat work was renewed in the 106th Congress with hearings and markups \nbefore both committees.\n  The CBI title enjoys the same bipartisan support as does the Africa \ntitle. Indeed, the President's CBI bill, introduced in this session at \nhis request, is virtually identical to the bill reported from the \nFinance Committee bill in both the 105th and 106th Congresses.\n  The Finance Committee bill enjoys the backing of the leadership and \nmembers on both sides of the aisle. It is, in fact, a testament to the \nbipartisan support for this legislation and the considerable push by \nthe White House that we have been given time to debate this bill now.\n  It is time to reject the isolationist label, the instinct to ignore \nthe broader world around us, and the tendency for focus exclusively \ninward. It is time to affirm the constructive role that the United \nStates can play in the wider world and fulfill the leadership the world \nexpects from the United States. It is time to act.\n  It is time to act because it is time we made good on the unfulfilled \npromises made to both Africa and the Caribbean.\n\n[[Page S13242]]\n\nAn October, 1998, report of the International Trade Commission makes \nclear, Africa faces daunting economic challenges. The ITC report \nhighlights the economic and structural problems Africa faces in \nattracting productive investment.\n  For all that, the ITC report also reflects the positive changes under \nway in Africa. The region's GDP rose by 4.8 percent from 1995 to 1997. \nSince 1990, the region has reached a number of agreements eliminating \ntrade and investment barriers and harmonizing economic policies.\n  Most of the governments of the region have ``introduced economic \nreforms to control budget deficits, and inflation, and to stabilize \ncurrencies.'' They have liberalized ``regulations on trade and \ninvestment,'' reduced tariffs and other import charges and abolished \nmost price controls.\n  In addition, many of the governments have begun significant programs \nof privatization. In fact, the governments of sub-Saharan Africa raised \n``an estimated $5.8 billion from privatization, primarily through \ndivestitures of utilities and telecommunication firms.''\n  What this legislation tries to do is meet those governments half way. \nIt is an effort to open our markets to their products as a way of \nreinforcing their own efforts to encourage productive investment and \neconomic growth.\n  The legislation is designed to reinforce a growing, the growing \ninterest in Africa among U.S. businesses. Direct investment by U.S. \nfirms more than quadrupled in 1997 alone to $3.8 billion, according to \nthe ITC. We want to encourage that positive trend.\n  Some may argue that, because this is a grant of unilateral \npreferences, it is one-sided--that there will be no benefits to the \nUnited States. What that ignores is the track record of the last \nseveral decades.\n  Where U.S. investment goes, U.S. trade follows. Significantly, while \nU.S. investment was increasing in 1996 and 1997 in sub-Saharan Africa, \nour exports to the region experienced a corresponding growth in capital \ngoods, particularly exports of machinery for use in agriculture and \ninfrastructure projects.\n  Africa represents an important opportunity to our farmers as well. \nWhile agricultural exports fell in dollar terms, largely because of the \nlower prices available on world markets for all commodities, Africa \nrepresents an important potential market for U.S. food exports as the \ncontinent increasingly looks offshore to meet its needs.\n  The real issue is whether or not the region will have the wherewithal \nto buy what it needs to offset the steady decline in per capita caloric \nintake that has accelerated in the last 2 to 3 years. The legislation \nbefore us would help address that problem. By opening our markets to \ntheir products, sub-Saharan African countries can earn the foreign \nexchange needed to purchase food on world markets, including from U.S. \nexporters.\n  Will that be enough? Will this legislation alone be the answer to \nAfrica's problems? Plainly not. As Senator Grassley indicated in his \neloquent statement opening the debate on this bill last Thursday, this \nlegislation is no panacea. It is instead a small, but significant step \ntoward a new economic relationship between the United States and sub-\nSaharan Africa.\n  Should this legislation be supplemented by other initiatives? It \nshould and it must if it is going to work. But, the fact that it is not \nthe whole answer to Africa's problems or does not reflect all that the \nUnited States might do to help Africans secure their own economic \ndestiny is no argument against action. It is time to move ahead and \nengage constructively with our African partners in the transition they \nthemselves have begun.\n  The same holds true for the Caribbean and Central America. Through \nthe original CBI program, the United States and U.S. private businesses \nhave played a significant role in the economic progress the region has \nmade over the past 15 years.\n  This past year, however, natural disasters eliminated much of the \nprogress made in the Caribbean and Central America in recent years. The \ndevastation began with the eruption of a long-dormant volcano that \nnearly depopulated the island of Montserrat and nearly erased its \neconomy in the summer of 1998.\n  In September of that year, Hurricane Georges severely damaged both \nthe Dominican Republic and Haiti. An even more devastating hurricane--\nHurricane Mitch--struck Central America in late October and early \nNovember late in the hurricane season.\n  Honduras and Nicaragua were particularly hard hit, but the hurricane \nalso did considerable damage to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Belize. \nHurricane Mitch left 11,000 dead and an even greater number homeless. \nMuch of the resulting damage was long-term--massive property damage and \nsoil erosion, the devastation of crop lands and manufacturing sites, \nputting thousands out of work. The region will take years to recover.\n  Those devastating circumstances have given renewed impetus to an idea \nthat surfaced almost immediately after the implementation of the \nNAFTA--the expansion of tariff preferences under the CBI to match those \noffered under the NAFTA to Mexico.\n  Will it work? I am confident it will because the legislation is \nmodeled on existing production-sharing arrangements in textiles and \napparel and other industries that already account for nearly half of \nall imports from the CBI beneficiary countries.\n  In other words, the program has a proven track record. Indeed, \nbilateral trade in textiles and apparel under existing production-\nsharing partnerships between U.S. and Caribbean or Central American \nfirms already accounts for 36 percent of current two-way trade between \nthe United States and the CBI region.\n  For all those reasons, the legislation merits our support.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I am aware there are other Senators who wish to speak. \nI will only take a moment to thank our chairman, our revered chairman, \nfor his comments, with which I wholly agree, with which the Finance \nCommittee entirely agrees. This bill comes to you, as he has said, from \na near unanimous committee. Ninety Senators voted, just yesterday, to \nmove forward.\n  I would just say, sir, I wish we could have all been present this \nafternoon when the Congressional Gold Medal was presented to President \nFord and Mrs. Ford in the Rotunda. The President gave a wonderful \nspeech, describing the Congress he came into, just as the Cold War \ncommenced; the extraordinary efforts that the 80th Congress made to \npass the Marshall Plan, for which they were not entirely rewarded by \nPresident Truman, who kept talking about the ``do-nothing'' 80th \nCongress. But there you are. Then came President Eisenhower and the \nmovement to establish NATO and to fund NATO, in which Speaker Rayburn, \nMajority Leader Johnson, and great Republicans joined in that matter.\n  Of his life in politics, in government, he said: I came in and I \nremained a moderate on social issues, a fiscal conservative on fiscal \nissues, and a convinced internationalist.\n  That is the America that fought in the dark, that long struggle about \nwhich John F. Kennedy talked. And we prevailed.\n  The totalitarian 20th century is behind us. Freedoms open up. Are we \nnow to close down at just the moment when everything we have stood for \nas a nation, from the time of Cordell Hull and the Reciprocal Trade \nAgreements Act of 1934--every measure we are talking about in this \nbill, no, it is not the final end-all effort; it is a part of a \ncontinuing effort that goes back to Trade Adjustment Assistance. It was \nestablished in the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. I was involved in \nwriting that legislation. It said, if you have trade, there will be \nwinners, there will be losers. We will look after the people who are \ntemporarily, as it turns out, disrupted, as economic patterns, trade \npatterns change.\n  In 48 hours, or 52 hours, the appropriation for the program, \nsupported by every President since President Kennedy, expires. The \nauthorization in fact ended on June 30. Can we let that happen? Can we \nbelieve that we would do this? Surely not.\n  But unless we are urgently attentive to the matters before us, and \nwork out what are technical differences, it will go down; and we will \nbe remembered\n\n[[Page S13243]]\n\nfor ending an era of enormous expansion and example to the rest of the \nworld, which the Western World is just beginning to follow on. It is \nhard to believe.\n  But listen to what the chairman said and hope in the next 24 hours we \ncan do this, because we can. And, sir, we must.\n  Under the rules, President Ford, I believe, has free access to the \nfloor. I wish he would come on here and talk to each of us one on one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. First of all, let me thank the distinguished ranking member \nof the Finance Committee, Senator Moynihan, for his eloquent remarks. \nAll I can say is, we must not let that happen. And with the kind of \nbipartisan spirit we had in the Finance Committee, it will not happen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/27/senate-section/article/S13243-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ROTH.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak with respect to \nNational Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Week. Because of the \nefforts of my colleagues, Senator Collins, Senator Torricelli, and \nmyself, this Senate passed a bipartisan resolution a last week to \ncommemorate, during the week of October 24 to 30, National Childhood \nLead Poisoning Prevention Week.\n  I think it is appropriate to recognize this problem that is taking \nplace throughout this country and also recognize what we are trying to \ndo to alleviate this great problem.\n  As a preliminary point, let me commend my colleague, Senator Collins, \nfor her great efforts in this regard. She has been a true leader in \nthis issue. She has been someone who has fought the good fight with \nrespect to this problem. She has participated legislatively. I was very \npleased and honored a few weeks ago to have her join me in Providence, \nRI, for a hearing on this issue. I look forward to joining her in a few \nweeks in Maine so we can examine the experience in her home State.\n  I also want to commend my colleague, Senator Torricelli, who also is \nvery active as a leader in this effort. Indeed, Senator Torricelli and \nI have introduced legislation, the Children's Lead SAFE Act of 1999, \nwhich is critically important to the future of our children in the \nUnited States.\n  This importance has been underscored and highlighted by two recent \nreports--one earlier this year in January of 1999 by the General \nAccounting Office, and another report that has been released recently \nunder the auspices of the Alliance To End Childhood Lead Poisoning and \nthe National Center for Lead-Safe Housing.\n  Both of these reports underscore the need for additional efforts to \neliminate childhood exposure to lead and also to provide additional \nsupport for screening and treatment of children who are exposed to \nenvironmental lead.\n  Regrettably, there are too many children in this country who are \nexposed to lead, typically through old lead paint that may be in their \nhome. It is particularly critical and crucial to children who are at a \nvery young age, under the age of 6, because their body is much more \nlikely to absorb this environmental hazard, and also because those are \nexactly the times in which brain nervous systems are developing, where \ncognitive skills are being developed. We know lead is the most \npernicious enemy of cognitive development in children.\n  In the United States, too many children are poisoned through this \nconstant exposure to low-levels of lead in their atmosphere. This \nexposure leads to reduced IQ, problems with attention span, \nhyperactivity, impaired growth, reading and learning disabilities, \nhearing loss, and a range of other effects.\n  Lead poisoning is entirely avoidable, if we have the knowledge and \nthe resources and the effort to prevent young children from being \nexposed to lead.\n  In January of this year, as I indicated, the General Accounting \nOffice highlighted the problems in the Federal health care system with \nrespect to lead screening and followup services for children.\n  We have policies that require all Medicaid children to be screened \nfor lead. Sadly, we have not achieved that level of 100 percent \nscreening. We want to reach that goal. Then after screening all of the \nchildren in the United States who may be vulnerable to lead poisoning, \nwe want to ensure these children have access to followup care. \nIdentifying poisoned children is only the first step and is only \neffective when coupled with proper follow-up care.\n  Most recently, we received information about that follow-up care from \na report, the title of which is: ``Another Link in the Chain: State \nPolicies and Practices for Case Management and Environmental \nInvestigation for Lead-Poisoned Children.'' As I indicated, this report \nwas sponsored by the Alliance To End Childhood Lead Poisoning and the \nNational Center for Lead-Safe Housing.\n  This report presents a State-by-State analysis of data which \nsuggests, first, there have been some innovative steps taken by the \nStates, but unfortunately there are disappointing gaps in the screening \nand treatment of children who are exposed to lead throughout the United \nStates.\n  There is also a great range among the States in their response to \nthis problem of childhood lead poisoning. In my own State of Rhode \nIsland, we have taken some very aggressive steps. Last week, we \ndedicated a lead center in Providence, RI, which provides comprehensive \nservices for lead-poisoned children, including parent education, \nmedical followup for children who have been exposed, and transitional \nhousing. Many times the source of the pollution is in the home of these \nchildren, and because of their low income, there is no place for them \nto go unless there is this transitional housing. This is an innovative \nstep forward. I am very pleased and proud to say it has taken place in \nmy home State.\n  If you look across the Nation, you find much less progress. Nearly \nhalf of the States have no standards for case management and, thus, the \nquality of care lead poisoned children receive is often not consistent \nwith public health recommendations. There is no real way to ensure \nthese children are getting the type of care they need because there are \nno case management policies. Only 35 States have implemented policies \nthat address when an environmental investigation should be performed to \ndetermine the source of a child's lead poisoning. There are many States \nwhere there is no way to determine where the source of the pollution is \ncoming from that is harming the child.\n  In addition, the report points out that despite the availability of \nMedicaid reimbursement for environmental investigation and case \nmanagement, more than half the States have not taken advantage of this \nMedicaid reimbursement. In addition, despite the emphasis we have in \nMedicaid on screening children, only one-third of the States could \nreport on how many of their lead poisoned children were enrolled in \nMedicaid, suggesting that screening data are not being coordinated, and \nthere really is not comprehensive, coherent screening policy in all too \nmany States.\n  Senator Torricelli and I have proposed legislation that would address \nthese deficiencies. The legislation will improve the management \ninformation systems so States know how many children are screened and \nhow many children have been exposed. We also encourage them to \nintegrate all the different agencies and institutions and programs that \nserve children so we can\n\n[[Page S13244]]\n\nhave a comprehensive approach. This would include involving the WIC \nprogram in the screening, early Head Start, maternal and child health \ncare block grant programs, so we have a comprehensive approach to \nidentifying, treating, following up and educating with respect to lead \nexposure.\n  We are committed to doing that. We are committed to ensuring that \nevery child in this country, particularly those children who are \nbeneficiaries of the Medicaid system, have this kind of screening and \nfollowup.\n  Unfortunately, we have found too many States that are not following \nthrough on their obligations. Of the 38 States that have enrolled \nMedicaid children to managed care plans, only 24 reported that their \nState's contract with the managed care organization contained any \nlanguage about lead screening or treatment services. So, many States \nare leaving it up to the managed care company or merely leaving it up \nto chance whether or not there are good protocols to follow up on lead \nexposure.\n  In addition to that, more than 40 percent of States reported that no \nfunding is available to help pay for even a portion of the hazard \ncontrol necessary to make a home lead safe for a lead-poisoned child. \nThere are not the resources to help these families cope with the \nreality of homes that are literally poisoning and harming their \nchildren. That is one reason why I joined my colleague, Senator \nTorricelli, to address this problem with respect to the Children's Lead \nSAFE Act of 1999. We would like to see clear and consistent standards \nfor screening and treatment to ensure that no child falls through the \ncracks. We would to help communities, parents and physicians take \nadvantage of every opportunity they have to detect and treat lead \npoisoning.\n\n  This bill is just one element in a comprehensive, coherent approach \nto eliminate this preventable disease that afflicts too many children \nin this country today.\n  I was pleased that during the appropriations process, the Senate \nsupported the President's request for full funding of the lead hazard \ncontrol grants program--indeed, particularly pleased when the conferees \nagreed with the Senate and maintained this funding. It is absolutely \ncritical. We will continue to press forward in terms of screening and \ntreatment, in terms of reducing lead hazards in the homes of children, \nand in terms of education, so there is no place in this country that \nfails to recognize the gravity of this situation where children are \npoisoned by exposure to lead.\n  Indeed, that is why we are here today. This week is National \nChildhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Week. We hope by reserving 1 week a \nyear to emphasize the challenges we face, to emphasize the steps which \nmust be taken in the future, we can galvanize additional support so \nthere is no child in this country who is poisoned by lead, whose \ndevelopment--physical, mental, social development--is harmed by such \nexposure.\n  At the heart of this effort is the work of many people, but, once \nagain, I thank my colleague and friend, Senator Susan Collins, who has \ntaken it upon herself to charge forward to make this hope of a lead-\nsafe environment for all our children a reality. I am pleased to be \nwith her sponsoring this resolution, sponsoring this week of \ncommemoration and also, in the days ahead, working to ensure that all \nthe children are as free as we can make them from the harm and the \ndanger of lead exposure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Presidential message recognizing \nNational Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Week and the executive \nsummary of ``Another Link in the Chain,'' be printed in the Record, \nfollowing my statement.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                     Washington, October 20, 1999.\n       Warm greetings to everyone observing National Childhood \n     Lead Poisoning Prevention Week.\n       As America's children begin their exciting journey into the \n     21st century, one of the greatest gifts we can give them is a \n     healthy start. Sadly, however, many children face needless \n     obstacles to healthy development in their own homes. Among \n     the most devastating of these obstacles is lead poisoning. \n     Today nearly 5 percent of children between the ages of 1 and \n     5 suffer from this condition. While any child can be \n     susceptible to lead poisoning and its effects, low-income \n     children are at a significantly higher risk, since most \n     children are poisoned by lead-based paint and lead-\n     contaminated dust and soil that are found in older, \n     dilapidated housing. For African-American children living in \n     these conditions, the rate of those who suffer from lead \n     poisoning is a staggering 22 percent.\n       The effects of lead poisoning can be serious and \n     irrevocable. Even low levels of exposure to lead can hinder \n     children's ability to learn and thrive, reducing their IQ and \n     attention span and contributing to learning disabilities, \n     hearing loss, impaired growth, and many other developmental \n     difficulties. My Administration, through the Department of \n     Housing and Urban Development and the Environmental \n     Protection Agency, has taken important steps to eliminate the \n     threat of lead poisoning. We have provided funding for such \n     efforts as removing lead-based paint from housing built prior \n     to 1978, when such paint was outlawed. We have also promoted \n     increased blood testing of young children to determine the \n     levels of lead in their blood.\n       However, when our children's well-being is at stake, we \n     must do more. I commend the concerned citizens and \n     organizations participating in this year's observance for \n     raising awareness of the dangers of lead poisoning and for \n     teaching families and communities how to prevent it. I urge \n     all Americans to take this occasion to learn more about lead \n     poisoning and to take part in local, state, and national \n     efforts to create a healthier environment for our children.\n       Best wishes for a successful week.\n     Bill Clinton.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      Chapter 1--Executive Summary\n\n       The first line of defense in protecting children from lead \n     poisoning is primary prevention, which means controlling lead \n     hazards before children are ever exposed to lead. However, \n     the broad distribution of lead in the U.S. housing stock has \n     made achieving primary prevention for all children an elusive \n     goal. As a result, secondary prevention strategies continue \n     to play a vital role in protecting children from lead \n     poisoning. Secondary prevention entails identifying the lead-\n     poisoned child, providing medical care and case management, \n     identifying the source of the child's lead exposure \n     (environmental investigation), and then ensuring that any \n     lead hazards identified are controlled to prevent the child's \n     further exposure to lead.\n       Over the past few years, there has been considerable public \n     attention to and controversy surrounding policies for \n     screening young children for lead poisoning. There has also \n     been considerable discussion about primary prevention and \n     housing-based approaches to primary prevention, as a \n     consequence of enactment of Title X and federal funding for \n     the HUD Lead Hazard Control Grants program. In contrast, \n     there has been little discussion of what actually happens \n     once a lead-poisoned child is identified. The Alliance To End \n     Childhood Lead Poisoning and the National Center for Lead-\n     Safe Housing agreed that it was time to reexamine the \n     response to lead-poisoned children nationwide. We decided \n     that characterizing the case management and environmental \n     investigation services now being provided in each state would \n     be a useful first step. We hope this report's documentation \n     of state policies will help sharpen discussion and decision-\n     making at many levels. This report is timely for at least \n     four reasons.\n       First, this report provides the information needed to \n     ensure that case management and environmental investigation \n     systems are ``in good working order'' to handle the increased \n     caseloads that can be expected from expanded lead screening \n     of high-risk children. Recent reports from the General \n     Accounting Office (GAO) have focused the spotlight on the \n     failure of federal health programs to screen high-risk \n     children for lead poisoning. GAO documented that just 19% of \n     Medicaid-enrolled children aged 1 through 5 are being \n     screened as required by law, and that the majority of \n     children needing case management and environmental \n     investigation are enrolled in Medicaid. As a consequence, \n     considerable attention is being paid now to improving lead \n     screening rates among Medicaid children. In addition, many \n     states are developing CDC-recommended lead screening plans to \n     identify and target the highest-risk children for lead \n     screening.\n       Second, this report raises a number of policy and program \n     issues that should be considered as states seek to ensure \n     that lead-poisoned children enrolled in Medicaid managed care \n     plans are provided with appropriate follow-up care. Many \n     states are still developing or fine-tuning their mechanisms \n     for overseeing and coordinating care with Medicaid managed \n     care plans, as well as state Children's Health Insurance \n     Programs.\n       Third, this report can help to inform a number of pending \n     policy decisions. The Health Care financing Administration \n     has been receiving criticism from many quarters for its \n     policy prohibiting Medicaid reimbursement for analysis of the \n     environmental samples needed for an adequate environmental \n     investigation to identify the lead hazards in a poisoned \n     child's home. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead \n     Poisoning Prevention is currently reviewing the evidence base \n     for case management services. Finally, U.S. Senators Robert \n     Torricelli (D-NJ) and Jack Reed (D-RI) and U.S. \n     Representative Robert Menendez (D-NJ) are introducing federal \n     legislation to address these issues in Congress.\n\n[[Page S13245]]\n\n       Fourth, the sharp decline in the number of children with \n     elevated blood lead levels documented by NHANES III, Phase 2 \n     offers opportunities never before available for using \n     screening and follow-up measures to advance prevention. For \n     the first time, the caseload of lead-poisoned children in \n     jurisdictions historically overwhelmed by the number lead-\n     poisoned children has become ``manageable.'' We have a \n     responsibility to respond promptly and humanely to children \n     with elevated blood lead levels as well as the opportunity to \n     use these interventions to advance prevention. Childhood lead \n     poisoning is entirely preventable. But achieving this goal \n     requires us to sharpen our tools and redouble prevention \n     efforts, rather than being complacent or uncritically flowing \n     ``established procedures'' by rote.\n\n\n                          scope of the survey\n\n       The scope of this survey and report is limited to \n     describing and evaluating the quality of self-reported state \n     policies and practices for environmental investigation and \n     case management. This report therefore could not assess state \n     primary prevention initiatives, lead screening policies and \n     performance, or even medical care provided to lead-poisoned \n     children. The most effective state programs are those that \n     succeed at primary prevention. Once a child is exposed to \n     lead, the overall effectiveness of the response must be \n     judged by performance in all three areas of secondary \n     prevention--and a single weak link in the chain of secondary \n     prevention activities can undermine the effectiveness of the \n     entire response. Having exemplary environmental investigation \n     and case management services is useless if the state fails to \n     screen children at risk for lead poisoning to identify those \n     with elevated blood lead levels. Similarly, providing good \n     environmental investigation and case management services is \n     pointless if these activities do not trigger action to \n     control identified lead hazards.\n       It is also important to be clear about what is meant by \n     each key term. ``Environmental investigation'' means the \n     examination of a child's living environment, usually the \n     home, to determine the source or sources of lead exposure for \n     a child with an elevated blood lead level. For the purposes \n     of this report, ``case management'' means coordination, \n     provision, and oversight of the services to the family \n     necessary to ensure that lead-poisoned children achieve \n     reductions in blood lead levels. In addition, case management \n     includes coordination, but not provision and oversight, of \n     the clinical or environmental care.\n\n\n                    survey methodology and responses\n\n       To gather the information about current policies and \n     practices for case management and environmental \n     investigation, an initial survey and a supplementary survey \n     were sent to directors of state lead poisoning prevention \n     programs. In states where these programs do not exist, we \n     identified knowledgeable respondents by contacting \n     surveillance grantees of the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention (CDC) or other program staff responsible for lead \n     services (often a division of the state health department). \n     Ultimately, we received responses from all 50 states and the \n     District of Columbia. We also received responses from 15 \n     local lead programs, which allowed us to better characterize \n     several important dimensions of current practice of state \n     programs.\n\n\n        key findings and recommendations on initiating services\n\n     State blood lead reporting systems\n       Central reporting of elevated blood lead levels is critical \n     to ensuring timely follow-up care for lead-poisoned children. \n     Although nearly all (47) states have a reporting system for \n     blood lead levels, the utility of the systems for timely \n     referral of children needing follow-up services varies \n     considerably. In addition, the lack of uniform national \n     recommendations for reporting blood lead levels has created a \n     burden on private laboratories and others that must report \n     this information to many different states in a variety of \n     formats, and has made it difficult to assess and compare \n     blood lead data across states.\n       CDC should establish national standards for blood lead \n     reporting to ensure standardization of blood lead data and \n     enable timely follow-up for lead-poisoned children.\n       States with blood lead reporting systems should evaluate \n     the effectiveness of their systems in triggering prompt \n     identification and follow-up of lead-poisoned children and \n     address any identified deficiencies.\n       States without a central reporting system for blood lead \n     levels should establish one as soon as possible.\n     Blood lead levels at which services are provided\n       CDC's 1997 guidance recommends that both case management \n     and environmental investigation be provided at blood lead \n     levels of 20 g/dL or persistent levels of 15-19 \n     g/dL. Encouragingly, most states are providing \n     services to children at or even below the blood lead \n     thresholds recommended by CDC. For environmental \n     investigation, 20 states perform environmental investigation \n     only at blood lead levels at or above 20 g/dL (not \n     persistent levels above 15 g/dL) and 2 states use a \n     trigger of 25 g/dL. Since environmental \n     investigation permits the identification and subsequent \n     control of lead hazards, early hazard identification by \n     providing environmental investigation at lower blood lead \n     levels is a positive preventive measure.\n       Some states are able to vary the scope of case management \n     services provided by blood lead level, providing less \n     intensive services at lower blood lead levels in order to \n     intervene before blood lead levels rise. Thus, it is not \n     surprising that many states report offering case management \n     at lower blood lead levels than recommended by CDC. Six \n     states offer case management at precisely the level \n     recommended by CDC, and 28 states offer the service at lower \n     levels (single levels above 15 g/dL or 10 \n     g/dL). Fourteen states provide case management only \n     at blood lead levels of 20 g/dL, but not persistent \n     levels between 15 and 19 g/dL as recommended by CDC.\n       At a minimum, states should provide case management and \n     environmental investigation to children at the levels \n     recommended by CDC, and, resources permitting, preventive \n     services and environmental investigation to as many children \n     as possible with blood lead elevations at or above 10 \n     g/dL.\n\n\n   key findings and recommendations on setting standards for services\n\n     Case management standards\n       The lack of national standards for case management of lead-\n     poisoned children has created variation in approach across \n     the country, and made achieving reimbursement from Medicaid \n     and other insurers more difficult. At present, only 29 state \n     programs indicated they had written standards for case \n     management. However, a consensus document Case Management for \n     Childhood Lead Poisoning, developed by the National Center \n     for Lead-Safe Housing, describing professional standards for \n     case management for lead-poisoned children already serves as \n     a guide for some state and local programs. Other \n     complementary documents exist or are under development.\n       Any case management protocol or standard must include \n     certain elements to ensure quality care. Our survey found \n     that states performed well in some areas, but needed \n     improvement in others. For example, although most states (43) \n     provide home visits as part of case management, many programs \n     make only a single home visit, which is unlikely to be \n     sufficient for ensuring that steps are taken to improve the \n     health status of the child. In addition, almost one-third \n     (29%) of programs fail to inquire about a lead-poisoned \n     child's WIC status, an important oversight given the \n     importance of good nutrition for lead-poisoned children. \n     Because they are an essential part of the solution, families \n     should be systematically involved in all aspects of the case \n     management process. Yet, our survey found that more than one-\n     third of state programs (37%) fail to include families in the \n     planning process and only one state program indicated that it \n     routinely refers families to parent support groups in the \n     community. The indefinite continuation of cases is also a \n     sign of a weak case management, yet 14 states reported that \n     they had no criteria for when to close a case.\n       Case management standards must also describe the specific \n     interventions to improve the health status of the child that \n     should be provided by case managers. Nearly all states \n     provide some type of educational intervention, including \n     education focused on lead and lead exposure risks, lead-\n     specific cleaning practices, and nutritional counseling. Two-\n     thirds of state programs (67%) provide assistance with \n     referrals to other necessary services and 80% provide follow-\n     up of identified problems. Six state programs indicate that \n     they now refer young children routinely to Early \n     Intervention programs for identification and treatment of \n     possible developmental problems. Surprisingly, 10 states \n     provide specialized cleaning services to reduce immediate \n     lead dust hazards in homes as part of their case \n     management interventions. However, due to funding \n     considerations, most of these states are not able to make \n     cleaning available except in homes in designated target \n     areas and under special circumstances.\n       All states should have in place a protocol that identifies \n     minimum standards for initiation, performance, and tracking \n     of case management services for lead-poisoned children, \n     including standards for data collection and outcome \n     measurements and for professional staffing and oversight.\n       CDC or its Advisory Committee on Lead Poisoning Prevention \n     should endorse a set of national standards for case \n     management for lead-poisoned children, beginning with a \n     definition of the term case management. The consensus \n     standards developed by the National Center for Lead-Safe \n     Housing (Case Management for Childhood Lead Poisoning) offer \n     a thorough, current, and complete set of expert standards for \n     quick review and endorsement.\n       Once national standards are in place, state protocols \n     should be reviewed for consistency. In the interim, states \n     should utilize written protocols specifying the services to \n     be provided along with performance standards and record-\n     keeping criteria.\n       Case management standards should include a minimum of two \n     case management visits to the home of a lead-poisoned child.\n       State case management protocols should include standards \n     for assessment, specifically including assessment of WIC \n     status.\n       State programs should evaluate the extent to which families \n     are being involved in case management and make necessary \n     program modifications to ensure that families are fully \n     involved in planning, implementation, and evaluation efforts.\n       States should examine their referral practices to ensure \n     that parents of lead-poisoned children are routinely referred \n     to available resources, including community-based parent \n     support groups, where they exist, in order to connect \n     families with another source of support and assistance.\n\n[[Page S13246]]\n\n       All states should have case closure criteria that encompass \n     reduction in a child's blood lead level and control of \n     environmental lead hazards and procedures for administrative \n     closure when needed.\n       States that routinely follow children until 6 years of age \n     should evaluate whether such a lengthy follow-up benefits the \n     child and family.\n       Case management standards should specify recommended \n     interventions, including: basic educational interventions; \n     referrals to Early Intervention services for developmental \n     assessment, referral services for WIC, housing (emergency and \n     long-term Solutions), health care, and transportation, as \n     needed; follow-up of identified problems as needed; and, \n     follow-up to ensure that families receive needed services.\n     Environmental investigation standards\n       State programs vary widely as to what activities constitute \n     an environmental investigation to determine the source of \n     lead exposure. Only 35 states have written protocols for \n     environmental investigation. Where written protocols do \n     exist, the scope of services and the kinds of data \n     collected vary extensively. For example, some programs \n     rely almost exclusively on XRF analysis to test the lead \n     content of paint, and interpret a positive reading for the \n     presence of lead-based paint as source identification. \n     Other programs focus on current pathways of exposure by \n     taking dust wipe and paint chip samples, assessing paint \n     condition, and in some cases evaluating exposures from \n     bare soil and drinking water. And, still other programs \n     operate on a case-by-case basis.\n       Just 35 states had minimum requirements in place for those \n     who perform environmental investigations for lead-poisoned \n     children; most frequently they required state-certified risk \n     assessors or lead inspectors. Training in the certified \n     disciplines of risk assessor and lead inspector provides a \n     core foundation of knowledge as well as credentials that may \n     be important in any legal proceedings. At the same time, \n     additional training beyond these certified disciplines is \n     needed, because the scope of the environmental investigation \n     of a lead-poisoned child is much more comprehensive than a \n     standard residential lead inspection, and somewhat broader \n     than a risk assessment.\n       The responses to our survey do not make it possible to \n     determine the extent to which states are performing (or \n     requiring to be performed) clearance testing after work has \n     done to respond to lead hazards identified in the home of a \n     lead-poisoned child. Follow-up visits are essential to ensure \n     that corrective measures were taken and lead safety \n     precautions followed. Because lead-contaminated dust can be \n     invisible to the naked eye, clearance dust tests are critical \n     to ensure the effectiveness and safety of the corrective \n     measures in the vast majority of situations. Post-activity \n     dust tests should be taken after completion of any paint \n     repair or other projects that could generate lead-dust \n     contamination.\n       Many program staff expressed frustration that environmental \n     investigations frequently do not result in any corrective \n     action. The ultimate measure of the success of an \n     environmental investigation is the action that results to \n     control lead hazards to reduce the child's continued lead \n     exposure. At the extreme, conducting a full environmental \n     investigation is irrelevant if no measures to reduce lead \n     exposure occur as a consequence.\n       States should have a written protocol identifying the \n     components of an environmental investigation for a lead-\n     poisoned child. Appropriate flexibility and customization \n     based on specific case factors and local sources are \n     legitimate and important elements.\n       The protocol for environmental investigation should include \n     routine collection of data on important pathways of exposure \n     (particularly interior dust lead) and documentation of poor \n     paint condition. The XRF analyzer should never be relied upon \n     as the only tool for environmental investigation. Chapter 16 \n     of HUD's Guidelines for the Evaluation and Control of Lead-\n     Based Paint Hazards in Housing provides the most \n     comprehensive and current guidance for environmental \n     investigations.\n       State programs should begin using the more protective dust \n     lead standards being proposed by EPA and HUD: no higher than \n     50 g/square foot for floors and 250 g/\n     square foot for window sills.\n       Environmental investigations need to generate \n     ``actionable'' data to ensure that all lead \n     hazards identified are controlled--the ultimate measure of \n     effectiveness. In most states, improved systems are needed \n     to document and track corrective actions to control lead \n     hazards to help ensure that environmental investigations \n     actually result in health benefits to children.\n       Health department program staff performing an environmental \n     investigation for a lead-poisoned child should be trained and \n     certified as lead professionals. This will serve to increase \n     professionalism in the field as well as give the results of \n     the investigation greater standing if challenged in court.\n       Individuals conducting environmental investigations need \n     additional training to assess sources of lead exposure beyond \n     the scope of the traditional EPA/HUD risk assessment.\n       When state or local programs or managed care organizations \n     contract environmental investigations out to certified lead \n     evaluators, it is important that they be charged with \n     conducting a comprehensive evaluation of potential exposure \n     sources as described in Chapter 16 of HUD's Guidelines for \n     the Evaluation and Control of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in \n     Housing.\n       State programs need to make clearance dust tests a routine \n     check to confirm that lead dust hazards are not left behind \n     after corrective measures are taken in the home of a lead-\n     poisoned child.\n     Lead hazard control: Legal authority and resources\n       Although this survey was not able to quantify the extent to \n     which state and local programs succeed in controlling hazards \n     identified in home of a lead-poisoned child, many programs \n     indicated that this is a major problem. Twenty-eight states, \n     more than 54%, do not have legal authority to order \n     remediation of homes with identified lead hazards. More than \n     40% of all states (22 state programs) indicate that no \n     funding is available in their state to help property owners \n     pay for even a portion of the necessary lead hazard control. \n     No state reported sufficient funds for lead hazard control. \n     The lack of legal authority to order remediation coupled with \n     the lack of resources to fund abatement and lead hazard \n     control is a major stumbling block for lead poisoning \n     prevention and treatment progress nationally.\n       States should consider the model legislative language \n     reflecting the principles and recommended lead-safety \n     standards of the National Task Force of Lead-Based Paint \n     Hazard Reduction and Financing developed by the National \n     Conference of State Legislatures.\n\n\n         key findings and recommendations on financing services\n\n       For both case management and environmental investigation, \n     adequate funding for services is a central challenge to \n     providing timely and quality services. Most programs have \n     patched together funding from federal, state, and local \n     sources as best they can. For case management, 23 states \n     reported relying primarily on federal funds, 12 states rely \n     primarily on state funds, and 4 states on Medicaid. Six \n     states reported a combination of sources. Even in states with \n     Medicaid reimbursement, Medicaid provides only part of the \n     support for case management. For environmental investigation, \n     CDC grant funds are the most common source of funds for \n     environmental investigation, with 22 states reporting \n     reliance on this funding source; some use CDC funds \n     exclusively. Medicaid reimbursement is the next most common \n     source of funding for environmental investigation, with 20 \n     states receiving at least some reimbursement for services \n     provided for Medicaid-enrolled children. State funds \n     provide support in 17 states and local or county funds in \n     15 states. Other sources fill in the gaps.\n       However, it appears that financing is not the strongest \n     area of state case management and environmental investigation \n     programs. Many state program staffs are not aware of how \n     their programs actually receive funds for case management and \n     environmental investigation services, and others seemed to be \n     confused about the concept of ``reimbursement'' for services. \n     At least 6 states provided different answers to the GAO than \n     they provided to us on the question of state Medicaid policy \n     for reimbursement of environmental investigations. GAO \n     surveyed EPSDT agencies while we surveyed program staff \n     responsible for lead-related services, but both should be \n     expected to be able to answer this question accurately.\n       Twenty states currently seek and receive Medicaid \n     reimbursement for case management, and 22 states report \n     Medicaid reimbursement for environmental investigation, \n     (although apparently slightly fewer are actually collecting \n     Medicaid dollars at this time). States using state (or local) \n     funds for environmental investigation or case management \n     without receiving Medicaid reimbursement are effectively \n     forgoing the federal Medicaid match for state spending. By \n     all rights, Medicaid should pay the costs of these medically \n     necessary treatment services for enrolled children. In \n     addition, by securing Medicaid reimbursement, states may be \n     able to shift the state's share of costs to the Medicaid \n     budget, rather than using the limited funds designated for \n     lead poisoning prevention or other public health functions. \n     Similarly, states that use CDC lead poisoning prevention \n     grant funds for environmental investigation without securing \n     Medicaid reimbursement should consider the opportunity costs. \n     Since CDC grant funds are finite and scarce, the decision not \n     to seek Medicaid reimbursement means forgoing other possible \n     uses, such as initiatives targeted to primary prevention.\n       The amounts reimbursed by Medicaid for both services vary \n     dramatically from state to state, ranging from $38 to $490 \n     for environmental investigation and from $25 for one \n     educational visit to a maximum of $1,610 for 8 months of \n     follow-up for case management. Although the set of services \n     provided varies to some extent state-by-state, the actual \n     cost of providing the services is unlikely to vary so widely. \n     Ideally, reimbursement should reflect the actual costs of \n     service delivery. State and local programs cannot \n     successfully bill Medicaid or managed care for services \n     provided unless they can document the actual cost of \n     providing those services.\n       States following HUD Guidance for investigating the home of \n     a lead-poisoned child are likely to need to conduct a number \n     of specific laboratory tests, possibly including interior \n     dust wipes, paint chips, soil, and drinking water. Yet a \n     vital source of funding for environmental investigation has \n     recently been restricted. In September 1998, HCFA\n\n[[Page S13247]]\n\n     erected a barrier to quality care when it ``clarified'' its \n     policy on reimbursement for environmental investigation in \n     its update to the State Medicaid Manual. HCFA's written \n     policy now inappropriately prohibits reimbursement for the \n     environmental sampling and analysis (such as measuring lead \n     in dust, soil, and water) that is needed to investigate the \n     source of lead exposure in a poisoned child's home--and makes \n     it impossible to achieve the essential purpose of \n     environmental investigation. In effect, the new language \n     limits coverage only to XRF analysis to determine the lead \n     content of paint, which usually does not confirm the \n     immediate exposure hazard or reveal what control action is \n     needed to reduce exposure.\n       Several states reported arbitrary limits on State Medicaid \n     reimbursement for environmental investigation services, such \n     as limiting payment to one investigation per child per \n     lifetime. It appears that such limits on environmental \n     investigation are illegal, since the federal EPSDT statute \n     entitles Medicaid children to all services medically \n     necessary to respond to a condition identified during an \n     EPSDT screen.\n       Only one-third of states could report how many or what \n     percentage of their cases were even enrolled in Medicaid. \n     States must be able to document the number of Medicaid-\n     enrolled children receiving services in order to receive or \n     make informed decisions about reimbursement.\n       Thirty-eight states reported the enrollment of at least \n     some Medicaid children into managed care plans, but only 24 \n     of these reported that their state's contract(s) with managed \n     care organizations (MCOs) contained any language about lead \n     screening or treatment services. Most reported that the \n     language dealt only with lead screening or generic EPSDT \n     screening requirements, missing an opportunity to describe \n     clear duties for health care providers for lead screening and \n     follow-up care.\n       State Medicaid agencies that have not yet established \n     mechanisms for Medicaid reimbursement for case management and \n     environmental investigation should do so immediately.\n       Health departments providing case management and \n     environmental investigation should contact the Medicaid \n     agency to ensure that reimbursement is available to public \n     sector service providers, customized for the specific \n     situation.\n       CDC should require its CLPP grantees to pursue Medicaid \n     reimbursement of case management and environmental \n     investigation as a condition of funding.\n       HCFA should revise its guidance to permit Medicaid \n     reimbursement for the costs of the laboratory samples \n     necessary to determine the source of lead exposure in the \n     home of a lead-poisoned child.\n       Medicaid should fund emergency services to reduce lead \n     hazards for children with EBL, including lead dust removal \n     and interim measures to immediately reduce hazards in the \n     child's home. If the child's home can not be made safe, \n     Medicaid should reimburse the cost of emergency relocation.\n       State programs should determine and document the actual \n     costs of providing case management and environmental \n     investigation services.\n       State lead programs should negotiate adequate reimbursement \n     rates with the State Medicaid agency, based on documentation \n     of the costs of providing services.\n       Based on current costs of service delivery, state and local \n     programs should ensure that their budgets and funding \n     requests seek the resources necessary to adequately manage \n     their caseloads.\n       States should consider billing private insurance providers \n     for services provided to children enrolled in such plans.\n       HCFA should disallow, and states should discontinue the use \n     of, arbitrary limits on State Medicaid reimbursement for \n     environmental investigation services unless they are shown \n     to have a medical basis.\n       State programs should establish the administrative means \n     necessary to track the insurance status (especially Medicaid \n     enrollment) of lead-poisoned children receiving case \n     management and environmental investigation services.\n       CDC should require its CLPP and Surveillance grantees to \n     pursue collection of data on the insurance status (especially \n     Medicaid enrollment) of the children receiving case \n     management and environmental investigation services.\n       State Medicaid contracts with MCOs should contain clear \n     language describing the specific duties of the MCOs, making \n     clear whether they are expected to deliver services, make \n     referrals, or provide reimbursement to other agencies for \n     services provided. States should address lead screening, \n     diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up services explicitly, \n     rather than relying on general language referencing EPSDT. \n     States should familiarize themselves with and utilize the \n     lead purchasing specifications for Medicaid management care \n     contracts that have been developed by the Center for Health \n     Policy and Research at the George Washington University \n     (available at ``www.gwumc.edu/chpr''). Where such language \n     has already been incorporated into contracts, it should be \n     enforced.\n       Where case management and environmental investigation are \n     provided by public sector providers and Medicaid children are \n     enrolled in capitated managed care plans, states should \n     consider financing case management and environmental \n     investigation through a ``carve-out'' to ensure that \n     providers are reimbursed for their costs of providing \n     services.\n\n\n  key findings and recommendations on tracking and evaluating services\n\n       Very few programs are tracking outcomes of children \n     identified as lead poisoned. Most states count the number of \n     home visits or completed environmental investigations, but \n     very few monitor the outcomes for children and the corrective \n     measures taken in those properties found to have poisoned a \n     child. For example, eight states did not know how many lead-\n     poisoned children needing follow-up care had been identified \n     in 1997 and 23 states did not know how many of their lead-\n     poisoned children had actually received services.\n       Only 15 states reported providing oversight to ensure that \n     all children identified as lead-poisoned receive appropriate \n     follow-up care, including case management and environmental \n     investigation services. Such oversight would be particularly \n     useful in the 24 states that rely on providers outside the \n     health department to provide case management services. Only \n     13 states indicated that they collected and tabulated data on \n     the identified source(s) of lead exposure from environmental \n     investigations.\n       Tracking case management and environmental investigation \n     activities is not enough in itself. The ultimate measure of \n     effectiveness is reducing the child's lead exposure and blood \n     lead level. Case management and environmental investigation \n     programs should be thoroughly evaluated to identify programs \n     that are effective, as well as to identify problems that \n     require additional staff training, technical assistance, or \n     other attention. In particular, this survey suggests that \n     staff in many states could benefit from training in key \n     areas, such as program evaluation and Medicaid and insurance \n     reimbursement.\n       States should establish the administrative capacity at \n     either the state or local level to track delivery of case \n     management and environmental investigation services to lead-\n     poisoned children, to track outcomes of interest for \n     individual children, and to ensure that appropriate services \n     are provided to lead-poisoned children.\n       CDC should require its CLPP grantee to report on case \n     management service delivery outcome measures in their \n     required reports. Such reporting would help build capacity \n     for tracking and begin to document the effectiveness of \n     program follow-up efforts.\n       States should establish, collect, and report outcome \n     measures for case management.\n       All states should collect and aggregate data on lead \n     sources, including the proximate cause(s) of lead exposure \n     identified through environmental investigation, and the lead \n     hazard control actions taken, along with relevant information \n     allowing characterization of the lead hazards (e.g., age and \n     condition of housing, renter or owner-occupied, source and \n     pathway of exposure, etc.)\n       CDC requires its grantees to provide data through its \n     STELLAR database, but its data fields have proven to be \n     limiting, especially for non-paint sources, and many grantees \n     report their dissatisfaction with STELLAR. CDC should \n     consider moving to an alternative software package with \n     greater flexibility and easily available support. Until CDC \n     revises its requirements, states should use standard office \n     database software to keep these records.\n       CDC should undertake or fund formal evaluations of state \n     case management and environmental investigation programs. \n     Programs should be given the tools and opportunity to meet \n     goals and improve performance. However, if state or local \n     programs are not able to achieve basic standards of \n     performance in follow-up of lead-poisoned children, federal \n     funding should be terminated.\n       CDC should sponsor a system of peer evaluation for state \n     and local lead programs. A pear evaluation program would \n     allow state program staff to learn from and share with one \n     another, reinforcing the replication of innovative and \n     effective practices.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, in discussing the passage \nof a resolution we introduced designating this week, October 24 through \nthe 30th, as National Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Week.\n  Senator Reed has been such a strong advocate and leader on lead \npoisoning issues. I have enjoyed working with him on this important \npublic health issue.\n  It is my hope the designation of this week as National Childhood Lead \nPoisoning Prevention Week will help to increase awareness of the \nsignificant dangers and prevalence of childhood lead poisoning across \nour Nation.\n  Great strides have been made in the past 20 years to reduce the \nthreat that lead poses to human health. Most notably, lead has been \nbanned from many products, including residential paints, food cans, and \ngasoline. These commendable steps have significantly reduced the \nincidence of lead poisoning. But unfortunately, contrary to what many \npeople think, the threat has not been eradicated. In fact, it remains \nand continues to imperil the health and well-being of our Nation's \nchildren. In\n\n[[Page S13248]]\n\nfact, lead poisoning is the No. 1 environmental health threat to \nchildren in the United States.\n  Even low levels of lead exposure can have serious developmental \nconsequences, including reductions in IQ and attention span, reading \nand learning disabilities, hyperactivity and behavioral problems. The \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention currently estimates that \n890,000 children, age 1 through 5, have blood levels of lead that are \nhigh enough to affect their ability to learn--nearly a million \nchildren.\n  Today, the major lead poisoning threat to children is posed by paint \nthat has deteriorated. Contrary to popular belief, it is the dust from \ndeteriorating or disturbed paint, rather than paint chips, that is the \nprimary source of lead poisoning. Unfortunately, it is all too common \nfor older homes to contain lead-based paint, particularly if they were \nbuilt before 1978. More than half of the entire housing stock and \nthree-quarters of homes built before 1978, contain some lead-based \npaint. Paint manufactured prior to the residential lead paint ban often \nremains safely contained and unexposed for decades. But over time, \noften through remodeling or normal wear and tear, the paint can become \nexposed, contaminating the home with dangerous lead dust.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/27/senate-section/article/S13248-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13248-S13249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    PRESIDENTIAL AND SENATORIAL COMMISSION ON NUCLEAR TESTING TREATY\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I address the Senate today with regard to \na bill that I am introducing which provides for the establishment of a \ncommission to be known as the Presidential and Senatorial Commission on \na Nuclear Testing Treaty.\n  On October 15, shortly after the historic debate in the Senate and \nthe vote taken on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, I addressed the \nSenate, suggesting that the President and the Senate explore options by \nwhich a commission could be appointed for the purpose of assessing \nissues relating to testing of nuclear weapons, and the possibility of \ncrafting a treaty that would meet the security interests of our Nation, \nwhile enabling America to once again resume the lead in arms control.\n  Following the historic debate and vote, I voted against that treaty, \nand I would vote again tomorrow against that treaty, and the day after, \nand the day after that. I say that not in any defiant way, but simply, \nafter three hearings of the Armed Services Committee and one of the \nForeign Relations Committee, after very careful analysis, after hours \nof discussion with my colleagues, after participating in the debate, it \nwas clear to me that the record did not exist to gain my support nor, \nindeed, the support of two-thirds majority of the Senate.\n  It is my view that the Senate and the President will join together to \nprovide bipartisan leadership to determine, in a collaborative way, how \nto dispel much of the confusion in the world about why this Senate \nfailed to ratify the treaty, to explain what the options are now, and \nto show that we are analyzing all of the other possibilities relating \nto a nuclear testing treaty. This, hopefully, will dispel such \nconfusion. Much of that confusion is based on misconceptions and wrong \ninformation. But we can overcome that.\n  We must explain that this Government has coequal branches--the \nexecutive, headed by the President; and the legislative, represented by \nthe Congress--and how our Constitution entrusts to this body, the \nSenate, sole authority to give advice and consent. This body exercised \nthat obligation, I think, in a fair and objective manner. But we are \nwhere we are.\n  My bill is somewhat unique, Mr. President. I call for a commission \nwith a total of 12 members--6 to be appointed by the majority leader of \nthe Senate; 6 to be appointed by the distinguished Democratic leader of \nthe Senate, with coequal responsibility between two members to be \ndesignated as cochairmen. I did that purposely to emphasize the need \nfor bipartisanship. We, the Senate, will not ratify the treaty unless \nthere are 67 votes in the affirmative. This last vote was 19 votes \nshort--votes cast by individuals of this body of clear conscience. That \nsignificant margin of 19 votes, in my judgment, can only be overcome \nthrough a bipartisan effort to devise a nuclear testing treaty seen \nclearly as in our national interests.\n  The cochairmen will be appointed--first, one by the distinguished \nmajority leader of the Senate, and the second by the President, in \nconsultation, of course, with the distinguished minority leader. That \nbrings the President well into the equation. He will undoubtedly be in \nconsultation with the distinguished minority leader throughout the \nseries of appointments by the minority leader.\n\n  This commission can have no more than two Members of the Senate \nappointed by the majority leader, and no more than two Members of the \nSenate, if he so desires, appointed by the minority leader. Therefore, \nup to four Senators could participate. But the balance of the 12--eight \nmembers--will be drawn from individuals who have spent perhaps as much \nas a lifetime examining the complexity of issues surrounding nuclear \nweapons, the complexity of the issues surrounding all types of \ntreaties, agreements, and understandings relating to nonproliferation.\n  We saw them come forward in this debate--individuals such as former \nSecretaries of Defense, former Secretaries of State, men and women of \nhonest, good intention, with honest differences of opinion, and those \ndifferences have to be bridged. By including eight individuals not in \nthe Senate along with four Senators--if it is the will of the leaders--\nwe can lift this issue out of the cauldron of politics. We can show the \nworld that we are making a conscientious effort to act in a bipartisan \nmanner. The experts the majority leader and the ones the minority \nleader, in consultation with the President, would pick will be known to \nthe world--former Secretaries of Defense of this Nation, former \nSecretaries of State, former National Laboratory Directors, individuals \nwhose collective experience in this would add up to hundreds of years. \nIn that way, I believe we will bring credibility to this process and \nwill result in this commission being able to render valuable advice and \nrecommendations to the Senate and the President at the end of their \nwork.\n  Several years ago, I was privileged to be the Ranking Member of the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence. There was a great deal of \nconcern in the Senate toward the Central Intelligence Agency and how it \nwas operating at that time. As a matter of fact, some of our most \ndistinguished Members--one indeed I remember clearly--called for the \nabolishment of the CIA. This individual was extremely disturbed with \nthe manner in which they were conducting business.\n  I took it upon myself at that time to introduce in the Senate \nlegislation calling for the establishment of a commission to make an \noverall study of our intelligence and to make recommendations to the \nPresident and the Congress. Congress adopted the legislation I \nintroduced and it was enacted into law.\n  The first chairman of that commission was Les Aspin, former Secretary \nof Defense, who, unfortunately, had an untimely death. He was succeeded \nby Harold Brown, former Secretary of Defense and former Secretary of \nthe Air Force, who I knew well. I served with him. Our former \ncolleague, Senator Rudman, was also closely involved. I was privileged \nto be on that commission. It did its work. It came up with \nrecommendations. The intelligence community accepted those \nrecommendations. The CIA survived and today flourishes.\n  I have given the outline of the commission I am proposing today. Let \nme briefly refer to the basic charge given the commission and the work \nthey should perform.\n  Duties of the commission: It shall be the duty of the commission, (1) \nto determine under what circumstances the nuclear testing treaty would \nbe in the national security interests of our Nation; (2) to determine \nhow a nuclear testing treaty would relate to the security interests of \nother nations. I was motivated to do this because of the \nmisunderstanding about the important and decisive action taken by this \nbody.\n\n  (3) To determine provisions essential to a nuclear testing treaty \nsuch that that treaty would be in the national security interests of \nthe United States;\n\n[[Page S13249]]\n\n(4) to determine whether a nuclear testing treaty would achieve the \nnonproliferation and arms control objectives of our Nation.\n  The bill includes a number of other recitations and other important \nprovisions.\n  We deal with the question of verification. We deal with the question \nof the science-based stockpile stewardship program, now being monitored \nand more fully developed by the Department of Energy.\n  All of this is carefully covered in this legislation I make to this \nbody tonight.\n  This is one Senator who believed he had an obligation to confer with \nhis colleagues about this important matter. I believe it is important \nthat this legislation be laid down as a starting point. It may well be \nthat other colleagues have better ideas. I take absolutely no pride of \nauthorship in this effort. Perhaps others can contribute ideas as to \nhow this legislative proposal might be amended.\n  Eventually, collectively, I hope we can work with our leadership in \nestablishing some type of commission so the consideration of a nuclear \ntesting treaty can go foward and people around the globe will have a \nbetter understanding of our efforts to achieve a more secure world.\n  I went back to do a little research which proved quite \ninteresting. We have heard so many times in this Chamber that politics \nshould stop at the water's edge. I was reminded of this as I was \nprivileged, along with many others in this Chamber, to attend the \npresentation to the former President of the United States, Gerald R. \nFord, and his lovely wife, Mrs. Betty Ford, the Congressional Gold \nMedal.\n\n  I took down some notes from President Ford's wonderful speech. I had \nthe privilege of serving under President Ford as Secretary of the Navy \nand, indeed, Chairman of the Bicentennial. I have great respect for \nhim.\n  He talked about Senator Vandenberg and how Senator Vandenberg was an \nabsolute, well-known conservative. Yet it was Senator Vandenberg's \nleadership that got the Marshall Program through the Senate of the \nUnited States. The Marshall Program was a landmark piece of legislation \ninitiated by President Truman. Indeed, in some of the accounts of \nhistory, some people said it should be called the Truman Plan. But \nTruman said ``Oh, no, don't name it after me because the Congress won't \naccept it; name it after George Marshall''--showing the marvelous \ncharacter of the wonderful President.\n  President Ford also talked about Everett Dirksen. He said:\n\n       The executive branch and the legislative branch worked with \n     him arm in arm on relationships that were important between \n     this country and the rest of the world.\n\n  Those are Ford's words.\n  Bipartisanship helped get the Marshall Plan through and enabled this \ncountry to show strength in the face of the cold war period.\n  That is history, ladies and gentleman.\n  I don't suggest in any way that I am making history here tonight. But \nI think it is very important that other Senators take time to look at \nthis and contribute their own ideas. It will require a significant \nmeasure of bipartisanship to achieve the objectives of the commission I \nam proposing. Let's see what we can do to work with our leadership and \ngo forward.\n  The events of history are interesting. Senator Vandenberg, chairman \nof the Foreign Relations Committee, in 1948, thought Tom Dewey was \ngoing to win the Presidency. He wrote into the Republican platform the \nfollowing phrase. I quote him:\n\n       We shall invite the minority party to join us under the \n     next Republican administration in stopping partisan politics \n     at the water's edge.\n\n  As it turned out, Truman won that historic election. And what did \nVandenberg do but go on and work with President Truman in the spirit of \nthat statement that he put into the Republican platform, and the first \nlandmark that the two achieved was the Marshall Plan.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/27/senate-section/article/S13249-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE LATE CHARLES E. SIMONS, JR., SENIOR UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, it gives me no pleasure to rise today \nand seek recognition, for it is to carry out a very sad task, which is \nto mark the passing of one of my longest and closest friends, Judge \nCharles E. Simons, Jr. of Aiken, South Carolina.\n  Judge Simons has served with distinction as a Federal District Court \nJudge for the District of South Carolina since his confirmation in \n1964. It was my pleasure to recommend this talented and bright man to \nPresident Johnson, and everyone who monitors the Federal Bench has been \nimpressed with the skill and insight in which Judge Simons adjudicated \ncases. His reputation is that of being a tough, but fair, judge whose \nimpartiality is above reproach and whose commitment to the rule of law \nis well known. The respect and admiration of the legal community for \nJudge Simons is evidenced by the fact that the Federal Courthouse on \nPark Avenue in Aiken was dedicated in his honor in 1987. Certainly a \nfitting tribute to a man who dedicated thirty-five years of his life to \nthe Federal Bench and had served as the Chief Judge of the District \nCourt for six years.\n  I must confess that Charles Simons was well known to me before I \nadvanced his name to the President, for he and I had been law partners \nin Aiken, South Carolina for many years. He was such an able and \nintelligent man, he was a great asset to our practice. In 1954, we had \nto end our partnership because of my election to the United States \nSenate, but Charles Simons continued to prosper as an attorney, earning \na well deserved reputation as an outstanding general practice lawyer.\n  While Charles Simons loved his work and the law, it was not an all \nconsuming passion, and he enjoyed many other activities outside the \ncourtroom. South Carolina is a beautiful state, and its citizens \neagerly engage in activities that allow them to spend as much time as \npossible outside enjoying the natural beauty of the Palmetto State. For \nCharles Simons, these activities included golf, hunting, and fishing, \neach which he pursued with an unflagging enthusiasm. These pursuits not \nonly allowed him a temporary reprieve from the weighty responsibilities \nof the duties of a Federal District Court Judge, but they also allowed \nhim to spend time with his friends.\n  One of the things that bonds friendships is shared interests, and \nboth Charles and I had a shared interest in physical fitness. He \nremained a fit and active man right up until July of this year when he \nsuffered brain damage as a result of a fall. Sadly, surgery did not \nreturn Charles to his previous health and he began a decline that \nresulted in his death yesterday at the age of eighty-three. Though his \npassing was not entirely unexpected, it still is a blow to his family \nand friends and to the South Carolina legal community.\n  While many mourn the death of Charles Simons, we should take the \nopportunity to be certain we celebrate his life and accomplishments. He \nserved the nation in a time of war, he was an accomplished attorney, a \nrespected judge, and a devoted family man. He leaves a body of work \nthat stands as case law and he has set a standard for other public \nservants to follow. All these accomplishments are even more impressive \nwhen one considers Charles' humble beginnings and the fact that he \naccomplished all he did through hard work, determination, and \nintelligence.\n  I am deeply saddened to have lost such a good friend and I share the \ngrief of the Simons' family. They have my deepest sympathies and my \nheartfelt condolences on the death of Charles.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/27/senate-section/article/S13249-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13249-S13251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           REPORT ON CONFERENCE FOR LABOR-HHS APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, a few moments ago, a conference on the \nappropriations bill for Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nwas completed. It was a rather unusual procedure because the conference \nreport was incorporated into the conference of the District of Columbia \nappropriations bill. That arose in light of the fact the House of \nRepresentatives had not passed a bill on Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education--an appropriations bill for those three \ndepartments, but the Senate did.\n  The procedure was adopted to have an informal conference with Senator \nHarkin, ranking member of the subcommittee, and myself representing\n\n[[Page S13250]]\n\nthe Senate, and Congressman John Porter, chairman of the House \nsubcommittee representing the House. I had talked to the ranking \nDemocrat, Congressman Obey, and had invited him to participate. He did \ncome to one of the meetings but said he did not intend to participate \nbecause of his objection to the nature of the proceedings, in light of \nthe fact that the House had not passed an appropriations bill.\n  This is not the ideal, proceeding in the manner I have described, but \nit is the best that could be done under the circumstances. There is a \nreal effort to complete the 13 appropriations bills and submit them to \nthe President before the close of business tomorrow so it all would be \non the President's desk before the current continuing resolution \nexpired. It may be that the President will veto the District of \nColumbia bill and the inclusion of the appropriations bill on Labor, \nHealth and Human Services. If that is to follow, then we will be \nproceeding to try to reach an accommodation as to what the bill ought \nto be.\n  My suggestion is the bill, which has been submitted, is a good bill, \nnot a perfect bill--I haven't seen one of those in the time I have been \nin the Senate--but, I submit, a good bill.\n  It contains a program level of $93.7 billion, which is about $2 \nbillion less than the program level passed by the Senate. This bill was \ncrafted by Senator Harkin and myself on a bipartisan basis, crafted in \na way to obtain the signature of the President of the United States. We \nhave directed very substantial funding to the three departments where \nthe total bill is $6 billion over fiscal year 1999 and an increase of \nsome $600 million over what the President requested.\n  Education is a priority in America of the highest magnitude. This \nbill contains a program level of $35 billion for the Department of \nEducation, constituting an increase of $2 billion over fiscal year 1999 \nand some $300 million over the administration's request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a brief summary be printed in the \nCongressional Record at the conclusion of my remarks, and for the \npurposes of this oral statement, I will summarize the highlights.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. With respect to the very important issue of Head Start, \nthe bill contains $5.2 billion, which is an increase of $608.5 million \nover the fiscal year 1999 level, and it matches the very substantial \nrequest for an increase requested by the President.\n  Special education, another very important item, contains $6.035 \nbillion, an increase of some $912.5 million over last year.\n  On the program GEAR UP, which is to support early college preparation \nfor low-income elementary and secondary schoolchildren, there is an \nincrease of some $60 million, a 50-percent increase over last year's \nfunding level of $120 million. I mention GEAR UP specifically because \nwe have not met the President's request, which was a doubling to $240 \nmillion from $120 million, but accommodating as far as we could some \n50-percent increase, or some $60 million.\n  There is a contentious issue on class size, and the President has \nrequested some $1.4 billion with the money to be directed to class size \nreduction. We have appropriated $1.2 billion, which is the same as last \nyear's appropriation, a very substantial sum of money, and we have done \nit in a way which is somewhat different from the President's request. \nThis class size reduction is the priority specified in our bill. But we \ndo allow the local school districts, if they decide, in their wisdom, \nthey want to use the money for something else, such as professional \ndevelopment or any other need of the school district, to direct the \nfunds in that manner.\n  The President would like to have it limited only to classroom size \nreduction. This is a matter I have personally discussed with President \nClinton, and it seems to me that, public policy-wise, the provisions of \nthis bill are the preferable ones. I say that because we give priority \nto what the President wanted--that is, classroom reduction size--but if \nthe local school district makes a determination that their local needs \nare different, they ought to have the latitude to make that change. \nThat does not provide a straitjacket coming out of Washington, DC, but \nstates the preference and allows the latitude for the local district to \nmake the change.\n  This bill contains a program for fighting school violence, with some \n$733.8 million being reallocated from existing programs to focus on the \ncause of youth violence. I convened three extensive roundtable \ndiscussions, or seminars, in effect, with experts from a variety of \nagencies within the Department of Education, the Department of Health \nand Human Services, the Department of Labor, and also the Department of \nJustice, to analyze the problems of school violence. We came up with a \nvariety of programs from existing funds to be directed in this manner.\n  The bill also contains very substantial increased funding for the \nNational Institutes of Health. Congressman Porter, Senator Harkin, and \nI think the Congress generally has acknowledged that the National \nInstitutes of Health are the crown jewels of the Federal Government. \nSometimes I say they are the only jewels of the Federal Government. But \nenormous increases have been made in medical research to combat \nParkinson's disease, with the experts now telling us we may be within 5 \nyears of conquering Parkinson's. There have been enormous advances on \nAlzheimer's, breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, heart \nailments, and the whole range of medical problems.\n\n  Stem cells have become a focal point of medical research. Almost a \nyear ago, they burst upon the scene and provide a real opportunity--a \nveritable fountain of youth--with these cells being replaced in the \nhuman body to conquer these medical maladies. In essence, the bill is a \nvery comprehensive effort to deal with the funding needs of these three \nmajor departments.\n  Another aspect of the conference today was an effort to have offsets \nin order to obtain the goal that we not touch Social Security, and we \nhave done that with an across-the-board cut of 0.95 percent in budget \nauthority and 0.57 percent in outlays. That is a little less than a 1-\npercent cut across the board in budget authority and a little more than \na half-percent cut in outlays.\n  Frankly, I do not like an across-the-board cut. But among all of the \nalternatives we were considering to avoid touching Social Security, \nthis was the least undesirable of the alternatives. And while there \nwill be cuts below what I would like to see, the increases, by and \nlarge, are sufficient so that there will be a net increase nonetheless.\n  For example, in the Head Start program, we increase funding by some \n$608 million. The 1-percent cut will reduce that figure by $38.7 \nmillion, to about a $569 million increase. On special education, for \nexample, we had a $912 million increase. A 1-percent across-the-board \ncut will reduce that by $23 million, so there still will be a net \nincrease of some $889 million.\n  We have structured this bill with some advances, but we have made a \ndetermination not to come in with advances higher than what the \nPresident had proposed. It is my hope that President Clinton will sign \nthis bill. From all of the collateral considerations, it appears \nunlikely he will sign the bill.\n  I have personally contacted Mr. Jack Lew, Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget, in an effort to negotiate with the White House \nin advance of this conference report. But there have been objections \nraised by some on the Democratic side in the House to having those \ndiscussions move forward because the House, in fact, did not pass a \nbill on Labor, Health, and Human Services.\n  If this is another step in the legislative process, so be it, with \nthe bill heading toward the President's desk. If he signs it, great; if \nhe vetoes it, we are prepared to go to work and try to move through \nwhat ought to be done. If someone has a better idea on offsets, we are \nprepared to listen. The objective of not touching Social Security, I \nthink, is a consensus objective. The objective of not raising taxes, \nagain, is a consensus objective. We have provided, I think \nappropriately--some would say generously--for important education and \nhealth programs, worker safety programs, and we will be prepared to \nmove forward to see to it that these very important functions are \ncarried\n\n[[Page S13251]]\n\nout and to seek agreement between the legislature--the Congress--and \nthe administration.\n  One final note: In my discussions with the President when we talked \nabout his interest in having classroom size done to his specifications, \nI think it is fair to note that the Constitution gives the principal \nauthority on the appropriations process to the Congress. Of course, the \nPresident has to sign the bill. But constitutionally, the Congress has \nthe principal line of responsibility. The President would like to have \nthis appropriations bill serve as an authorization vehicle. The \nauthorizers are not happy about that with the process in the Congress \nfor a separate committee to do the authorization and the separate \ncommittee to do the appropriations. We have undertaken the \nauthorization but have exercised our congressional preference in \nsetting public policy to establish the President's program for \nclassroom size as the priority, but giving the latitude to the school \ndistricts to do it differently. We think that is consistent with the \nconstitutional responsibility we have.\n  We think some deference ought to be paid to our determination of \npublic policy. But again we are prepared to work with the President to \nreach a bill which will be acceptable to both the Congress and the \nPresident.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n    Fiscal Year 2000 Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Conference \n                               Agreement\n\n       Budget Summary and Bill Totals--The bill contains a program \n     level of $93.7 billion, an increase of $6 billion over the FY \n     '99 program level of $87.7 billion, and in increase of $600 \n     million over the President.\n\n\n                            bill highlights\n\n       School Violence Initiative totals $733.8 million.

Mr. President, I want to commemorate the 30-day period \nfrom September 15 through October 15 which was designated by the \nPresident as Hispanic Heritage Month.\n  Around the country, and in my home state of New Mexico, Hispanics \nhave been making outstanding contributions to public service, business, \neducation, and to our communities. Hispanic Heritage Month signals a \ntime of recognition and celebration of an enriched legacy, tradition, \nand culture that has been present in our country for over 400 years.\n  We in New Mexico are well familiar with the fact that the Hispanic \npresence in the United States reaches far back to 1528, and in New \nMexico to 1539. We also know that Hispanics have influenced greatly our \narchitecture, food, clothing, literature, music, and certainly our \nfamily values. Many of our landmark cities have grown from early \nSpanish settlements; cities such as Los Angeles, San Antonio, San \nFrancisco, and Santa Fe, to name only a few.\n  Although we know that Hispanics make up the fastest-growing minority \ngroup in this country, and by 2025 will be the largest minority group \nin our national population growth, too many Americans still are not \naware of the historic significance and contributions of Hispanics in \nAmerican life. That is why Hispanic Heritage Month is important as a \nrecognition of the accomplishments and contributions of Hispanics in \nour country.\n  There are countless, New Mexicans who have contributed greatly to our \nHispanic community through hard work and the belief that one can \naccomplish what one sets his or her mind to do. Today I'd like to \nmention two of these individuals from New Mexico, who have contributed \nto their communities and have made a difference in my home State.\n\n[[Page S13252]]\n\n  At the age of 5, Mike Lujan was already contributing to his family's \nhousehold income to help support his parents and 14 siblings. Mike \nencountered difficulties in high school and graduated with a 1.7 grade-\npoint-average. However, because of his determination Mike enrolled in \ncollege, sought tutoring, and this year, he will be celebrating a \nquarter century of teaching in the Santa Fe Public Schools. During his \ntime as a teacher and head wrestling coach, Mike Lujan has been honored \nwith USA Weekend's ``Most Caring Coach'' award and the national \nJefferson Award given to ``a citizen who cares'' which is presented by \na three-star general at the Pentagon.\n\n  This past August, Mike's story was told in ``Vista'' a magazine which \ndiscusses Hispanic Issues and salutes Hispanics in a variety of areas. \nThe article about Mike closes with a quote from him which says, ``One \nof the secrets for success is to remember your roots. Once you forget \nwho you are, you can't help others.''\n  The second individual I would like to recognize is Tony Suazo, a \nnative of Canjilon, located in northern New Mexico. Tony was recognized \nas 1 of 10 northern New Mexicans, by the Santa Fe New Mexican, for \ntheir volunteer and professional achievements in the community. Every \nChristmas, Tony Suazo walks through the streets of Espanola, NM, in a \nSanta Suit, with a bag of toys thrown over his shoulder. He plays Santa \nClaus at the ``Put a smile on a Child's Face'' annual children's \nChristmas party. This party draws about 3,000 people, and every child \nwho walks through the door receives a gift. Every year leading up to \nthis event, Tony closes his business 6 weeks before the Christmas \nparty. He then runs around town faxing fliers about the event and \ncollects the toys, to be given as gifts, in front of local shopping \ncenters.\n  You see, Mr. President, Tony Suazo and his wife close their business \ndown 6 weeks prior to this event and live off their savings during that \ntime. He does not miss his lost income because, as his wife puts it, \n``His dream is to see every child, whether they are needy or not, have \na toy.'' Tony has been awarded the Espanola Valley Chamber of \nCommerce's Man of the Year.\n  These two individuals serve as an example of Hispanics who have been \nmaking contributions to our communities--believing in themselves, \nbelieving in hard work, and believing that they can achieve their \ngoals.\n  Mr. President, at this time let me just say a couple of sentences in \nSpanish because that is a very important part of the Spanish tradition \nin my State.\n  Sr. Presidente, conozco solo una manera de rendir tributo a una \ncultura cuyo idioma es tradicionalmente sinonimo de identidad. El \nidioma espanol imparte un sentido de conciencia, historia y tradicion \nque en ingles, mi lengua materna, es a veces imposible expresar.\n  Sin idioma no habrian anecdotas, y sin las anecdotas del dirigente \nLujan, Tony Suazo y de un sinnumero de hispanos-americanos, nuestra \nnacion sin duda alguna experimentaria un vacio en la medula misma de su \nidentidad.\n  Let me just summarize that or translate it:\n  Mr. President, there is only one way I know to pay full tribute to a \nculture for which language is often synonymous with identity. The \nSpanish language imparts a sense of feeling, history, and tradition, \nwhich my own native tongue of English often fails to convey.\n  Without language, there would be no stories, and without the stories \nof Coach Lujan, Tony Suazo, and countless other Hispanic-Americans, our \nnation would surely suffer from the great void at the very heart of its \nidentity.\n  Mr. President, it is with great pride that I call on all my \ncolleagues and on all Americans to join me even though I am a little \nlate with this, in celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month and to come \ntogether as individuals, families, and communities to learn more about \nthis extremely important culture in our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/27/senate-section/article/S13252-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13252-S13254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CBO COST ESTIMATE\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, on October 19, 1999, I filed Report No. \n106-196 to accompany S. 976, a bill to amend title V of the Public \nHealth Service Act to focus the authority of the Substance Abuse and \nMental Health Services Administration on community-based services for \nchildren and adolescents, to enhance flexibility and accountability, to \nestablish programs for youth treatment, and to respond to crises, \nespecially those related to children and violence. At the time the \nreport was filed, the estimate by the Congressional Budget Office was \nnot available. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the CBO estimate \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 26, 1999.\n     Hon. James M. Jeffords,\n     Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n         Pensions, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 976, the Youth \n     Drug and Mental Health Services Act.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contacts are Julia \n     Christensen (for federal costs), who can be reached at 226-\n     9010, and Leo Lex (for the state and local impact), who can \n     be reached at 225-3220.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Barry B. Anderson\n                                   (For Dan L. Crippen, Director).\n       Enclosure.\n     S. 976--Youth Drug and Mental Health Services Act\n       Summary: S. 976 would reauthorize certain programs of the \n     Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration \n     (SAMHSA) through fiscal year 2002. The bill would consolidate \n     programs currently operated under the Knowledge and \n     Development Application (KDA) and Targeted Capacity Expansion \n     (TCE) programs into three programs that target priorities for \n     mental health and prevention and treatment of substance \n     abuse. The bill would explicitly repeal certain programs and \n     would transfer general discretionary grant authority for \n     demonstrations, training, and other purposes to these new \n     programs. In addition, the bill would reauthorize SAMHSA's \n     Mental Health and Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment \n     Block Grants and would continue the transition of those block \n     grant programs into federal-state performance partnerships. \n     S. 976 also would create several new programs that focus on \n     children and adolescents.\n       To fund programs administered by SAMHSA, the bill would \n     authorize the appropriation of about $4.1 billion for 2000 \n     and such sums as may be necessary for 2001 and 2002. Assuming \n     the appropriation of the necessary amounts, CBO estimates \n     that implementing S. 976 would cost about $1.5 billion in \n     2000 and $12.2 billion over the 2000-2004 period. Enacting S. \n     976 would not affect direct spending or receipts; therefore, \n     pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply.\n       S. 976 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n     (UMRA). However, the bill would provide significant funding \n     to both public and private entities for programs dealing with \n     substance abuse and mental health.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of S. 976 is shown in the following table. \n     For the purposes of this estimate, CBO assumes that the bill \n     will be enacted this fall and that the necessary \n     appropriations will be provided for each fiscal year. The \n     table summarizes the budgetary impact of the legislation \n     under two different sets of assumptions. The first set of \n     assumptions provides the estimated levels of authorizations \n     with annual adjustments for anticipated inflation, when \n     appropriate, after fiscal year 2000. The second set of \n     assumptions does not include any such inflation adjustments. \n     The costs of this legislation would fall within budget \n     function 550 (health).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                      By fiscal years, in millions of dollars--\n                                   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        1999         2000         2001         2002         2003         2004\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\n \n                                         With Adjustments for Inflation\n \nSAMHSA Spending Under Current Law:\n    Budget Authority \\1\\..........        2,488        (\\2\\)            0            0            0            0\n\n[[Page S13253]]\n\n \n    Estimated Outlays.............        2,235        1,427          182           75            0            0\nProposed Changes:\n    Estimated Authorization Level.            0        4,122        4,266        4,358            0            0\n    Estimated Outlays.............            0        1,452        3,317        3,976        2,634          787\nSAMHSA Spending Under S. 976:\n    Estimated Authorization Level         2,488        4,122        4,266        4,358            0            0\n     \\1\\..........................\n    Estimated Outlays.............        2,235        2,879        3,499        4,050        2,634          787\n \n                                        Without Adjustments for Inflation\n \nSAMHSA Spending Under Current Law:\n    Budget Authority \\1\\..........        2,488        (\\2\\)            0            0            0            0\n    Estimated Outlays.............        2,235        1,427          182           75            0            0\nProposed Changes:\n    Estimated Authorization Level.            0        4,122        4,122        4,122            0            0\n    Estimated Outlays.............            0        1,452        3,267        3,828        2,510          750\nSAMHSA Spending Under S. 976:\n    Estimated Authorization Level         2,488        4,122        4,122        4,122            0            0\n     \\1\\..........................\n    Estimated Outlays.............        2,235        2,879        3,449        3,903        2,510          750\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The 1999 level is the amount appropriated for that year.\n\\2\\ Amounts appropriated for SAMHSA in Public Laws 106-62 and 106-75, the fiscal year 2000 continuing\n  resolutions that provide funding through October 29, 1999, are not included in this estimate. Thus far, no\n  full-year appropriations for SAMHSA programs have been provided for 2000.\n\n     Basis of Estimate\n       Provisions relating to services for children and \n           adolescents\n       Projects for Children and Violence. S. 976 would authorize \n     two discretionary grant programs that focus on issues \n     surrounding children and violence. The bill would authorize \n     the appropriation of $100 million in 2000 and such sums as \n     necessary for 2001 and 2002 for making grants to public \n     entities in support of local community programs. The bill \n     also would allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     (HHS) to use those funds to carry out community assistance \n     programs. Projects supported by grants must adopt a \n     comprehensive approach to helping children deal with \n     violence. S. 976 also would authorize $50 million in 2000 and \n     such sums as necessary for 2001 and 2002 for a grant program \n     to sponsor the development of best practices for treating \n     psychiatric disorders associated with violence-related \n     stress. Grant assistance would also be available to establish \n     technical assistance centers that would directly help \n     communities deal with violence. These programs would cost $18 \n     million in 2000 and $422 million during the 2000-2004 period, \n     assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts.\n       High-Risk Youth. The bill would reauthorize the High-Risk \n     Youth Program at such sums as necessary for 2000 through \n     2002. Based on the amount spent on this activity in the past, \n     CBO estimates that continuing the program would require \n     appropriations of about $7 million a year for 2000 through \n     2002. Subject to the appropriation of the estimated amounts, \n     CBO estimates that implementing this provision would cost $2 \n     million in 2000 and $21 million during the 2000-2004 period.\n       Substance Abuse Treatment Services for Children and \n     Adolescents. Section 104 of S. 976 would authorize three \n     grant programs that would provide assistance to public and \n     private nonprofit entities for substance abuse services for \n     children and adolescents. Those programs would increase \n     access to substance abuse treatment and early intervention \n     services for children and adolescents and target prevention \n     activities against methamphetamine or inhalant abuse and \n     addiction among youths. The bill would require that SAMHSA \n     conduct an evaluation of methamphetamine and inhalant \n     prevention programs and submit to the Congress an annual \n     report on the effectiveness of those programs. The bill also \n     would authorize a grant program that would fund up to four \n     youth interagency research, training, and technical \n     assistance centers. S. 976 would authorize $74 million in \n     2000 for these programs and such sums as necessary amounts, \n     CBO estimates that these programs would cost $7 million in \n     2000 and $205 million during the 2000-2004 period.\n       Comprehensive Community Services for Children with Serious \n     Emotional Disturbances. S. 976 would reauthorize the \n     Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services for Children \n     and Their Families Program through 2002. The bill would allow \n     the Secretary of HHS to waive certain program requirements \n     for territories, Indian tribes, and tribal organizations. The \n     bill also would increase the grant duration from five years \n     to six years. It would permit current grantees to receive a \n     noncompetitive award in the sixth year equal to the amount \n     awarded in the fifth year. The bill would authorize $100 \n     million for the program in 2000 and such sums as necessary \n     for 2001 and 2002. Subject to appropriation of the necessary \n     amounts, CBO estimates that implementing this provision would \n     cost $16 million in 2000 and $290 million over the 2000-2004 \n     period.\n       Services for Children of Substance Abusers. S. 976 would \n     reauthorize the Services for Children of Substance Abusers \n     Program and transfer its authority within HHS from the Health \n     Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to SAMHSA. This \n     program was never directly funded under HRSA. The \n     reauthorized program would provide grants to public and \n     private nonprofit entities to support a range of services for \n     children of substance abusers, including primary health care, \n     counseling, and referral services. It also would provide \n     services to affected families and would allow funds to be \n     used for training certain providers of services covered under \n     the program. For this program, S. 976 would authorize \n     appropriations of $50 million in 2000 and such sums as \n     necessary for 2001 and 2002. Implementing this program would \n     cost $5 million in 2000 and $148 million during the 2000-2004 \n     period.\n       Services for Youth Offenders. Section 107 of the bill would \n     authorize a program to award competitive grants to state and \n     local juvenile justice agencies. Funds would support services \n     for youth offenders following their discharge from juvenile \n     or criminal justice facilities. Individuals qualifying for \n     those services also must have or be at risk of developing a \n     serious and diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional \n     disorder. The bill would limit spending on funds used toward \n     planning and transition costs for youths during their \n     incarceration to 20 percent of the amount of each grant. S. \n     976 would authorize $40 million in 2000 and such sums as \n     necessary for 2001 and 2002. CBO estimates that implementing \n     this program would cost $4 million in 2000 and $111 million \n     during the 2000-2004 period.\n       Emergency Response. S. 976 would permit the Secretary of \n     HHS to use up to 3 percent of discretionary funds \n     appropriated to SAMHSA under title V of the Public Health \n     Service Act, excluding amounts appropriated to the Project \n     for Assistance in Transition from Homeless (PATH) Program, to \n     make noncompetitive grants to address emergency situations. \n     The bill would require that the Secretary publish objective \n     criteria that would be used to establish the appropriate uses \n     for the emergency funds.\n       Other Provisions. The bill also would reauthorize the \n     general authorities of SAMHSA under section 501 of the Public \n     Health Service Act. S. 976 would authorize $25 million in \n     2000 and such sums as necessary for 2001 and 2002 for the \n     purpose of providing grants, cooperative agreements, and \n     contracts under section 501. According to SAMHSA, \n     authorizations for this program are intended as a safety-net \n     mechanism for the agency; therefore, CBO estimates that no \n     additional amounts would be required for 2001 and 2002. \n     However, assuming the appropriation of the authorized amount \n     in 2000, CBO estimates that minimal spending would arise from \n     this authority--about $1 million in 2000 and $8 million over \n     the 2000-2004 period.\n       Provisions relating to mental health\n       Priority Mental Health Needs of Regional and National \n     Significance. S. 976 would consolidate SAMHSA's discretionary \n     authorities for certain mental health activities, including \n     those currently funded through its KDA program, under a new \n     program. The bill would repeal certain programs and would \n     transfer general discretionary grant authority for \n     demonstrations, training, and other purposes to the new \n     program. Under the consolidated program, competitive grants \n     would be disbursed to states, political subdivisions of \n     states, Indian tribes and tribal organizations, other public \n     entities, and private nonprofit organizations. Funds could be \n     used to provide training and technical assistance, develop \n     best practices in the mental health field for prevention, \n     treatment and rehabilitation (and evaluations), establish \n     programs to help states and communities target gaps in \n     prevention services, and develop family and consumer \n     networks. S. 976 would authorize $300 million in 2000 and \n     such sums as necessary for 2001 through 2002. Subject to \n     appropriation of the necessary amounts, CBO estimates that \n     this program would cost $30 million in 2000 and $862 million \n     during the 2000-2004 period.\n       Community Mental Health Services Performance Partnership \n     Block Grant. S. 976 would provide for a full transition of \n     SAMHSA's Block Grants for Community Mental Health Services \n     Program to the Community Mental Health Services Performance \n     Partnership model. The bill would authorize the appropriation \n     of $450 million for the program in 2000 and such sums as \n     necessary for 2001 and 2002. Subject to appropriation of the \n     necessary amounts, CBO estimates that this provision would \n     cost $189 million in 2000 and $1.3 billion during 2000 \n     through 2004.\n       Under the performance partnership grant program, states \n     enter into agreements, or\n\n[[Page S13254]]\n\n     ``performance partnerships,'' with the Secretary of HHS. The \n     federal-state partnership identifies goals and objectives and \n     develops performance indicators, that will be used to \n     help states and grant recipients ultimately reach their \n     programmatic targets. The program is designed to foster \n     the development of networks that promote a comprehensive \n     approach to community-based mental health care. The bill \n     would replace the current requirements for state plan \n     submissions with five broad criteria. In addition, S. 976 \n     would establish the amount each state received in 1998 as \n     the minimum for 2000 and subsequent years.\n       Grants for the Benefit of Homeless Individuals. The bill \n     would authorize $50 million for this program in 2000 and such \n     sums as necessary for 2001 and 2002. The program received no \n     appropriation in 1999. This program would cost $8 million in \n     2000 and $146 million over the 2000-2004 period, assuming \n     appropriation of the necessary amounts.\n       PATH Program. The Projects for Assistance in Transition \n     from Homelessness Program would be reauthorized through 2002. \n     The bill also would provide the Secretary of HHS with new \n     authority to waive requirements for entities to provide \n     certain services under the program. The bill would authorize \n     the appropriation of $75 million a year from 2000 through \n     2002. Subject to the appropriation of the authorized amounts, \n     this program would cost $29 million in 2000 and $218 million \n     during 2000 through 2004.\n       Protection and Advocacy. S. 976 would reauthorize the \n     Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Individuals Act of \n     1986 at such sums as necessary for 2000 through 2002. The \n     provision also would revise the minimum allotment formula \n     under the formula grant. In addition, the bill would change \n     the name of the act to the ``Protection and Advocacy for \n     Individuals with Mental Illnesses Act.'' CBO estimates that \n     carrying out this provision would require appropriations of \n     $23 million a year, adjusted for inflation. Implementing this \n     program would cost $12 million in 2000 and $70 million during \n     the 2000-2004 period, assuming appropriation of the estimated \n     amounts.\n       Provisions relating to substance abuse\n       Priority Substance Abuse Treatment Needs of Regional and \n     National Significance. S. 976 would replace SAMHSA's \n     substance abuse treatment projects as currently funded under \n     the KDA and TCE programs with a new program that targets \n     treatment needs. The bill would repeal certain programs and \n     would consolidate general discretionary grant authority for \n     demonstrations, training, and other purposes under the new \n     program. The bill would authorize $300 million in 2000 and \n     such sums as necessary for 2001 and 2002. Assuming \n     appropriation of the necessary amounts, this program would \n     cost $39 million in 2000 and $870 million during 2000 through \n     2004.\n       Priority Substance Abuse Prevention Needs of Regional and \n     National Significance. Similarly, S. 976 would replace \n     SAMHSA's substance abuse prevention activities as currently \n     funded under the KDA and TCE programs with a new program that \n     funds projects targeting prevention needs. The new program \n     would consolidate SAMHSA's discretionary grant authority for \n     certain substance abuse prevention programs within a single \n     program. The bill would authorize $300 million in 2000 and \n     such sums as necessary for 2001 and 2002. Subject to the \n     appropriation of necessary funds, this program would cost $36 \n     million in 2000 and $869 million during the 2000-2004 period.\n       Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Performance \n     Partnership Block Grant. S. 976 would provide for a full \n     transition of the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment \n     Block Grant to the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment \n     Performance Partnership Block Grant model. The bill would \n     authorize $2 billion for 2000 and such sums as necessary for \n     2001 and 2002. We estimate that this provision would cost \n     $988 million in 2000 and $6.1 billion over the 2000-2004 \n     period, assuming appropriation of the necessary funds.\n       Under the performance partnership model, the Secretary \n     works with the states and other interested groups to develop \n     programmatic goals, objectives, and performance measures with \n     the intent of reducing the prevalence of substance abuse and \n     improving access to preventive and treatment services.\n       S. 976 would repeal or amend some of the requirements under \n     current law, while retaining others. For example, the bill \n     would remove the mandate that states use 35 percent of funds \n     for alcohol abuse prevention and treatment activities and 35 \n     percent of funds for other drug abuse prevention and \n     treatment activities. In addition, the bill would allow \n     states to request waivers of certain other spending \n     allocation requirements. S. 976 would provide states with \n     greater flexibility in allocating grant funds and allows an \n     additional year to obligate and spend them. The bill also \n     would permanently revise the minimum allotment determination.\n       Alcohol and Drug Prevention or Treatment Services for \n     Indians and Native Alaskans. S. 976 would authorize grants to \n     provide substance abuse prevention and treatment services for \n     Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and Native Alaskans. The \n     bill also would establish a commission to study and report on \n     health care issues in these populations. It would authorize \n     $15 million for the prevention and treatment program and $5 \n     million for the commission in 2000 and such sums as necessary \n     in 2001 and 2002. Subject to appropriation of the necessary \n     amounts, these provisions would cost $2 million in 2000 and \n     $55 million during 2000 through 2004.\n       Other provisions\n       Data Infrastructure. S. 976 would authorize such sums as \n     necessary for 2000 through 2002 for a new grant program to \n     support data infrastructure development in the states. To \n     facilitate compliance with performance partnership \n     requirements, the bill would provide financial assistance for \n     states to develop and operate mental health and substance \n     abuse data collection, analysis, and reporting systems. CBO \n     estimates that the necessary authorization would be $100 \n     million in each year, adjusted for inflation. Assuming \n     appropriation of the estimated amounts, implementing this \n     provision would cost $10 million in 2000 and $271 million \n     over the 2000-2004 period.\n       Miscellaneous Provisions. The bill would provide states \n     with additional flexibility in their use of federal grant \n     funds while enhancing accountability through effective \n     performance measurements. The bill also would reduce some of \n     SAMHSA's administrative costs associated with managing its \n     programs. On balance, CBO estimates that the administrative \n     burden associated with the proposed expansion of programs \n     under SAMHSA's management, including the costs of \n     promulgating new regulations and submitting additional \n     reports to the Congress, would exceed any savings that would \n     be generated by the bill. Although S. 976 does not explicitly \n     authorize funding for program management, CBO estimates \n     authorizations of appropriations for SAMHSA program \n     administration under S. 976 at $58 million in 2000 and \n     subsequent years, adjusted for inflation. Assuming \n     appropriation of the necessary amounts, such administrative \n     expenses would cost $57 million in 2000 and $180 million over \n     the 2000-2004 period.\n       S. 976 also would require the Secretary of HHS to develop \n     and implement new rules concerning use of seclusion and \n     restraints on residents of certain facilities supported by \n     federal funds. The bill also would apply nondiscrimination \n     and institutional safeguards to religious providers of \n     substance abuse services. In cases where a client objects to \n     the religious nature of the organization, the bill would \n     require that appropriate referral services be provided. CBO \n     assumes that, as a condition of grant assistance, states \n     would bear the cost of enforcing compliance with the referral \n     requirement. Finally, the bill would require that the \n     Secretary of HHS submit a report to the Congress within two \n     years of enactment on the issue of prevention and treatment \n     of individuals with co-occurring mental health and substance \n     abuse disorders.\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: The Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act sets up pay-as-you-go \n     procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or \n     receipts. Enacting S. 976 as amended by the managers' \n     amendment of October 22, 1999, would not affect direct \n     spending or receipts; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures \n     would not apply.\n       Estimated impact on state, local, and tribal governments: \n     The bill would provide grants to state, local, and tribal \n     governments, as well as other private and nonprofit entities, \n     for substance abuse and mental health programs. The grant \n     programs cover a variety of activities including prevention, \n     intervention, training, counseling, mental health, and \n     community and youth services.\n       In most cases, the funds authorized by this bill would be \n     available for grants to both public and private (including \n     nonprofit) entities. However, two large block grants would \n     make funds available to states: the Community Mental Health \n     Services Performance Partnership Block Grant ($450 million in \n     fiscal year 2000) and the Substance Abuse Prevention and \n     Treatment Performance Partnership Block Grant ($2 billion in \n     fiscal year 2000). The bill also would authorize $40 million \n     in fiscal year 2000 for grants to state and local juvenile \n     justice agencies that provide services to youth offenders who \n     have or who may be at risk of developing mental, behavioral, \n     or emotional disorders.\n       In some cases, additional conditions of assistance would be \n     placed on grant programs. However, these conditions would not \n     be intergovernmental mandates as defined in UMRA, and \n     overall, state, local, and tribal governments would benefit \n     from increased funding, the extension of existing grant \n     programs, and in many cases a greater degree of flexibility \n     in administering substance abuse programs.\n       Estimated impact on the private sector: The bill contains \n     no private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: Julia Christensen. \n     Impact on State, Local, and Tribal Governments: Leo Lex.\n       Estimate approved by: Peter H. Fontaine, Deputy Assistant \n     Director for Budget Analysis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/27/senate-section/article/S13254-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13254-S13255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to amend title 35, United States Code, to provide \nenhanced protection for investors and innovators, protect patent terms, \nreduce patent litigation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n             the american inventors protection act of 1999\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today, along with the \nRanking Member on the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, to introduce \nthe American Inventors Protection Act of 1999. Simply put, this \nlegislation reflects several years of discussions and consensus-\nbuilding efforts in the Senate and the House, and represents the most \nimportant and most comprehensive reforms to our nation's patent system \nin nearly half a century. As we prepare to enter a new millennium built \non high-tech growth, the Internet, and electronic commerce, in which \nAmerican competitiveness will depend on the strength of the patent \nsystem and the protections it affords, this legislation could not be \nmore timely.\n  The last time the Patent Act underwent a significant update was in \n1952. Since then, our Nation has experienced an unprecedented explosion \nof technology growth and a tremendous expansion of the global market \nfor the fruits of American ingenuity. Yet our patent laws have remained \nlargely unchanged in the face of the new demands engendered by these \ndevelopments. This legislation--which many of my colleagues will \nrecognize as a compromise version of the Omnibus Patent Act passed by \nthe Judiciary Committee with near unanimity more than 2 years ago--will \neffect targeted changes to the patent code to equip the patent system \nto meet the challenges of new technology and new markets as we approach \nthe new millennium, while at the same time promoting American \ncompetitiveness and ensuring adequate protection for American \ninnovators, both at home and abroad.\n  As many of my colleagues know, this legislation is the product of \nseveral years of discussion and extensive efforts to reach agreement on \na responsible package of patent reforms. The Senate made significant \nprogress toward consensus during the last Congress when several key \ncompromises were reached in the Judiciary Committee to strengthen the \nbill's protections for small businesses and independent inventors and \nto preserve America's competitive edge in the face of increasing global \ncompetition. I was pleased this year to see those efforts continued in \nthe House, where the supporters and former opponents of the bill agreed \nto sit down and work through their differences to produce a \nconstructive patent reform bill. The result is H.r. 1907, which has 59 \ncosponsors in the House--including the most ardent opponents of prior \nreform measures--and was passed in the House by a 376-43 vote.\n  In many ways, the House-passed ``American Inventors Protection Act'' \nbuilds upon the compromises reached in the Senate during the last \nCongress. For example, the widespread agreement on 18-month publication \nof patent applicants is centered around the Senate compromise that \nallowed inventors to avoid disclosure of their applications by not \nfiling their application abroad, where 18-month publication is now the \nrule. Similarly, estoppel provisions similar to those agreed to in the \nSenate form a key component on the broad-based agreement on patent \nreexamination reform. I  am pleased to see these compromises preserved \nand to see that the House has built upon them to reach the sort of \nbroad consensus on patent reform that I have long advocated.\n\n  The bill Senator Leahy and I are introducing today in the Senate \npreserves these important compromises and adds to them a number of \nimportant provisions. For example, our bill includes a title not in the \nHouse bill to reduce patent fees for only the second time in history \n(the first time fees were reduced was last year in a bill Senator Leahy \nand I ushered through the Senate), to ensure that trademark fees are \nspent only for trademark-related operations, and to require a study of \nalternative fee structures to encourage maximum participation by the \nAmerican inventor community. Our bill also adds important provisions to \nenhance protections for our national security by preventing disclosure \nof sensitive and strategic patent-related information and by helping to \nidentify national security positions at the Patent and Trademark Office \n(PTO) and obtain appropriate security clearances for PTO employees. The \nbill also prohibits the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks from \nentering into an agreement to exchange U.S. patent data with certain \nforeign countries without explicit authorization from the Secretary of \nCommerce. Also in our bill is a requirement that GAO conduct a study on \npatents issued for methods of doing or conducting business, which have \nbeen the subject of a 75 percent increase in applications at the PTO/\n  Like the House bill, our legislation will achieve a number of \nimportant substantive patent reforms, consistent with the principles of \nprotecting American inventors, our national competitiveness, and the \nintegrity of our patent system.\n  First, the bill provides inventors with enhanced protections against \ninvention promotion scams by creating a private right of action for \ninventors harmed by deceptive and fraudulent practices and by requiring \ninvention promoters to disclose certain information in writing prior to \nentering into a contract for invention promotion services. An inventor \nwho is harmed by any\n\n[[Page S13259]]\n\nmaterial false or fraudulent statement or representation, or any \nomission of material fact, by an invention promoter, or by the \ninvention promoter's failure to make the required disclosures, may \nrecover actual damages or, at the plaintiff's election, statutory \ndamages in an amount up to $5,000, as the court considers just, plus \nreasonable costs and attorneys' fees. A court may award increased \ndamages, up to treble damages, where it finds such conduct to have been \nintentional and done with the intent to deceive the inventor. And, in \nan effort to provide better access to information for inventors, the \nPatent and Trademark Office is required to make publicly available all \ncomplaints received involving invention promoters, along with any \nresponse of the invention promoter.\n  Second, as noted above, the bill will reduce patent fees, protect \ntrademark fees from being diverted to non-trademark uses, and require \nthe PTO to study alternative fee structures to encourage maximum \nparticipation by American inventors.\n  Third, the bill provides a ``first inventor defense'' to an action \nfor patent infringement for someone who has reduced an invention to \npractice at least one year before the effective filing date of the \npatent and commercially used the subject matter before the effective \nfiling date of such patent. The bill responds to recent changes in PTO \npractice and the Federal Circuit's 1998 decision in State Street Bank & \nTrust Co. v. Signature Financial Group, 149 F.3d 1360 (Fed Cir. 1998), \nin which it formally did away with the so-called ``business methods'' \nexception to statutory patentable subject matter. As a result, patent \nfilings for business methods are up by 75 percent this year, and many \nwho have been using business methods for many years pursuant to trade \nsecret protection--believing such methods were not patentable--are now \nfaced with potential patent infringement suits from others who, while \nthey may have come later to the game, were first to reach the patent \noffice after the bar to patentability for business methods was lifted.\n\n  Fourth, the bill will guarantee a minimum 17-year patent term for \ndiligent applicants, addressing concerns that have been expressed since \nthe United States went to a 20-year from filing term of protection with \nthe adoption of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act in 1994.\n  Fifth, the bill will place American inventors on a level playing \nfield with their foreign competitors by providing for domestic \npublication in English of those patent applications that are now \nsubject to foreign publication by foreign patent offices, while still \nretaining the option inventors now enjoy of preserving the secrecy of \ntheir application by not filing abroad. It also protects American \ninventors from broader disclosure of their invention through domestic \npublication than occurs in foreign publications by allowing the patent \napplicant to submit a redacted copy of their application for \npublication. This provision will effectively facilitate access to \ninformation that will enable inventors to target their resources more \neffectively while also providing, for the first time, effective interim \nprotection for inventors during patent pendency.\n  Sixth, the bill is designed to reduce litigation in district courts \nand make reexamination a viable, less-costly alternative to patent \nlitigation by giving third-party requesters the option of inter-partes \nreexamination procedures (in addition to the current ex parte \nreexamination procedures). Under this optional procedure, the third \nparty is afforded an expanded, although still limited, role in the \nreexamination process through an opportunity to respond, in writing, to \nan action by a patent examiner when, but only when, the patent owner \ndoes so. These expanded rights for third parties are carefully balanced \nwith incentives to prevent abusive reexamination requests, including \nbroad estoppel provisions and severe restrictions on appeals.\n  Finally, the bill will make a number of miscellaneous, yet important \npatent reforms.\n  In short, the provisions of this bill now enjoy widespread bipartisan \nand bicameral support. The total package of changes that have been made \nto this legislation over the past several years are both responsive and \ncomprehensive. The time to act on this package of reforms is now. \nIntellectual property, and patents in particular, are among our \nnation's greatest assets in this technology-dominated age. Our patent \nsystem must be equipped to handle the challenges of the new millennium \nand to protect our nation's creators into the next century. The \nstrength of our economy depends upon it. If we do not, we will lose our \nedge in the ongoing race for technological and economic leadership in \nthe world economy.\n  In the most simple of terms, we must have a patent system that is \nstate of the art. The bill Senator Leahy and I are introducing today \nwill help to provide just that. I hope that my colleagues will join \nwith me in giving their overwhelming support for this measure.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join with Senator \nHatch in introducing the ``American Inventors Protection Act of 1999,'' \nwhich I hope can be enacted into law this year.\n  This patent bill is important to America's future. I have heard from \ninventors, from businesses large and small, from hi-tech to low-tech \nfirms that this bill will give American inventors and businesses an \nimproved competitive edge now enjoyed by many European countries.\n  We should be on a level playing field with them.\n  This bill reduces patent fees for only the second time in history. \nThe first time that was done was also in a Hatch-Leahy bill passed by \nthe Senate in the 105th Congress.\n  All the concepts in this bill--such as patent term guarantees, \ndomestic publication of patent applications filed abroad, first \ninventor defense--have been thoroughly examined. Indeed, they have been \nincluded in several bills that the Congress has carefully studied.\n  Chairman Hatch and I have worked closely on this bill. I believe that \nwe can get a good patent bill to the President before we go out of \nsession this year. I look forward to working with the House on these \nissues and appreciate the hard work and careful crafting that went into \ntheir bill--H.R. 1907.\n  I wish to point out that the Senate Judiciary Committee last year \nalso developed a strong bill--S. 507--which contained many of the same \nconcepts and approaches found in H.R. 1907 and S. 1798.\n  It is long past time for the Senate to consider and pass this patent \nreform legislation. Our patent bill will be good for Vermont, good for \nUtah and every state in the Nation, good for American innovators of all \nsizes, and good for America.\n  We will be working with the Administration, the full Senate and with \nthe House to move this bill along quickly. I hope we can keep this \nbipartisan coalition together because otherwise this bill will die, as \npast efforts have.\n  The patent bill will reform the U.S. patent system in important ways.\n  It will reduce legal fees that are paid by inventors and companies; \neliminate duplication of research efforts and accelerate research into \nnew areas; increase the value of patents to inventors and companies; \nand facilitate U.S. inventors and companies' research, development, and \ncommercialization of inventions.\n  In Vermont, we have a number of independent inventors and small \ncompanies. It is, therefore, especially important to me that this bill \nwill be one that helps them as well as the larger companies in Vermont \nlike IBM.\n  Over the past several years, Congress has held eight Congressional \nhearings with more than 80 witnesses testifying about the various \nproposals incorporated in the bill. Republican and Democratic \nAdministrations alike, reaching back to the Johnson Administration, \nhave supported these similar reforms.\n  I also thank Secretary Daley and the administration for their \nunflagging support of effective patent reform. I also know that they \nworked closely with the House on H.R. 1907. I will submit a more \ndetailed statement on S. 1798 before we proceed to Senate \nconsideration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 1799. A bill for the relief of Sergio Lozano; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n[[Page S13260]]\n\n                          private relief bill\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer \nlegislation that provides permanent resident status to Sergio Lozano \nwho, with his younger sister and brother, were granted immigrant visas \nto come to the United States with their mother in 1997. Unfortunately, \nthey lost the opportunity to be come immigrants when they tragically \nlost their mother in that same year.\n  Sergio Lozano lived with his siblings and their mother, Ana Ruth \nLozano, until her death in February of this year due to complications \nfrom typhoid fever. Since their mother's death, the three siblings have \nbeen living with their closest relative, their U.S. citizen grandmother \nwho lives in Los Angeles and has since adopted the two younger \nchildren.\n  Without his mother, Sergio does not have the legal right to remain in \nthe United States. When he first arrived in the U.S. at 17, he was \nunable to obtain lawful permanent residence because immigration law \nprohibits permanent legal residency to minor children without their \nparents. However, as a child of 17, he was also outside the age limit \nfor adoption by his grandmother. As a result, Sergio, through no fault \nof his own, has been left in limbo in the United States.\n  Without legal status, this young man can be deported by the INS \ndespite the fact that he has no immediate family in El Salvador except \ntheir estranged father who was alleged to have been abusive to the \nmother and the children.\n  Without the legislation, Sergio will most likely be separated from \nhis brother and sister and sent back to El Salvador. Here in the U.S., \nhe can remain with his brother and sister, further his education and \ncontinue to thrive in the loving environment provided by his U.S. \ncitizen grandmother and uncles.\n  I have previously sought administrative relief for all three Lozano \nchildren by asking the INS district office in Los Angeles and \nCommissioner Meissner if any humanitarian exemptions could be made in \ntheir case. INS told my staff that there was nothing further they could \ndo administratively and a private relief bill may be then only way to \nprotect the children from deportation. Since then, the two younger \nLozano children have been adopted by their grandmother and have \nreceived approval of their lawful permanent resident petitions. Like \nhis siblings, Sergio has too suffered a sense of loss and bewilderment \nafter losing a parent. However. unlike his sister and brother, he \nstands to be deprived of the security of his American family and \ndeported back to a land he no longer knows, if only as a consequence of \nbeing born two years too soon.\n  Last year, the Senate passed by unanimous consent the private bill I \nintroduced on behalf of Sergio Lozano and his siblings. However, the \n105th Congress came to a close before the House was able to act.\n  This year, I hope you will support the bill on behalf of Sergio \nLozano so that we can help him begin to rebuild his life with his \nloving family in the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM:\n  S. 1800. A bill to amend the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to improve onsite \ninspections of State food stamp programs, to provide grants to develop \ncommunity partnerships and innovative outreach strategies for food \nstamp and related programs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n  the food stamp outreach and research for kids act of 1999 (the fork \n                                  act)\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce \nThe Food Stamp Outreach and Research for Kids Act of 1999.\n  Along with my House colleagues Representatives William Coyne and \nSander Levin, I created this common sense piece of legislation with the \ngoal of guarding children and their families against hunger.\n  In 1998, over 14 million children lived in households that could not \nafford to buy food.\n  That was an increase of almost 4 million children from 1997.\n  At the same time, the number of poor children not getting Food Stamps \nreached its highest level in a decade.\n  My bill, the Food Stamp Outreach for Kids Act of 1999 (the FORK Act), \nwould help us to give children who are currently going hungry the Food \nStamps that they need.\n  Some time ago, food banks in Florida started telling me that the \nnumber of people coming to them for assistance was increasing, and that \nif demand continued at the current rate, they might run out of food.\n  This crisis was not specific to Florida, Congressman Coyne and \nCongressman Levin were hearing the same concerns from food banks in \nPennsylvania and Michigan.\n  When we asked them whom the new people coming to the food banks were, \nwe were told that they were mostly low-income working families.\n  When the food banks screened these families using eligibility \nguidelines, it looked as if the majority of the new people coming to \nthe food banks for assistance should have been receiving food stamps \nbut were not.\n  The General Accounting Office (GAO) researched this issue, and in \ntheir July, 1999 report found that while a number of people who have \nleft the Food Stamp program because of the improved economy, economic \ngrowth alone does not explain the drop in Food Stamp participation.\n  The GAO found that demand for emergency and supplemental food was \nincreasing and that some state agencies were not correctly following \nfederal laws regarding Food Stamp benefits.\n  Perhaps most disturbing of all, the GAO found that almost half of the \npeople who have lost Food Stamps since 1996 are children.\n  The FORK Act is designed to address GAO's findings and \nrecommendations to make certain that children and families in this \ncountry are not going hungry.\n  The FORK Act would provide grant funding to food banks, schools, \nhealth clinics, local governments and other entities that interact with \nworking families. The grants would allow those organizations to develop \nand expand innovative approaches to Food Stamp outreach, which would \nhelp the Food and Nutrition Service enroll many of the eligible \nfamilies that currently go hungry.\n  The FORK Act would require the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) to \nconduct onsite inspections of state Food Stamp programs to identify \nbarriers to enrollment and work with states to develop corrective \naction plans.\n  The FORK Act would authorize FNS to conduct research, which will help \nit to improve access, formulate nutrition policy and measure program \nimpacts and integrity.\n  The FORK Act would require the Departments of Agriculture and Health \nand Human Services to work with state Temporary Assistance for Children \nand Families (TANF) programs to train caseworkers and make sure that \nprospective and former TANF recipients are property informed about Food \nStamp eligibility.\n  Finally the FORK Act would authorize private-public partnerships to \nexpand nutrition education programs.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe that there is a member in this \nCongress who ever intended for children to go hungry because their \nparents left welfare to go to work.\n  Now that we know it is happening, we must act quickly to make certain \nthat the Food Stamp program works for children and families in need.\n  I hope that my Senate colleagues will join me in supporting this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a list of groups supporting the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The material

A bill to provide for the identification, collection, and \nreview for declassification of records and materials that are of \nextraordinary public interest to the people of the United States, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n[[Page S13262]]\n\n              public interest declassification act of 1999\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the \nPublic Information Disclosure Act, a bill that seeks to add to our \ncitizens' knowledge of how and why our country made many of its key \nnational security decisions since the end of World War II. This bill \ncreates a mechanism for comprehensively reviewing and declassifying, \nwhenever possible, records of extraordinary public interest that \ndemonstrate and record this country's most significant and important \nnational security policies, actions, and decisions.\n  As James Madison once wrote, ``A people who mean to be their own \ngovernors must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.'' \nAcquiring this knowledge has become increasingly difficult since World \nWar II's end, when we witnessed the rise of a vast national security \napparatus that encompasses thousands of employees and over 1.5 billion \nclassified documents that are 25 years or older. Secrecy, in the end, \nis a form of regulation. And I concede that regulation of state secrets \nis often necessary to protect national security. But how much needs to \nbe regulated after having aged 25 years or more?\n  The warehousing and withholding of these documents and materials not \nonly impoverish our country's historical record but retard our \ncollective understanding of how and why the United States acted as it \ndid. This means that we have less chance to learn from what has gone \nbefore; both mistakes and triumphs fall through the cracks of our \ncollective history, making it much harder to resolve key questions \nabout our past and to chart our future actions.\n  On the other hand, greater openness makes it more possible for the \ngovernment to explain itself and to defend its actions, a not so \nunimportant thing when one recalls Richard Hofstader's warning in his \nclassic 1964 essay The Paranoid Style in American Politics: ``The \ndistinguishing thing about the paranoid style is not that its exponents \nsee conspiracies here and there in history, but they regard a `vast' or \n`gigantic' conspiracy, set in motion by demonic forces of almost \ntranscendent power as the motive force in historical events.'' A poll \ntaken in 1993 found that three-quarters of those surveyed believed that \nPresident Kennedy was assassinated by a conspiracy involving the CIA, \nrenegade elements of our military, and organized crime. The Grassy \nKnoll continues to cut a wide path across our national consciousness. \nThe classified materials withheld from the Warren Commission, several \nof our actions in Vietnam, and Watergate have only added to the \nAmerican people's distrust of the Federal government.\n  Occasionally, though, the government has drawn back its cloak of \nsecrecy and made substantial contributions to our national \nunderstanding. In 1995, the CIA and the NSA agreed to declassify the \nVenona intercepts, our highly secretive effort that ranged over four \ndecades to decode the Soviet Union's diplomatic traffic. Much of this \ntraffic centered on identifying Soviet spies, one of the cardinal \npreoccupations of that hateful era we call ``McCarthyism.'' These \nreleases made at least one thing crystal clear: Their timely release \ndecades ago would have dimmed the klieg lights on many who were \ninnocent and shown them more brightly on those who truly were guilty. \nIt would have been an important contribution during a time when the \ninnocent and the guilty were ensnared in the same net.\n  Today, Congress plays a pivotal role in declassification through so-\ncalled ``special searches.'' Generally, these involve a member of \nCongress or the White House asking the intelligence community to search \nits records on specific subjects. These have ranged from Pinochet to \nmurdered American church women to President Kennedy's assassination. \nHowever, these good intentions often produce neither good results nor \ngood history. Sadly, most of these searches have been done poorly, \ncosting millions of dollars and consuming untold hours of labor. \nSeveral have been performed repeatedly. Special searches on murdered \nAmerican church women, for example, have been done nine separate times. \nYet there are still several important questions that have yet to be \nanswered. The CIA alone has been asked to do 33 ``special searches'' \nsince 1998.\n  Part of the problem is that Congress lacks a centralized, rational \nway of addressing these requests. This bill establishes a nine-member \nboard composed of outside experts who can filter and steer these \nsearches, all the while seeking maximum efficiency and disclosure.\n  The other part of the problem lies in how the intelligence community \nhas conducted these searches. It is imperative that searches are \ncarried out in a comprehensive manner. This is not only cheaper in the \nlong run but produces a much more accurate record of our history. One \ncannot do Pinochet, for example, and not do Chile under his rule at the \nsame time. To do otherwise skews history too much and creates too many \nblind spots, all leading to more questions and more searches. This does \na disservice not only to those asking for these searches but to the \nAmerican people who have to pay for ad hoc, poorly done \ndeclassification. If we do it right the first time, then we can forgo \nmuch inefficiency.\n  Many of these special searches ask vital questions about this \nnation's role in many disturbing events. We must see, therefore, that \nthey are done correctly and responsibly. This legislation, if passed, \nwould improve Congress' role in declassification, making it an \ninstrumental arm in the de-cloaking and re-democratization of our \nnational history. Indeed, anything less would cheat our citizens, \nundermine their trust in our institutions, and erode our democratic \nvalues.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBB (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Boxer, \n        Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Murray, \n        Mr. Reid, Mr. Sarbanes and Mr. Lieberman.\n  S. 1803. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \npermanently and expand the research tax credit; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n               permanent extension of the R tax credit\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I send to the desk legislation that will \npermanently extend the research credit and increase the alternative \nincremental credit 1% per step. It will also expand the credit to \ncompanies operating in Puerto Rico. Mr. President, research and \nexperimentation are the foundation of a vibrant economy. While there is \nsome initial cost involved, studies have shown that a permanent \nextension of the R tax credit pays for itself over time due to \nincreased federal revenues generated by a rise in productivity and \neconomic growth. Without a permanent extension of the R credit, \nbusinesses are less likely to make long term investments in research \nthat is necessary for scientific and technological advancements. \nInstead, decisions must be made on an annual basis which, over time, \nhave the effect of slowing progress. In order to guarantee that our \ncountry remains the leader in cutting edge technology we need to \npermanently extend the R credit. The advantages of increased research \nand experimentation are simply too overwhelming to ignore.\n  I intended on offering this bill as an amendment in the Finance \nCommittee to the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999, (S. 1792), but I was \npersuaded by members on both sides of the aisle that amendments in \nCommittee threatened the whole deal. I decided, instead, to address \nthis issue on the Senate floor. I still strongly support the tax \nextenders bill that was reported out of Committee, but I believe, as I \nhave for some time, that we need to address this one deficiency. \nWithout certainty, our nation's investments in research will suffer. \nPermanent extension of the R tax credit is the only way to provide \nthat certainty. Despite recent setbacks, I will continue to work with \nall of my colleagues to extend this credit permanently.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1803\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT EXTENSION AND MODIFICATION OF RESEARCH \n                   CREDIT.\n\n       (a) Permanent Extension.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 41 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 (relating to credit for\n\n[[Page S13263]]\n\n     increasing research activities) is amended by striking \n     subsection (h).\n       (2) Conforming amendment.--Paragraph (1) of section 45C(b) \n     of such Code is amended by striking subparagraph (D).\n       (3) Effective date.--The amendments made by this subsection \n     shall apply to amounts paid or incurred after June 30, 1999.\n       (b) Increase in Percentages Under Alternative Incremental \n     Credit.--\n       (1) In general.--Subparagraph (A) of section 41(c)(4) of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended--\n       (A) by striking ``1.65 percent'' and inserting ``2.65 \n     percent'',\n       (B) by striking ``2.2 percent'' and inserting ``3.2 \n     percent'', and\n       (C) by striking ``2.75 percent'' and inserting ``3.75 \n     percent''.\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendments made by this subsection \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after June 30, 1999.\n       (c) Extension of Research Credit to Research in Puerto Rico \n     and the Possessions of the United States.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 41(d)(4)(F) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to foreign research) is \n     amended by inserting ``, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or \n     any possession of the United States'' after ``United \n     States''.\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1999.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 1804. A bill to direct the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation \nwith the Director of the Office of Science Technology and the Director \nof the National Science Foundation, to establish a program for \nincreasing the United State's scientific, technology, and mathematical \nresources, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n  the 21st century technology resources and commercial leadership act\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President I am please to introduce a bill \nintended to preserve the United States' world leadership position in \ntechnology into the coming century. This legislation is intended to \nassure that our scientific, mathematics, engineering and technology \nresources are surpassed by no one. It is intended to ensure that our \nmost precious national resources, our people, receive the best \neducation and training through our best national product, innovation. \nWe must allow our most creative forces to interact to achieve improved \nmath and science education in our schools. We must assure more highly \ntrained college graduates in science, math, engineering and technology. \nAnd we must encourage the retooling of our country's experienced minds \nto address the problems and the solutions of tomorrow.\n  Specifically, this legislation uses a portion of each H-1B visa fee \nto provide grants for innovative programs which will improve the math, \nscience, engineering and technology skills of Americans so that they \ncan fill the estimated average of 137,800 new positions expected to be \ncreated in these fields each year from now through 2006. During the \ninterim, while the American pipeline of talent is filling, the bill \nlifts the caps on H-1B visas to allow our American companies to \ncontinue to grow and prosper.\n  This legislation is necessary and beneficial to our nation. Let me \nexplain in some detail why.\n  First, although this country can be proud of having some of the most \nhighly regarded colleges and universities in the world, our elementary \nand secondary education system is not sufficiently emphasizing science \nand math in the curriculum. Our students are falling behind in these \nareas. The results of the 1998 Third International Math and Science \nStudy (TIMSS) are instructive. In math, our 4th graders ranked 12th out \nof 26 countries. Not a stellar performance. But even more discouraging, \nby 12th grade, the U.S. math rank was 19th out of 21 countries. As a \nresult, not enough American college students are majoring in the \nsciences, including computer science, mathematics and engineering to \nfill the escalating need for highly trained professionals.\n  According to information compiled by the American Electronics \nAssociation, at the same time that the number of jobs in these fields \nhas increased by 20%, the number of college graduates with degrees in \nengineering, engineering technology, computer science, mathematics, \nbusiness information systems, and physics has declined by 5%.\n  To fill the jobs available, American companies are finding it \nincreasingly necessary to hire foreign professionals. When they recruit \non university campuses in the United States, 32% of the Masters degree \nand 45% of the doctoral degree candidates are foreign, not American, \nstudents. Even though they have been educated here, these foreign \nstudents cannot remain here to work without a visa.\n  Even with these graduates available, there are more jobs to be filled \nthan qualified candidates. When our companies cannot hire qualified \npeople to work for them, they cannot function--they cannot compete. \nMost of these companies have concluded long ago that they need to \nretain the qualified people that they do hire. They understand that one \nway to retain them is to provide training to continually update and \nupgrade their skills. There are many examples of these kinds of \nprograms.\n  In addition, there are older American workers with advanced technical \nskills that are outdated, or whose experience is in industries which \nare not in a growth mode. Companies are finding ways to assist some of \nthese professional to retool for the current and future needs of \nbusiness. An example of retraining experienced workers is a program at \nSan Diego State University. That institution's Defense Conversion \nCenter has focused on retraining displaced defense industry \nprofessional, including military personnel and aerospace engineers.\n  Let me read from their project proposal description dated 9/21/99.\n\n       The expansion of the H-1B visa program is a limited and \n     temporary fix to a critical national problem. Unless we find \n     creative ways to meet our workforce needs internally, our \n     ability to produce cutting-edge products will erode. Indeed, \n     some experts predict that our position as the world's leader \n     in innovation will slip from first place to sixth early in \n     the next century. The risk goes beyond losing our competitive \n     edge in the global marketplace; without a strong technology \n     base, our national defense system will be jeopardized.\n\n  The proposal goes on to describe the university's program:\n\n       In the early 1990's, the defense industry in San Diego \n     virtually disintegrated, resulting in the loss of over 42,000 \n     jobs. Established with a grant from the Department of \n     Defense, the SDSU Defense Conversion Center developed several \n     certificate programs designed to fast-track displaced defense \n     industry workers back into the marketplace. To date, over \n     1100 individuals have enrolled in the Center, and 80% of \n     those who participated in the program found or retained \n     employment in such high-tech fields as radio-frequency \n     design, software engineering, concurrent design and \n     manufacturing, and multi-media design.\n\n  Many companies are also finding that it is not enough to focus on \nonly their short term hiring needs. There are numerous examples of \ncompanies partnering with their local schools to provide innovative \nchanges in curriculum and skill sets.\n  For example, Hewlett-Packard has joined forces with Colorado State \nUniversity to assist minority students beginning their studies at CSU. \nThe assistance includes 10-week internships at H-P, during which CSU \nprovides instructors to H-P to teach calculus. The internships provide \na bridge from the academic to the real world, demonstrating the \napplication of math and science skills. They also provide the freshmen \nwith valuable experience that can lead to permanent jobs at H-P.\n  Eastman Chemical Company in Tennessee offers another example. Working \nwith its local school system, the company focused on two objectives: to \nhelp prepare and motivate all students to develop competency in math \nand science, and to create a school system of such excellence that \ncollege graduates would be drawn there as a great place to raise \nchildren. The result was several programs, including an ``Educator on \nLoan'' program where on a rotating basis, teachers could work at the \ncompany's manufacturing plant to under the skills required.\n  These private/public partnerships are an excellent start. But these \nefforts are not sufficient to solve the problems we have with \nmaintaining our country's ability to compete and lead the world in the \n21st century. We must encourage more innovation, more achievement to \nfill the pipeline so that our children will be able to prosper in the \ntechnological revolution underway.\n  This legislation encourages innovation. It provides financial \nassistance for ideas which will work. The proposed legislation is broad \nenough to cover any idea which can be demonstrated to produce results. \nSome of the programs\n\n[[Page S13264]]\n\nI think should be considered would be to provide scholarships to \nstudents who possess the requisite talent and are willing to become \ncertified as math and science teachers, and who will agree to teach for \na number of years. Scholarships for students who will major in math, \nscience, engineering or technology fields makes sense. But we should \nnot limit our selves to these stock type approaches. There will be many \nother new and creative ideas and we should welcome them and reward \nthem, as long as they produce the outcome we want. We want to improve \nand increase the American talent pool.\n  In the meantime, I think it is important not to force our companies \nto develop off-shore bases in order to hire the foreign professional \nthey need. The history of numeric caps on H-1B visas is one of best \nguess, rather than of calculated need. It is difficult to anticipate \nthe total need, but simply inserting a number because it is politically \nagreeable isn't the right answer. During the last session we adopted \nlegislation produced through the fine efforts of Senator Abraham and \nothers who worked tirelessly in addressing a broad array of problems \nand issues.\n  The result is that our law now requires those who are dependent on H-\n1B worker to attest, to give their oath, that they have tried to hire \nan American to fill the position unsuccessfully before applying for a \nforeign worker visa. These requirements are stringent. They protect \nAmerican workers against companies which might otherwise ignore \nqualified applicants in order to bring in a foreign worker. The law \nprotects against layoffs followed by foreign hiring.\n  With this law in place and with diligent enforcement of its \nrequirements, there is no reason to also pick an arbitrary number as a \ncap for H-1B visas. We can let the marketplace prevail. We can focus on \nimproving our own resources and our own children's education so that in \nthe future we will have more highly skilled professionals to fill these \npositions. When our supply meets the demand we will have achieved the \ngoals of improving our education curriculum and our ability to remain \nleaders in the 21st century.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. \n        Jeffords):\n  S. 1805. A bill to restore food stamp benefits for aliens, to provide \nStates with flexibility in administering the food stamp vehicle \nallowance, to index the excess shelter expense deduction to inflation, \nto authorize additional appropriations to purchase and make available \nadditional commodities under the emergency food assistance program, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n                     the hunger relief act of 1999\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today Senators Specter, Leahy, Jeffords, \nand I are introducing the Hunger Relief Act of 1999. Our goals in this \nlegislation are to promote self-sufficiency and the transition from \nwelfare to work, and to eradicate childhood hunger by increasing the \navailability of food stamps to low-income working families. Republicans \nand Democrats share these goals, and it deserves broad bipartisan \nsupport.\n  Improving Food Stamp accessibility is a central part of helping low-\nincome working families feed their children and achieve self-\nsufficiency. A strong Food Stamp Program, along with a higher minimum \nwage and an adequate Earned Income Tax Credit, gives low-income \nfamilies the stability they need to build a brighter future. With the \nunemployment rate at a 30-year low and record, economic growth, this is \na time of broad economic prosperity for most Americans. But that is not \ntrue for the poorest Americans. In 1998 the poverty rate declined from \n13.3% to 12.7%, but this still surpasses rates in the 11% range \nrecorded throughout the 1970's. The safety net provided by food stamps \nhas weakened since the 1970's, and hunger among working families in \nAmerica has grown.\n  In July 1999, the Department of Agriculture reported that 6.6 million \nadults and 3.4 million children live in households that suffered from \nhunger in 1998, and that 36 million people comprising 10% of the \nnation's households lack secure access to enough food for an active \nhealthy life.\n  In the same month, the Congressional General Accounting Office \nreported that of the 14 million U.S. children who live in poverty, the \nproportion who receive food stamps dropped from 94% in 1995 to 84% in \n1997. During 1997 alone, the number of children living in poverty \ndecreased by 350,000--but the number receiving food stamps decreased by \n1.3 million. GAO's report concludes, ``children's participation in the \nFood Stamp Program has dropped more sharply than the number of children \nliving in poverty, indicating a growing gap between need and \nassistance.''\n  In January 1999, the Urban Institute released the results of a study \nof former welfare recipients and reported that 33% have to skip or \nreduce meals due to lack of food. This result is corroborated by \nindependent studies in Wisconsin and South Carolina, and by NETWORK's \nNational Welfare Reform Project.\n  In 1998, surveys of emergency food providers conducted by the U.S. \nConference of Mayors and America's Second Harvest independently \ndocumented that the need for emergency food services increased 15 to \n20% over the previous year, and that almost 40% of emergency food \nclients live in households in which an adult is employed.\n  The Community Childhood Hunger Identification Project conducted \nsurveys of over 5,000 low-income families between 1992 and 1994--the \nmost comprehensive study of childhood hunger ever undertaken in the \nU.S.--and found that approximately 4 million children under age 12 were \nhungry, and 9.6 million were at risk of hunger.\n  Far too many working parents still struggle to feed their families. \nIf our national values cannot persuade us to fight hunger now, while \nthe economy is strong, when will we ever do so? If we need economic \nreasons to fight hunger in America, we need only consider the effects \nof hunger on children.\n  Hunger and undernutrition are serious problems for people of all \nages, but their effects are particularly damaging to children. Over 14 \nmillion children live in households that suffer hunger. Hungry and \nundernourished children are more likely to become anemic, and to suffer \nfrom allergies, asthma, diarrhea, and infections. They are also more \nlikely to have behavioral problems and difficulty in learning. When \nchildren arrive at school hungry, they cannot learn. If we do not \naddress this problem, our considerable investments in education and \nearly learning activities will not have the full positive impact that \nthey should. Hunger and under-nutrition injure our greatest national \nresource--our children.\n  In the past three decades, food stamps have grown into the nation's \nmost comprehensive and trusted way to end hunger. The news that \nparticipation in the Food Stamp Program has declined 27% over the past \nthree and a half years would be welcome--if poverty had declined by a \ncomparable amount. But the poverty rate declined by only 7% over this \ntime. Six million more poor people are without food stamps today than \nin 1995. GAO reported that in 1997 alone, while the number of children \nliving in poverty decreased by just 350,000, the number of children \nreceiving food stamps decreased by 1.3 million. We need to be concerned \nthat the nutritional needs of the other 950,000 children are not being \nmet.\n  Just as the decline in the welfare rolls does not by itself show that \npeople are no longer poor, the decline in Food Stamp rolls in no way \nmeans that children and families are no longer hungry. Increasingly, \nlow-income working families are relying on emergency food services. \nAcross the country, demand for emergency food services has increased by \nas much as 50% in some places. Many food banks find themselves unable \nto meet the increased requests for help.\n  Only two days ago, the Chicago Sun-Times published an article \nentitled ``Hunger--a growing concern in suburbs,'' describing \nincreasing demand for emergency food in some of Chicago's most affluent \nneighborhoods.\n  A November 1998 study by Project Bread and Tufts University found \nthat 49% of emergency food providers in Massachusetts reported \nincreased need among families with children over the previous year. Of \nthose requesting assistance, 33% of food bank clients were children, \nand 27% of Massachusetts adults requesting emergency food assistance \nwere employed. Although our\n\n[[Page S13265]]\n\nstrong economy and historically low unemployment rate have helped many \nfamilies get back on their feet, there is no question that many \nfamilies are working hard and still cannot make ends meet.\n\n  By simplifying Food Stamp eligibility rules and improving access to \nthe program, we can reduce hunger and malnutrition, and help working \nfamilies live healthier, more fulfilling lives. No one in this country \nshould go hungry. This is a problem we can solve. We must not become \nindifferent to the message that hunger indeed has a cure.\n  The Hunger Relief Act repeals many of the 1996 welfare reform law's \nrestrictions on access to food stamps for legal immigrants. For 30 \nyears prior to the welfare reform law, Food Stamps were available to \nlegal immigrants. The 1996 welfare reform law made them no longer \neligible. That law also created substantial uncertainty among eligible \ngroups as to whether they qualify.\n  Last year, Congress restored food stamp eligibility to some legal \nimmigrants--children, seniors, and disabled persons--who were in the \nUnited States before August 1996. This was an important step, but it \nhelped fewer than a third of those who were adversely affected by the \n1996 law. Hunger among legal immigrants predictably increased after \n1996, although many legal immigrants held low-income jobs and paid \ntaxes. Children continue to be denied benefits because they arrived in \nthe U.S. after 1996 or because exclusion of their parents directly \nresults in decreased access to food stamps. Our laws recognize that \nlegal immigrants need access to employment, education, and health care \nprograms. Yet all of these efforts are compromised when legal \nimmigrants are denied access to adequate nutrition. The Hunger Relief \nAct ensures that all those who need food stamps can obtain them.\n  In addition, the Hunger Relief Act helps low-income families by \nrelaxing federal limits on the value of a vehicle that a family can own \nand still be eligible for food stamps. The current federal limit is \n$4,650, which has risen only $150 since 1977.\n  Because low-income parents commonly need a vehicle to get to work and \nto safely transport their children, many states have adopted vehicle \nallowance standards for their state assistance programs that are more \ngenerous than the federal standard. The conflicting and complex rules \nthat govern state programs and the Food Stamp Program complicate access \nto food stamps for working families, as confirmed by GAO's July 1999 \nreport.\n  By giving states the option of using their state vehicle standards \ninstead of the federal standard, the Hunger Relief Act gives states the \nflexibility to ensure that their nutritional needs are met. It also \npromotes work and child safety.\n  The case of a single parent of three young children in Northeastern \nMassachusetts illustrates the need for this provision. The mother's \nincome recently dropped to $928 per month, but she is denied food \nstamps because the value of her car exceeds $4650. Massachusetts would \nbe unlikely to reject her application under state law, but the federal \nlaw requires her pleas for help to be rejected. Our Hunger Relief Act \nwill change that.\n  The Hunger Relief Act also enables families to qualify for food \nstamps when they have to spend more than 50% of their income on housing \ncosts. Low-income families must often pay high rent for substandard \nhousing in many cities today. According to a recent report by the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, demand for public housing \nis rising, while the supply of affordable apartments and houses is \ndeclining. Between 1996 and 1998, the number of affordable apartments \nfell by more than 1 million. Nearly 1 million low-income families are \nnow waiting for public housing units across the country. They may wait \nas long as 8 years in New York City to be placed.\n  HUD compares finding affordable housing to an ominous game of musical \nchairs in which only the lucky find seats. In Boston, the average rent \nfor a two bedroom apartment rose by 58% between 1990 and 1998 to $1,350 \nafter adjusting for inflation. The Women's Educational and Technical \nUnion has documented that single parents with one infant pay an average \nrent of $839 in Boston, $709 in Worcester, and $578 in Pittsfield. All \nof these figures far exceed half of a minimum wage worker's income.\n  Present law permits some shelter costs to be deducted when \ndetermining Food Stamp eligibility, but the deduction is capped too \nlow. In 1996, 950,000 people received reduced food stamp benefits due \nto the shelter cap. Over 880,000 of those affected were families with \nchildren. The Hunger Relief Act raises the cap from $275 to $340, and \nthen indexes it to inflation, increasing access to food stamps for \napproximately 1.25 million people.\n  For example, a family from Centerville, Massachusetts consisting of a \nworking mother and three children, survives on $1,433 in income each \nmonth. Yet their shelter costs exceed $1,200. This family cannot \npossibly meet these children's nutritional needs on $233 each month, \neven if the family spends money on nothing besides shelter and food. \nThe Hunger Relief Act is intended to keep families like this from \nhaving to choose between heating and eating.\n  Finally, the Hunger Relief Act increases federal support for \nemergency food programs. Sharp increases in requests for help from food \npantries and soup kitchens have occurred over the past year, despite \nsteep declines in food stamp participation. The U.S. Conference of \nMayors, and America's Second Harvest has independently documented a 15 \nto 20% increase in need over 1998. A recent survey of 30 cities by the \nNational Governors Association found that a growing number of low-\nincome working parents rely on food banks to feed their children. 79% \nof Massachusetts food pantries funded through Projected Bread reported \nserving more working poor in 1998, and 72% reported helping more \nfamilies with children. To ensure that emergency food needs are met, \nthe Hunger Relief Act increases federal funding for The Emergency Food \nAssistance Program by 10%.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the total cost of the \nHunger Relief Act will be $2.5 billion over the first 5 years. This \namount will increase our support for the Food Stamp Program by just \nover 2% each year, a relatively small price to repair the most serious \nproblems in the nation's core nutrition program.\n  Americans overwhelmingly recognize that hunger is also closely linked \nto problems in health, education, and the workplace. Adequate nutrition \nshould be available to all. Over three hundred national, regional, and \nlocal organizations support the Hunger Relief Act. Even before welfare \nreform was enacted, a January 1996 poll found that 55% of Americans \nbelieve hunger is worsening in our country, and 74% felt that more \nshould be done to combat hunger in America. I request unanimous consent \nthat a letter signed by over 300 organizations in support of the Hunger \nRelief Act may be printed in the Congressional Record following my \nstatement.\n  Millions of low-income working families, like the Jenkins family of \nRoyalston, Massachusetts will be helped by this bill. Although Terry \nJenkins' husband works in two jobs, after their mortgage payments, car \npayments, utilities and clothing expenses for four children are paid, \nthey often cannot afford enough food for their family. As a result, \nTerry worries that her children cannot concentrate during their \nclasses.\n  Her concern is legitimate. Students who are hungry or at-risk of \nhunger are twice as likely to have academic, social and psychological \nproblems as children from similar low-income families who are not \nhungry. By improving the Food Stamp Program, the Hunger Relief Act will \nreduce the suffering for millions of families like the Jenkins.\n  Now, while the economy is strong, we must actively fight hunger and \nensure that the most basic needs of children and families are met. I \nwelcome the support of Senators Specter, Leahy and Jeffords in this \nbipartisan effort and I look forward to early action in the Senate to \npass this needed legislation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as we approach the beginning of the next \ncentury, we have much to be proud of as a nation. The stock market has \nreached an historic 10,000 mark. We are in the midst of one of the \ngreatest economic expansions in our nation's history. More Americans \nown their own homes\n\n[[Page S13266]]\n\nthan at any time, and we have the lowest unemployment and welfare \ncaseloads in a generation.\n  Yet, there are millions of Americans who go hungry every day. Just \nthis past July, the Department of Agriculture published a report \nentitled ``Household Food Security in the United States 1995-1998'' \nwhich reported that last year, 36 million persons--of which \napproximately 40% were children--lived in households that experienced \nhunger.\n  While it is true that food stamp and welfare program caseloads have \ndropped over the past few years, hunger has not. As families try to \nmake the transition from welfare to work, too many are falling out and \nbeing left behind. And too often, it is our youth who is feeling the \nbrunt of this, as one out of every five people lining up at soup \nkitchens is a child.\n  Second Harvest, the nation's largest hunger relief charity, \ndistributed more than one billion pounds of food to an estimated 26 \nmillion low-income Americans last year through their network of \nregional food banks. These food banks provide food and grocery products \nto nearly fifty thousand local charitable feeding programs--food \nshelves, pantries, soup kitchens and emergency shelters.\n  Yet as the demand has risen at local hunger relief agencies, too many \npantries and soup kitchens have been forced to turn needy people away \nbecause the request for their services exceeds available food.\n  Last year, the U.S. Conference of Mayors released its Annual Survey \nof Hunger and Homelessness, which reported that the demand for hunger \nrelief services grew 14 percent last year. Additionally, 21 percent of \nrequests for emergency food were estimated to have gone unmet. This is \nthe highest rate of unmet need by emergency food providers since the \nrecession of the early 1990s. And this is not just a problem of the \ninner cities. According to the Census Bureau, hunger and poverty are \ngrowing faster in the suburbs than anywhere else in America. In my own \nstate of Vermont, one in ten people is ``food insecure,'' according to \ngovernment statistics. That is, of course, just a clinical way to say \nthey are hunger or at risk of hunger.\n  Under the leadership of Deborah Flateman, the Vermont Food Bank \ndistributes food to approximately 240 private social service agencies \nthroughout the state to help hungry and needy Vermonters. The local \nfood shelves and emergency kitchens which receive food from the Vermont \nFood Bank clearly are on the front-line against hunger. And what they \nare seeing is very disturbing--one in four seeking hunger relief is a \nchild under the age of 17. Elderly people make up more than a third of \nall emergency food recipients. We cannot continue to allow so many of \nour youngest and oldest citizens face the prospect of hunger on a daily \nbasis. Another extremely troubling statistic about hunger in Vermont is \nthat in 45 percent of the households that receive charitable food \nassistance, one or more adults are working. Nationwide, working poor \nhouseholds represent more than one-third of all emergency food \nrecipients. These are people in Vermont and across the U.S. who are \nworking, paying taxes and contributing to the economic growth of our \nnation, but are reaping few of the rewards.\n\n  Our government has taken numerous steps to alleviate hunger in \nAmerica, but clearly more still needs to be done.\n  The Emergency Food Assistance Program has been essential in the fight \nagainst hunger by providing USDA commodities to the nation's food banks \nand local emergency feeding charities. As the demands continue to grow, \nhowever, TEFAP resources are running on empty. The Hunger Relief Act \nwould increase funding for TEFAP, thus helping community charities cope \nwith increased local demand for hunger relief.\n  Perhaps more than any other program, the Food Stamp Program has been \ncritical to the prevention and alleviation of hunger and poverty, and \nis essential to helping families on welfare transition to work. \nNationally, one in ten people--half of which are children--participates \nin the Food Stamp Program.\n  In this time of economic booms, one in five U.S. children--\napproximately 15 million children--lives in a household receiving food \nstamps.\n  And far too many families with full-time or part-time minimum wage \njobs need food stamps just to approach the poverty line.\n  For many families, the choice between paying the rent and buying food \nis becoming more and more common. While the Food Stamp Program does \nadjust benefits for families with high shelter costs, this adjustment \nhas been artificially capped. In 1993, Congress passed a phased-out \nelimination of the cap on the food stamp shelter deduction. With the \npassage of the Welfare Reform bill, however, Congress repealed the \nphase-out and the cap remained in place.\n  The cap on the shelter deduction has had a significant impact on \nworking families, who tend to have higher shelter costs than families \nreceiving public housing assistance. The Hunger Relief Act raises the \nshelter cap from $275 to $340, and then indexes it to inflation, \nincreasing access to Food Stamps for approximately 1.25 million people.\n  Many working poor families, particularly in rural areas, own a \nmodestly valued car, necessary to get to work, but of a value greater \nthan the antiquated food stamp vehicle limit. In the last 22 years, the \nlimit on car values has increased a total of $150, and in many states \nthe Food Stamp vehicle allowance is much lower than the TANF vehicle \nallowance. The Hunger Relief Act would give states more freedom, \nallowing states the option of using the same limits for vehicles under \nboth TANF and Food Stamps. The Hunger Relief Act would also complete \nthe restoration of food stamp benefits to thousands of immigrants who \nwere pushed out of the program by the Welfare Reform Act.\n  Last Congress I worked hard to include $818 million in the \nAgricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reauthorization Act to \nrestore food stamp benefits for thousands of legal immigrants. This \nlegislation restored food stamps to legal immigrants who are disabled \nor elderly, or who later become disabled, and who resided in the United \nStates prior to August 22, 1996. That law also increased food stamp \neligibility time limits--from five years to seven years--for refugees \nand asylees who came to this country to avoid persecution. Hmong \nrefugees who aided U.S. military efforts in Southeast Asia were also \ncovered, as were children residing in the United States prior to August \n22, 1996.\n  Though the Agriculture Research Act restored food stamp eligibility \nto children of legal immigrants, many of these children are not \nreceiving food stamps and are experiencing alarming instances of \nhunger. In its recent report entitled ``Who is Leaving the Food Stamp \nProgram? An Analysis of Caseload Changes from 1994 to 1997,'' the \nUnited States Department of Agriculture reported that participation \namong children living with parents who are legal immigrants fell \nsignificantly faster than children living with native-born parents. It \nappears that restrictions on adult legal immigrants deterred the \nparticipation of their children. That is a disturbing development that \nmust be rectified, and the Hunger Relief Act would go along way toward \nmaking the situation right by restoring food stamp eligibility to all \nlegal immigrants.\n  Of the many problems that we face as a nation, hunger is one that is \nentirely solvable. Hunger is not a Democrat or Republican issue. Hunger \nis a problem that all Americans should agree must be ended in our \nnation. I am proud to join with Senators Kennedy, Specter, and Jeffords \nin introducing the Hunger Relief Act, and I look forward to working \nwith members of the Senate to see the passage of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Domenici, Mr. \n        Hollings, and Mr. Cleland):\n  S. 1806. A bill to authorize the payment of a gratuity to certain \nmembers of the Armed Forces who served at Bataan and Corregidor during \nWorld War II, or the surviving spouses of such members, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Veterans Affairs.\n\n\n               bataan and corregidor veterans legislation\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce important \nlegislation, of which Senator Hollings and Senator Cleland are also \nsponsors, recognizing the heroic contributions of American soldiers who \nserved in Bataan and Corregidor during World War\n\n[[Page S13267]]\n\nII. This legislation will provide a one time honorarium to those \nveterans who survived the notorious Death March and were made to work \nas slave labor in support of the Japanese war effort. Compensation \nawarded these heroes for their imprisonment has never approached the \nvalue of their sacrifices on behalf of our nation's liberty. As these \nlegendary heroes approach the final chapters of their lives, if is \nfitting that the nation pay them special homage for their heroic deeds \nheretofore unrewarded. That's why I am introducing this legislation \ntoday--to salute these Americans in recognition of the great sacrifices \nthey made for this nation.\n  From December 1941 to April 1942, American military forces stationed \nin the Philippines fought valiantly against overwhelming Japanese \nmilitary forces on the Bataan peninsula near Manila. Under severe \ncombined attack of the Japanese forces, General Douglas MacArthur \nordered U.S. troops to withdraw to the Bataan peninsula to form a \nstrong defensive perimeter to protect the eventual evacuation of troops \nfrom the island. The U.S. forces fought for 3 months, considerably \nlonger than the unfavorable troop balance would have suggested was \npossible. As a result of extending Japanese military resources during \nthat crucial initial phase of the war in the Pacific, U.S. forces in \nBataan and Corregidor prevented Japan from accomplishing critical \nstrategic objectives that would have enabled them to capture Australia. \nHad the Japanese been able to accomplish their plans, their victory in \nthe Philippines could have doomed Allied efforts in the Pacific from \nthe very outset.\n  On April 9, 1942, Major General Edward King, Commander of U.S. forces \non the Bataan peninsula, ordered the troops to surrender rather than \nface certain slaughter on the battlefield. What followed was the \ntragic, infamous ``Death March'' of American prisoners from the Bataan \npeninsula to Camp O'Donnell of Manila. Some experts estimate that more \nthan 10,000 Americans died on the 85-mile march to the prison camp. \nMany died of starvation or lack of water; some were executed on the \nspot by their Japanese captors.\n  In June 1942, following the surrender of American troops of the \nCorregidor garrison, prisoners held at the O'Donnell Prisoner of War \n(POW) camp were joined with those captured at Corregidor and \ntransferred to the Cabanatuan POW camp. In the fall of 1944, the \nJapanese transferred more than 1,600 prisoners from the Cabanatuan POW \ncamp to ``hell ships'' destined for Japan, where prisoners were used as \nslave laborers working in mines, shipyards, and factories. In some \ncases, because the ``hell ships'' weren't marked, they were attacked \nand sunk by U.S. military aircraft.\n  Mr. President, the heroic performance of our soldiers at  Bataan and \nduring incarceration in POW camps earned them well-deserved citations \nfollowing the war. The 200th and 515th Coastal Artillery units from New \nMexico that served to defend the retreating troops at Bataan received \nthree Presidential Unit Citations and the Philippine Presidential Unit \nCitation for their heroism. New Mexico is particularly proud of these \nmen whose heroism I seek to salute through this legislation today. Of \nthe 25,000 American servicemen stationed in the Philippines at the \noutbreak of World War II, less than 1,000 are living today. These \nheroes deserve special recognition and gratitude from the American \npeople beyond the symbolic recognition and remuneration they have \nheretofore received.\n\n  In December, 1998, the Canadian Government approved a legislative \nmeasure to compensate their military veterans who had been captured by \nthe Japanese during the fall of Hong Kong, and who subsequently \nprovided slave labor in Japanese POW camps. The measure awarded \napproximately 700 qualified veterans and surviving spouses $15,600 each \n``as an extraordinary payment to extraordinary individuals who suffered \nextraordinary treatment in captivity.'' The payment to Canadian \nveterans will total $11.7 million from Canadian federal funds, not from \nthe Japanese Government. The Japanese Government considers their \nliability for treatment of POWs to have been settled by the treaty \nsigned in 1952, compensating each prisoner of war for their time in \ncaptivity, but not for any slave labor that was performed. Last fall, \nJapan's high court rejected a compensation suit seeking redress filed \nby a coalition of former Allied prisoners on the basis of the 1952 \ntreaty protecting Japan from further liability in post-war settlements.\n  Mr. President in agreeing to provide their veterans with compensation \nfor slave labor performed while in POW camps, the Canadian Government \nrecognized that lengthy legal proceedings appealing the decision of the \nJapanese high court would likely be too drawn out to be beneficial to \ntheir aging veterans. As a result, the Canadian Government concluded \nthat it was appropriate and honorable to recognize the heroic \ncontributions of veterans who were made to perform slave labor simply \nout of recognition of the debt of gratitude owed to the veterans by the \nCanadian people.\n  Our American veterans who served in Bataan and Corregidor and \nperformed slave labor in Japanese mines, shipyards, and factories are \nin a similar predicament as their Canadian colleagues. These men have \nnever been fully compensated for their heroism and sacrifices made \nwhile serving as slaves to their Japanese captors. The Japanese \ngovernment has concluded that it is no longer liable for compensating \nsuch claims. Appealing the decision of the Japanese high court to \nfurther authority would take more time than many of our veterans have. \nConsequently, Mr. President, I believe that the American Government, \njust as the Canadian Government has done, should choose to recognize \nthe contributions of the war heroes of Bataan and Corregidor.\n  The legislation I am introducing today calls on the Congress to \nauthorize payment of $20,000 to each veteran of Bataan or Corregidor \nwho performed slave labor during World War II. The honorarium would \nalso be extended to surviving spouses. This small token of appreciation \nwould mean a great deal to these heroes and their families.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill. I hope we can enact it in \nthe near future.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me commend our distinguished \ncolleague from New Mexico. I had the privilege of visiting Corregidor \nabout 30 years ago with Senator Montoya. We talked about the New Mexico \nNational Guard. Most were lost who went through that dreadful \nexperience. For those that survived--I lost a good friend, Jack \nLeonard, and other graduates who served in the New Mexico National \nGuard--this is a moment of history that should be noted in a more clear \nand reverent fashion.\n  I ask, please, to be added as a cosponsor to the Senator's bill.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator from South Carolina very much. This \nlegislation will move more quickly with him as a cosponsor. I also want \nto indicate that Senator Domenici is a cosponsor of this legislation, \nas well. As I say, I hope we can move ahead with it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague \nSenator Bingaman to introduce legislation that will compensate our \nveterans who fought at Bataan and Corregidor and were later held \nprisoner.\n  I do not think words can fully describe the bravery of these veterans \nand the horrific conditions they endured, but I think a quote from Lt. \nGen. Jonathan M. Wainwright provides an insight into these men:\n\n       They were the first to fire and last to lay down their \n     arms, and only reluctantly doing so after being given a \n     direct order.\n\n  The 200th and 515th Coast Artillery better known as the New Mexico \nBrigade played a prominent and heroic role in the fierce fighting that \ntook place in the Philippines. For four months the men of the 200th and \nthe 515th held off the Japanese only to be finally overwhelmed by \ndisease and starvation.\n  Today every student in his or her history class learns about the \ntragic result of the Battle for Bataan. The survivors of the battle \nwere subjected to the horrors and atrocities of the 65 mile ``Death \nMarch.'' As if this were not enough, following the infamous march these \nmen were held for over 40 months in Prisoner of War Camps.\n  Sadly, of the eighteen hundred men in the Regiment, less than nine \nhundred returned home and a third of\n\n[[Page S13268]]\n\nthose passed away within a year of returning. I simply cannot imagine \nwhat it must have been like for these men.\n  I would now like to briefly discuss the Bill we are introducing. This \nlegislation offers long overdue compensation to a select group of men \nwho served in the Philippines at Bataan and Corregidor during World War \nII. The bill authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to pay \n$20,000 to any veteran, or his surviving spouse, who served at Bataan \nor Corregidor, was captured and held as a prisoner of war, and was \nforced to perform slave labor as a prisoner in Japan during World War \nII.\n  There is one final point that I want to make as a matter of simple \nfairness. I believe that in the upcoming months the federal tax \nimplications should be examined. It may be necessary to provide that \nthe $20,000 payment should be excluded from federal income taxes.\n  Without an exclusion, the interaction between a lump sum payment, the \nsocial security income tax earnings limitation could subject some of \nthe survivors of the Bataan death march to one-time exorbitant tax \nrates in excess of 50 percent. We don't want the federal government to \ngive the compensation with one hand, only to have it taken away by the \nIRS.\n  Thank you and I look forward to working with my colleagues on this \nissue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 1807. A bill to provide for increased access to airports in the \nUnited Kingdom by United States air carriers, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n          open skies between the u.s. and the u.k. legislation\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation in \nresponse to the lack of progress in negotiations between the United \nStates and the United Kingdom to open up competition through an open-\nskies treaty for air travel between our countries. International \naviation travel is central to the continued growth of commerce and \ntourism, and every effort must be made to increase these opportunities.\n\n  This bill mandates that the United States and the United Kingdom come \nto an agreement that would grant all applications U.S. carriers \ncurrently have filed with the U.S. Department of Transportation for \nroute access to the United Kingdom. The bill also mandates more access \nto London's Heathrow International Airport for U.S. carriers that do \nnot currently have access to this airport. Congressman Bud Shuster, \nChairman of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, \nhas already introduced an identical bill, H.R. 3072, with the Ranking \nMinority Member, Congressman James Oberstar, in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Under the current 22 year old bilateral agreement, known as Bermuda \nII, only two U.S. airlines, American and United, and two from Great \nBritain, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, can fly between Heathrow \nand the United States. Under the current agreement, the British hold \ndominant rights to air travel between our countries in one of the most \nrestrictive existing bilateral agreements for air travel. For example, \nBritish Airways is allowed to fly more routes to the U.S. than all U.S. \ncarriers can fly to the United Kingdom combined. This present policy is \nunfair and is not in the best interests of American or British \nconsumers.\n  This situation is illustrated by the recent announcement by British \nAirways that it would be ending its nonstop flights between Pittsburgh \nand London as of October 31, 1999. This means that a city which has had \nnonstop for over a decade will no longer have it. Under the current \nrestrictive agreement, only the British can fly to and from Pittsburgh; \nAmerican carriers willing to pick up this route are unable to do so.\n  The United States has open-skies agreements with over 36 countries \nwhich have been completed or are being phased in. Open-skies agreements \nallow a free market in air service in which airlines can fly where they \nwant. It is inappropriate for the United States to lack a similar \nagreement with an historic ally and major trading partner such as the \nUnited Kingdom.\n  If an agreement is not reached within six months of the bill's \npassage, the Secretary of Transportation is required to revoke all \ncurrent slots and slot exemptions held by British air carriers at \nChicago O'Hare and New York Kennedy airports. In addition, if the \nUnited States and the United Kingdom do not reach an open-skies \nagreement by the end of 2000, the bill mandates renunciation of the \ncurrent bilateral agreement. My goal is to provide a strong incentive \nfor our two countries to negotiate a fair, long overdue agreement by \nincreasing competition and choices for consumers and all interested \ncarriers in both countries.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1807\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ACCESS TO UNITED KINGDOM AIRPORTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--If the Governments of the United Kingdom \n     and the United States have not signed an agreement, by the \n     date that is 180 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, that--\n       (1) provides for approval of all applications for air \n     routes from the United States to the United Kingdom that have \n     been submitted to the Secretary of Transportation by United \n     States air carriers and are pending on October 14, 1999; and\n       (2) provides slots at Heathrow International Airport to \n     United States air carriers that do not have any slots at such \n     airport on such date of enactment, without affecting any \n     slots held by other United States air carriers at such \n     airport on such date of enactment,\n     the Secretary of Transportation shall immediately revoke all \n     slots and exemptions to the slot rule held by British air \n     carriers at O'Hare International Airport and John F. Kennedy \n     International Airport and, after the date of such revocation, \n     shall not grant any slot or exemption to the slot rule to a \n     British air carrier at either of such airports until such an \n     agreement is signed.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section, the following \n     definitions apply:\n       (1) British air carrier.--The term ``British air carrier'' \n     means a citizen of Great Britain undertaking by any means, \n     directly or indirectly, to provide foreign air transportation \n     (as defined in section 40102(a) of title 49, United States \n     Code).\n       (2) Slot rule.--The term ``slot rule'' means the \n     requirements contained in subparts K and S of part 93 of \n     title 14, Code of Federal Regulations.\n       (3) United states air carrier.--The term ``United States \n     air carrier'' has the meaning given to the term ``air \n     carrier'' by section 40102(a) of title 49, United States \n     Code.\n\n     SEC. 2. OPEN SKIES AGREEMENT.\n\n       If the Governments of the United Kingdom and the United \n     States have not signed an open skies agreement, as defined in \n     Department of Transportation Order 92-8-13, by December 31, \n     2000, the Secretary of State shall immediately file a notice \n     to terminate the Agreement Between the United States of \n     America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great \n     Britain and Northern Ireland Concerning Air Services, in \n     accordance with the provisions of the Agreement.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Biden):\n  S. 1808. A bill to reauthorize and improve the drug court grant \nprogram; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n         Drug Court Reauthorization and Improvement Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce a \nbill to provide federal assistance to States and local governments for \ndrug courts to provide treatment rather than expensive imprisonment for \ndrug addicted nonviolent offenders.\n  This legislation would reauthorize and improve upon a novel program \nby which States and localities may obtain Federal funds to assist in \nthe implementation of a ``drug court'' within the State and local \ncriminal courts. Drug courts are designed to select from the general \ncriminal population nonviolent offenders who test positive for drugs, \nand put them through a program of court supervised drug treatment and \nrehabilitation. In this way, we can both aid first-time drug offenders \nby preventing them from becoming career criminals and provide \nlocalities the funds to enable them to control the serious backlogs in \ntheir criminal court caused by the drug crime wave. In the long-term, \nthis solution to the drug plague promises to be less expensive than \nincarcerating these nonviolent offenders.\n  In 1991, I introduced similar legislation (S. 648), which was \nproposed by a\n\n[[Page S13269]]\n\n1990 study commissioned by the Philadelphia Bar Association entitled, \n``Clearing the Road to Justice.'' This study found that state and local \ncourts are overwhelmed by a large number of drug related crimes \ncommitted by first time offenders. The study concluded that a separate \ndrug court division could both speed processing of drug related cases \nand provide mandatory drug screening programs to target first-time \nnonviolent drug offenders, and at the same time free up the rest of the \ncourt system to focus on violent criminals.\n  Congress enacted legislation to authorize a federal drug court grant \nprogram as part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of \n1994. However, in an action without any debate and that I believe \nreflected poor judgment, Congress repealed such authority in the \nOmnibus Consolidation Recessional and Appropriations Act of 1996 (PL \n104-134). Although Congress rescinded the authority for this program, \nit has had been good sense to continue to appropriate some funds to the \nprogram by increasing funding from $11.5 million in 1995 to $40 million \nin 1999.\n  As a result of this federal funding, there has been a considerable \nincrease in the number of drug courts in the United States. Since 1994, \nthe total number of operating drug court program has grown from 42 to \napproximately 300. However, there is still not enough funding to \nadequately support the program despite the increased interest. Last \nyear the Department of Justice received 216 grant applications, but was \nable to award only 88 grants. Justice reports that there were at least \n38 additional programs that would have received grants had there been \nfunding available.\n  During my travels in Pennsylvania, I have confirmed that there is a \ngreat deal of interest in implementing this program. Currently, there \nare six counties (Allegheny, Chester, Lycoming, Philadelphia, York, \nErie) that are in various stages of planning and implementing drug \ncourt programs. I had the opportunity to speak to a number of \nprosecutors, judges and participants of these programs. They are very \npositive about their initial progress and very optimistic about the \nresults that they will achieve in the future.\n  As a member of the Judiciary and Appropriations Committees, I have \nbeen an advocate of increasing funds for this program. I am committed \nto a balanced federal budget and realize that we must be careful in how \nwe make federal expenditures. With this in mind, I have chosen this \nprogram carefully as one in which we should invest federal funds. I \nbelieve that Congress must step up to the plate and commit to this \nprogram by authorizing it and appropriating sufficient funds to meet \nthe growing demand for drug court alternatives. It is necessary that \nthe criminal justice system and Congress face up to the fact that \nrealistic rehabilitation must be a part of the process of drug \ntreatment and crime reduction.\n\n  I believe that the drug courts are extremely effective in breaking \nthe cycle of substance abuse and crime and will save large amounts of \nmoney that otherwise would have been spent on incarceration. With this \nprogram, first-time drug offenders may be prevented from becoming \ncareer criminals, and localities will be provided with funds to \nminimize the serious backlogs in criminal courts caused largely by drug \ncrimes. The most recent Drug Court Survey Report, published by the \nOffice of Justice Programs' Drug Court Clearinghouse and Technical \nAssistance Project at American University found that the drug court \nprograms reported low recidivism rates between 2% and 20%. The survey \nalso found significantly reduced drug use even among those who did not \ngraduate from the programs, with as many as 93% of participants testing \nnegative for drugs. Further, this alternative promises to be less \nexpensive than incarcerating nonviolent offenders. Drug courts offer \nsignificant cost savings as compared to incarceration. According to the \nDrug Court Survey Report, the average cost for the treatment component \nof a drug court program ranges between $900 and $1,200 per participant, \nand savings in jail bed days have been estimated to be at least $5,000 \nper defendant. Additional reported savings include reductions in police \novertime, witness costs and grand jury expenses.\n  While these statistics are very promising, they are not necessarily \nrepresentative of all of the drug court programs. In 1997, GAO issued a \nreport entitled ``Drug Courts: Overview of Growth, Characteristics and \nResults,'' which found that nearly half of the drug court programs do \nnot maintain follow-up data regarding recidivism or relapse to drug \nabuse. Accordingly, GAO recommended that the Attorney General require \ndrug court programs to collect and maintain follow-up data on \nrecidivism and drug use relapse. This legislation includes a \nrequirement for such follow-up so Congress can better determine the \nprogram's efficacy.\n  This legislation would authorize up to $200 million per year for this \ninnovative program, the original level from the 1994 law. Additionally, \nin order to create greater flexibility for states and local governments \nto fund the drug court programs, this legislation would allow federal \nfunds that are received from sources other than the Drug Courts Program \nOffice to be counted as a part of the 25% grantee matching contribution \nrequirement. The current Justice policy requires the grantee to \ncontribute 25% of the total program costs--none of which can come from \na federal source.\n  Additionally, the 1994 law required the Department of Justice to \nconsult with HHS concerning administration of the drug court program, \nand although the drug court provision was rescinded, Justice has \ncontinued to consult with HHS in an informal manner regarding treatment \nprograms. As Chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services and \nEducation Appropriations Subcommittee, I recognize the important role \nthat HHS can play in improving the treatment aspect of the drug court \nprogram. Accordingly, this bill would reinstate the requirement that \nJustice consult with HHS regarding administration of the drug court \nprogram and would authorize $75 million to be appropriated to HHS to be \nused for drug treatment services associated with drug court programs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important program which provides \nan effective alternative to imprisonment for drug addicted nonviolent \noffenders.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Frist, \n        Ms. Collins, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Reed, Mr. Dodd and Mrs. \n        Murray):\n  S. 1809. A bill to improve service systems for individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n The Development Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 1999\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to introduce \ntoday, for myself, and my colleagues from the Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee, Senators Kennedy, Harkin, Frist, Collins, \nWellstone, Reed, Dodd, and Murray, The Developmental Disabilities \nAssistance and Bill of Rights Act of 1999. This bill is the \nreauthorization of a piece of legislation with a rich legacy, and a \nlong history of bipartisan Congressional support. Originally authorized \nin 1963 and last reauthorized in 1996, it has always focused on the \nneeds of our most vulnerable citizens, an estimated four million \nindividuals with severe disabilities, including individuals with mental \nretardation and other lifelong, pervasive disabilities.\n  Initial versions of this legislation focused primarily on the \ninterdisciplinary training of professionals to work with individuals \nwith developmental disabilities. The University Affiliated Facilities \n(UAFs) were the first federally funded programs charged with expanding \nthe cadre of professionals to address the needs of individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities. The name of these programs was changed to \nUniversity Affiliated Programs (UAPs) in a subsequent reauthorization \nand their mission was expanded to include community services and \ninformation dissemination pertaining to individuals with developmental \ndisabilities. Finally, in 1996, after 33 years of planned expansion by \nCongress, each State established and received core funding for at least \none UAP.\n  In the 1970 reauthorization of the DD Act, Congress recognized the \nneed for, and value of strengthening State efforts to coordinate and \nintegrate services for individuals with developmental\n\n[[Page S13270]]\n\ndisabilities. As a result, Congress established and authorized funding \nfor State Developmental Disabilities Councils (DD Councils) in each \nstate. The purpose of the Councils was, and continues to be, to advise \ngovernors and State agencies on how to use available and potential \nresources to meet the needs of individuals with developmental \ndisabilities. Every State has a DD Council. The Councils undertake \nadvocacy, capacity building, and systemic change activities directed at \nimproving access to community services and supports for individuals \nwith disabilities and their families.\n  In 1975, Congress created and authorized funding for Protection and \nAdvocacy Systems (P) in each state to ensure the safety and well \nbeing of individuals with developmental disabilities. The mission of \nthese systems has evolved over the years, initially addressing the \nprotection of individuals with developmental disabilities who lived in \ninstitutions, to the present responsibilities related to the protection \nof individuals with developmental disabilities from abuse, neglect, and \nexploitation, and from the violation of their legal and human rights, \nboth in institutions and in the community.\n  The 1975 reauthorization of the DD Act also established funding for \nProjects of National Significance. Through this new authority Congress \nauthorized funding for projects that would support national initiatives \nrelated to specific areas of need. Over the years, projects related to \nareas such as people with developmental disabilities and the criminal \njustice system, home ownership, employment, assistive technology, and \nself-advocacy for individuals with developmental disabilities have been \ninitiated through these projects.\n  The 1999 reauthorization of the DD Act builds on the past successes \nof these programs, reflects today's changing society, and seeks to \nprovide a foundation to provide the services and supports that \nindividuals with developmental disabilities, their families, and \ncommunities will need as we enter the next century. Let me take a few \nmoments to highlight the major provisions of this bill.\n  The Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of \n1999 continues a tradition of support for a DD Network in each State \nthat is able to provide advocacy, capacity building, and systemic \nchange activities in quality assurance, education and early \nintervention, child care, employment, health, housing, transportation, \nrecreation and other services for individuals with developmental \ndisabilities and their families. This approach reflects current trends \nin society and in the field of developmental disabilities in that it \nemphasizes the empowerment of individuals with developmental \ndisabilities and their families and joins it with state flexibility and \nincreased accountability.\n  The bill continues and further develops the important work of the DD \nAct programs in each State. It seeks to ensure that more individuals \nwith developmental disabilities are able to fully participate in and \ncontribute to their communities through full integration and inclusion \nin the economic, political, social, cultural, and educational \nmainstream of our nation. It also assists DD Act programs to improve \nthe quality of supports and services for individuals with developmental \ndisabilities and their families regardless of where they choose to \nlive.\n  Unfortunately, in keeping with other realities of our time, the bill \nalso recognizes that individuals with developmental disabilities are at \ngreater risk of abuse, neglect, financial and sexual exploitation, and \nthe violation of their legal and human rights, than the general \npopulation. Based upon this recognition, the bill supports the extra \neffort and attention that is needed, in both individual and systemic \nsituations, to ensure that individuals with developmental disabilities \nare put at no greater risk of harm than others in the general \npopulation.\n  The bill recognizes that individuals with developmental disabilities \noften have multiple, evolving, life long needs that require interaction \nwith agencies and organizations that offer specialized assistance as \nwell as interaction with generic services in their communities. The \nnature of the needs of these individuals and the capacity of States and \ncommunities to respond to them have changed. In the past 5 years, new \nstrategies for reaching, engaging, and assisting individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities have gained visibility and credibility. \nThese new strategies are reinforced by and reflected in this bill.\n  In the past, the Councils, Centers, and P Systems have been \nauthorized to provide advocacy, capacity building, and systemic change \nactivities to make access to and navigation through various service \nsystems easier for individuals with developmental disabilities. Over \ntime there has been pressure for these three programs to provide \nassistance beyond the limit of their resources and beyond their \nauthorized missions. The bill clearly and concisely specifies the roles \nand responsibilities of Councils, Centers, and P Systems so that \nthere is a common understanding of what the programs are intended to \ncontribute toward a State's efforts to respond to the needs of \nindividuals with developmental disabilities and their families.\n  The bill gives States' Councils, Centers, and P Systems more \nflexibility. Each program in a State, working with stakeholders, is to \ndevelop goals for how to assure that individuals with developmental \ndisabilities and their families participate in the design of and have \naccess to needed community services, individualized supports, and other \nforms of assistance that promote self-determination, independence, \nproductivity, integration, and inclusion in all facets of community \nlife. Goals may be set in any of the following areas of emphasis: \nquality assurance, education and early intervention, child care, \nhealth, employment, housing, transportation, recreation, or other \ncommunity services.\n  Consistent with Congressional emphasis on strengthening \naccountability for all federal programs, this legislation requires each \nprogram to determine, before undertaking a goal, how it will be \nmeasured. Measurement of a goal must reflect the impact of the goal on \nindividuals with developmental disabilities. The Secretary of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS) is to develop indicators \nof progress to evaluate how the three programs in each State have \nengaged in activities to promote and achieve the purpose and policy of \nthe Act in terms of choices available to individuals with developmental \ndisabilities and their families, their satisfaction with services, \ntheir ability to participate in community life, and their safety. In \naddition, the Secretary is to monitor how the three programs funded in \neach State coordinate their efforts, and how that coordination affects \nthe quality of supports and services for individuals with developmental \ndisabilities and their families in that State.\n  During the past several years, a clearer picture has emerged of what \nindividuals with developmental disabilities are able to accomplish when \nthey have access to the same choices and opportunities available to \nothers and with the appropriate support. There has also been increasing \nrecognition of and support for self-advocacy organizations established \nby and for individuals with developmental disabilities. This bill \nreflects and promotes such efforts by authorizing State Councils in \neach State to support self-advocacy organizations for individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities.\n  The legislation renames the University Affiliated Programs as \nUniversity Centers for Excellence for Developmental Disabilities \nEducation, Research, and Service, expands their responsibilities to \ninclude the conduct of research, and links them together to create a \nNational Network.\n  By administering the three programs specifically authorized under the \nDD Act and by funding projects of national significance to accomplish \nsimilar or complementary efforts, the Administration on Developmental \nDisabilities (ADD) in HHS plays a critical role in supporting and \nfostering new ways to assist individuals with developmental \ndisabilities and in promoting system integration to expand and improve \ncommunity services for individuals with disabilities. This bill \nprovides ADD with the ability to foster similar efforts across the \nExecutive Branch. The bill authorizes ADD to pursue and join with other \nExecutive Branch entities in activities that will improve choices, \nopportunities, and services for individuals with developmental \ndisabilities.\n  The bill recognizes that forty-nine States have begun to develop \nfamily\n\n[[Page S13271]]\n\nsupport programs for families with children with disabilities. This \nsupports States by providing grants (one, 3-year grant per State, on a \ncompetitive basis) to assist States to provide services to families who \nchoose to keep their children with disabilities at home and not be \nforced to place their children in institutions due to the lack of \nsupport. The bill gives States maximum flexibility to use targeted \nfunds to strengthen or expand existing State family support programs.\n  Finally, in response to a national need to increase the number and \nimprove the training of direct support workers who assist individuals \nwith developmental disabilities where they live, work, go to school, \nand play, the bill includes provisions proposed by Senators Frist and \nWellstone. One provides funding for the development and dissemination \nof a technology-based training curriculum to provide state of the art \nstaff development for individuals in direct service roles with people \nwith developmental disabilities and their families. The other is a \nscholarship program to encourage continuing education for individuals \nentering the field of direct service\n  Throughout the country, the DD Act programs have a long history of \nachievement. In Vermont, the DD Act programs make ongoing contributions \nto major initiatives affecting individuals with developmental \ndisabilities and their families. They play significant roles in many of \nVermont's accomplishments, including: the inclusion of children with \nsevere disabilities into local schools and classrooms; early \nintervention and family leadership initiatives that are national \nmodels; and innovative programs in the areas of employment, and \ncommunity living options for individuals with developmental \ndisabilities. Based upon the letters our office has received from \nacross the country, it is clear that these small programs make \nsubstantial, positive differences in their states.\n  The bill we present today reflects the foundation of what Congress \nhas supported over the past 36 years, combined with our best efforts to \nsupport individuals with the most severe disabilities, their families, \nand their communities into the next century. It represents the best of \nwhat we in Congress have the opportunity to do . . . to ensure that \nthose who are among our most vulnerable citizens, are protected, \nsupported, and encouraged to achieve their potential. My colleagues and \nI are proud to present it to you today and hope to see it enacted as \nsoon as possible. \n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today I join with my colleagues, Senator \nFrist, Senator Jeffords, Senator Mikulski, Senator Murray, Senator \nDurbin, and Senator Cochran to introduce the ``Clinical Research \nEnhancement Act of 1999''.\n  Our goal is to enhance support for clinical research, which is \ncentral to biomedical research. Major advances in basic biological \nresearch are opening doors to new insights into all aspects of \nmedicine. As a result, extraordinary opportunities exist for cutting-\nedge clinical research to bring breakthroughs in the laboratory to the \nbedside of the patient. Clinical research is essential for the \nadvancement of scientific knowledge and the development of cures and \ntreatments for disease. In addition, the results of clinical research \nare incorporated by industry and used to develop new drugs, vaccines, \nand health care products. These advances in turn strengthen the economy \nand create jobs.\n  Unfortunately, the number of physicians choosing careers in clinical \nresearch is in serious decline. Between 1994 and 1998, the number of \nphysicians applying for first-time NIH grants decreased by 21%. Studies \nby the Institute of Medicine, the National Research Council, the \nNational Academy of Sciences, and the National Institutes of Health \nhave all highlighted the significant problems faced by clinical \nresearchers, including lack of grant support, lack of training \nopportunities, and the heavy debt burden from medical school.\n  The legislation we are introducing today seeks to enhance clinical \nresearch by addressing these issues. Our bill will provide research \nsupport and training opportunities for clinical researchers at all \nstages of their careers, as well as the necessary infrastructure to \nconduct clinical research.\n  The bill establishes several research grant awards. The Mentored \nPatient-Oriented Research Career Development Awards will support \nclinical investigators in the early phases of their independent careers \nby providing salary and other support for a period of supervised study. \nThe Mid-Career Investigator Awards in Patient-Oriented Research will \nprovide support for mid-career clinicians, to give them time for \nclinical research and to act as mentors for beginning investigators.\n  To encourage the training of clinical investigators at various stages \nin their careers, the bill establishes several programs. The NIH will \nsupport intramural and extramural training programs for medical and \ndental students. For students who want to pursue an advanced degree in \nclinical research, the bill provides support for both students and \ninstitutions to create training programs. For post-graduate education, \nNIH will support continuing education in such research.\n  Our legislation also creates a clinical research tuition loan \nrepayment program to encourage recruitment of new investigators. \nStudent debt is a major barrier to clinical research. Young physicians \ngraduate from medical school with an average debt of $86,000. Because \nof the limited financial opportunities in clinical research to repay \ntheir large debts, many young physicians are under great pressure to \nchoose more lucrative fields of medical practice. NIH has acknowledged \nthis problem, and has established an intramural loan repayment program \nto encourage the recruitment of clinical researchers to NIH. Our \nlegislation expands the current program, so that researchers throughout \nthe country will be eligible.\n  A solid infrastructure is essential to any research program. In \nclinical research, that infrastructure is provided, in part, by the \ngeneral clinical research centers at academic health centers throughout \nthe country. Our bill provides statutory authority for those clinical \nresearch centers.\n  In the past, support for these centers was once provided largely by \nacademic health centers. However, academic health centers today are \nconfronted with heavy competition from non-teaching institutions and \nare increasingly emphasizing patient care over research to minimize \ncosts. In the face of these changes, clinical researchers have become \nmuch more dependent on NIH for infrastructure support.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to move this important \nlegislation through Congress. Our bill is supported by over 70 \nbiomedical associations and organizations. I commend the American \nFederation for Medical Research for its support of this legislation.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to offer my support as a \ncosponsor of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of \nRights Act Amendments of 1999, a bill to extend and improve our \nNation's developmental disabilities programs which allow individuals \nwith developmental disabilities, such as mental retardation and severe \nphysical disabilities, to live more independent and productive lives.\n  As the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Disability Policy \nduring the 104th Congress, I introduced the Developmental Disabilities \nAssistance and Bill of Rights Act Amendments of 1996 which successfully \nextended this vital law. Through this experience, I became aware of the \nimportance of the programs under this Act and how they work to improve \nthe lives of individuals with developmental disabilities.\n  Before the DD Act was first signed in 1963, Americans who happened to \nbe born with developmental disabilities often lived and died in \ninstitutions where many were subjected to unspeakable conditions, far \nworse than conditions found in any American prison. Over the last \nseveral decades, thanks in part to the programs included in the DD Act, \nwe have learned how to help families to bring up their children with \ndevelopmental disabilities in their family homes; we have learned how \nto teach children with developmental disabilities; we have learned how \nto make room for these citizens to live and work in the heart of our \ncommunities; and we have learned how to ensure safe living environments \nand dependable care for those\n\n[[Page S13272]]\n\nindividuals with developmental disabilities who remain in residential \nfacilities.\n  The bill introduced today will ensure that these activities will \ncontinue. This bill will update and increase the accountability and \nflexibility of these programs under the law. These programs include the \nuniversity affiliated programs which educate students in developmental \ndisabilities related fields and which conduct research and training on \nhow to meet the needs of the disabled. The law also authorizes funding \nfor State Developmental Disabilities Councils which advise governors \nand State agencies on how to use available and potential resources to \nmeet the needs of individuals with developmental disabilities. To help \nprotect the rights of the developmentally disabled, the law provides \ngrants for Protection and Advocacy Systems to provide information and \nreferral services and to investigate reported incidents of abuse and \nneglect of individuals with developmental disabilities.\n  I am pleased that Senator Jeffords has agreed to include a provision \nin this bill which I drafted to address the training of direct service \npersonnel for individuals with developmental disabilities. The training \nof direct service personnel is a national challenge in both magnitude \nand complexity. The size of this workforce is over 400,000 persons with \nan estimated annual turnover rate of 50 percent. In addition, nearly \nhalf of these workers are part time, working nontraditional hours. To \naddress this dilemma, I have drafted a provision to develop a training \nprogram to create, evaluate, and disseminate a multimedia curriculum \nfor staff development of individuals who are direct support workers or \nwho seek to become direct support workers. This program will help \ndevelop a training regime that will be both cost and time effective for \nproviders of services for the developmentally disabled.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to offer my support to the Developmental \nDisabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act Amendments of 1999, \nwhich will improve and strengthen an important law which provides \nsupport for individuals with developmental disabilities and their \nfamilies and which will assist individuals with developmental \ndisabilities to live independently and work in the community, out of \ninstitutions, with as little bureaucracy and government intrusion as \npossible.\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President. The Developmental Disabilities Act \nhas been a cornerstone of federal registration for people with \ndisabilities. I am pleased to be here today with Senator Jeffords, \nSenator Kennedy, and other colleagues from the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee to introduce legislation that will \nreauthorize this important law.\n  The entities funded under the Act--The Developmental Disabilities \nCouncils, University Affiliated Programs, and the Protection and \nAdvocacy agencies--have enabled us to move away from a service system \ndominated by large public institutions, and to establish services where \nfamilies and individuals want them--in their own homes, communities, \nand neighborhoods. In fact, the Supreme Court cited the Developmental \nDisabilities Act in the recent Olmstead decision as one of several \npieces of federal legislation that secure opportunities for people with \ndisabilities to enjoy the benefits of community living.\n  This year's reauthorization is important for a number of reasons. \nFirst, we must continue our progress toward providing better community \nservices for all people with disabilities. The Development Disabilities \nAct is instrumental in that work.\n  Second, we must ensure that people with developmental disabilities \nare free from abuse and neglect in all aspects of the service delivery \nsystem. This bill will help protect people with disabilities from abuse \nand neglect no matter where they live--inside an institution or in the \ncommunity.\n  And, finally, we must do more to strengthen and support families as \nthey provide care and support to family members with a disability. \nFamily Support programs are one of the fastest growing services on the \nState level. State policy-makers are realizing that family caregivers \nare the true heroes of our long-term care system and they need help if \nthey are going to keep their children at home. In this year's \nreauthorization of the Developmental Disabilities Act, we have included \na Family Support program to help states strengthen and coordinate their \nsupport systems for family caregivers.\n  I commend the disability groups for all of their work to make this \nreauthorization possible. I thank my colleagues and their staff for \ntheir hard work to reauthorize this law into the next millennium. I \napplaud their commitment to people with developmental \ndisabilities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Conrad, Mr. \n        Kerrey, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Sarbanes):\n  S. 1810. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to clarify and \nimprove veterans' claims and appellate procedures; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n\n\n                  DUTY TO ASSIST VETERANS LEGISLATION\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today to \nmake sure we treat America's veterans with the compassion they deserve. \nThey have sacrificed so much of their personal lives for our country. \nAnd with this bill, I want to show them we appreciate their service, \nand we will be there when they need help.\n  When veterans need medical care, they file a claim for benefits with \nthe Veterans Administration. It requires researching information over \nmany years and from many different government organizations.\n  Traditionally, the Veterans Administration has helped veterans \nresearch and file their claims. That's the way it should be.\n  But a series of recent court decisions have changed that--and made it \nharder for veterans to file their claims. I want to set the record \nstraight. The VA has a duty to assist veterans in filing their claims.\n  So today, I am introducing legislation to amend Title 38 of the \nUnited States Code to clarify and improve veterans claims and \nprocedures.\n  My legislation clarifies that the Department of Veterans Affairs has \na duty to assist veterans in preparing all of the facts pertinent to a \nclaim for benefits. The VA has historically aided veterans in gathering \ninformation from the federal bureaucracy so they can file a claim.\n  Let's not forget--the claims process was set up to aid our veterans. \nIt's important to all veterans, especially those with severe mental and \nphysical disabilities.\n  Homeless veterans need help. Elderly veterans need help. And family \nmembers--who sacrifice to care for veterans--need help from the federal \ngovernment.\n  Anyone who has ever dealt with a veterans claim for benefits knows \nthis is a very difficult process. It can be frustrating for veterans \nwho--even in the best of circumstances--may be forced to wait several \nyears for a claim to be approved and granted. Veterans already pay a \nheavy cost for delayed benefits. They often face financial, family, and \nhealth problems, as they try to resolve their claims.\n  Yet, as we speak, the claims process at the VA is becoming even more \ndifficult for America's veterans and their families.\n  Through a series of court decisions, the VA's historic duty to assist \nveterans has been set aside. The courts responsible for veterans claims \nhave determined that it is now the individual veteran's responsibility \nto file a well-rounded claim before they can get assistance from the \nVA. The effect has been to place the burden on the individual veteran \nto gather information--service records, medical records, and other \ndocumentation--from the federal government in order to file a claim.\n  Mr. President, the courts have decided our veterans in need of \nassistance must go it alone. Homeless veterans suffering from Post \nTraumatic Stress Disorder must now prepare their claims without \nassistance from the government they sacrificed for. Veterans who are \nsick, mentally or physically disabled, indigent, or poorly educated now \nface new barriers to assistance they may be legally entitled to \nreceive. Veterans without the financial resources, time or familiarity \nwith the claims process system must navigate through the bureaucracy \nwithout federal assistance. That's not the way we should treat \nAmerica's veterans.\n\n[[Page S13273]]\n\n  Clearly, the courts have misinterpreted Congressional intent. The \nVeterans Judicial Review Act was signed into law during the 100th \nCongress with the following language,\n\n       It is the obligation of the Veterans Administration to \n     assist a claimant in developing facts pertinent to his claim \n     and to render a decision which grants him every benefit that \n     can be supported in law while protecting the interests of the \n     Government.\n\n  Somehow the courts interpreted that language differently. My \nobjective in introducing legislation today is not to quarrel with the \ncourts. I simply want to reassert congressional intent and re-establish \nthe VA's duty to assist veterans. My legislation simply confirms the \nCongress believes it is important and appropriate for the federal \ngovernment to assist veterans in preparing claims for benefits.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is widely supported among those who \nwork on veterans benefits claims every day. Numerous veterans advocacy \ngroups, including the Disabled American Veterans, strongly support my \nlegislation. This bill has original cosponsors from both sides of the \naisle. It is a bipartisan response to a real problem confronting \nAmerica's veterans.\n  Let's do the right thing for America's veterans and particularly for \nthose veterans who need the government's assistance the most.\n  I urge prompt Senate consideration and passage of this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Frist, Mr. Jeffords, Ms. \n        Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Cochran):\n  S. 1813.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Clinical Research \n     Enhancement Act of 1999''.\n\n      SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Clinical research is critical to the advancement of \n     scientific knowledge and to the development of cures and \n     improved treatment for disease.\n       (2) Tremendous advances in biology are opening doors to new \n     insights into human physiology, pathophysiology and disease, \n     creating extraordinary opportunities for clinical research.\n       (3) Clinical research includes translational research which \n     is an integral part of the research process leading to \n     general human applications. It is the bridge between the \n     laboratory and new methods of diagnosis, treatment, and \n     prevention and is thus essential to progress against cancer \n     and other diseases.\n       (4) The United States will spend more than \n     $1,200,000,000,000 on health care in 1999, but the Federal \n     budget for health research at the National Institutes of \n     Health was $15,600,000,000 only 1 percent of that total.\n       (5) Studies at the Institute of Medicine, the National \n     Research Council, and the National Academy of Sciences have \n     all addressed the current problems in clinical research.\n       (6) The Director of the National Institutes of Health has \n     recognized the current problems in clinical research and \n     appointed a special panel, which recommended expanded support \n     for existing National Institutes of Health clinical research \n     programs and the creation of new initiatives to recruit and \n     retain clinical investigators.\n       (7) The current level of training and support for health \n     professionals in clinical research is fragmented, \n     undervalued, and underfunded.\n       (8) Young investigators are not only apprentices for future \n     positions but a crucial source of energy, enthusiasm, and \n     ideas in the day-to-day research that constitutes the \n     scientific enterprise. Serious questions about the future of \n     life-science research are raised by the following:\n       (A) The number of young investigators applying for grants \n     dropped by 54 percent between 1985 and 1993.\n       (B) The number of physicians applying for first-time \n     National Institutes of Health research project grants fell \n     from 1226 in 1994 to 963 in 1998, a 21 percent reduction.\n\n[[Page S13274]]\n\n       (C) Newly independent life-scientists are expected to raise \n     funds to support their new research programs and a \n     substantial proportion of their own salaries.\n       (9) The following have been cited as reasons for the \n     decline in the number of active clinical researchers, and \n     those choosing this career path:\n       (A) A medical school graduate incurs an average debt of \n     $85,619, as reported in the Medical School Graduation \n     Questionnaire by the Association of American Medical Colleges \n     (AAMC).\n       (B) The prolonged period of clinical training required \n     increases the accumulated debt burden.\n       (C) The decreasing number of mentors and role models.\n       (D) The perceived instability of funding from the National \n     Institutes of Health and other Federal agencies.\n       (E) The almost complete absence of clinical research \n     training in the curriculum of training grant awardees.\n       (F) Academic Medical Centers are experiencing difficulties \n     in maintaining a proper environment for research in a highly \n     competitive health care marketplace, which are compounded by \n     the decreased willingness of third party payers to cover \n     health care costs for patients engaged in research studies \n     and research procedures.\n       (10) In 1960, general clinical research centers were \n     established under the Office of the Director of the National \n     Institutes of Health with an initial appropriation of \n     $3,000,000.\n       (11) Appropriations for general clinical research centers \n     in fiscal year 1999 equaled $200,500,000.\n       Since the late 1960s, spending for general clinical \n     research centers has declined from approximately 3 percent to \n     1 percent of the National Institutes of Health budget.\n       (12) In fiscal year 1999, there were 77 general clinical \n     research centers in operation, supplying patients in the \n     areas in which such centers operate with access to the most \n     modern clinical research and clinical research facilities and \n     technologies.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to provide \n     additional support for and to expand clinical research \n     programs.\n\n     SEC. 3. INCREASING THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES \n                   OF HEALTH IN CLINICAL RESEARCH.\n\n       Part B of title IV of the Public Health Service Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 284 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 409C.

Edward Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I write to thank you for your \n     continued support of the need to enhance clinical research \n     programs at the National Institutes of Health by \n     reintroducing the Clinical Research Enhancement Act. The \n     American Federation for Medical Research, a national \n     organization of over 5,000 physician-scientists who are \n     involved in basic, translational, clinical and health \n     services research, is committed to the improvement of human \n     health through the translation of basic scientific \n     discoveries to treatments and cures for disease.\n       For many years, academic medical centers have been able to \n     provide institutional support to young physician-scientists \n     who are interested in pursuing careers in biomedical \n     research. However, as the health care marketplace has become \n     increasingly competitive, academic centers have all but \n     eliminated internal subsidies for clinical research or the \n     training of clinical investigators. In fact, the Association \n     of American Medical Colleges has estimated that these \n     institutions have lost approximately $800 million in annual \n     ``purchasing power'' for research and research training \n     within their institutions.\n       Unfortunately, young investigators and medical students \n     have suffered as a result of the loss of these funds from the \n     system. The AMA has reported that the number of medical \n     school graduates indicating an interest in a research career \n     has fallen steadily in the 1990's. In addition, the number of \n     first time physician applicants to the National Institutes of \n     Health for research support has fallen by at least 20 percent \n     between 1994 and 1997. It is important that these downward \n     trends are stopped. These lost physician scientists represent \n     the next generation who will move basic science discoveries \n     to patients. We thank you for introducing the Clinical \n     Research Enhancement Act, an extremely modest investment in a \n     much-needed program to reinvigorate our nation's clinical \n     research capabilities.\n       There is a strong consensus among the 70 scientific and \n     consumer organizations that have endorsed this legislation \n     that Congress must stop the deterioration of the U.S. \n     clinical research capacity. In addition, we must assure that \n     the American people and the American economy benefit from the \n     translation of basic science breakthroughs to improved \n     clinical care and new medical products. The American \n     Federation for Medical Research is pleased to have the \n     opportunity to express its strong support for this important \n     piece of legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William Lowe, M.D.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n       Supporters of the Senate Clinical Research Enhancement Act\n\n       Academy of Radiology Research, Alliance for Aging Research, \n     Alzheimer's Association, Ambulatory Pediatric Association, \n     American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, American \n     Academy of Neurology, American Academy of Pediatrics, \n     American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, \n     American Academy of Optometry, American Academy of Orthopedic \n     Surgeons, American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck \n     Surgery, American Academy of Pediatrics, American Association \n     for Cancer Research, American Association for Dental \n     Research, American Association for the Study of Liver \n     Disease, American Association of Dental Schools, American \n     College of Cardiology, American College of \n     Neuropsychopharmacology, American College of Physicians--\n     American Society of Internal Medicine, American College of \n     Preventive Medicine.\n       American Federation for Medical Research, American Heart \n     Association, American Kidney Fund, American Pediatric \n     Society, American Podiatric Medical Association, American \n     Professors of Dermatology, American Society for Clinical \n     Pharmacology and Therapeutics, American Society for Clinical \n     Nutrition, American Society for Investigative Pathology, \n     American Society for Reproductive Medicine, American Society \n     for Addiction Medicine, American Society for Hematology, \n     American Urological Association, Arthritis Foundation, \n     Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, \n     Association of Academic Health Centers, Association of \n     American Cancer Institutes, Association of Departments of \n     Family Medicine, Association of Medical Schools Pediatric \n     Department Chairs, Association of Pathology Chairs.\n       Association of University Professors of Ophthalmology, \n     Citizens for Public Action, Coalition for American Trauma \n     Care, Coalition of Patient Advocates for Skin Disease \n     Research, College on Problems of Drug Dependence, Cooley's \n     Anemia Foundation, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, East Carolina \n     University School of Medicine, Epilepsy Foundation, \n     Federation of Behavioral, Psychological & Cognitive Sciences, \n     Friends of the National Institute of Dental Research, General \n     Clinical Research Centers Program Directors Association, \n     Jeffrey Modell Foundation, Medical Dermatology Society, \n     National Alopecia Areata Foundation.\n       National Caucus of Basic Biomedical Science Chairs, \n     National Health Council, National Hemophilia Foundation, \n     National Organization for Rare Disorders, National \n     Osteoporosis Foundation, New York University School of \n     Medicine, Research!

A bill to establish a system of registries of temporary \nagricultural workers to provide for a sufficient supply of such workers \nand to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to streamline \nprocedures for the admission and extension of stay of nonimmigrant \nagricultural workers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\nagricultural job opportunity benefits and security act of 1999 (agjobs)\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators \nGraham, Craig, Cleland, McConnell, Coverdell, Mack, Cochran, Helms, \nGrams, Crapo, Bunning, and Voinovich to introduce the Agricultural Job \nOpportunity Benefits and Security Act of 1999.\n  Our bill will reform the agricultural labor market, establish and \nmaintain immigration control, provide a legal workforce for our \nfarmers, and restore the dignity to the lives of thousands of \nfarmworkers who have helped make the U.S. economy the powerhouse that \nit is today. Indeed, these people, the farmers and farm workers, are \nmuch of the reason you and I are able to go home to a table full of \nfood.\n\n  In all of my legislative career--7 years now--I have never found an \nissue that as quickly moves off the merits and on to name-calling than \nthe issue of immigration. I was amazed and astounded at the things that \nwere said to me and my colleague from Oregon,\n\n[[Page S13276]]\n\nSenator Wyden, as we pursued this issue with the very best of motives \nlast year. Those things are said still. But I challenge anyone who \nwants to see a better life, I challenge them to defend the current \nsystem we have in this country for agricultural workers and farmers. We \ntake for granted when we go to the grocery store all the abundance that \nthere greets us, but we seldom take the time to think of those who \nhelped produce it and bring it to the market.\n  There is a shameful story to be told in this country when it comes to \nagricultural workers. What I am offering with all of my colleagues--my \nbipartisan colleagues--is a good-faith effort to make a bad situation \nmuch better and to get this country off an illegal system and on to a \nlegal system so farmers no longer need be felons and farm workers no \nlonger need to live in our shadows as fugitives.\n  A few years ago, the GAO issued a report. They said there is no \nworker shortage in agriculture. They said there is no worker shortage \nbecause we have all these illegal aliens here. As a consequence of \ndepending on an illegal system, these people who come--many from south \nof the border--are subject to the most inhumane treatment by coyotes in \nhuman form. These are people who prey upon their fears. These are \norganizations--even some who profess to be advocates--that hold them up \nfor money, subject them to physical abuse and even rape, and do so in \nthe name of providing labor. They are in business as long as we keep \nthis shameful system illegal.\n  How many people are we talking about? By some estimates, there are \n1.6 million illegal workers in agriculture in this country. These are \nthe people who are so often victimized. They will always be victimized \nas long as we keep them illegal.\n  Senator Graham, Senator Craig and I have tried to devise a way to \nhelp workers and farmers in three distinctive ways in the bills we have \nintroduced today. First, we provide an opportunity for an adjustment of \nstatus so when this bill becomes the law, any worker who can \ndemonstrate he or she has been in this country working in agriculture \nfor some period of time in the previous year can apply for an adjusted \nstatus which will give them immediate legal rights and put them on the \ncourse over the next 5 to 7 years to work in agriculture and earn \npermanent legal status, a green card. Their change of status from \nillegal to legal actually occurs immediately.\n  It was my experience as a person in business that those who got \namnesty immediately got a voice. As soon as they had a legal right to \nbe here, their conditions began to improve. The people who will argue \nagainst this bill somehow benefit--even profit--by keeping these people \nillegal and by being their voice. I don't think that serves their \ninterests based on what I saw in the private sector in the middle \n1980s.\n  What we are proposing is not amnesty. Some have said this is \nindentured servitude. The indentured servitude is the status quo. The \nindentured servitude are those who simply say keep them illegal, keep \nthem down, make sure they don't have the benefits that other workers in \nAmerica do, and we will somehow suggest we are on their side. The way \nout of indentured servitude is to give them a legal path to follow. \nThat is what Senator Graham, Senator Craig and I are doing.\n  The second part of our bill is to actually reform the H-2A program. \nTo demonstrate that, I have an application I filled out to become a \nSenator. It is two pages. I filled it out fairly quickly and persuaded \n51-plus percent of the people in Oregon to elect me to the Senate.\n\n  If I am a farmer and I need help, this is the manual that explains \nhow to fill out the application for one worker: It is hundreds of pages \nlong. The manual is unnumbered and covers a multitude of agencies in \nthe Federal Government, all of which have to sign off on every single \nforeign migrant worker. I am simply saying this program, H-2A, as we \nhave it now, is a manifest failure. It is a manifest failure because \nvery few people utilize it. All of the benefits promised by the current \nH-2A program go unfulfilled because everyone evades the law because the \nlaw doesn't work.\n  What Senator Graham, Senator Craig and I are proposing to do is to \ncreate a national registry that does not even kick in until all \ndomestic workers have right of first refusal. What it does is connect \nworkplaces and employers with employees who want to work on farms. It \nwill provide an opportunity even for organized labor to go to one \nplace, find out who wants to be there, who wants the job, and even \nassist them in organizing if they choose to do so.\n  I am not here to oppose organized labor. I am trying to help them, to \nsay there is a legal way to do this that will better serve the \ninterests of real people, and not the imaginary, hoped-for things that \nsome are claiming are possible, which are not possible.\n  Third, Senator Graham, Senator Craig and I are providing enhanced \nworker protections. Specifically, in this program, workers will get no \nless than the minimum wage, the prevailing wage, or the adverse effect \nwage rate which is 5 percent above the prevailing rate. This is our \nattempt to say that these people are due the basics of what American \ncitizens have. In addition to that, they will have transportation \nbenefits, housing benefits, and they will now be covered under the \nMigrant Seasonal Agricultural Protection Act in ways they were not \nbefore.\n  All of this is done because we are here to help. We reach out to all \nwho are in this disadvantaged situation who want to be legal, who want \na future, who want to pursue the American dream, and who want to do \nfarm work.\n  Some have suggested we are trying to flood this country with more \nillegal problems. I say on the floor of the Senate, I don't want one \nadditional worker, but I want those who are here to have a legal way to \nbe here. This isn't as if they are coming; they are already here. It is \na shameful situation when we can do nothing for them under law.\n  As this bill goes forward, lots of name-calling will go on, lots of \nmischaracterizations will be made. However, I ask my colleagues, I ask \nanyone interested in this issue, to read the bill this time and then \ntell the truth about it. Do not make it up because we have a problem. \nIt is a human problem. It affects farm workers and farmers and we owe \nthem something better than they have under U.S. law today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1814\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The \n     Secretary of State may consult with the Secretary of Labor in \n     carrying out this paragraph.\n       (2) Expedited consideration by secretary of state.--The \n     Secretary of State shall, as expeditiously as possible, but \n     not later than 5 days after the employer files an application \n     under paragraph (1), issue visas to, and the Attorney General \n     shall admit, a sufficient number of eligible aliens \n     designated by the employer to fill the job opportunities for \n     which the employer has applied under that paragraph, if the \n     employer has met the requirements of sections 301 and 302. \n     The employer shall be subject to the alien employment user \n     fee determined under section 404(b)(1)(B) with respect to \n     each job opportunity for which the Secretary of State \n     authorizes the issuance of a visa pursuant to paragraph (2).\n       (c) Redetermination of Need.--\n       (1) Requests for redetermination.--\n       (A) In general.--An employer may file a request for a \n     redetermination by the Secretary of the employer's need for \n     workers if--\n       (i) a worker referred from the registry is not at the place \n     of employment on the date of need shown on the application, \n     or the date the work for which the worker is needed has \n     begun, whichever is later;\n       (ii) the worker is not ready, willing, able, or qualified \n     to perform the work required; or\n       (iii) the worker abandons the employment or is terminated \n     for a lawful job-related reason.\n       (B) Additional authorization of admissions.--The Secretary \n     shall expeditiously, but in no case later than 72 hours after \n     a redetermination is requested under subparagraph (A), submit \n     a report to the Secretary of State and the Attorney General \n     providing notice of a need for workers under this subsection, \n     if the employer has met the requirements of sections 301 and \n     302 and the conditions described in subparagraph (A).\n       (2) Job-related requirements.--An employer shall not be \n     required to initially employ a worker who fails to meet \n     lawful job-related employment criteria, nor to continue the \n     employment of a worker who fails to meet lawful, job-related \n     standards of conduct and performance, including failure to \n     meet minimum production standards after a 3-day break-in \n     period.\n       (d) Emergency Applications.--Notwithstanding subsections \n     (b) and (c), the Secretary may promptly transmit a report to \n     the Attorney General and Secretary of State providing notice \n     of a need for workers under this subsection for an employer--\n       (1) who has not employed aliens under this Act in the \n     occupation in question in the prior year's agricultural \n     season;\n       (2) who faces an unforeseen need for workers (as determined \n     by the Secretary); and\n       (3) with respect to whom the Secretary cannot refer able, \n     willing, and qualified workers from the registry who will \n     commit to be at the employer's place of employment and ready \n     for work within 72 hours or on the date the work for which \n     the worker is needed has begun, whichever is later.\n     The employer shall be subject to the alien employment user \n     fee determined under section 404(b)(1)(B) with respect to \n     each job opportunity for which a notice of insufficient \n     workers is made pursuant to this subsection.\n       (e) Regulations.--The Secretary of State shall prescribe \n     regulations to provide for the designation of aliens under \n     this section.\n\n     SEC. 304. EMPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Required Wages.--\n       (1) In general.--An employer applying under section 301(a) \n     for workers shall offer to pay, and shall pay, all workers in \n     the occupation or occupations for which the employer has \n     applied for workers from the registry, not less (and is not \n     required to pay more) than the greater of the prevailing wage \n     in the occupation in the area of intended employment or the \n     adverse effect wage rate. No worker shall be paid less than \n     the greater of the hourly wage prescribed under section \n     6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. \n     206(a)(1)), or the applicable State minimum wage.\n       (2) Payment of prevailing wage determined by a state \n     employment security agency sufficient.--In complying with \n     paragraph (1), an employer may request and obtain a \n     prevailing wage determination from the State employment \n     security agency. If the employer requests such a \n     determination, and pays the wage required by paragraph (1) \n     based upon such a determination, such payment shall be \n     considered sufficient to meet the requirement of paragraph \n     (1).\n       (3) Reliance on wage survey.--In lieu of the procedure of \n     paragraph (2), an employer may rely on other information, \n     such as an employer-generated prevailing wage survey that the \n     Secretary determines meets criteria specified by the \n     Secretary in regulations.\n       (4) Alternative methods of payment permitted.--\n       (A) In general.--A prevailing wage may be expressed as an \n     hourly wage, a piece rate, a task rate, or other incentive \n     payment method, including a group rate. The requirement to \n     pay at least the prevailing wage in the occupation and area \n     of intended employment does not require an employer to pay by \n     the method of pay in which the prevailing rate is expressed, \n     except that, if the employer adopts a method of pay other \n     than the prevailing rate, the burden of proof is on the \n     employer to demonstrate that the employer's method of pay is \n     designed to produce earnings equivalent to the earnings that \n     would result from payment of the prevailing rate.\n       (B) Compliance when paying an incentive rate.--In the case \n     of an employer that pays a piece rate or task rate or uses \n     any other incentive payment method, including a group rate, \n     the employer shall be considered to be in compliance with any \n     applicable hourly wage requirement if the average of the \n     hourly earnings of the workers, taken as a group, in the \n     activity for which a piece rate, task rate, or other \n     incentive payment, including a group rate, is paid, for the \n     pay period, is at least equal to the required hourly wage, \n     except that no worker shall be paid less than the hourly wage \n     prescribed under section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards \n     Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206(a)(1)) or the applicable State \n     minimum wage.\n       (C) Task rate.--For purposes of this paragraph, the term \n     ``task rate'' means an incentive payment method based on a \n     unit of work performed such that the incentive rate varies \n     with the level of effort required to perform individual units \n     of work.\n\n[[Page S13282]]\n\n       (D) Group rate.--For purposes of this paragraph, the term \n     ``group rate'' means an incentive payment method in which the \n     payment is shared among a group of workers working together \n     to perform the task.\n       (b) Requirement To Provide Housing.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Requirement.--An employer applying under section 301(a) \n     for registered workers shall offer to provide housing at no \n     cost (except for charges permitted by paragraph (5)) to all \n     workers employed in job opportunities to which the employer \n     has applied under that section, and to all other workers in \n     the same occupation at the place of employment, whose place \n     of residence is beyond normal commuting distance.\n       (B) Liability.--An employer not complying with subparagraph \n     (A) shall be liable to a registered worker for the costs of \n     housing equivalent to the type of housing required to be \n     provided under that subparagraph and shall not be liable for \n     any employment-related obligation solely by reason of such \n     noncompliance.\n       (2) Type of housing.--In complying with paragraph (1), an \n     employer may, at the employer's election, provide housing \n     that meets applicable Federal standards for temporary labor \n     camps or secure housing that meets applicable local standards \n     for rental or public accommodation housing or other \n     substantially similar class of habitation, or, in the absence \n     of applicable local standards, State standards for rental or \n     public accommodation housing or other substantially similar \n     class of habitation.\n       (3) Workers engaged in the range production of livestock.--\n     The Secretary shall issue regulations that address the \n     specific requirements for the provision of housing to workers \n     engaged in the range production of livestock.\n       (4) Limitation.--Nothing in this subsection shall be \n     construed to require an employer to provide or secure housing \n     for persons who were not entitled to such housing under the \n     temporary labor certification regulations in effect on June \n     1, 1986.\n       (5) Charges for housing.--\n       (A) Utilities and maintenance.--An employer who provides \n     housing to a worker pursuant to paragraph (1) may charge an \n     amount equal to the fair market value (but not greater than \n     the employer's actual cost) for maintenance and utilities, or \n     such lesser amount as permitted by law.\n       (B) Security deposit.--An employer who provides housing to \n     workers pursuant to paragraph (1) may require, as a condition \n     for providing such housing, a deposit not to exceed $50 from \n     workers occupying such housing to protect against gross \n     negligence or willful destruction of property.\n       (C) Damages.--An employer who provides housing to workers \n     pursuant to paragraph (1) may require a worker found to have \n     been responsible for damage to such housing which is not the \n     result of normal wear and tear related to habitation to \n     reimburse the employer for the reasonable cost of repair of \n     such damage.\n       (6) Housing allowance as alternative.--\n       (A) In general.--In lieu of offering housing pursuant to \n     paragraph (1), the employer may provide a reasonable housing \n     allowance during the 3-year period beginning on the date of \n     enactment of this Act. After the expiration of that period \n     such allowance may be provided only if the requirement of \n     subparagraph (B) is satisfied or, in the case of a \n     certification under subparagraph (B) that is expired, the \n     requirement of subparagraph (C) is satisfied. Upon the \n     request of a worker seeking assistance in locating housing, \n     the employer shall make a good faith effort to assist the \n     worker in identifying and locating housing in the area of \n     intended employment. An employer who offers a housing \n     allowance to a worker, or assists a worker in locating \n     housing which the worker occupies, pursuant to this \n     subparagraph shall not be deemed to be a housing provider \n     under section 203 of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural \n     Worker Protection Act (29 U.S.C. 1823) solely by virtue of \n     providing such housing allowance.\n       (B) Certification.--The requirement of this subparagraph is \n     satisfied if the Governor of the State certifies to the \n     Secretary that there is adequate housing available in an area \n     of intended employment for migrant farm workers, aliens \n     provided status pursuant to this Act, or nonimmigrant aliens \n     described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the Immigration \n     and Nationality Act, who are seeking temporary housing while \n     employed at farm work. Such certification shall expire after \n     3 years unless renewed by the Governor of the State.\n       (C) Effect of certification.--Notwithstanding the \n     expiration of a certification under subparagraph (B) with \n     respect to an area of intended employment, a housing \n     allowance described in subparagraph (A) may be offered for up \n     to one year after the date of expiration.\n       (D) Amount of allowance.--The amount of a housing allowance \n     under this paragraph shall be equal to the statewide average \n     fair market rental for existing housing for nonmetropolitan \n     counties for the State in which the employment occurs, as \n     established by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development \n     pursuant to section 8(c) of the United States Housing Act of \n     1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(c)), based on a 2-bedroom dwelling unit \n     and an assumption of 2 persons per bedroom.\n       (c) Reimbursement of Transportation.--\n       (1) To place of employment.--A worker who is referred to a \n     job opportunity under section 302(a), or an alien employed \n     pursuant to this Act, who completes 50 percent of the period \n     of employment of the job opportunity for which the worker was \n     hired, shall be reimbursed by the employer for the cost of \n     the worker's transportation and subsistence from the worker's \n     permanent place of residence (or place of last employment, if \n     the worker traveled from such place) to the place of \n     employment to which the worker was referred under section \n     302(a).\n       (2) From place of employment.--A worker who is referred to \n     a job opportunity under section 302(a), or an alien employed \n     pursuant to this Act, who completes the period of employment \n     for the job opportunity involved, shall be reimbursed by the \n     employer for the cost of the worker's transportation and \n     subsistence from the place of employment to the worker's \n     place of residence, or to the place of next employment, if \n     the worker has contracted with a subsequent employer who has \n     not agreed to provide or pay for the worker's transportation \n     and subsistence to such subsequent employer's place of \n     employment.\n       (3) Limitation.--\n       (A) Amount of reimbursement.--Except as provided in \n     subparagraph (B), the amount of reimbursement provided under \n     paragraph (1) or (2) to a worker or alien shall not exceed \n     the lesser of--\n       (i) the actual cost to the worker or alien of the \n     transportation and subsistence involved; or\n       (ii) the most economical and reasonable common carrier \n     transportation charges and subsistence costs for the distance \n     involved.\n       (B) Distance traveled.--No reimbursement under paragraph \n     (1) or (2) shall be required if the distance traveled is 100 \n     miles or less, or the worker is not residing in employer-\n     provided housing or housing secured through a voucher as \n     provided in subsection (b)(6).\n       (C) Place of recruitment.--For the purpose of the \n     reimbursement required under paragraph (1) or (2) to aliens \n     admitted pursuant to this Act, the alien's place of residence \n     shall be deemed to be the place where the alien was issued \n     the visa authorizing admission to the United States or, if no \n     visa was required, the place from which the alien departed \n     the foreign country to travel to the United States.\n       (d) Continuing Obligation To Employ United States \n     Workers.--\n       (1) In general.--An employer that applies for registered \n     workers under section 301(a) shall, as a condition for the \n     approval of such application, continue to offer employment to \n     qualified, eligible United States workers who are referred \n     under section 302(b) after the employer receives the report \n     described in section 302(b).\n       (2) Limitation.--An employer shall not be obligated to \n     comply with paragraph (1)--\n       (A) after 50 percent of the anticipated period of \n     employment shown on the employer's application under section \n     301(a) has elapsed; or\n       (B) during any period in which the employer is employing no \n     H-2A workers in the occupation for which the United States \n     worker was referred; or\n       (C) during any period when the Secretary is conducting a \n     search of a registry for workers in the occupation and area \n     of intended employment to which the worker has been referred, \n     or in other occupations in the area of intended employment \n     for which the worker that has been referred is qualified and \n     that offer substantially similar terms and conditions of \n     employment.\n       (3) Limitation on requirement to provide housing.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, an employer \n     to whom a registered worker is referred pursuant to paragraph \n     (1) may provide a reasonable housing allowance to such \n     referred worker in lieu of providing housing if the employer \n     does not have sufficient housing to accommodate the referred \n     worker and all other workers for whom the employer is \n     providing housing or has committed to provide housing.\n       (4) Referral of workers during 50-percent period.--The \n     Secretary shall make all reasonable efforts to place a \n     registered worker in an open job acceptable to the worker, \n     including available jobs not listed on the registry, before \n     referring such worker to an employer for a job opportunity \n     already filled by, or committed to, an alien admitted \n     pursuant to this Act.\n\n     SEC. 305.

Upon approval of an application for an \n     extension of stay or change in the alien's authorized \n     employment, the Attorney General shall provide a new or \n     updated employment eligibility document to the alien \n     indicating the new validity date, after which the alien is \n     not required to retain a copy of the application.\n       ``(D) Limitation on employment authorization of aliens \n     without valid identification and employment eligibility \n     card.--An expired identification and employment eligibility \n     document, together with a copy of an application for \n     extension of stay or change in the alien's authorized \n     employment that complies with the requirements of \n     subparagraph (A), shall constitute a valid work authorization \n     document for a period of not more than 60 days from the date \n     of application for the extension of stay, after which time \n     only a currently valid identification and employment \n     eligibility document shall be acceptable.\n       ``(E) Limitation on an individual's stay in status.--An \n     alien having status under this section may not have the \n     status extended for a continuous period longer than 3 years \n     unless the alien remains outside the United States for an \n     uninterrupted period of 6 months. An absence from the United \n     States may break the continuity of the period for which a \n     nonimmigrant visa issued under section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) \n     is valid. If the alien has resided in the United States 10 \n     months or less, an absence breaks the continuity of the \n     period if it lasts for at least 2 months. If the alien has \n     resided in the United States 10 months or more, an absence \n     breaks the continuity of the period if it lasts for at least \n     one-fifth the duration of the stay.\n       ``(b) Study by the Attorney General.--The Attorney General \n     shall conduct a study to determine whether aliens under this \n     section depart the United States in a timely manner upon the \n     expiration of their period of authorized stay. If the \n     Attorney General finds that a significant number of aliens do \n     not so depart and that withholding a portion of the aliens' \n     wages to be refunded upon timely departure is necessary as an \n     inducement to assure such departure, then the Attorney \n     General shall so report to Congress and make recommendations \n     on appropriate courses of action.''.\n       (b) No Family Members Permitted.--Section 101(a)(15)(H) of \n     the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)) \n     is amended by striking ``specified in this paragraph'' and \n     inserting ``specified in this subparagraph (other than in \n     clause (ii)(a))''.\n       (c) Range Production of Livestock.--Nothing in this title \n     shall preclude the Secretary of Labor and the Attorney \n     General from continuing to apply special procedures to the \n     employment, admission, and extension of aliens in the range \n     production of livestock.\n\n                   TITLE IV--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. 401.

Complaints may be \n     filed by any aggrieved person or any organization (including \n     bargaining representatives). No investigation or hearing \n     shall be conducted on a complaint concerning such a failure \n     or misrepresentation unless the complaint was filed not later \n     than 12 months after the date of the failure or \n     misrepresentation, as the case may be. The Secretary shall \n     conduct an investigation under this paragraph if there is \n     reasonable cause to believe that such a failure or \n     misrepresentation has occurred.\n       (B) Expedited investigation of serious child labor, wage, \n     and housing violations.--The Secretary shall complete an \n     investigation and issue a written determination as to whether \n     or not a violation has been committed within 10 days of the \n     receipt of a complaint pursuant to subparagraph (A) if there \n     is reasonable cause to believe that any of the following \n     serious violations have occurred:\n       (i) A violation of section 12(c) of the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 212(c)).\n       (ii) A failure to make a wage payment, except that \n     complaints alleging that an\n\n[[Page S13284]]\n\n     amount less than the wages due has been paid shall be handled \n     pursuant to subparagraph (A).\n       (iii) A failure to provide the housing allowance required \n     under section 304(b)(6).\n       (iv) Providing housing pursuant to section 304(b)(1) that \n     fails to comply with standards under section 304(b)(2) and \n     which poses an immediate threat of serious bodily injury or \n     death to workers.\n       (C) Statutory construction.--Nothing in this Act limits the \n     authority of the Secretary of Labor to conduct any compliance \n     investigation under any other labor law, including any law \n     affecting migrant and seasonal agricultural workers or, in \n     the absence of a complaint under this paragraph, under this \n     Act.\n       (2) Written notice of finding and opportunity for appeal.--\n     After an investigation has been conducted, the Secretary \n     shall issue a written determination as to whether or not any \n     violation described in subsection (b) has been committed. The \n     Secretary's determination shall be served on the complainant \n     and the employer, and shall provide an opportunity for an \n     appeal of the Secretary's decision to an administrative law \n     judge, who may conduct a de novo hearing.\n       (3) Ability of alien workers to change employers.--\n       (A) In general.--Pending the completion of an investigation \n     pursuant to paragraph (1)(A), the Secretary may permit the \n     transfer of an aggrieved person who has filed a complaint \n     under such paragraph to an employer that--\n       (i) has been approved to employ workers under this Act; and\n       (ii) agrees to accept the person for employment.\n       (B) Replacement worker.--An aggrieved person may not be \n     transferred under subparagraph (A) until such time as the \n     employer from whom the person is to be transferred receives a \n     requested replacement worker referred by a registry pursuant \n     to section 302 of this Act or provided status under section \n     101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n       (C) Limitation.--An employer from whom an aggrieved person \n     has been transferred under this paragraph shall have no \n     obligation to reimburse the person for the cost of \n     transportation prior to the completion of the period of \n     employment referred to in section 304(c).\n       (D) Voluntary transfer.--Notwithstanding this paragraph, an \n     employer may voluntarily agree to transfer a worker to \n     another employer that--\n       (i) has been approved to employ workers under this Act; and\n       (ii) agrees to accept the person for employment.\n       (b) Remedies.--\n       (1) Back wages.--Upon a final determination that the \n     employer has failed to pay wages as required under this \n     section, the Secretary may assess payment of back wages due \n     to any United States worker or alien described in section \n     101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     employed by the employer in the specific employment in \n     question. The back wages shall be equal to the difference \n     between the amount that should have been paid and the amount \n     that actually was paid to such worker.\n       (2) Failure to pay wages.--Upon a final determination that \n     the employer has failed to pay the wages required under this \n     Act, the Secretary may assess a civil money penalty up to \n     $1,000 for each person for whom the employer failed to pay \n     the required wage, and may recommend to the Attorney General \n     the disqualification of the employer from the employment of \n     aliens described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act for a period of time \n     determined by the Secretary not to exceed 1 year.\n       (3) Other violations.--If the Secretary, as a result of an \n     investigation pursuant to a complaint, determines that an \n     employer covered by an application under section 401(a) has--\n       (A) filed an application that misrepresents a material \n     fact;\n       (B) failed to meet a condition specified in section 401; or\n       (C) committed a serious violation of subsection (a)(1)(B),\n     the Secretary may seek a cease and desist order and assess a \n     civil money penalty not to exceed $1,000 for each violation \n     and may recommend to the Attorney General the \n     disqualification of the employer if the Secretary finds it to \n     be a substantial misrepresentation or violation of the \n     requirements for the employment of any United States workers \n     or aliens described in section 101(a)(15)(ii)(a) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act for a period of time \n     determined by the Secretary not to exceed 1 year. In \n     determining the amount of civil money penalty to be assessed \n     or whether to recommend disqualification of the employer, the \n     Secretary shall consider the seriousness of the violation, \n     the good faith of the employer, the size of the business of \n     the employer being charged, the history of previous \n     violations by the employer, whether the employer obtained a \n     financial gain from the violation, whether the violation was \n     willful, and other relevant factors.\n       (4) Expanded program disqualification.--\n       (A) 3 years for second violation.--Upon a second final \n     determination that an employer has failed to pay the wages \n     required under this Act, or a second final determination that \n     the employer has committed another substantial violation \n     under paragraph (3) in the same category of violations, with \n     respect to the same alien, the Secretary shall report such \n     determination to the Attorney General and the Attorney \n     General shall disqualify the employer from the employment of \n     aliens described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act for a period of 3 years.\n       (B) Permanent for third violation.--Upon a third final \n     determination that an employer has failed to pay the wages \n     required under this section or committed other substantial \n     violations under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall report \n     such determination to the Attorney General, and the Attorney \n     General shall disqualify the employer from any subsequent \n     employment of aliens described in section \n     101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n       (c) Role of Associations.--\n       (1) Violation by a member of an association.--An employer \n     on whose behalf an application is filed by an association \n     acting as its agent is fully responsible for such \n     application, and for complying with the terms and conditions \n     of this Act, as though the employer had filed the application \n     itself. If such an employer is determined to have violated a \n     requirement of this section, the penalty for such violation \n     shall be assessed against the employer who committed the \n     violation and not against the association or other members of \n     the association.\n       (2) Violation by an association acting as an employer.--If \n     an association filing an application on its own behalf as an \n     employer is determined to have committed a violation under \n     this subsection which results in disqualification from the \n     program under subsection (b), no individual member of such \n     association may be the beneficiary of the services of an \n     alien described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act in an occupation in which \n     such alien was employed by the association during the period \n     such disqualification is in effect, unless such member files \n     an application as an individual employer or such application \n     is filed on the employer's behalf by an association with \n     which the employer has an agreement that the employer will \n     comply with the requirements of this Act.\n       (d) Study of Agricultural Labor Standards and \n     Enforcement.--\n       (1) Commission on housing migrant agricultural workers.--\n       (A) Establishment.--There is established the Commission on \n     Housing Migrant Agricultural Workers (in this paragraph \n     referred to as the ``Commission'').\n       (B) Composition.--The Commission shall consist of 12 \n     members, as follows:\n       (i) Four representatives of agricultural employers and one \n     representative of the Department of Agriculture, each \n     appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture.\n       (ii) Four representatives of agricultural workers and one \n     representative of the Department of Labor, each appointed by \n     the Secretary of Labor.\n       (iii) One State or local official knowledgeable about \n     farmworker housing and one representative of Housing and \n     Urban Development, each appointed by the Secretary of Housing \n     and Urban Development.\n       (C) Functions.--The Commission shall conduct a study of the \n     problem of in-season housing for migrant agricultural \n     workers.\n       (D) Interim reports.--The Commission may at any time submit \n     interim reports to Congress describing the findings made up \n     to that time with respect to the study conducted under \n     subparagraph (C).\n       (E) Final report.--Not later than 3 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Commission shall submit a report \n     to Congress setting forth the findings of the study conducted \n     under subparagraph (C).\n       (F) Termination date.--The Commission shall terminate upon \n     filing its final report.\n       (2) Study of relationship between child care and child \n     labor.--The Secretaries of Labor, Agriculture, and Health and \n     Human Services shall jointly conduct a study of the issues \n     relating to child care of migrant agricultural workers. Such \n     study shall address issues related to the adequacy of \n     educational and day care services for migrant children and \n     the relationship, if any, of child care needs and child labor \n     violations in agriculture. An evaluation of migrant and \n     seasonal Head Start programs (as defined in section 637(12) \n     of the Head Start Act) as they relate to these issues shall \n     be included as a part of the study.\n       (3) Study of field sanitation.--The Secretary of Labor and \n     the Secretary of Agriculture shall jointly conduct a study \n     regarding current field sanitation standards in agriculture \n     and evaluate alternative approaches and innovations that may \n     further compliance with such standards.\n       (4) Study of coordinated and targeted labor standards \n     enforcement.--The Secretary, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of Agriculture, shall conduct a study of the most \n     persistent and serious labor standards violations in \n     agriculture and evaluate the most effective means of \n     coordinating enforcement efforts between Federal and State \n     officials. The study shall place primary emphasis on the \n     means by which Federal and State authorities, in consultation \n     with representatives of workers and agricultural employers, \n     may develop more effective methods of targeting resources at \n     repeated and egregious violators of labor standards. The \n     study also shall consider ways of facilitating expanded \n     education among agricultural employers and workers regarding \n     compliance with labor standards and evaluate means of \n     broadening such education on a cooperative basis among \n     employers and workers.\n\n[[Page S13285]]\n\n       (5) Report.--Not later than 3 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, with respect to each study required to \n     be conducted under paragraphs (2) through (4), the Secretary \n     or group of Secretaries required to conduct the study shall \n     submit to Congress a report setting forth the findings of the \n     study.\n\n     SEC. 402. BILATERAL COMMISSIONS.\n\n       The Attorney General is authorized and requested to \n     establish a bilateral commission between the United States \n     and each country not less than 10,000 nationals of which are \n     nonimmigrant aliens described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) \n     of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a)). Such bilateral commissions shall \n     provide a forum to the governments involved to discuss \n     matters of mutual concern regarding the program for the \n     admission of aliens under section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\n     SEC. 403.

DETERMINATION AND USE OF USER FEES.\n\n       (a) Schedule of Fees.--The Secretary of Labor shall \n     establish and periodically adjust a schedule for the registry \n     user fee and the alien employment user fee imposed under this \n     Act, and a collection process for such fees from employers \n     participating in the programs provided under this Act. Such \n     fees shall be the only fees chargeable to employers for \n     services provided under this Act.\n       (b) Determination of Schedule.--\n       (1) In general.--The schedule under subsection (a) shall \n     reflect a fee rate based on the number of job opportunities \n     indicated in an employer's application under section \n     301(a)(1)(C) and sufficient to provide for the reimbursement \n     of the direct costs of providing the following services:\n       (A) Registry user fee.--Services provided through the \n     agricultural worker registries established under section \n     301(a), including registration, referral, and validation, but \n     not including services that would otherwise be provided by \n     the Secretary of Labor under related or similar programs if \n     such registries had not been established.\n       (B) Alien employment user fee.--Services related to an \n     employer's authorization to employ eligible aliens pursuant \n     to this Act, including the establishment and certification of \n     eligible employers, the issuance of documentation, and the \n     admission of eligible aliens.\n       (2) Procedure.--\n       (A) In general.--In establishing and adjusting such \n     schedule, the Secretary of Labor shall comply with Federal \n     cost accounting and fee setting standards.\n       (B) Publication and comment.--The Secretary of Labor shall \n     publish in the Federal Register an initial fee schedule and \n     associated collection process and the cost data or estimates \n     upon which such fee schedule is based, and any subsequent \n     amendments thereto, pursuant to which public comment will be \n     sought and a final rule issued.\n       (c) Use of Proceeds.--\n       (1) In general.--All proceeds resulting from the payment of \n     registry user fees and alien employment user fees shall be \n     available without further appropriation and shall remain \n     available without fiscal year limitation to reimburse the \n     Secretaries of Labor, State, and Agriculture, and the \n     Attorney General for the costs of carrying out section 218 of \n     the Immigration and Nationality Act and the provisions of \n     this Act.\n       (2) Limitation on enforcement costs.--In making a \n     determination of reimbursable costs under paragraph (1), the \n     Secretary of Labor shall provide that reimbursement of the \n     costs of enforcement under section 401 shall not exceed 10 \n     percent of the direct costs of the Secretary described in \n     subsection (b)(1) (A) and (B).\n\n     SEC. 405.

REPORT TO CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Requirement.--Not later than 4 years after the \n     effective date under section 408, the Resources, Community \n     and Economic Development Division, and the Health, Education \n     and Human Services Division, of the Office of the Comptroller \n     General of the United States shall jointly prepare and \n     transmit to the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on the Judiciary of the \n     Senate a report describing the results of a review of the \n     implementation of and compliance with this Act. The report \n     shall address--\n       (1) whether the program has ensured an adequate and timely \n     supply of qualified, eligible workers at the time and place \n     needed by employers;\n       (2) whether the program has ensured that aliens admitted \n     under this program are employed only in authorized \n     employment, and that they timely depart the United States \n     when their authorized stay ends;\n       (3) whether the program has ensured that participating \n     employers comply with the requirements of the program with \n     respect to the employment of United States workers and aliens \n     admitted under this program;\n       (4) whether the program has ensured that aliens admitted \n     under this program are not displacing eligible, qualified \n     United States workers or diminishing the wages and other \n     terms and conditions of employment of eligible United States \n     workers;\n       (5) to the extent practicable, compare the wages and other \n     terms of employment of eligible United States workers and \n     aliens employed under this program with the wages and other \n     terms of employment of agricultural workers who are not \n     authorized to work in the United States;\n       (6) whether the housing provisions of this program ensure \n     that adequate housing is available to workers employed under \n     this program who are required to be provided housing or a \n     housing allowance;\n       (7) recommendations for improving the operation of the \n     program for the benefit of participating employers, eligible \n     United States workers, participating aliens, and governmental \n     agencies involved in administering the program; and\n       (8) recommendations for the continuation or termination of \n     the program under this Act.\n       (b) Advisory Board.--There shall be established an advisory \n     board to be composed of--\n       (1) four representatives of agricultural employers to be \n     appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture, including \n     individuals who have experience with the H-2A program; and\n       (2) four representatives of agricultural workers to be \n     appointed by the Secretary of Labor, including individuals \n     who have experience with the H-2A program,\n     to provide advice to the Comptroller General in the \n     preparation of the reports required under subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 407. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       (a) In General.--This Act and the amendments made by this \n     Act shall become effective on the date that is 1 year after \n     the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall prepare and submit \n     to the appropriate committees of Congress a report that \n     described the measures being taken and the progress made in \n     implementing this Act.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to recognize our Presiding Officer \nwho is also one of the stalwart advocates of this reform in \nagricultural farm labor, as well as the Senator from Oregon who has \ngiven such leadership on this issue.\n  In my opinion, those voices who you anticipate will decry the \nproposals we are making have to carry the burden of defending the \nstatus quo. In my opinion, that is an impossible defense. What has the \nstatus quo led to in this country? It has led to over 600,000 people \nwho pick the fruits and vegetables upon which American families depend, \nupon which much of our agricultural economy is relying--600,000-plus of \nthose persons ranging between a third and a half of all of the migrant \nworkers in the country are illegal. They are here without documents. \nThey are here without any legal status. Can we call the current system \na humane system when it puts 600,000 people in the shadows of our \nsociety because they are without legal status or legal protection? I \nthink not.\n  It is also a system which denies benefits, ironically, to U.S. \ncitizens and U.S. legal permanent residents who work as migrants in \nAmerican agriculture, which we make available to non-U.S. citizens who \ncome here under a temporary work visa that we call a H-2A visa. For \ninstance, we provide transportation assistance to foreign visa workers \nthat we do not provide to U.S. citizens. We provide housing benefits to \nforeign workers that we do not provide to U.S. citizens. We provide \neven a higher wage rate, a higher base salary to foreign visa workers \nthan we do to U.S. citizens who work as migrant workers in American \nagriculture.\n  We also have a system which is--to say antiquated is to give it a \nstatus that is beyond justification. We are using a system that is \nbureaucratic, that does not apply contemporary methods of technology, \ncommunication, which, while it approves some 90 percent of the \npetitions that are filed to make it possible for those non-U.S.\n\n[[Page S13286]]\n\nvisa workers to come into the United States, oftentimes the delay in \ngetting that ultimate approval is so extended that by the time the \napproval arrives the crops have already rotted in the field.\n  Anyone who wishes to attack our ideas, I think, has the burden of \neither attempting to defend a clearly--not broken but smashed status \nquo, and then to come forward with their own ideas. A few days ago, \nSenator Wyden and the Presiding Officer and myself offered an amendment \nto a Department of Labor appropriations bill in which we directed that \nthe administration should come forward with its ideas as to how to \ncorrect the broken status quo of migrant farm labor in America. We look \nforward to receiving that response. We have been asking for that \nresponse for the better part of 2 to 3 years.\n  I hope now that we are on the verge of introducing legislation, we \nwill see an engagement by all the parties who have professed an \ninterest in this issue so we can get their ideas. We do not believe, as \nthoughtful as we hope this legislation will be seen, that it came down \nfrom the mountain on plates of stone. It is the product of our best \nhuman effort and we invite others who have their ideas to participate \nin this process. But I believe we can all start from the fundamental \nposition that the status quo is inhumane, illegal, and unacceptable to \nthe United States of America as a great nation entering the 21st \ncentury.\n  The legislation we are introducing--and we are actually introducing \ntwo pieces of legislation--the first is the Agricultural Job \nOpportunity Benefits and Security Act of 1999, which we intend to \nacronym into AG-JOBS, which is the comprehensive bill which includes \nall the elements the Presiding Officer outlined in his introductory \nremarks. We will then introduce a second bill which will be called the \nFarm Worker Adjustment Act of 1999, which will include only those \nprovisions that relate to the adjustment of status by the some 600,000 \nundocumented aliens who are currently in the United States.\n  We invite our colleagues to consider both of these pieces of \nlegislation. We hope they would be inclined to cosponsor both of these \npieces of legislation.\n  What would be the consequence of passage of the legislation that we \nintroduce this evening? What would be the consequences, first, for farm \nworkers? Farm workers would receive better wages. Instead of having as \nthe base the minimum wage, the base, as the Presiding Officer \nindicated, would be the greater of the minimum wage or the adverse wage \nrate plus 5 percent. In my State of Florida, the current calculation of \nthe adverse wage rate plus 5 percent would be approximately $7.45, as \ncompared to the current minimum wage of $5.15.\n  Second, domestic farm workers, U.S. citizens, and permanent \nresidents, as well as those who would have the temporary work permits \nunder the adjustment of status legislation, would all be entitled to \nhousing, either housing onsite or, if it were determined by the \nGovernor of the State there was adequate housing in the vicinity of the \nagricultural work site, it could be a housing allowance, a voucher \nwhich would allow the farm worker to select their own places to live.\n  It would also provide for the first time for domestic workers, \ncitizens, permanent residents, and temporary work permit holders, \naccess to a transportation allowance. If they had to go more than 100 \nmiles to get from one job to the next, they would be entitled to \ncompensation for their transportation. They would also receive the \nbenefits of some modern technology. Just as we currently have a worker \nregistry system for much of nonagricultural employment in America, this \nwould provide a computer registry for agricultural workers where they \ncan indicate: I am prepared to work in the following crops. I am \nprepared to work in the following locations and during the following \ntime periods of the year. They would be permanently registered, so when \na farmer was looking for workers who met those criteria, he would find \nthis employee's name and a means by which to access that potential \nworker.\n  We would increase worker protection. Farm workers would now be \ncovered by the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act. \nWe would not have this shadow workforce of 600,000 people without legal \nprotection.\n  There would be stricter penalties for employers who failed to follow \nthe law. Employers could be barred from the H-2A program, including a \npermanent bar for violations of the rights of workers.\n  The legal status would be available to all of the persons. They would \neither be working as a citizen, a permanent resident, a holder of a \ntemporary work permit, or an H-2A visa. But our goal would be to create \na situation, both legally and economically, in which all of the persons \npicking the fruits and vegetables in America's fields would be legal.\n  How would the farmers benefit? The farmers would have access to this \nefficient, modern, streamlined register as a means of determining who \nis available to do the work that I need.\n  They would have assurance that all of their workers were legal. We \nhave had situations in the last few months in which there were raids on \nfields--Vidalia onion fields in Georgia, fruit fields in the Pacific \nNorthwest where persons who could not show they had documents--and many \ncould not--were arrested, where the farmer was put into a situation \nthat his livelihood, his crop for the year was about to be lost because \nhe would not have the people necessary to harvest the food.\n  We would also provide to the farmer the assurance that there would be \na streamlined means by which, if necessary, they could access non-U.S. \nworkers to assure they had a full complement of workers to carry out \nthe task.\n  Mr. President, you have stated with force and eloquence the rationale \nfor this legislation and what we hope to accomplish. I hope in the vein \nwithin which you entered this to ask our colleagues to carefully \nconsider this legislation, particularly in the context of the \nunacceptable status quo. We look forward to engaging with their ideas \nand the ideas of others who have an interest in this issue so that this \nsession of Congress will have as one of its achievements the closure of \na chapter of inhumane abuse of hundreds of thousands of people and a \ndenial to American agriculture of what it wants--a legal, humanely \ntreated agricultural workforce to pick the fruits and vegetables upon \nwhich our Nation depends.\n  I join with you and our colleagues as we start this effort this \nevening and will shortly be sending to the desk the legislation on the \nadjustment of status of agricultural workers.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have had the privilege of listening \ntonight to both you and the Senator from Florida discuss the \nintroduction of what we call ag jobs. I must tell you that I am pleased \nto join with you as a shaper and an original cosponsor of this \nlegislation because both you and Senator Graham have so clearly \noutlined a fundamental human problem in our country that the Department \nof Labor refuses to look at with any creative form of resolution and \nfor which America's agricultural base pleads for a resolution.\n  In the mid-1960s, I had the great privilege of serving as a national \nofficer of the Future Farmers of America. During that year, I traveled \nthe length and the breadth of America in behalf of American \nagriculture. From the beautiful green pea fields of eastern Oregon to \nthe San Joaquin Valley of California where cotton was in abundance to \nthe orange groves of Florida just at the time they were blooming, the \none thing that was constantly present was a migrant farm labor force, \nworking with those in production agriculture to pollinate, to weed, to \nthin, and, most important, to harvest the abundance of American \nagriculture.\n  During that year when I was traveling, I often gave speeches that \nsaid the American farmer produces enough for himself or herself and 55 \nother Americans. We, as Americans, were tremendously proud of that \nstatistic.\n  Today, if I were making the same trip, I would say that the American \nfarmer produces enough for himself or herself and 155 Americans and \nanother 100 foreign mouths. Oh, we are so tremendously proud of \nAmerica's productive capability. One of the reasons we are proud is not \nonly are we unique in what we do, but we are tremendously efficient in \nhow we do it.\n  We have always been labor intensive. It is the character of the \nindustry, and\n\n[[Page S13287]]\n\nwe have chosen that labor from where it was available. We have paid \nthem good wages, but we must have them and we need them for the \nAmerican consumer, for the abundance of the market shelf, and for the \nproductivity of production agriculture. It is all a part of a total \npicture.\n  Starting several decades ago, we began to run into problems. We did \nnot have a Department of Labor that would work collectively and \nproductively with American agriculture to deal with a very significant \npart of the equation that I have just outlined, and that was the labor \nside. We have a H-2A program, and Senator Graham has already outlined \nit. We recognize about 34,000 people are registered in that program on \nan annual basis and those are the ``foreign guest workers.'' Yet we \nhave nearly 600,000 foreign illegal aliens in the agricultural job \nmarket.\n  What is wrong here? What is wrong is a phenomenally complicated \nprocess and, Mr. President, you held the book up tonight--thousands of \npages of procedure, controls, regulations, and phenomenal forms for \noftentimes illiterate people to fill out to identify with the job \nmarket that is clearly in this country. They fall victim to a term we \ncall ``the coyote,'' that exploiter of human beings, the one who takes \nthe opportunity to say: Ah, but for $1,000, I can get you across the \nborder and into the farm fields of eastern Oregon or southwestern \nIdaho; pay me the money and I will find you the job.\n  Weeks later, they are oftentimes rounded up by the Immigration \nService and whisked back across the border, and they are treated as \nless than human. Oftentimes, they are crammed into vehicles like \nsardines in a can. We hear the story almost every year about the \nvehicle that overturns and splits and spills open, and oftentimes these \ninnocent people are killed.\n  That is one side of the story we are trying to solve, and I say to \nthe Department of Labor: Why can't you work with us to solve this \nproblem? Why can't we develop a national registry of domestic workers \nand from that point move to a system that allows workers into our \ncountry as foreign guest workers under an H-2A program and a system \nthat recognizes those who are already here, 600,000-plus?\n  That is what we offer tonight in ag jobs. We think it is tremendously \nstraightforward and it is honest. Yes, there will be opposition, to \nwhich the Senator from Oregon who is presiding at this moment, has \nspoken. I say to those who oppose, they oppose for all of the wrong \nreasons. They ought to sit down with us to see where we can work out \nour differences.\n  I have spoken to the human side of the equation, but I talk tonight \nabout the whole picture of agriculture. There is the other side. There \nis the agricultural producer who should be allowed to have access to a \nstable, reliable, and available workforce.\n  The Department of Labor says today: If you need a job, advertise for \nit. So the onion farmer in southwestern Idaho advertises in Wisconsin, \nor New York, or Florida that he has a 2- or 3-week field job? I doubt \nit. It does not happen; it will not happen. But that is basically what \nthe law of the day requires, and that is why there are 600,000-plus \nillegal aliens in our country because the current law isn't working, it \nis denying the farmer his or her reliable workforce, and it is \nliterally opening the doors of our borders and saying: Come in, \nillegals. The jobs are here for you.\n\n  As a sovereign nation, that is something we should not tolerate; and \nthat is our inability and our unwillingness to control a border \nenvironment. And we do that if we have a reasonable and easily \naccessible system so foreign guest workers can find their way into it \nand find the jobs they seek. That is what our bill offers to that \nworkforce.\n  The Bureau of Labor Statistics has just come out with an interesting \nfigure that says, in the next 15 years, at today's current economic \ngrowth rates, there will be a deficit of at least 20 percent in our \nworkforce. If we take all of the humans in America, all of the willing \nand available workers, all of those capable of working, and find them \njobs, in this economy, there will still be a deficit of 20 percent.\n  What does that say? That if we are to maintain our productivity and \nour growth rates in this country, and our economic level of \nopportunity, that we have to find a legal, responsible, and easily \naccessible way of allowing foreign guest workers into our country to \nwork at the jobs that will be there; and then for them to be able to \nreturn to their homes, having had a positive experience in this country \nand having allowed our country to grow and to prosper, as it should. \nThat is what our legislation is about, only it is for agriculture \nspecifically.\n  So we hope our colleagues will look at this legislation and join with \nus in it. As we move into next year's session, we will, obviously, be \nholding the necessary and appropriate hearings on it to address what is \na very real problem in my State, in Oregon, in Florida, in every other \nagricultural State in the Nation, and that includes nearly all of the \nlower 48, and certainly even the State of Hawaii.\n  So I hope that is the story that comes from the introduction of our \nlegislation tonight. It is one that I think is critically important for \nus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url":

Res. 207\n\n       Whereas the United States has a deep and sustained interest \n     in the promotion of deregulation, competition, and regulatory \n     reform in Japan;\n       Whereas new and bold measures by the Government of Japan \n     regarding regulatory reform will help remove the regulatory \n     and structural impediments to the effective functioning of \n     market forces in the Japanese economy;\n       Whereas regulatory reform will increase the efficient \n     allocation of resources of Japan, which is critical to \n     returning Japan to a long-term growth path powered by \n     domestic demand;\n       Whereas regulatory reform will not only improve market \n     access for United States business and other foreign firms, \n     but will also enhance consumer choice and economic prosperity \n     in Japan;\n       Whereas a sustained recovery of the Japanese economy is \n     vital to a sustained recovery of Asian economies;\n       Whereas the Japanese economy must serve as one of the main \n     engines of growth for Asia and for the global economy;\n       Whereas the Governments of the United States and Japan \n     reconfirmed the critical importance of deregulation, \n     competition, and regulatory reform when the two governments \n     established the Enhanced Initiative on Deregulation and \n     Competition Policy in 1997;\n       Whereas telecommunications is a critical sector requiring \n     reform in Japan, where the market is hampered by a history of \n     laws, regulations, and monopolistic practices that do not \n     meet the needs of a competitive market;\n       Whereas as the result of Japan's laws, regulations, and \n     monopolistic practices, Japanese consumers and Japanese \n     industry have been denied the broad benefits of innovative \n     telecommunications services, cutting edge technology, and \n     lower prices that competition would bring to the market;\n       Whereas Japan's significant lag in developing broadband and \n     Internet services, and Japan's lag in the entire area of \n     electronic commerce, is a direct result of a noncompetitive \n     telecommunications regulatory structure;\n       Whereas Japan's lag in developing broadband and Internet \n     services is evidenced by the following: (1) Japan has only \n     17,000,000 Internet users, while the United States has \n     80,000,000 Internet users; (2) Japan hosts fewer than \n     2,000,000 web sites, while the United States hosts over \n     30,000,000 web sites; (3) electronic commerce in Japan is \n     valued at less than $1,000,000,000, while in the United \n     States electronic commerce is valued at over $30,000,000,000; \n     and (4) 19 percent Japan's schools are connected to the \n     Internet, while in the United States 89 percent of schools \n     are connected; and\n       Whereas leading edge foreign telecommunications companies, \n     because of their high level of technology and innovation, are \n     the key to building the necessary telecommunications \n     infrastructure in Japan, which will only be able to serve \n     Japanese consumers and industry if there is a fundamental \n     change in Japan's regulatory approach to telecommunications: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved; That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the appropriate officials in the executive branch \n     should implement vigorously the call for Japan to undertake a \n     major regulatory reform in the telecommunications sector, the \n     so called ``Telecommunications Big Bang'';\n       (2) a ``Telecommunications Big Bang'' must address \n     fundamental legislative and regulatory issues within a \n     strictly defined timeframe;\n       (3) the new telecommunications regulatory framework should \n     put competition first in order to encourage new and \n     innovative businesses to enter the telecommunications market \n     in Japan;\n       (4) the Government of Japan should ensure that Nippen \n     Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) and its affiliates \n     (the NTT Group) are prevented from using their dominant \n     position in the wired and wireless market in an \n     anticompetitive manner; and\n       (5) the Government of Japan should take credible steps to \n     ensure that competitive carriers have reasonable, cost-based, \n     and nondiscriminatory access to the rights-of-way, \n     facilities, and services controlled by NTT, the NTT Group, \n     other utilities, and the Government of Japan, including--\n       (A) access to interconnection at market-based rates;\n       (B) unrestricted access to unbundled elements of the \n     network belonging to NTT and the NTT Group; and\n       (C) access to public roads for the installation of \n     facilities.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the history of our Government's effort to \npromote deregulation and openness in the Japanese telecommunications \nsector goes back over 20 years. Back to the days when Bob Strauss was \nthe U.S. Trade Representative.\n  The first agreement involved significant changes in the procurement \npolicies of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone. Known as NTT, it was then \nthe government owned, monopoly, domestic telecommunications provider. \nThis agreement has been revised and renewed seven times--most recently \nearlier this year.\n  There has been a plethora of other bilateral telecommunications \nagreements with Japan over the years. On\n\n[[Page S13289]]\n\ninterconnection. On cellular phones. And on international value added \nnetworks.\n  We have used Section 301 to pry open the Japanese telecommunications \nmarket. We created Section 1377 in the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act to deal \nwith Japanese telecommunications practices. We have had the MOSS talks \nwith Japan in the 1980s. And we have also pursued multilateral efforts \nthrough the GATT, the WTO, and the Information Technology Agreement--\nthe ITA.\n  I don't think the United States has negotiated more in one sector \nwith any nation than we have done with Japan over telecommunications.\n  And we have made progress, from virtually zero sales by Americans to \nJapan in this sector twenty years ago to several billion dollars today.\n  But there is still a long way to go. Japan is the second largest \neconomy in the world. It is at the cutting edge of most high \ntechnology. Yet its consumption of telecommunications goods and \nservices fits more closely the model of a second tier economy.\n  It is true that penetration of cellular phones in Japan is among the \nhighest in the world. But, Japan has only 17 million Internet users, \nwhile the United States has almost five times as many--80 million \nusers. Japan hosts fewer than two million web sites, while the United \nStates hosts over 30 million. Electronic commerce in Japan is valued at \nless than one billion dollars, versus at least thirty times as much in \nthe United States. And only 19 percent of Japan's schools are connected \nto the Internet, versus in the United States where 89 percent of \nschools are connected.\n  Why is this?\n  The answer is simple. Japan maintains a non-competitive regulatory \nsystem that prevents market forces from fully operating in the \ntelecommunications sector. American telecom service and equipment \nproviders are still limited in their ability to do business in Japan.\n  But the system also hurts the Japanese consumer. They can't obtain \nthe highest quality telecommunications technology at the lowest price. \nThey are not able to choose from the incredible array of services and \nproducts available around the world. And they pay higher prices than \nthey should.\n  Japanese firms also suffer for the same reasons in their \ntelecommunications purchases. They cannot get the best. And they \noverpay for what they can buy. Many modern services are simply \nunavailable in Japan.\n  Earlier this month, the United States Government presented Japan with \nits annual deregulation requests in a number of sectors. If the \nJapanese government implemented this whole list, they would be on a \npath leading to economic growth. To better choice and lower prices for \nits consumers. And to increased efficiency for its industry.\n  I an not naive enough to think that will happen. However, I do know \nthat Japan's adoption of the USTR requests, a so-called \n``Telecommunications Big Bang'', would open the telecommunications \nsector to global competition with all the attendant benefits.\n  Senator Grassley and I are submitting a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution. It simply stresses the need for this significant regulatory \nreform in Japan. It calls on USTR vigorously to implement their call \nfor this change. And it sends the message to Japan that the Senate is \nstrongly behind this effort.\n  Such deregulation serves American and International business. It \nserves the Japanese economy. It serves the Japanese consumer. It serves \nJapanese industry. And it serves the original and global economy which \nneed so desperately a growing Japan. In the long-run, everyone would \nwin.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution when it is called up.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this resolution I am offering with \nSenator Baucus calls for fair access to Japan's $35 billion \ntelecommunications equipment market. Telecommunications is one of our \nmost important exports and one of our most significant areas for future \nexport growth.\n  Recently, the United States and Japan reached a new \ntelecommunications procurement agreement covering procurement by the \nsuccessor companies of the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Company. This \nagreement replaced the 1997 agreement that expired when the Nippon \nTelegraph and Telephone Company was restructured.\n  We have had many difficulties gaining access to Japan's \ntelecommunicates market in the past, probably not too different from a \nlot of sectors as we try to enter our products into Japan. It may be \nnothing new in that respect, but this is a new agreement that will be \nin effect for 2 years, and we should give it a chance to work. But \nhistory shows we have not made much progress when it comes to \nimplementing fair bilateral market access agreements with Japan.\n  You know the usual story: We are always overjoyed, after several \nmonths or even years of negotiating an agreement with the Japanese, \nthat it has been some major breakthrough; and then down the road a few \nmonths or years, when you expect the agreement to be carried out--not \nonly according to its word but also according to its spirit--you find \nthe victory you anticipated and were thankful for at the time it was \nsigned comes out to be a half a loaf or a quarter of a loaf in \npractice. I think that is what we are finding out here a little bit \nwith this telecommunications agreement.\n  The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Company and the government in \nJapan, which owns 65 percent of the telecommunications group, have \ntraditionally maintained that Nippon Telegraph and Telephone is a \nprivate company which should not be subject to government interference \nbut be allowed to make its own procurement decisions.\n  Our concern is that we need effective bilateral government oversight \nso Japan's telecommunications industry does not revert to its \ntraditional reliance upon domestic suppliers and consequently \ncircumvent this agreement. That is because Nippon Telegraph and \nTelephone's procurement history shows that even nearly two decades \nafter the first bilateral agreement on this company's procurement, \nJapan still tends to make a large portion of its procurement from the \n``NTT family'' of Japanese equipment makers; thus, not opening their \nmarkets to products from overseas, including U.S. products. Often, NTT \nover-engineers specifications, which in the past were very Japan-\nspecific or company-specific--another nontariff trade barrier to keep \nout products from the United States and other countries.\n  World telecommunications trade is growing very rapidly, but global \nmarket access is not keeping pace with the fast pace of technology \ndevelopment. The Baucus-Grassley resolution expresses the sense of the \nSenate that the only effective way for the United States to achieve \nsignificant market access in Japan is through Japan staying with \nserious and sustained deregulation and consequently having market \nopportunities for imports from other countries, including the United \nStates.\n  This resolution carriers a message that ought to be heard loud and \nclear in the runup to the World Trade Organization Ministerial \nConference that will take place in Seattle at the end of November. So I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to approve this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/27/senate-section/article/S13289-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13289-S13321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   AFRICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     LAUTENBERG AMENDMENT NO. 2331\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him \nto the bill (H.R. 434) to authorize a new trade and investment policy \nfor sub-Sahara Africa; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. __.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) it is in the mutual interest of the United States and \n     the countries of sub-Saharan Africa to promote stable and \n     sustainable economic growth and development in sub-Saharan \n     Africa;\n       (2) the 48 countries of sub-Saharan Africa form a region \n     richly endowed with both natural and human resources;\n       (3) sub-Saharan Africa represents a region of enormous \n     economic potential and of enduring political significance to \n     the United States;\n       (4) the region has experienced a rise in both economic \n     development and political freedom as countries in sub-Saharan \n     Africa have taken steps toward liberalizing their economies \n     and encouraged broader participation in the political \n     process;\n       (5) the countries of sub-Saharan Africa have made progress \n     toward regional economic integration that can have positive \n     benefits for the region;\n       (6) despite those gains, the per capita income in sub-\n     Saharan Africa averages less than $500 annually;\n       (7) United States foreign direct investment in the region \n     has fallen in recent years and the sub-Saharan African region \n     receives only minor inflows of direct investment from around \n     the world;\n       (8) trade between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa, \n     apart from the import of oil, remains an insignificant part \n     of total United States trade;\n       (9) trade and investment, as the American experience has \n     shown, can represent powerful tools both for economic \n     development and for building a stable political environment \n     in which political freedom can flourish;\n       (10) increased trade and investment flows have the greatest \n     impact in an economic environment in which trading partners \n     eliminate barriers to trade and capital flows and encourage \n     the development of a vibrant private sector that offers \n     individual African citizens the freedom to expand their \n     economic opportunities and provide for their families;\n       (11) offering the countries of sub-Saharan Africa enhanced \n     trade preferences will encourage both higher levels of trade \n     and direct investment in support of the positive economic and \n     political developments under way throughout the region; and\n       (12) encouraging the reciprocal reduction of trade and \n     investment barriers in Africa will enhance the benefits of \n     trade and investment for the region as well as enhance \n     commercial and political ties between the United States and \n     sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n     SEC. 103. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       Congress supports--\n       (1) encouraging increased trade and investment between the \n     United States and sub-Saharan Africa;\n       (2) reducing tariff and nontariff barriers and other \n     obstacles to sub-Saharan African and United States trade;\n       (3) expanding United States assistance to sub-Saharan \n     Africa's regional integration efforts;\n       (4) negotiating reciprocal and mutually beneficial trade \n     agreements, including the possibility of establishing free \n     trade areas that serve the interests of both the United \n     States and the countries of sub-Saharan Africa;\n       (5) focusing on countries committed to accountable \n     government, economic reform, and the eradication of poverty;\n       (6) strengthening and expanding the private sector in sub-\n     Saharan Africa;\n       (7) supporting the development of civil societies and \n     political freedom in sub-Saharan Africa; and\n       (8) establishing a United States-Sub-Saharan African \n     Economic Cooperation Forum.\n\n     SEC. 104.

FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (referred to \n     in this title as ``CBERA'') represents a permanent commitment \n     by the United States to encourage the development of strong \n     democratic governments and revitalized economies in \n     neighboring countries in the Caribbean Basin.\n       (2) Thirty-four democratically elected leaders agreed at \n     the 1994 Summit of the Americas to conclude negotiation of a \n     Free Trade Area of the Americas (referred to in this title as \n     ``FTAA'') by the year 2005.\n       (3) The economic security of the countries in the Caribbean \n     Basin will be enhanced by the completion of the FTAA.\n       (4) Offering temporary benefits to Caribbean Basin \n     countries will enhance trade between the United States and \n     the Caribbean Basin, encourage development of trade and \n     investment policies that will facilitate participation of \n     Caribbean Basin countries in the FTAA, preserve the United \n     States commitment to Caribbean Basin beneficiary countries, \n     help further economic development in the Caribbean Basin \n     region, and accelerate the trend toward more open economies \n     in the region.\n       (5) Promotion of the growth of free enterprise and economic \n     opportunity in the Caribbean Basin will enhance the national \n     security interests of the United States.\n       (6) Increased trade and economic activity between the \n     United States and Caribbean Basin beneficiary countries will \n     create expanding export opportunities for United States \n     businesses and workers.\n       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to--\n       (1) offer Caribbean Basin beneficiary countries willing to \n     prepare to become a party to the FTAA or a comparable trade \n     agreement, tariff treatment essentially equivalent to that \n     accorded to products of NAFTA countries for certain products \n     not currently eligible for duty-free treatment under the \n     CBERA; and\n       (2) seek the participation of Caribbean Basin beneficiary \n     countries in the FTAA or a trade agreement comparable to the \n     FTAA at the earliest possible date, with the goal of \n     achieving full participation in such agreement not later than \n     2005.\n\n     SEC. 203.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) it is in the mutual interest of the United States and \n     the countries of sub-Saharan Africa to promote stable and \n     sustainable economic growth and development in sub-Saharan \n     Africa;\n       (2) the 48 countries of sub-Saharan Africa form a region \n     richly endowed with both natural and human resources;\n       (3) sub-Saharan Africa represents a region of enormous \n     economic potential and of enduring political significance to \n     the United States;\n       (4) the region has experienced a rise in both economic \n     development and political freedom as countries in sub-Saharan \n     Africa have taken steps toward liberalizing their economies \n     and encouraged broader participation in the political \n     process;\n       (5) the countries of sub-Saharan Africa have made progress \n     toward regional economic integration that can have positive \n     benefits for the region;\n       (6) despite those gains, the per capita income in sub-\n     Saharan Africa averages less than $500 annually;\n       (7) United States foreign direct investment in the region \n     has fallen in recent years and the sub-Saharan African region \n     receives only minor inflows of direct investment from around \n     the world;\n       (8) trade between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa, \n     apart from the import of oil, remains an insignificant part \n     of total United States trade;\n       (9) trade and investment, as the American experience has \n     shown, can represent powerful tools both for economic \n     development and for building a stable political environment \n     in which political freedom can flourish;\n       (10) increased trade and investment flows have the greatest \n     impact in an economic environment in which trading partners \n     eliminate barriers to trade and capital flows and encourage \n     the development of a vibrant private sector that offers \n     individual African citizens the freedom to expand their \n     economic opportunities and provide for their families;\n       (11) offering the countries of sub-Saharan Africa enhanced \n     trade preferences will encourage both higher levels of trade \n     and direct investment in support of the positive economic and \n     political developments under way throughout the region; and\n       (12) encouraging the reciprocal reduction of trade and \n     investment barriers in Africa will enhance the benefits of \n     trade and investment for the region as well as enhance \n     commercial and political ties between the United States and \n     sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n     SEC. 103.

FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (referred to \n     in this title as ``CBERA'') represents a permanent commitment \n     by the United States to encourage the development of strong \n     democratic governments and revitalized economies in \n     neighboring countries in the Caribbean Basin.\n       (2) Thirty-four democratically elected leaders agreed at \n     the 1994 Summit of the Americas to conclude negotiation of a \n     Free Trade Area of the Americas (referred to in this title as \n     ``FTAA'') by the year 2005.\n       (3) The economic security of the countries in the Caribbean \n     Basin will be enhanced by the completion of the FTAA.\n       (4) Offering temporary benefits to Caribbean Basin \n     countries will enhance trade between the United States and \n     the Caribbean Basin, encourage development of trade and \n     investment policies that will facilitate participation of \n     Caribbean Basin countries in the FTAA, preserve the United \n     States commitment to Caribbean Basin beneficiary countries, \n     help further economic development in the Caribbean Basin \n     region, and accelerate the trend toward more open economies \n     in the region.\n       (5) Promotion of the growth of free enterprise and economic \n     opportunity in the Caribbean Basin will enhance the national \n     security interests of the United States.\n       (6) Increased trade and economic activity between the \n     United States and Caribbean Basin beneficiary countries will \n     create expanding export opportunities for United States \n     businesses and workers.\n       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to--\n       (1) offer Caribbean Basin beneficiary countries willing to \n     prepare to become a party to the FTAA or a comparable trade \n     agreement, tariff treatment essentially equivalent to that \n     accorded to products of NAFTA countries for certain products \n     not currently eligible for duty-free treatment under the \n     CBERA; and\n       (2) seek the participation of Caribbean Basin beneficiary \n     countries in the FTAA or a\n\n[[Page S13300]]\n\n     trade agreement comparable to the FTAA at the earliest \n     possible date, with the goal of achieving full participation \n     in such agreement not later than 2005.\n\n     SEC. 203.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) it is in the mutual interest of the United States and \n     the countries of sub-Saharan Africa to promote stable and \n     sustainable economic growth and development in sub-Saharan \n     Africa;\n       (2) the 48 countries of sub-Saharan Africa form a region \n     richly endowed with both natural and human resources;\n       (3) sub-Saharan Africa represents a region of enormous \n     economic potential and of enduring political significance to \n     the United States;\n       (4) the region has experienced a rise in both economic \n     development and political freedom as countries in sub-Saharan \n     Africa have taken steps toward liberalizing their economies \n     and encouraged broader participation in the political \n     process;\n       (5) the countries of sub-Saharan Africa have made progress \n     toward regional economic integration that can have positive \n     benefits for the region;\n       (6) despite those gains, the per capita income in sub-\n     Saharan Africa averages less than $500 annually;\n       (7) United States foreign direct investment in the region \n     has fallen in recent years and the sub-Saharan African region \n     receives only minor inflows of direct investment from around \n     the world;\n       (8) trade between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa, \n     apart from the import of oil, remains an insignificant part \n     of total United States trade;\n       (9) trade and investment, as the American experience has \n     shown, can represent powerful tools both for economic \n     development and for building a stable political environment \n     in which political freedom can flourish;\n       (10) increased trade and investment flows have the greatest \n     impact in an economic environment in which trading partners \n     eliminate barriers to trade and capital flows and encourage \n     the development of a vibrant private sector that offers \n     individual African citizens the freedom to expand their \n     economic opportunities and provide for their families;\n       (11) offering the countries of sub-Saharan Africa enhanced \n     trade preferences will encourage both higher levels of trade \n     and direct investment in support of the positive economic and \n     political developments under way throughout the region; and\n       (12) encouraging the reciprocal reduction of trade and \n     investment barriers in Africa will enhance the benefits of \n     trade and investment for the region as well as enhance \n     commercial and political ties between the United States and \n     sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n     SEC. 103. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       Congress supports--\n       (1) encouraging increased trade and investment between the \n     United States and sub-Saharan Africa;\n       (2) reducing tariff and nontariff barriers and other \n     obstacles to sub-Saharan African and United States trade;\n       (3) expanding United States assistance to sub-Saharan \n     Africa's regional integration efforts;\n       (4) negotiating reciprocal and mutually beneficial trade \n     agreements, including the possibility of establishing free \n     trade areas that serve the interests of both the United \n     States and the countries of sub-Saharan Africa;\n       (5) focusing on countries committed to accountable \n     government, economic reform, and the eradication of poverty;\n       (6) strengthening and expanding the private sector in sub-\n     Saharan Africa;\n       (7) supporting the development of civil societies and \n     political freedom in sub-Saharan Africa; and\n       (8) establishing a United States-Sub-Saharan African \n     Economic Cooperation Forum.\n\n     SEC. 104.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``United States-Caribbean \n     Basin Trade Enhancement Act''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (referred to \n     in this title as ``CBERA'') represents a permanent commitment \n     by the United States to encourage the development of strong \n     democratic governments and revitalized economies in \n     neighboring countries in the Caribbean Basin.\n       (2) Thirty-four democratically elected leaders agreed at \n     the 1994 Summit of the Americas to conclude negotiation of a \n     Free Trade Area of the Americas (referred to in this title as \n     ``FTAA'') by the year 2005.\n       (3) The economic security of the countries in the Caribbean \n     Basin will be enhanced by the completion of the FTAA.\n       (4) Offering temporary benefits to Caribbean Basin \n     countries will enhance trade between the United States and \n     the Caribbean Basin, encourage development of trade and \n     investment policies that will facilitate participation of \n     Caribbean Basin countries in the FTAA, preserve the United \n     States commitment to Caribbean Basin beneficiary countries, \n     help further economic development in the Caribbean Basin \n     region, and accelerate the trend toward more open economies \n     in the region.\n       (5) Promotion of the growth of free enterprise and economic \n     opportunity in the Caribbean Basin will enhance the national \n     security interests of the United States.\n       (6) Increased trade and economic activity between the \n     United States and Caribbean Basin beneficiary countries will \n     create expanding export opportunities for United States \n     businesses and workers.\n       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to--\n       (1) offer Caribbean Basin beneficiary countries willing to \n     prepare to become a party to the FTAA or a comparable trade \n     agreement, tariff treatment essentially equivalent to that \n     accorded to products of NAFTA countries for certain products \n     not currently eligible for duty-free treatment under the \n     CBERA; and\n       (2) seek the participation of Caribbean Basin beneficiary \n     countries in the FTAA or a trade agreement comparable to the \n     FTAA at the earliest possible date, with the goal of \n     achieving full participation in such agreement not later than \n     2005.\n\n     SEC. 203.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) it is in the mutual interest of the United States and \n     the countries of sub-Saharan Africa to promote stable and \n     sustainable economic growth and development in sub-Saharan \n     Africa;\n       (2) the 48 countries of sub-Saharan Africa form a region \n     richly endowed with both natural and human resources;\n       (3) sub-Saharan Africa represents a region of enormous \n     economic potential and of enduring political significance to \n     the United States;\n       (4) the region has experienced a rise in both economic \n     development and political freedom as countries in sub-Saharan \n     Africa have taken steps toward liberalizing their economies \n     and encouraged broader participation in the political \n     process;\n       (5) the countries of sub-Saharan Africa have made progress \n     toward regional economic integration that can have positive \n     benefits for the region;\n       (6) despite those gains, the per capita income in sub-\n     Saharan Africa averages less than $500 annually;\n       (7) United States foreign direct investment in the region \n     has fallen in recent years and the sub-Saharan African region \n     receives only minor inflows of direct investment from around \n     the world;\n       (8) trade between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa, \n     apart from the import of oil, remains an insignificant part \n     of total United States trade;\n       (9) trade and investment, as the American experience has \n     shown, can represent powerful tools both for economic \n     development and for building a stable political environment \n     in which political freedom can flourish;\n       (10) increased trade and investment flows have the greatest \n     impact in an economic environment in which trading partners \n     eliminate barriers to trade and capital flows and encourage \n     the development of a vibrant private sector that offers \n     individual African citizens the freedom to expand their \n     economic opportunities and provide for their families;\n       (11) offering the countries of sub-Saharan Africa enhanced \n     trade preferences will encourage both higher levels of trade \n     and direct investment in support of the positive economic and \n     political developments under way throughout the region; and\n       (12) encouraging the reciprocal reduction of trade and \n     investment barriers in Africa will enhance the benefits of \n     trade and investment for the region as well as enhance \n     commercial and political ties between the United States and \n     sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n     SEC. 103. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       Congress supports--\n       (1) encouraging increased trade and investment between the \n     United States and sub-Saharan Africa;\n       (2) reducing tariff and nontariff barriers and other \n     obstacles to sub-Saharan African and United States trade;\n       (3) expanding United States assistance to sub-Saharan \n     Africa's regional integration efforts;\n       (4) negotiating reciprocal and mutually beneficial trade \n     agreements, including the possibility of establishing free \n     trade areas that serve the interests of both the United \n     States and the countries of sub-Saharan Africa;\n       (5) focusing on countries committed to accountable \n     government, economic reform, and the eradication of poverty;\n       (6) strengthening and expanding the private sector in sub-\n     Saharan Africa;\n       (7) supporting the development of civil societies and \n     political freedom in sub-Saharan Africa; and\n       (8) establishing a United States-Sub-Saharan African \n     Economic Cooperation Forum.\n\n     SEC. 104.

FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (referred to \n     in this title as ``CBERA'') represents a permanent commitment \n     by the United States to encourage the development of strong \n     democratic governments and revitalized economies in \n     neighboring countries in the Caribbean Basin.\n       (2) Thirty-four democratically elected leaders agreed at \n     the 1994 Summit of the Americas to conclude negotiation of a \n     Free Trade Area of the Americas (referred to in this title as \n     ``FTAA'') by the year 2005.\n       (3) The economic security of the countries in the Caribbean \n     Basin will be enhanced by the completion of the FTAA.\n       (4) Offering temporary benefits to Caribbean Basin \n     countries will enhance trade between the United States and \n     the Caribbean Basin, encourage development of trade and \n     investment policies that will facilitate participation of \n     Caribbean Basin countries in the FTAA, preserve the United \n     States commitment to Caribbean Basin beneficiary countries, \n     help further economic development in the Caribbean Basin \n     region, and accelerate the trend toward more open economies \n     in the region.\n       (5) Promotion of the growth of free enterprise and economic \n     opportunity in the Caribbean Basin will enhance the national \n     security interests of the United States.\n       (6) Increased trade and economic activity between the \n     United States and Caribbean Basin beneficiary countries will \n     create expanding export opportunities for United States \n     businesses and workers.\n       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to--\n       (1) offer Caribbean Basin beneficiary countries willing to \n     prepare to become a party to the FTAA or a comparable trade \n     agreement, tariff treatment essentially equivalent to that \n     accorded to products of NAFTA countries for certain products \n     not currently eligible for duty-free treatment under the \n     CBERA; and\n       (2) seek the participation of Caribbean Basin beneficiary \n     countries in the FTAA or a trade agreement comparable to the \n     FTAA at the earliest possible date, with the goal of \n     achieving full participation in such agreement not later than \n     2005.\n\n     SEC. 203.

Mr. President, earlier today, I learned of the \npassing of Jack Lynch, the former Prime Minister of Ireland. I was \ndeeply saddened to hear of Prime Minister Lynch's passing and would \nlike to reflect for just a few moments on his life and enormous \ncontributions to peace in Ireland.\n  While Prime Minister Lynch's achievements were many, he is best \nremembered for encouraging a more tolerant Irish attitude toward \nBritish sovereignty in the Protestant-dominated North; a change in \nattitude that made the Good Friday peace accords possible. In 1969, \nduring his tenure as Prime Minister, Jack Lynch showed remarkable \nrestraint in his dealings with the North, resisting pressure from his \nparty and many citizens of Ireland to send troops across the border to \nprotect Catholics in Londonderry from attacks by Protestant \nparamilitaries and local police forces. This desire for peace further \nmanifested itself in the late 1970s, when Prime Minister Lynch began \ntraveling to Belfast to discuss peace with British officials. These \nefforts cumulated in a historic dialogue about peace and tolerance with \nthen-British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a dialogue which began \nthe gradual process of trust-building necessary for a lasting peace.\n  Another reminder of the enduring achievements of Prime Minister Lynch \nis Irish membership in the European Union. In 1973, Ireland was a \ncountry with a failing economy, a high unemployment rate, and rampant \nemigration. In an effort to rekindle the faltering economy and \nreconnect Ireland with the European continent, Jack Lynch entered \nIreland into the European Economic Community. Today, billions of \ndollars of European aid and investment have helped Ireland become one \nof the world's 25 wealthiest nations, unemployment has dropped to half \nthe European Union average, and people are returning to their ancestral \nhomes. It is mainly due to Prime Minister Lynch's foresight in \nnegotiating Irish entry into the E.E.C. that this economic turnaround \nhas occurred.\n  These accomplishments only begin to illustrate the many professional \nsuccesses of Peter Lynch. He was a man who was able to look past \nhistoric prejudice and heat-of-the-moment emotions to bring individuals \nwith very different viewpoints together in meaningful dialogue. He was \na visionary who saw the need for economic modernization and was \nunafraid to seek help from his European neighbors. And, in the end, he \nwas a leader. As current Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern has said, \nhis firm leadership saw Ireland through a period of great turbulence \nand his outstanding work to gain Irish membership in the E.E.C. changed \nforever the way Ireland sees itself as a nation. And for this, Mr. \nPresident, people of Irish descent, such as myself, thank him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/27/senate-section/article/S13321-3", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13321-S13322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE PEOPLE'S CREED\n\n Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nMichigan Rehabilitation Association, a remarkable organization from my \nhome state of Michigan, which will celebrate its 50th Anniversary on \nNovember 1, 1999.\n  Over the past five decades, the Michigan Rehabilitation Association \n(MRA) has proudly worked to meet the needs of Michigan's disabled \ncommunity. While beginning as a professional association for \nrehabilitation practitioners, it has quickly grown into one of \nMichigan's leading advocates for the welfare and rights of handicapped \npeople. While its scope and purpose have evolved, its members have \nremained steadfastly committed to excellence in the delivery of \nservices to the disabled.\n  Since its inception in 1949 as the country's first state chapter of \nthe National Rehabilitation Association, the MRA's far-reaching hand \nhas helped thousands of Michigan's citizens achieve a higher quality of \nlife. As it celebrates this important milestone, I am sure its staff, \nfriends and supporters will have the opportunity to recall its many \nsuccesses. I am pleased to join with them in thanking the people of the \nMichigan Rehabilitation Association for their efforts while applauding \nall the hard work and determination that have resulted in the MRA's \nprestigious reputation.\n  The Michigan Rehabilitation Association can take pride in the many \nimportant achievements of its first fifty years. I know my colleagues \nwill join me in saluting the accomplishments of MRA's first half \ncentury and in wishing it continued success for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/27/senate-section/article/S13322-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13322-S13324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            RED MASS HOMILY\n\n Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, on Sunday, October 3, 1999, the \nMost Reverend Raymond J. Boland, Bishop of the Kansas City-St. Joseph \narea of Missouri, delivered the homily at the Red Mass held at St. \nMatthew's Cathedral in Washington, DC. The Red Mass traditionally marks \nthe opening of the Supreme Court's new term. In his address, Bishop \nBoland discusses the idea of having cooperative dialog between the \nChurch and State in their mutual search for justice and respect.\n  I ask to have printed in the Record the text of the homily given by \nBishop Raymond J.

I am also grateful \n     to the John Carroll Society for sponsoring this annual event \n     once again. John Carroll, the first Roman Catholic Bishop of \n     the Republic, played a significant part in defining the role \n     of the church in an infant nation where religion would have \n     freedom but not state sponsorship. John's brother, Daniel, \n     signed the Constitution which gave political and legal shape \n     to what is now the United States.\n       Because of a certain anniversary which occurs this year, I \n     would like to think that a fuller acceptance of the dignity \n     of the human person may lead to a more productive \n     understanding of the relationship between church and state in \n     this country and elsewhere. It augurs well for our individual \n     freedoms but it is also a delicate balance which may be in \n     jeopardy.\n       This year marks the 350th Anniversary of the Toleration Act \n     of 1649, a significant development for its time which boldly \n     reaffirmed the right of religious and political freedom in \n     the Maryland colony. Many of you are familiar with the \n     monument at St. Mary's City, the first capital of the future \n     state, which symbolically depicts a man with uplifted \n     countenance emerging from the confining stone from which he \n     is sculpted. At his feet three words are carved, Freedom of \n     Conscience.\n\n[[Page S13323]]\n\n       The Edict of Toleration provided, ``No person shall from \n     henceforth be in any ways troubled . . . for or in respect of \n     his or her religion nor in the free exercise thereof within \n     this Province nor any way be compelled to the belief or \n     exercise of any other against his will.'' (Their Rights and \n     Liberties, Thomas O'Brien Hanley, S.J. p. 115)\n       When Jesus enunciated his oft-quoted judgment, ``Give to \n     Caesar what is Caesar's, but give to God what is God's.'' \n     (Luke 20:25) Luke tells us that his response ``completely \n     disconcerted'' his audience ``and reduced them to silence.'' \n     (Luke 20:26) Over the centuries we have not remained silent \n     but we have continued to remain perplexed. Couched in terms \n     of black and white the principle is one for the ages but its \n     complexity intensifies as its application uncovers a \n     multiplicity of details. All people of faith are citizens and \n     most citizens are people of faith. Avowed atheists may not \n     believe in God or any god, as Bishop Fulton Sheen used to \n     quip, ``they have no invisible means of support,'' but it can \n     be argued that their secularized or humanistic self-\n     sufficiency constitutes a belief system of some sort. The \n     predicament is obvious. The church-goer pays taxes. A devout \n     Christian can be passionately patriotic. Among our citizens \n     are Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and adherents of many \n     other religions, all of whom wish to practice their faith in \n     freedom and many of whom honor forebears who came to this \n     country precisely for that reason. According to reputable \n     opinion polls the vast majority of Americans believe in God, \n     pray with some frequency and articulate their sincerely-held \n     beliefs by following rituals and disciplines promoted by \n     their respective churches. These same people are also \n     participants in the political process. They vote, they seek \n     political office, they express their opinions, they establish \n     forums to give wider circulation to their political \n     philosophies. There is absolutely no way they can prevent the \n     influence of their religious beliefs from coloring their \n     public attitudes and forming their political convictions. \n     Indeed, churches as a whole, convinced that they have much \n     which is positive to contribute to the public debate, expect \n     their members to bring their cultural and religious values to \n     the various arenas where ideas are being generated and laws \n     being honed. The church, no less than the state, seeks to \n     meet the challenges of a society where sociological and \n     technological change seems to be constantly outpacing our \n     human capacity to keep it within the bounds of comprehension \n     not to mention control.\n       There is another dimension to this reality which is even \n     more important because it comes closer to the cutting edge. \n     Many citizens, whether they be religious or not, only \n     participate in the public debate in a limited way. But we are \n     concerned with the other end of the spectrum--the lawyers, \n     the judges, the legislators who devote their lives to \n     enacting and interpreting laws and who will naturally do so \n     within the context of their own inherited and acquired \n     religious convictions. When they enter statehouses and \n     courtrooms they cannot leave their consciences along with \n     their coats in the cloakroom. Not all matters are charged \n     with ethical or moral overtones but those which are of most \n     concern to our populace--rights and liberties, life and \n     death, war and peace, affluence and poverty, personal freedom \n     and the common good--are so interlaced with cultural, \n     religious, scientific and legal implications that wisdom in \n     all its personifications is called for.\n       Is it possible to hope that, as we enter a new millennium, \n     church and state in our land, and even the international \n     world, may all subscribe to a synthesis of basic principles \n     which guarantee freedom for all while equally protecting the \n     rights of believers and unbelievers? Have we been moving in \n     that direction? Surely such an outcome is desirable. Church \n     and state have a lot in common in their mutual search for \n     justice, in promoting respect for all just laws, in their \n     concern for the common good and this, of necessity, includes \n     such important areas as education, health care and social \n     services.\n       It is difficult to assess what influence Maryland's Edict \n     of Toleration had on the framers of the Constitution. The \n     Establishment Clause and, later on, the Free Exercise Clause \n     have achieved a hallowed place in our national psyche even \n     though many modern scholars detect inconsistencies in their \n     application and some straying from their authors' intention \n     in their interpretation. History certainly indicates that \n     Congress adopted the two religion clauses as protection for \n     religion, not protection from religion. English teachers \n     constantly warn their students that analogies and metaphors \n     should not be pushed too far. Thomas Jefferson's famous \n     ``Wall of Separation'' metaphor may have suffered this over \n     extension, something certainly not supported by a complete \n     examination of his legal philosophy nor of the Constitution \n     itself. The phrase has become a mantra. How high the wall? \n     How impenetrable? Nobody denies the need for separation but \n     such does not exclude cooperation. This vital area of \n     constitutional law has experienced many twists and turns in \n     its two centuries of history and more cases are winding their \n     way upwards from lower courts. Maybe we need the equivalent \n     of what manufacturers call R and D, Research and Development, \n     to discover where we've been and to propose new ways of \n     legally facilitating those who work with Caesar and walk with \n     God. Instead of tanks and guns and land mines, maybe we have \n     a great opportunity to offer the world a legal system which \n     guarantees elementary human rights and yes, religious rights, \n     and as a result, the potential for peace, justice and \n     economic growth. We may even get to the stage when the words \n     of Deuteronomy will be applied to us, ``this great nation is \n     truly a wise and intelligent people.'' (Deut. 4:6).\n       In the last century the Church has made extraordinary \n     strides in its own understanding of pluralism, religious \n     freedom and political liberty. It was not easy because \n     theocracies dominated the scene in the western world for so \n     many centuries. The demise of the Holy Roman Empire and the \n     disappearance of the Papal States gave the Church both an \n     opportunity and a challenge to speak to the world with moral \n     authority unfettered and unprotected by armies, navies or \n     nuclear weapons.\n       The high point of this new attitude was enshrined in one of \n     the shortest documents of the Second Vatican Council, that \n     world-wide meeting of Catholic Bishops in Rome in the mid-\n     sixties. The document, known as Dignitatis Humanae, the \n     Declaration on Religious Liberty, was promulgated by Pope \n     Paul VI in December, 1965 after five drafts and two years of \n     vigorous debate. Called by the Pope ``one of the major texts \n     of the Council'' it began with the felicitous observation, \n     ``contemporary man is becoming increasingly conscious of the \n     dignity of the human person'' (Dignitatis Humanae, 1). It is \n     no secret that one of the most influential framers of this \n     document was the American Jesuit, John Courtney Murray, who \n     brought with him to the Vatican a deep understanding and a \n     genuine admiration for the guarantees established by the \n     United States Constitution and Bill of Rights. It may have \n     been indirect but there is no doubt that the American \n     experience, dating back to the Toleration Act of 1649, found \n     a responsive echo in St. Peter's Basilica.\n       If there was any question about this new initiative it was \n     resoundingly dispelled by our new Pope, John Paul II, in 1979 \n     during the very first year of his pontificate. Here was a man \n     whose only fellow seminarian was snatched in the night and \n     executed by the Gestapo precisely because he was a Catholic \n     seminarian. Here was a priest and bishop who later prevailed \n     over the disabilities imposed upon him and his flock by an \n     atheistic Communist regime.\n       In his papal letter Redemptor Hominis, John Paul II would \n     recall and reaffirm that Vatican Council document and again \n     declare that the right to religious freedom together with the \n     right to freedom of conscience is not only a theological \n     concept but is one also ``reached from the point of view of \n     natural law, that is to say, from the purely human position, \n     on the basis of the premises given by man's own experience, \n     his reason and his sense of human dignity.'' (Redemptor \n     Hominis, 17)\n       For over 20 years, on every continent, again and again the \n     Holy Father has stressed that the human dignity of each \n     individual is the basis for all law.\n       Within the last year, in his New Year's message, addressing \n     people of good will everywhere the Pope reiterated his \n     conviction that ``when the promotion of the dignity of the \n     human person is the guiding principle and when the search for \n     the common good is the overriding commitment'' (World Day of \n     Peace Message, 1999, 1) the right to life, to religious \n     freedom, of citizens to participate in the life of their \n     community, the right of ethnic groups and national minorities \n     to exist along with those rights to self-fulfilment covering \n     educational, economic and peace issues become possible.\n       The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, intimately \n     associated with the United Nations Charter, affirms the \n     innate dignity of all members of the human family along with \n     the equality and inalienability of their rights. Even though \n     these ideals are being blatantly ignored in many places \n     across the globe, here in this land we must not ignore the \n     unique opportunity we have to solidify the principle \n     enunciated and developed by our leaders of both church and \n     state that ``human rights stem from the inherent dignity and \n     worth of the human person.'' (Cf. In particular the Vienna \n     Declaration, 1993 Preamble 2).\n       Crafting principles is easy in comparison to applying them \n     to the extraordinary complexities of modern life. Mistakes \n     have been made in the past. On the part of the Church there \n     have been excesses of evangelistic zeal: in the halls of \n     justice nobody seems proud of the Dred Scott decision. We \n     live in an imperfect world and we are not all pious God-\n     fearing and timid law-abiding clones.\n       There will always be tension between church and state. This \n     tension, in many ways, creates a safety valve. It is, after \n     all, when this tension disappears that we should worry.\n       In the enactment and administration of civil laws, people \n     of faith do not expect privileges but they do expect \n     fairness. George Orwell in his classic, Animal Farm, coined \n     the phrase that ``all animals are created equal but some are \n     more equal than others.'' Is there a danger that the \n     devotees of secularism are ``more equal'' than those who \n     are proud of the faith they profess? Do secular symbols \n     enjoy more protection than religious symbols? In every age \n     there are some who would like to have religion disappear. \n     As religion has proven itself remarkably durable, the next \n     line of attack is the attempt to trivialize it into \n     insignificance. It seems incredible but now and again \n     there are those who maintain that believers have no right \n     to engage in the public debate.\n\n[[Page S13324]]\n\n       ``To accept the separation of the church from the state did \n     not mean accepting a passive or marginal status for the \n     Church in society''. (Responsibilities and Temptations of \n     Power: A Catholic View. J. Bryan Hehir, Georgetown \n     University.)\n       The church by definition has a theological foundation but \n     it is also a voluntary association within our society with \n     much to say about social policies. It should be accorded the \n     same rights in the public debate as associations which \n     profess no theological leanings.\n       Even Pope John Paul II expressed his apprehension on this \n     matter when he accepted the credentials of one of the \n     esteemed John Carroll Society members, Lindy Boggs, as the \n     United States Ambassador to the Holy See, a year ago. On that \n     occasion he declared, ``It would truly be a sad thing if the \n     religious and moral convictions upon which the American \n     experiment was founded could now somehow be considered a \n     danger to free society, such that those who would bring these \n     convictions to bear upon your nation's public life would be \n     denied a voice in debating and resolving issues of public \n     policy. The original separation of church and state in the \n     United States was certainly not an effort to ban all \n     religious conviction from the public sphere, a kind of \n     banishment of God from civil society. Indeed, the vast \n     majority of Americans, regardless of their religious \n     persuasion, are convinced that religious conviction and \n     religiously informed moral argument have a vital role in \n     public life.''\n       Religion will endure. Christianity, for one, has its own \n     inner guarantees revolving around the presence of God's \n     Spirit and the promises of Christ. They are doomed to \n     disappointment who constantly predict that the unfolding \n     discoveries of the many scientific disciplines will make \n     religion obsolete or, at best, the hollow consolation of the \n     feeble-minded. On the contrary, the more we reveal the \n     mysteries of the universe in which we live, and decipher the \n     minutiae of human existence, the more we come face to face \n     with the creativity of God. We can partially answer the \n     ``hows'' and the ``whens'' and the ``whats'' but at the end \n     of the day, there is still the ``why''?\n       My accent always betrays my origins and on July 12, 1965 I \n     became an American citizen in the court house of Upper \n     Marlboro, Maryland, which, coincidentally, is the town where \n     John Carroll was born. I willingly promised to uphold the \n     laws of the United States and I acquired the freedom and, \n     indeed, the expectation to be part of the process which \n     monitors, implements and sometimes modifies those laws. \n     During these past thirty something years of my citizenship I \n     have observed the Constitution endure some severe pressures \n     and, by and large, I agree with the national consensus that \n     ``the system works''. There is no substitute for the rule of \n     law.\n       Across the impressive facade of the Supreme Court Building \n     are the words ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' If I were the \n     architect I would have been tempted to add two further words, \n     ``For All.'' Criminals should fear the law: good people whose \n     means are meager should not be intimidated by either the law \n     itself or the wealth of those who can retain a bevy of high-\n     profile lawyers. Claims are sometimes made that those on the \n     lowest rungs of the economic ladder rarely have access to \n     adequate legal representation. It is for this reason that I \n     wish to commend those legal firms and individual lawyers who, \n     through various pro bono networks, seek to alleviate this \n     shortcoming. They bring a nobility to their profession which \n     is beyond value and it is often the only antidote to the \n     popular cynicism which is foisted upon lawyers in general.\n       As we usher in a new millennium, and as the world shrinks \n     around us, we have much to learn from each other. The Church \n     and the state must protect the freedom and the integrity of \n     one another within their respective spheres of competence, \n     and where there is overlapping, the dialogue must be marked \n     by, as one scholar suggested, (J. Bryan Hehir) technical \n     competency, civil intelligibility and political courtesy. In \n     this way the 350 year old vision of the Toleration Act of \n     1649 will endure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/27/senate-section/article/S13324-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   IN TRIBUTE TO RONALD DOBIES' INDUCTION TO THE NEW JERSEY ELECTED \n                         OFFICIALS HALL OF FAME\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mayor \nRonald Dobies of Middlesex Borough on his induction into the New Jersey \nElected Officials Hall of Fame. After nearly 30 years in public service \nMayor Dobies was inducted last January. He was first elected Mayor in \n1979, and he has been re-elected four times since. Prior to this \nservice, Mayor Dobies was a member of the school board for six years, \nas well as a four-year member of the Borough Council.\n  Through these years, Mayor Dobies' administrations have grappled with \nsome basic suburban dilemmas, such as preserving open space while \nattracting development and keeping municipal services up and taxes \ndown. Among his accomplishments, Mayor Dobies has secured flood-control \nmeasures and ongoing road projects, increased park and recreation \nareas, and overseen the construction of the borough's Senior Citizen \nHousing complex.\n  Mayor Dobies is originally from Scranton, Pennsylvania, and attended \nthe University of Scranton. He graduated with a degree in chemistry and \nphilosophy, and ultimately joined basic training at Fort Gordon in \nAugusta, Georgia. After serving in the military police corps overseas, \nRonald and his wife Blanche returned to the United States.\n  Mayor Dobies has added to his impressive record of community service \nby demonstrating his abilities in the business world as well. He is \ncurrently the Director of Analytical Research for Wyeth-Ayerst Research \nin Pearl River, New York. While this job is a full-time one, he still \nfinds the time to devote between 30 and 40 hours each week to his \nresponsibilities as Mayor. Each Friday night, Mayor Dobies hosts \nmeetings with his constituents, a tradition he began during his first \nterm. Mayor Dobies has won the respect of both Republicans and \nDemocrats in his borough, and his non-contentious style has promoted a \nsuccessful bipartisan spirit at all levels of government in Middlesex \nBorough. This December, Mayor Dobies will conclude his fifth term, and \nhe hopes to return for a sixth next year. I look forward to his \ncontinued service in this office, and I extend my congratulations to \nhim on his honor by the New Jersey Elected Officials Hall of \nFame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/27/senate-section/article/S13324-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          WORKER SAFETY AWARD FOR FORT JAMES MILL OF OLD TOWN\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce that this \npast June 2, 1999, the Fort James Corporation Paper Mills 2 was \nrecognized for its impressive safety record of performance for the \nentire year of 1998. The award was presented by the Pulp & Paper \nAssociation, which honored the St. James Mill at its Awards Banquet at \nthe Association's annual Professional Development Conference in St. \nPetersburg, Florida.\n  The award is the highest honor given for safety performance \nthroughout the paper industry, and reflects the most improved safety \nrecord in the class of 56 mills working between one and to two million \nhours per year. Mr. President, the mill logged over 1.3 million work \nhours with an extremely low incidence of Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration (OSHA) recordable work injuries--only 21, yielding an \nexemplary incident rate of 3.2. This incident rate reflects that very \nfew employees required any type of medical attention while carrying out \ntheir demanding jobs.\n  Further, in light of their accomplishments on behalf of the safety of \nthe community and its people, the City of Old Town issued a resolution \nto the Fort James Corporation honoring its employees for their \noutstanding commitment. And at a follow-up picnic, mill employees were \ngiven a true Maine ``thank you'' as mill management, along with \ncorporate environmental and safety leaders as well as local officials, \nhelped out in cooking and serving a Celebration Picnic to all of the \nmill's employees. Each employee was also presented with a gift in \nrecognition of the worker safety accomplishments.\n  To the entire workforce and management at the Fort James Mill, I \nwould like to add my congratulations and a sincere Maine thank you as \nwell for their efforts in worker safety that have culminated in this \nwell deserved award, and I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/27/senate-section/article/S13324-3", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13324-S13325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE VERMONT DEVELOPMENT CREDIT UNION\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, 10 years ago, Caryl Stewart, \nExecutive Director of the Vermont Development Credit Union, had a dream \nfor a grass roots community development ``bank'' to serve low and \nmoderate income people in Burlington, Vermont. Who would have guessed \nthem that her dream would become a growing credit union with over $10 \nmillion in assets and 5,000 members in 175 Vermont towns?\n  Through it all, the credit union, with Caryl at its helm, has stayed \ntrue to its vision of serving lower income families and small business \nentrepreneurs in Vermont. Not just with loans, but also with the \npersonal attention and counseling needed to ensure that loan\n\n[[Page S13325]]\n\nrecipients succeed, whatever their goals. It is that commitment to \nVermonters and the communities they live in that has won the Credit \nUnion the support and patronage of so many Vermont businesses and \norganizations.\n  It has also won the organization support from far beyond Vermont's \nborders. From Fannie Mae to the Community Development Financial \nInstitutions program the Vermont Development Credit Union has received \nfunding and won national recognition for its innovative lending and \nsupport programs.\n  Vermont Development came from very small beginnings in a very small \ncity of our very small State.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an important \nmatter brought to my attention by one of my constituents. I recently \nreceived a letter from G. Ross Darnell, and he pointed out the \nimportance of educating our students about the Constitution. In his \nletter, though, he also mentioned that our educational system has not \nbeen performing well in this area. I agree with Mr. Darnell on both \npoints.\n  The importance of education in preserving our liberties has been \nrealized since the founding of our Republic. In 1787, Thomas Jefferson \nwrote to James Madison with his reflections on the new Constitution. In \nthat letter he said, ``I hope the education of the common people will \nbe attended to; convinced that on their good sense we may rely with the \nmost security for the preservation of a due degree of liberty.'' \nJefferson knew if the people were not aware of the freedoms guaranteed \nby the Constitution they would be powerless to stop any encroachments \nupon them. I'm sure Mr. Jefferson would be quite alarmed at the state \nof ignorance today.\n  While it is a cliche that a generation always finds faults with the \none which follows, there is no denying that in terms of constitutional \nknowledge, the level of ignorance is severe. A poll of teenagers last \nyear illustrates this. Only forty-one percent could name the \nconstitutionally ordained branches of our government, only twenty-one \npercent could say that there were one hundred senators, and only \nthirty-six percent knew one of the most important phrases in our \nnation's history: ``We the People . . .'' These teenagers are moving \ninto adulthood, but they are not taking with them a knowledge of our \nnation's Constitution.\n  It is undeniable that our educational system has failed to address \nthis deficiency. Many experts have documented the fact that most \ntextbooks do not devote a sufficient amount of space to exploring the \nConstitution and the ideas and personalities which shaped it. Even the \nnational history standards proposed a few years ago failed to address \nadequately the importance of this document. The Constitution, along \nwith the Declaration of Independence, is the very foundation upon which \nour nation is built. To not devote sufficient space in textbooks or \ntime in class to it is a tragedy not only for students but also for the \nnation.\n  It's also troubling to note that when constitutional history is \ndiscussed today, the Founding Fathers are portrayed as racist, sexist \nelitists. This caricature of the Founders, which fails to take into \naccount how the Constitutional Convention tried to balance the idealism \nof the Declaration of Independence with the political realities of the \nday, is only abetted by the shallowness of the constitutional teaching \nin our schools. How can students weigh the competing claims in this \nimportant debate when they don't even know what is in the Constitution?\n  How should this deficiency be addressed? I'm not here to suggest \nanother federal program which would impose standards on the state and \nlocal school districts. I have long believed that curriculum is best \ndetermined by local school boards which are much closer to the people \nthan we are here in Washington, D.C. Instead, I am today using this \nopportunity in the United States Senate to urge my colleagues to \nsupport states, school districts, and teachers beginning a wholesale \neffort to renew in our youth a respect and knowledge for the \nConstitution. Our young people need to know the rights guaranteed by \nthis seminal document.

Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \napplaud BP/Amoco for its decision to provide cleaner gasoline to the \nChicago Metropolitan Area. BP/Amoco recently announced that it will \nbegin offering lower sulfur premium gasoline immediately and that it \nintends to provide lower sulfur gasoline in all three grades by 2001--\nthree years ahead of the requirement for lower sulfur gasoline proposed \nby EPA.\n  The average sulfur content of gasoline sold in Chicago today is \napproximately 300 ppm. BP/Amoco's decision will reduce the sulfur \ncontent in its gasolines to 30 ppm. As a cosponsor of legislation to \ncap the sulfur content of gasoline--S. 172, the Clean Gasoline Act of \n1999--I believe reducing sulfur levels in gasoline is an extremely \ncost-effective way to improve our nation's air quality.\n  It is estimated that when fully implemented, lower-sulfur gasoline \noffered by BP/Amoco will reduce nitrogen oxide emissions--one of the \nprecursors to the formation of ozone--by about 3 tons per day. That is \nthe equivalent of removing 70,000 cars from Chicago's highways every \nday.\n  BP/Amoco's decision to voluntarily reduce the sulfur content of \ngasoline sold in Chicago means cleaner, healthier air for the residents \nof the Chicago metropolitan area. It demonstrates again that when we \nwork together we can ensure continued economic growth and protect our \nenvironment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/27/senate-section/article/S13325-3", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13325-S13326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      GOVERNOR'S COMMISSION ON WOMEN 35TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I rise to celebrate women \nin my home state of Vermont. It gives me great pleasure to speak in \nrecognition of the Governor's Commission on Women of Vermont and to \nacknowledge their 35th anniversary.\n  Over the last 35 years, the Governor's Commission on Women has \naccrued a long list of achievements in the state of Vermont. It is a \nvibrant and healthy organization, dedicated to ensuring that women's \nrights, health, life choices, careers and community service are in \nsharp focus for policymakers and citizens alike. Commission members \nknow how to use their strength of advocacy to empower women and raise \nthe profile and scope of key issues. To highlight a recent endeavor, \nthe Commission made it a priority to give all Vermonters a better \nunderstanding of their health benefits by offering a series of \neducational materials on managed care plans.\n  I have often said that community service is the cornerstone of \ndemocracy and I believe that each citizen has a responsibility to \ncontribute to their community. The Governor's Commission on Women does \njust this, by addressing the pressing matters of concern throughout the \nstate, such as poverty, child care and pay equity. For over three \ndecades the Commission has taken on the ``tough to tackle'' issues. I \nwas very pleased to partner with women's groups across Vermont, \nincluding the Commission, in the fight to ratify the Equal Rights \nAmendment. Although we suffered defeat on this particular issue, we \nknew we were successful in championing the message of equal rights.\n  Through a combination of their hard work, commitment and vision, the \nVermont Commission has surpassed all expectations and created new, and \nI believe lasting, community partnerships. I am proud of what they have \nbeen able to achieve and I hope that others throughout the state and \nnation will look to the Commission's accomplishments and be inspired to \nact as resourcefully.\n  I have made it a personal priority to support the Commission's \nefforts to reach their goals and, because I am\n\n[[Page S13326]]\n\ncommitted to raising awareness at the federal level about the needs of \nwomen, I rely upon them for guidance. From a woman's right to make her \nown reproductive health choices, to supporting efforts to thwart \ndomestic violence, to addressing the life quality issue of retirement \nsecurity, I have had the opportunity to listen, to learn and to act on \neach of these issues in Congress. I encourage my colleagues to forge \nthe same relationship of mutual reliance with any organization \nrepresenting women in their respective states. I firmly believe that we \ncan never shy away from efforts to understand, and eventually \nameliorate the impacts of discrimination, low wages and lack of \nopportunities.\n  I extend my best wishes to the Governor's Commission on Women and to \nhonor their very notable accomplishments over the past 35 \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/27/senate-section/article/S13326-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CHILDREN WITH BRACHIAL PLEXUS INJURIES\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue \nwhich affects children across the country.\n  Brachial plexus injuries (BPI), also known as Erb's palsy, occur when \nthe nerves which control the muscles in the shoulders, arms and hands \nare injured. Any or all of the nerves which run from the spine to the \narms and hands may be paralyzed. Often this injury is caused when an \ninfant's brachial plexus nerves are stretched in the birth canal.\n  What is devastating about BPI is that the children will have \nparalyzed arms and hands which may be misshapen or extending out from \nthe body at unnatural angles. This can retard a child's physical \ndevelopment, making everyday tasks such as coloring, drawing, dressing \nand going to the bathroom, which their peers can perform with no \ntrouble, almost impossible. The feeling in the children's arms and \nhands is similar to how a non-paralyzed person's arm feels when he or \nshe sleeps on it. This numbness leads to more serious injuries--\ntoddlers and young children will accidentally or purposely burn or \nmutilate themselves because they lack feeling in their extremities. \nSome children can undergo expensive surgery and therapy and, though \nnever fully recovering, can regain some normal function of their arms \nand hands. However, many children suffer permanent, debilitating \nparalysis from which they never fully recover.\n  On Thursday, October 21, I sponsored a meeting between members of the \nUnited Brachial Plexus Network (UBPN), surgeons, occupational \ntherapists and experts from the Social Security Administration to \ndiscuss why so many families with children with brachial plexus \ninjuries were being turned down for Supplemental Security Income \ndespite seeming to meet the qualifications for such payments as laid \nout in the Social Security Administration handbook.\n  The Social Security Administration gave a presentation explaining the \nstatutory qualifications for receiving SSI. Their presentations were \nfollowed by presentations by surgeons and therapists explaining how \nchildren with BPI function and why they feel children paralyzed by BPI \nshould be eligible for SSI payments because of their disability.\n  Most moving were the presentations made by children with BPI and \nparents of BPI children. These courageous people talked about their \ndaily lives and the difficulties children with BPI must endure in \nattempting to perform everyday tasks.\n  I want to commend UBPN board member Kathleen Kennedy from my home \nstate of Iowa, Iowa State Senator Kitty Rehberg and Sharon Gavagan, who \nalso sits on the board for UBPN, for their hard work and dedication in \norganizing the meeting between the UBPN and the Social Security \nAdministration. I want to thank the surgeons and therapists who \ntraveled from Texas to make presentations. I also want to commend Susan \nDaniels, Kenneth Nibali of the Social Security Administration and the \nexperts from SSA for their willingness to travel from Baltimore to \nparticipate in the meeting. I am encouraged by their willingness to \nconsider issuing new guidelines to the personnel in the SSA field \noffices regarding brachial plexus injuries.\n  We must work to ensure that everyone who meets the guidelines for \nreceiving SSI has the opportunity to apply for the benefits and be \ngiven a fair hearing. I look forward to seeing the new guidelines from \nSSA, and I am eager to continue working with the Social Security \nAdministration on this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/27/senate-section/article/S13326-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SEQUENTIAL REFERRALS--S. 225 AND S. 400\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Multidistrict Jurisdiction \n     Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION.\n\n       Section 1407 of title 28, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in the third sentence of subsection (a), by inserting \n     ``or ordered transferred to the transferee or other district \n     under subsection (i)'' after ``terminated''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(i)(1) Subject to paragraph (2), any action transferred \n     under this section by the panel may\n\n[[Page S13327]]\n\n     be transferred, for trial purposes, by the judge or judges of \n     the transferee district to whom the action was assigned to \n     the transferee or other district in the interest of justice \n     and for the convenience of the parties and witnesses.\n       ``(2) Any action transferred for trial purposes under \n     paragraph (1) shall be remanded by the panel for the \n     determination of compensatory damages to the district court \n     from which it was transferred, unless the court to which the \n     action has been transferred for trial purposes also finds, \n     for the convenience of the parties and witnesses and in the \n     interests of justice, that the action should be retained for \n     the determination of compensatory damages.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendments made by this Act shall apply to any civil \n     action pending on or brought on or after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is about to \npass S. 1748, the Multi-District Jurisdiction Act of 1999, and H.R. \n2112, as amended by the Hatch-Leahy substitute during its consideration \nin the Senate Judiciary Committee. Our substitute amendment is the text \nof S. 1748, the Multi-District Jurisdiction Act of 1999, which the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and I, along \nwith Senators Grassley, Torricelli, Kohl, and Schumer, introduced last \nweek. Our bipartisan legislation is needed by Federal judges across the \ncountry to restore their power to promote the fair and efficient \nadministration of justice in multi-district litigation.\n  Current law authorizes the Judicial Panel on Multi-District \nLitigation to transfer related cases, pending in multiple Federal \njudicial districts, to a single district for coordinated or \nconsolidated pretrial proceedings. This makes good sense because \ntransfers by the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation are based \non centralizing those cases to serve the convenience of the parties and \nwitnesses and to promote efficient judicial management.\n  For nearly 30 years, many transferee judges, following circuit and \ndistrict court case law, retained these multi-district cases for trial \nbecause the transferee judge and the parties were already familiar with \neach other and the facts of the case through the pretrial proceedings. \nThe Supreme Court in Lexecon Inc. v. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & \nLerach, 523 U.S. 26 (1998), however, found that this well-established \npractice was not authorized by the general venue provisions in the \nUnited States Code. Following the Lexecon ruling, the Judicial Panel on \nMulti-District Litigation must now remand each transferred case to its \noriginal district at the conclusion of the pretrial proceedings, unless \nthe case is already settled or otherwise terminated. This new process \nis costly, inefficient and time consuming.\n  The Multi-District Jurisdiction Act of 1999 seeks to restore the \npower of transferee judges to resolve multi-district cases as \nexpeditiously and fairly as possible. Our bipartisan bill amends \nsection 1407 of title 28 of the United States Code to allow a \ntransferee judge to retain cases for trial or transfer those cases to \nanother judicial district for trial in the interests of justice and for \nthe convenience of parties and witnesses. The legislation provides \ntransferee judges the flexibility they need to administer justice \nquickly and efficiently. Indeed, our legislation is supported by the \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts, the Judicial Conference of \nthe United States and the Department of Justice.\n  In addition, we have included a section in our bill to ensure \nfairness during the determination of compensatory damages by adding the \npresumption that the case will be remanded to the transferor court for \nthis phase of the trial. Specifically, this provision provides that to \nthe extent a case is tried outside of the transferor forum, it would be \nsolely for the purpose of a consolidated trial on liability, and if \nappropriate, punitive damages, and that the case must be remanded to \nthe transferor court for the purposes of trial on compensatory damages, \nunless the court to which the action has been transferred for trial \npurposes also finds, for the convenience of the parties and witnesses \nand in the interests of justice, that the action should be retained for \nthe determination of compensatory damages. This section is identical to \na bipartisan amendment proposed by Representative Berman and accepted \nby the House Judiciary Committee during its consideration of similar \nlegislation earlier this year.\n  Multi-district litigation generally involves some of the most complex \nfact-specific cases, which affect the lives of citizens across the \nnation. For example, multi-district litigation entails such national \nlegal matters as asbestos, silicone gel breast implants, diet drugs \nlike fen-phen, hemophiliac blood products, Norplant contraceptives and \nall major airplane crashes. In fact, as of February 1999, approximately \n140 transferee judges were supervising about 160 groups of multi-\ndistrict cases, with each group composed of hundreds, or even \nthousands, of cases in various stages of trial development.\n  But the efficient case management of these multi-district cases is a \nrisk after the Lexecon ruling. Judge John F. Nangle, Chairman of the \nJudicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation, recently testified before \nCongress that: ``Since Lexecon, significant problems have arisen that \nhave hindered the sensible conduct of multi-district litigation. \nTransferee judges throughout the United States have voiced their \nconcern to me about the urgent need to enact this legislation.''\n  Mr. President, Congress should listen to the concerned voices of our \nFederal Judiciary and swiftly send the Multi-District Jurisdiction Act \nof 1999 to the President for his signature into law.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \nsubstitute be agreed to, the bill be read a third time and passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements \nrelating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, and colleagues, this is the seventh time I \nhave come to the floor of the Senate in recent days to talk about the \nissue of Medicare coverage for prescription drugs. The reason I do so \nis I think it is so important that before we wrap up our work in this \nsession of Congress, we take action on this matter, given how many \nvulnerable senior citizens there are in this country who simply cannot \nafford their prescriptions.\n  There is just one bipartisan bill with respect to prescription drug \ncoverage now before the Senate. It is a piece of legislation known as \nthe SPICE Act, the Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act.\n  It is a bipartisan bill on which I have teamed with Senator Olympia \nSnowe of Maine; and it is one that the two of us are very hopeful this \nCongress will act on before we conclude our work.\n  There are some who think this issue is too controversial and too \ndifficult to tackle before the next election. I would note that it is \ngoing to be more than a year until the next election. We are going to \nhave a lot of senior citizens who are walking on an economic tightrope, \nevery week balancing their food costs against their fuel costs, and \ntheir fuel costs against their medical bills, who are not going to be \nable to pay for their prescriptions and their necessities if the Senate \ndecides to duck this issue and put it off until after the next \nelection. I think the reason we are sent here is to tackle issues and \nnot just put them off until after the election.\n  Over the last few months, Senator Snowe and I have worked with senior \ncitizen groups; we have worked with people in the pharmaceutical \nsector, in the insurance sector, various public- and private-sector \norganizations; and we believe the SPICE legislation that we have \ncrafted is the kind of bill that Members of the Senate can support.\n  In fact, as part of the budget, Senator Snowe and I teamed up, and we \noffered a specific funding plan. And 54 Members of the Senate are now \non record--they are now specifically on record--with respect to the \nSnowe-Wyden funding plan for paying for prescription drug benefits. So \nwe are now in a position, it seems to me, colleagues, to take specific \naction.\n  One of the reasons I have come to the floor tonight is my hope that \nwe can really show how urgent this need is.\n  What I have done, as the poster next to me says, is urge senior \ncitizens to send in copies of their prescription drug bills, directly \nto their Senator, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. I have decided I am \ngoing to, in my discussions on the floor each evening, read a portion \nof the letters I am receiving from seniors at home in Oregon.\n  I read about one group in the newspaper the other day who said it is \nnot really that urgent a need. More than 20 percent of the Nation's \nsenior citizens are spending over $1,000 a year out of pocket for their \nprescription medicine.\n  I read a couple of nights ago about an elderly woman from southern \nOregon whose income is just over $1,000 a month in Social Security. She \nspends more than half of it on her prescriptions.\n  Those are the kinds of accounts we are hearing again and again and \nagain. The fact is, our senior citizens are getting shellacked twice. \nFirst, Medicare doesn't cover prescriptions. That is the way the \nprogram began in 1965. I was director of the Gray Panthers at home for \nabout 7 years before I was elected to Congress. The need was very acute \nback then for prescription drug coverage. But today it is even more \nimportant, for two reasons.\n  First, the senior citizen, who not only gets no Medicare coverage for \ntheir prescriptions, is now subsidizing the big buyers such as the \nhealth maintenance organizations that are in a position to negotiate \nbig discounts. These big buyers, the health maintenance organizations, \nhave real bargaining power and clout. They go out and negotiate a \ndiscount; they get a break. If you are a senior citizen, for example, \nin Myrtle Creek, OR, or Philomath--I will read from those letters in a \nmoment--you end up subsidizing those big buyers. I don't think that is \nright.\n  In addition, since the days when we began to push, with the Gray \nPanthers, for prescription drug coverage, a lot of the new, important \nprescriptions are preventive in nature. I described several days ago an \nimportant anticoagulant drug that can help with a variety of ailments \nrelating to strokes. The cost of that anticoagulant drug is in the \nvicinity of about $1,000 a year. You have a full-scale stroke that can \ncome about if you don't get the medicine, and the cost can be $100,000 \na year.\n  When people ask me, can this country afford to cover prescription \ndrugs under Medicare, my view is, our country cannot afford not to do \nit. As part of this campaign we have launched in the Senate to have \nseniors send in, as this poster says, copies of their prescription drug \nbills, Senator Snowe and I have teamed up on a bipartisan kind of plan. \nI am going to read from these letters. I will take just a couple of \nminutes for that tonight.\n  Just a couple of days ago, I heard from a woman in Philomath, OR, who \nwrote me about her mother. Her mother had recently spent more than \n$2,220 on prescription drugs. The daughter said--this was particularly \npoignant, in my view--the only way her mother was able to, in effect, \ncover her prescription needs was that her mother was getting samples \nfrom the doctor. The fact that she spent more than $2,220 on \nprescription drugs and the year isn't even over yet is dramatized by \nthe fact that the cost would be much greater were it not for the fact \nthat she was getting samples to supplement what she was paying for. \nThat is the kind of account we are hearing from seniors in Oregon, as \nthey, as this poster says, send in copies of their prescription drug \nbills. I hope we will get more of that.\n\n  We need to deal with this issue on a bipartisan basis. Senator Snowe \nand I have chosen to model our program after the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefit Plan. The SPICE proposal we introduced is sort of a \nsenior citizens version of the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan. \nThe elderly population, of course, is different from that of the \nFederal workforce, but the model of trying to offer choices and options \nand alternatives to make sure there is competition in health care of \nthe kind Senator Graham has advocated in the past is very sensible. If \nit is good enough for Members of Congress, it certainly ought to be the \nkind of thing we look at to cover older people. It is especially \nimportant because it can be a model that prevents cost shifting on to \nother groups of citizens.\n  There are other proposals, for example, that in effect have Medicare \nsort of buying up all the prescription drugs and taking the lead as the \npurchaser. What concerns me about that approach is, I think you will \nhave massive cost shifting on to other groups of individuals. Nobody in \nthe Congress intentionally would want to see a proposal developed that \nwould, in effect, give a discount to folks on Medicare and then just \nhave the cost shifted over to somebody who was 27 years old and had a \ncouple of kids and was working hard and doing their best to get ahead \nin life. We have to use marketplace forces to develop and implement \nthis benefit.\n  The proposal I have introduced with Senator Snowe is one that uses \nthose marketplace forces. It would give seniors the kind of bargaining \npower a health maintenance organization and a big buying group would \nhave, but it wouldn't involve a lot of price controls. It wouldn't \ninvolve a lot of micromanagement. It wouldn't be sort of one-size-fits-\nall health care.\n  As we go ahead with this bipartisan campaign, the bill on which \nSenator Snowe and I have teamed up is, in fact, the only bipartisan \nmeasure now before the Senate. I am going to come to this floor as \noften as I can and urge seniors to send in copies of their prescription \ndrug bills directly to their Senator and just keep bringing to our \ncolleagues' attention the need for action on this issue.\n\n[[Page S13329]]\n\n  The second letter I want to describe tonight comes from an elderly \ncouple from my hometown in Portland who said they have already spent \n$1,750-plus on their prescription drug costs so far this year. They \nwrote: We have saved all our life, never knowing what health problems \nwould befall us. We are glad to pay our fair share, but the cost of \nprescription drugs is eating up our savings.\n  Finally, a constituent from Myrtle Creek has written that recently \nthey spent $700 on prescription medicines. This exceeds the so-called \naverage many of the experts in the beltway are talking about as not \nbeing that big a deal for senior citizens. This is a bill incurred by \nan older person from Myrtle Creek. We hear the same thing from \nPortland, OR. We hear the same thing from Philomath, OR. This is what \nwe are hearing all across this country.\n  It would be a terrible shame, in my view, for the Senate to say we \nare not going to act, we are going to let this become a big campaign \nissue in the 2000 election, and Democrats and Republicans can engage in \na lot of finger pointing and, in effect, sort of put out that the other \nside doesn't care, the other side isn't interested. We will end up \nseeing this issue drag on well into the next century.\n  I believe the Snowe-Wyden legislation, the only bipartisan bill now \nbefore the Senate on prescription drugs, may not be the last word on \nthis issue. It is not going to be enacted into law with every I dotted \nand every T crossed, as it has been proposed thus far, but I do believe \nit can serve as a model.\n  It is bipartisan. Fifty-four Members in the Senate are already on \nrecord as having cast a vote for the specific plan we have to fund this \nprogram. And so the opportunity to make the lives of older people in \nthis country better, to help those who are scrimping and not taking \ntheir drugs the way they ought to, to be able to do it in a way that \nuses marketplace kinds of forces and provides choices and options, just \nthe way our families get, seems to be an opportunity we cannot afford \nto pass up.\n\n  I know Senator Graham, who has done good work on the health care \nissue and the prescription issue as a member of the Finance Committee, \nis here to talk. The hour is late. But I intend to keep coming to the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate and pushing for action on this issue. There is \na bipartisan bill before the Senate now. This would be the kind of \nissue that could be a legacy for this session of the Congress. I intend \nto keep coming to the floor of the U.S. Senate, reading from the \nletters I am getting from home, urging seniors to do as this poster \nsays: Send in copies of your prescription drug bills.\n  I intend to come back to this floor again and again and again, until \nwe get action on this matter. For years, since the days when I was \ndirector of the Oregon Gray Panthers at home, I have had a dream that \nthe U.S. Congress would make sure that older people who aren't taking \ntheir medicines because they can't afford it would be able to get this \ncoverage.\n  The opportunity to team up with Senator Snowe has been a real \npleasure for me. She has been speaking out on this issue. I will \ncontinue to speak out on it, and we are going to do everything we can \nto make sure the U.S. Senate acts on this question and does it in this \nsession of the Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/27/senate-section/article/S13329-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13329-S13331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             IN HONOR OF THEODORE ROOSEVELT AND JOHN CHAFEE\n\n\n                        The National Park System\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor two visionary \nstatesmen--President Theodore Roosevelt and Senator John Chafee. Today, \nOctober 27, 1999, we celebrate what would have been President Theodore \nRoosevelt's 141st birthday. Last Friday, we celebrated John Chafee's \n77th--and much to our sadness his last.\n  Working at opposite ends of the 20th century, these two outstanding \nleaders contributed greatly to the cause of preserving our precious \nnatural resources for this and especially for future generations.\n  President Roosevelt was born on October 27, 1858, in New York City. \nHe is remembered as one of our finest Presidents. He is honored as such \nby being the only 20th century President to join Presidents Washington, \nJefferson, and Lincoln at Mount Rushmore.\n  In 1901, after the assassination of President McKinley, Theodore \nRoosevelt became America's youngest President. As a child, Roosevelt \nwas faced with poor health and asthma. To escape the pollution of New \nYork City, Roosevelt's father would often take him to Long Island for \nextended visits. It was there that Roosevelt began his lifelong \ndevotion to the outdoors and to vigorous exercise. His dedication to \nthe ``strenuous life'' was a hallmark of his career.\n  In 1884, his first wife, Alice Lee Roosevelt, and his mother died on \nthe same day. Roosevelt spent much of the next two years on his ranch, \nthe Elkhorn, located in the Badlands of the Dakota Territory.\n  Today, a portion of this ranch is included in the national park named \nin his honor--the Theodore Roosevelt National Park in North Dakota. \nHistory shows Roosevelt to be a true visionary as one reviews his many \naccomplishments. The Panama Canal, one of the world's engineering \nmarvels, would not have been complete without President Roosevelt's \ntenacious leadership. He is remembered by business and labor as a \n``trust buster'' who spearheaded the dissolution of a large railroad \nmonopoly in the Northwest using the Sherman Antitrust Act.\n  In 1905, Roosevelt won the Nobel Peace Prize for mediating an end to \nthe Russo-Japanese War.\n  But perhaps his greatest contribution to future generations of \nAmericans was his passionate advocacy of conservationism. The history \nof our Nation is marked by activism on public lands issues. The \nbeginning of the 19th century was marked by President Thomas \nJefferson's purchase of the Louisiana Territory. That one purchase \nadded almost 530 million acres to the United States. The Louisiana \nPurchase changed America from an eastern coastal Nation to a \ncontinental empire.\n  Roosevelt set the tone for public lands issues at the beginning of \nthe 20th century. His words and his actions created a new call to \nAmerica's environmental ethic. Theodore Roosevelt said, ``We must ask \nourselves if we are leaving for future generations an environment that \nis as good, or better, than what we found.''\n  He lived up to his challenge. Mr. President, listen to what Theodore \nRoosevelt contributed to the public lands legacy of the United States. \nDuring his period in the White House, from 1901 to 1909, Theodore \nRoosevelt designated 150 national forests; the first 51 Federal bird \nreservations; 5 national parks; the first 18 national monuments; the \nfirst 4 national game preserves; and the first 21 reclamation projects.\n  Theodore Roosevelt also established the National Wildlife Refuge \nSystem, beginning with Pelican Island in Florida, which was designated \nin 1903. Together, these projects equaled Federal protection for almost \n230 million acres--a land area equivalent to that of all the east coast \nStates from Maine to Florida and just under one-half of the area of the \nLouisiana Purchase.\n  Theodore Roosevelt's contributions to the public land trust cannot be \nequaled. Perhaps even greater was his contagious passion for the ethic \nof conservation that he managed to instill for the first time in \nAmerica's consciousness, the idea of conservation and environmental \nprotection as goals worthy of pursuit.\n  Mr. President, Senator John Chafee was a leader in the Theodore \nRoosevelt model. Senator Chafee was a major participant in every piece \nof environmental legislation that passed the Congress since the early \n1980s. He authored the Superfund program, created in 1980 to direct and \nfund the cleanup of hazardous waste dump sites and leaking underground \nstorage tanks.\n  In 1982, he sponsored the Coastal Barrier Resources Act, a law that \nresulted in the preservation of thousands of acres of coastline \nthroughout the Nation.\n  He led major reform of the Clean Water Act in 1986, introducing more \nthorough controls on industrial pollution and a new emphasis on non-\npoint source pollution.\n  He created the National Estuary Program to protect coastal resources \nand\n\n[[Page S13330]]\n\nsteered the bill to enactment over a Presidential veto in 1987.\n  In the 1980s, Senator Chafee turned his attention to the air, leading \nefforts to adopt the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, taking steps to \ncontrol acid rain and toxic chemical emissions.\n  In 1993, Senator Chafee wrote the law establishing the nation's first \nindoor air hazard research and response program.\n  With his clear head, methodical mind, and ability to broker a \ncompromise, Senator Chafee led us through these legislative battles to \ntoday's result--a legal infrastructure of environmental law that \nensures our own health and safety and preserves the public land trust \nestablished by Theodore Roosevelt.\n  On this day, as we celebrate the 141st anniversary of the birth of \nTheodore Roosevelt and pay tribute to the work of Senator John Chafee, \nwe must ask ourselves, ``Can we meet the challenge posed by Theodore \nRoosevelt and leave an environment for future generations that is as \ngood or better than it was when we found it?'' Are we worthy inheritors \nof the legacy of John Chafee?\n  Senator Chafee leaves us with his model to follow as a member of this \nbody which took Roosevelt's challenge to heart and led the Environment \nand Public Works Committee to take actions on the environment that have \nleft us better off than when he arrived in the Senate.\n  Sadly, I argue that we, the Senate, are struggling with a backlog of \nneglect and are ill prepared to assure the well being of one of the \nmost prominent examples of America's environmental heritage: our \nnational parks.\n  In 1916, Congress created the National Park Service ``. . . to \nconserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the \nwildlife therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such \nmanner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the \nenjoyment of future generations.''\n  My friend and colleague, the Presiding Officer, and I have the \nprivilege of living in two of our States which have been especially \nblessed by God and blessed by preceding generations willing to take the \nsteps to protect the beauties of the Yellowstone, or of an Everglades. \nThe challenge that we have is worthy of the standard that has been set \nby Theodore Roosevelt and the others who have made it possible for us \nto enjoy those wonders of nature.\n  Today, the ``unimpaired'' status of our national parks is at-risk.\n  On April 22, 1999, the National Parks and Conservation Association \nidentified this year's ten-most endangered parks.\n  In his opening remarks, Mr. Tom Kiernan, president of the NPCA, \nstated that these parks were chosen not because they are the only parks \nwith endangered resources, but because they demonstrate the resource \ndamages that are occurring at all of our parks.\n  These parks demonstrate the breadth of the threats facing our park \nsystem.\n  For example, Chaco Culture National Historical Park in Chaco Canyon, \nNew Mexico, contains the remains of thirteen major structures that \nrepresent the highest point of Pueblo pre-Columbian civilization.\n  What is the status of this great world treasure?\n  In the words of the NPCA, it is ``. . . falling victim to time and \nneglect.'' Weather damage, inadequate preservation, neglected \nmaintenance, tourism impacts, and potential resource development on \nadjacent lands threaten the long-term life of these structures.\n  Another example: All of the parks in the Florida Everglades region \nwere included on the list of the most endangered.\n  In this area, decades of manipulation of the water system led to loss \nof significant quantities of Florida's water supply to tide each day, a \n90-percent decline in the wading bird population, invasion of non-\nnative plants and animals, and shrinking wildlife habitat.\n  Mr. President, you will be particularly interested and saddened by \nwhat the National Park and Conservation Association calls Yellowstone \nNational Park, the ``poster child for the neglect that has marred our \nnational parks.''\n  We have all heard Senator Thomas and others speak about the \ndegradation of the sewage handling and treatment system at Yellowstone \nNational Park--a situation that has caused spills into Yellowstone Lake \nand nearby meadows, sending more than 225,000 gallons of sewage into \nYellowstone's waterways, threatening the water quality of this \nresource.\n  I recently had an opportunity to visit yet another example of \nneglect, Ellis Island National Monument in New York Harbor. The state \nof the historical resources in this important part of the history and \nheritage of America--the space through which millions of people first \ngained their exposure and appreciation and commitment to America--is \nunconscionable.\n  While there are a handful of buildings that have been restored to \ntheir previous level of majesty, over 30 buildings where immigrants \ncame to the United States lie abandoned, in disrepair, and \ndeteriorating.\n  Particularly troubling was damage to the hospital buildings, which, \nwhen restored, will be a valuable tool in recreating an important era \nin our nation's history.\n  The hospital on Ellis Island provided care for immigrants who were \ndetained temporarily for medical reasons.\n  This marked one of our country's earliest efforts at providing for \npublic health and disease control and prevention.\n  Broken windows and leaky roofs have allowed the elements to wreak \nhavoc on these buildings and trees are sprouting from the floorboards \nof what was once an immigrant dormitory.\n  Lead paint flakes fall from the walls and rats scurry down historic \nhallways.\n  There are efforts being made to block further deterioration, but the \nexisting damage is extensive.\n  Small scale actions to prevent further destruction are wholly \ninadequate in the face of the extensive damage to these buildings which \nare so important to our nation's history.\n  Mr. President, the sad circumstances of Chaco Canyon, of the \nEverglades, of Yellowstone, of Ellis Island, the sad circumstances of \nthese few examples by no means mean that they are the extent of the \nchallenge of our national parks.\n  In fact, estimates of the maintenance backlog at our national parks \nreach as high as $3.5 billion. The National Park Service has now \ndeveloped a 5-year plan to meet this requirement based on its ability \nto execute funds and the priorities of the National Park System.\n  This year the National Park Service requested $194 million in order \nto commence the process of meeting this accumulated backlog of \nmaintenance needs.\n  I am pleased to say, Mr. President, that I believe Members of \nCongress should take some pride in the fact that as a result of this \nyear's appropriations process the House and Senate have modified the \nNational Park Service request of $194 million and increased it to \n$224.5 million. This is a very commendable step forward.\n  I am proud of the actions of the appropriations committees. I know \nthat there is likely to be further executive and legislative \nconsiderations of the budget of the National Park Service before we \ncomplete our action. But I hope that we will continue to maintain this \nlevel of commitment to meeting the backlog of urgent maintenance needs \nin our national parks.\n  Although these actions demonstrate a willingness to work to meet the \nneeds of the National Park Service, I believe we cannot adequately \naddress the extent of needs, including the needs of natural resources \nwithin the Park System and the external threats to those natural \nresources with a piecemeal approach.\n  There is a limit to what we can do with the tools we have today. The \nSenate is working to fund 21st century needs for construction and \nnatural resource preservation using a 19th century, year-to-year annual \nappropriations process. What the National Park Service needs is a \nsustained, reliable funding source that will allow it to develop \nintelligent plans based on a prioritization of needs with confidence \nthat the funds will be available when they are necessary to complete \nthose plans. This approach will allow common sense to prevail when \nprojects are prioritized for funding.\n  Let me use the example which is closest to me. That is the effort \nabout to be launched for restoration of the Florida Everglades. We are \nnow over half a century into man's major manipulation of the Florida \nEverglades, a\n\n[[Page S13331]]\n\nmanipulation which has had many positive effects in terms of protecting \nmillions of people from the ravages of flooding but has also very \nfundamentally changed the character of the Florida Everglades. The \nCorps of Engineers has presented to the Congress its recommendation of \nhow to remedy the scars that have been imposed on the Everglades. If \nauthorized by this Congress, the Everglades restoration plan of the \nCorps of Engineers will be the most extensive restoration of an \nenvironmental system ever undertaken in our Nation's history and, in \nall probability, in the history of the world. It will be an effort at \nthe beginning of the 21st century of the scale, boldness, and challenge \nthat  the Panama Canal was at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\n  This is also going to be a project which will challenge America \nfinancially. The estimate is that over the 20 years to complete this \nproject, the total cost will be approximately $8 billion. The State of \nFlorida will pay half; the Federal Government will pay half. The math \nindicates that for each year for the next 20 years, the average demand \non Federal resources for this restoration project will be approximately \n$200 million.\n  I think it is critical before we begin this restoration we have the \nmaximum assurance of the resources necessary to complete the \nrestoration. I use the analogy of open-heart surgery. If one is going \nto open up a system and take a great knife and begin to cleave the \nchanges that have occurred in the Everglades over the last 50 years so \nthat at the conclusion of this operation we will have a healthier, more \nnatural system, it is incumbent upon those who start the surgery to be \nassured they will have the resources to complete the operation. Failure \nto have those resources at any stage throughout this 20-year process \nwill certainly result in the death of the patient.\n  We have taken some steps to attempt to assure a more reliable source \nof funds for the National Park Service. Your colleague, Senator Thomas, \nled the way to reform with his landmark legislation on the National \nPark Service called Vision 2000. This legislation adopted for the first \ntime both concessions reform and science-based decisionmaking on \nresource needs within the Park Service. We took a big step forward last \nyear with the extension of the fee demonstration program. The fee \ndemonstration program allows individual parks to charge entrance fees \nand to use a portion of the proceeds for maintenance backlog and \nnatural resource projects. This action generated about $100 million \nannually for the Park System.\n  Now it is time to take the next step. Earlier this year with Senators \nReid and my colleague, Senator Mack, we introduced legislation entitled \n``The National Park Preservation Act.'' This legislation would provide \ndedicated funding to the National Park Service to restore and conserve \nthe natural resources within our Park System. This legislation seeks to \naddress the long-term efforts required to truly restore and protect our \nnatural, cultural, and historic resources within the National Park \nService.\n  This legislation would allocate funds derived from the use of a \nnonrenewable resource, our offshore drilling in the outer continental \nshelf, to recover the American resource of oil and gas. We would then \nconvert those funds derived from the Federal royalty on offshore oil \nand gas drilling for a program of restoration and preservation of our \nnatural, cultural, and historic resources within the National Park \nService. These funds provided by our bill would assure that each year \nthe National Park Service would have the resources it needed to restore \nand prevent damages to its resources.\n  At the beginning of this century, at a time of relative tranquility, \nPresident Theodore Roosevelt managed to instill a nation with a \ntradition of conservation with this simple challenge: Can we leave this \nworld a better place for future generations?\n  At the end of this century, we honor Senator John Chafee who leaves a \nlegacy of a legal infrastructure that provides a foundation upon which \nwe can continue to meet President Theodore Roosevelt's challenge. Let \nus keep the vision of these great leaders in mind as we embark together \non our efforts to protect  the National Park System into the new \ncentury.\n\n  In the words of President Theodore Roosevelt: Nothing short of \ndefending the country during wartime compares in importance with the \ngreat central task of leaving this land even a better land for our \ndescendents than it is for us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/27/senate-section/article/S13331-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
