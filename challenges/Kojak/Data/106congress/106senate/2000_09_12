Mr. President, today the Senate will resume debate on the \nChina PNTR legislation. Under the order, the time until 10 a.m. will be \nequally divided for closing remarks on the Byrd amendment regarding \nsubsidies. Therefore, the first vote of the day will occur at 10 a.m. I \nunderstand there may be a possibility that Senator Byrd will request a \nvoice vote rather than a rollcall vote. But depending on that request, \nfollowing the vote, debate will resume on the Thompson amendment No. \n4132. The Senate will recess for the weekly party conferences from \n12:30 p.m. to 2:15 p.m. At 2:15, Senator Helms will be recognized to \noffer an amendment which will be debated at that time. Further \namendments are anticipated; therefore, Senators can expect votes \nthroughout the day and into the evening.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I say, through the Chair to my friend from Nebraska, we \nwere also informed that Senator Byrd would agree to a voice vote on \nthis. So I think it would be to everyone's best interests that those \nwho have amendments to offer would offer the amendments as quickly as \npossible.\n  When Senator Byrd gets here, it is my understanding he wants to say a \nfew words prior to the voice vote on his amendment. But I think it \nwould be appropriate that the Senate be advised that there likely will \nnot be a recorded vote at 10 o'clock this morning, so Senators should \nbe about their other business.\n  I also say to the acting leader, we hope those who are managing the \nvarious appropriations bills that have passed the Senate and have \npassed the House would do whatever they can to get the conference \nprocess underway. We have a tremendous amount of work to do. And while \nwe are not debating appropriations bills in the evening, as we were \nlast week, there is still a lot of work to be done on those. We hope \nthe conferences, including engaging the administration, would be \nongoing at this time so we can have an end game around here to complete \nthose bills.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/12/senate-section/article/S8353-6", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of H.R. 4444, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4444) to authorize extension of \n     nondiscriminatory treatment (normal trade relations \n     treatment) to the People's Republic of China, and to \n     establish a framework for relations between the United States \n     and the People's Republic of China.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Wellstone amendment No. 4118, to require that the President \n     certify to Congress that the People's Republic of China has \n     taken certain actions with respect to ensuring human rights \n     protection.\n       Wellstone amendment No. 4119, to require that the President \n     certify to Congress that\n\n[[Page S8354]]\n\n     the People's Republic of China is in compliance with certain \n     Memoranda of Understanding regarding prohibition on import \n     and export of prison labor products.\n       Wellstone amendment No. 4120, to require that the President \n     certify to Congress that the People's Republic of China has \n     responded to inquiries regarding certain people who have been \n     detained or imprisoned and has made substantial progress in \n     releasing from prison people incarcerated for organizing \n     independent trade unions.\n       Wellstone amendment No. 4121, to strengthen the rights of \n     workers to associate, organize and strike.\n       Smith (of New Hampshire) amendment No. 4129, to require \n     that the Congressional-Executive Commission monitor the \n     cooperation of the People's Republic of China with respect to \n     POW/MIA issues, improvement in the areas of forced abortions, \n     slave labor, and organ harvesting.\n       Byrd amendment No. 4117, to require disclosure by the \n     People's Republic of China of certain information relating to \n     future compliance with World Trade Organization subsidy \n     obligations.\n       Byrd amendment No. 4131, to improve the certainty of the \n     implementation of import relief in cases of affirmative \n     determinations by the International Trade Commission with \n     respect to market disruption to domestic producers of like or \n     directly competitive products.\n       Thompson amendment No. 4132, to provide for the application \n     of certain measures to covered countries in response to the \n     contribution to the design, production, development, or \n     acquisition of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons or \n     ballistic or cruise missiles.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Does my friend from Nebraska have a statement?\n  Mr. HAGEL. No, I do not.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4117\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what is the question before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, No. 4117.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. I will be direct and to the point. This \namendment requires the U.S. Trade Representative, acting through the \nWorking Party on the Accession of China to the World Trade \nOrganization, to obtain a commitment from China to disclose information \nabout state-owned enterprises that export products and government \nassistance given to those state-owned enterprises. My amendment also \nrequests a timetable for China's compliance with WTO subsidy \nobligations.\n  Even the staunchest supporters of permanent normal trade relations \nwith China recognize that U.S. trade with China will continue to be an \nuphill battle insofar as fairness is concerned. The administration \nacknowledges this fact, and my good friend Senator Roth stated the same \nonly yesterday.\n  There are profound implications to Sino-American relations as a \nresult of granting PNTR to China. State-owned enterprises continue to \nbe the most significant source of employment in most areas in China, \nand some reports suggest that these subsidized enterprises account for \nas much as 65 percent of the jobs in many areas of China.\n  Government control reigns supreme in China. My amendment sends a \nmessage that the U.S. Senate seeks transparency in China's likely \naccession to the World Trade Organization, WTO. My amendment places \nMembers on record as demanding China's compliance with the promises \nthat China has made under the bilateral trade agreement that it signed \nwith the United States.\n  Opponents of my amendment state that the amendment is redundant and \nflawed on two bases. First, it was argued that the administration is \nalready required to condition the extension of permanent normal trade \nrelations with the People's Republic of China on a finding that China's \nstate-owned enterprises are not disruptive to our trading interests.\n  With all due respect to my colleagues, with this bit of news that the \nsubsidy issue rests on some administrative conclusion, I began \nimmediately working double time to get this amendment passed. This news \nsounded the alarm. I think it would be better to have the information \ndirect, and to make our own conclusions. The Senate has that latitude!\n  In addition, if the President already has information to certify that \nChina's state-owned enterprises are not disruptive to our trading \ninterests, my amendment should present no problem. Let Members see the \nraw statistics. Let Members of Congress make up their own minds.\n  What is the Administration trying to hide? I will have more \nconfidence in what the administration says if I can review the material \nmyself, and if Congress can review it.\n  I have the same limited confidence in the proposed administrative \nreview team that is supposed to keep an eye on China, which, as \nopponents of my amendment mentioned, the specifics on how this review \nteam will operate has not yet been determined. Are Senators willing to \nleave this matter to fate?\n  The opponents of my amendment also mentioned, and it is true, that \nChina signed a bilateral agreement with the United States that \nproclaims that China will cease the use of subsidies prohibited under \nthe WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM \nAgreement), including those subsidies contingent upon export \nperformance and subsidies contingent upon the use of domestic over \nimported goods, which are strictly prohibited under the SCM agreement. \nThe WTO subsidy agreements do, indeed, state that many subsidies are \nprohibited and shall not be allowed. I'm all for that!\n  Why should we not know this information? Help me find out by voting \nin support of this amendment! Help me provide the U.S. steel industry, \nand other industries, with an assurance--based on more than a nod from \nthe administration--that there are no illegal Chinese subsidies.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, this side yields back all time as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The amendment (No. 4117) was rejected.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I am prepared to make a statement relating \nto Senator Thompson's amendment. However, I understand my colleague \nfrom Iowa has a scheduling conflict and therefore needs to complete a \nstatement by 10:10. I therefore ask unanimous consent that Senator \nGrassley be recognized for up to 8 minutes and that I be recognized \nfollowing his statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--I don't \nintend to object if I have an opportunity to follow--I ask that I may \nbe recognized following Senator Hagel.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I revise my unanimous consent.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask \nunanimous consent that after Senator Kennedy speaks, it be in order for \nme to bring my amendment to the floor.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I further revise my unanimous consent \nrequest to include Senator Wellstone's request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon the \ndisposition of the amendment by Mr. Helms, my amendment at the desk be \nmade the pending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4132\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as a co-sponsor of Senator Thompson's \nlegislation on weapons proliferation, I\n\n[[Page S8355]]\n\nwant to tell my colleagues why I will not support this, or any other \neffort, to amend H.R. 4444, the legislation to authorize the permanent \nextension of nondiscriminatory trade treatment to the People's Republic \nof China.\n  First, I want to say that I fully agree with Senator Thompson's \ngoals. He wants to reduce the threat posed to the United States by the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  So do I.\n  He wants to curb the transfer of technologies to rogue nations that \nmight destabilize regional security, threaten our allies, or endanger \nUnited States forces.\n  And so do I.\n  In my view, this Administration has not done nearly enough to \nsafeguard the United States from the growing threat of nuclear \nproliferation.\n  You don't have to take my word for it.\n  For anyone who thinks that the weapons anti-proliferation efforts of \nthis administration have been adequate, and that the world is a safer \nplace under the Clinton-Gore team, just take a look at the Cox \nCommission Report.\n  Or the report of the Rumsfeld Commission.\n  Both of these reports are compelling, and highly disturbing.\n  But, this is neither the time nor the place to deal with these \nissues.\n  The real issue today is whether we will approve this measure to \nextend permanent normal trade relations with China, and thereby allow \nthe United States to take advantage of a market-opening trade agreement \nwe helped negotiate.\n  An agreement that will mean new sales, more jobs, and increased \nprosperity for America's farmers, ranchers, and agricultural producers, \nour service providers, and our manufacturing sector.\n  I want to make this very clear:\n  A vote to amend PNTR, at this late stage, is a vote against PNTR.\n  If we change so much as one word of this PNTR legislation, it will \nnot be consistent with the legislation passed by the House of \nRepresentatives, and will be sent back to that chamber.\n  With less than 20 legislative days to go in this session of Congress, \nthat would kill the PNTR bill for this year.\n  And if PNTR is defeated, China will not suffer.\n  China will still enter the WTO, whether we normalize our trade \nrelations with them or not.\n  If China enters the WTO, and we have not approved permanent normal \ntrade relations status, our farmers, our service providers, our \nmanufacturers will be forced to sit on the sidelines. Our competitors \nfrom Europe, Asia, and Canada will have China's market all to \nthemselves. They will win a competitive advantage over us. Perhaps a \npermanent one.\n  The only ones who would suffer would be our farmers, and our workers.\n  Putting ourselves at this sort of disadvantage will hurt our economy.\n  And it will not help our national security one bit.\n  The problem I have with linking trade with national security, or with \nhuman rights, or with any other worthy cause, is that this sort of \nlinkage assumes that we can only do one thing, but not the other.\n  We can either have human rights in China, or we can have free trade.\n  We can either protect our national security, or we can trade with \nChina and jeopardize our security.\n  I believe these assumptions are false.\n  Our relationship with China is complex. It has more than one \ndimension.\n  And I believe the United States is big enough, smart enough, tough \nenough, and sophisticated enough to have more than a one-dimensional \nChina policy.\n  We can have an effective human rights policy with China.\n  We can have a tough and effective national security policy.\n  And we can have a trade policy that serves our vital national \ninterests.\n  We can do all of this at the same time, and do it well.\n  But not if we amend this bill and send it back to the House.\n  One last thing.\n  I read this morning that thousands of anti-globalization protesters \nrioted today at the meeting of the World Economic Forum in Melbourne, \nAustralia. Scores of people were hurt. Almost one quarter of the \ndelegates were locked out of the summit by the rioters.\n  One Australian official was trapped for almost an hour in his \nvandalized car.\n  Leaders of the riot claimed they were successful in blockading the \nconference.\n  ``I think we can claim victory tonight'', one of the protest leaders \nsaid.\n  The Melbourne riots come right on the heels of similar anti-\nglobalization riots in Davos, Switzerland, Washington, DC, and last \nDecember in Seattle.\n  These riots are profoundly disturbing. They appear to be growing in \nintensity and frequency around the world. And they are terribly \nmisguided.\n  Since the United States helped create the global trading system in \n1947, free trade has lifted millions of people out of poverty.\n  As poor nations have gained new prosperity, they have improved the \nhealth and education of their citizens.\n  They have invested in new technologies to clean up the environment.\n  And all the nations of the world's trade community have helped keep \nthe peace, even during the bleak days of the Cold War.\n  Today, China is on the verge of rejoining the world trade community \nit abandoned in 1950.\n  A vote for normalizing China's trade relations with the United States \non a permanent basis will reaffirm our support for a member-driven, \nrules-based trading system.\n  It will highlight the importance of trade as a way to achieve \nprosperity for all, including the world's poorest nations.\n  And it will repudiate those who would tear down the most successful \nmultilateral trade forum the world has ever known.\n  I urge my colleagues to support a clean PNTR bill, with no \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise this morning to urge my colleagues \nto oppose the Thompson amendment.\n  First, this is not a debate about whether national security or trade \nis the highest responsibility and priority of our Government. Of \ncourse, America's national security takes precedence over all other \npriorities. It is not helpful when we in this Chamber hear references \nto putting ``trade dollars and business interests ahead of national \nsecurity.'' There is not one Member in this body who does not put \nAmerica's national security interests ahead of all other interests, \nincluding trade interests. The national security interests of this \ncountry come first for all of us.\n  That is not the issue. We need to understand very clearly the \nunderlying bill granting China permanent normal trade relations. In \ngranting PNTR to China, we allow our businesses and farmers the \nopportunity to take advantage of all the far reaching market-opening \nconcessions China made to the United States when it signed the \nbilateral trade agreement with America last November. PNTR does not \nchange or does not enhance China's access to America's markets. China \nhas had access to our markets for years. It changes America's access to \nChina's markets, which we have not had. There are no American trade \nconcessions to China in PNTR. Our markets have long been open to China.\n  Voting down PNTR means throwing away what the Chinese have finally \nagreed to do--give to our businesses and farmers a fair shot at their \nmarkets. We must be perfectly clear on this point as we continue this \ndebate on PNTR. That is the issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Thompson amendment, not because I \nthink Senator Thompson is wrong about proliferation; quite the \nopposite. The proliferation of missile technology and weapons of mass \ndestruction clearly represents one of the most serious threats to the \nsecurity of the United States. It is precisely because it is such a \nserious problem, with real implications for all Americans--by the way, \nimplications for the world--that it needs to be treated seriously and \nresponsibly.\n  Tacking this amendment to PNTR without any consideration in any \ncommittee of jurisdiction, without one hearing from proliferation \nexperts,\n\n[[Page S8356]]\n\nwithout understanding the national security, geopolitical, and economic \nconsequences for America, would be irresponsible.\n  Every Senator in this body agrees with Senator Thompson about the \nimportance of stemming the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \ntechnology. I strongly disagree with his approach. His amendment would \nbe bad for American nonproliferation efforts, bad for America's \neconomic and trade interests, and bad for American national security. \nProliferation is a global problem with implications for the security of \nthe United States and all of our allies and friends across the world.\n  We cannot deal effectively with proliferation on a unilateral basis. \nThat approach will be ineffective and will only diminish our ability to \ninfluence the proliferator. We must have the help of our allies and our \nfriends. It is folly to believe that unilateral sanctions by one nation \nwill stop any nation from its proliferation activities, if that is the \nintent. It isn't that simple. History has shown clearly that unilateral \nsanctions are unworkable tools of foreign policy. They end up injuring \nthe interests of the sanctioning nation. The only time a unilateral \nsanction may be effective is when it covers a unique American product \nor technology for which there is no foreign availability. Most of all, \nthe items and technologies covered by the Thompson amendment do not fit \nthis category. If we prohibit the sale of these items and technologies \nwithout ensuring that our allies and friends are on board, we simply \ndiminish our influence over the target country. At the heart of the \ndebate is how best to influence the behavior of proliferating nations.\n\n  Unilateral sanctions will not encourage more responsible behavior on \nthe part of China or any other country. This amendment might terminate \na number of assistance programs that are clearly in America's interests \nto continue. For example, one of the sanctions in the Thompson \namendment calls for a cutoff in Export-Import Bank financing for \nexports to the target country. Now, Export-Import Bank financing is \ndesigned to assist American exporters in their efforts to compete in \nforeign markets for business. It does not and has never been designed \nto assist foreigners. Cutting off Export-Import Bank financing hurts \nAmerican exports. It is hard to imagine how this could have a positive \neffect on the target country's proliferation behavior.\n  The American people are going to elect a new American President in 2 \nshort months. Proliferation will be a major issue for the new \nPresident. The new President and his team must come up with a \ncomprehensive strategy for dealing with it. It is not in the best \ninterests of our national security to handicap our new President by \ntying his hands with the provisions in this amendment. I believe that \nChina's entry into the WTO, the World Trade Organization, and our \ngranting of PNTR to China, is of enormous strategic importance to the \nUnited States. It is not only a matter of trade. It is not only about \nleveling the playing field for American businesses and farmers who have \nnever had a fair shot at China's markets. At its core, it is about \nhelping to set China on the road to becoming a responsible member of \nthe global community. It is about taking advantage of an unprecedented \nopportunity to help the Chinese people gain more control over their own \ndestinies.\n\n  We have heard, over the last few days, about human rights, religious \nrights, freedoms. All encompass this dynamic. Do we believe that we \ninfluence the behavior of a totalitarian nation to be better to its \npeople and give its people more opportunities and enhance their lives, \ngive them more control over their own destinies, by walking away from \nsuch a relationship? I do not think so. It has never been proven to be \nthe case in history, and I do not think it will be proven to be the \ncase this time.\n  WTO membership does not permit the Chinese Government to exercise the \nkind of control over people's lives as it has over the past 50 years. \nMembership in the WTO requires the Chinese Government to undertake \npainful economic and legal reforms and to open its markets, open its \nsociety. Is this perfect? Of course not. Are there flaws? Of course \nthere are. Are there imperfections? Of course there are. Will there be \nproblems implementing it? Of course there will be. All of these things \nare in America's strategic interest, however. We need to support \nChina's accession to the WTO and grant them PNTR.\n  But if we attach this amendment, then we will not pass PNTR this \nyear. As my friend from Iowa so succinctly put it: It will go down. And \nin whose best interest is that? Let us not forget that trade and \nprosperity encourage and enhance freedom, peace, and stability in the \nworld.\n  This amendment would also have a negative impact on our ability to \ngather intelligence on proliferators. The amendment requires the \nPresident to report to the Congress the names of every suspected \nproliferator in an unclassified report. Although this amendment urges \nthe President to do this in a way that protects sensitive intelligence \nsources, it is unclear, of course, how that will happen. How will \nsources be protected if Congress follows the expedited voting \nprocedures in this amendment for overturning a Presidential \ndetermination that sanctions should not be imposed for national \nsecurity reasons? How will we debate the correctness of the President's \ndecision without talking about the intelligence information that led to \nthe President's decision in the first place? It is impossible. Do we \nbelieve that by exposing our intelligence sources, by telling the world \nwhat we suspect or know, we can have a positive effect on \nproliferation?\n  We invest millions and millions of dollars and engage in multiyear \nprojects to gain intelligence on proliferation activities around the \nworld. We should not jeopardize that effort by having the President \nissue an unclassified report to Congress that lays out exactly what we \nknow and how we were able to determine what we know.\n  The amendment also seeks to involve our capital markets in foreign \npolicy issues. I do not think--and this is as kindly as I can say it--\nthat this is a wise course of action under any circumstances. America \nis stronger because the world regards our markets, our capital markets, \nour financial markets, as the most trustworthy, honest, stable, and \nmost fairly regulated in the world. In no place in our present system \nare America's capital markets used as a device of foreign policy. This \nwould be dangerously irresponsible and unprecedented, and this would be \ndone without one congressional hearing to examine the consequences of \nsuch action.\n\n  America is the preeminent capital market in the world, but that \nposition is under constant challenge. International investors can move \ntheir money, issue their stocks, access capital anywhere in the world, \nwith the click of a mouse. Why would we want to inject new political \nredtape and risks and uncertainty into a system that hangs on such a \nprecarious balance? For what? Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan \nhas been quoted on numerous occasions in the last few days on this \nissue. I remind my colleagues what Chairman Greenspan said about the \nThompson proposal:\n\n       So a most fundamental concern about this particular \n     amendment is, it doesn't have any capacity of which I am \n     aware to work. And by being put in effect, the only thing \n     that strikes me as a reasonable expectation is it can harm us \n     more than it would harm others.\n\n  This amendment would cast a long shadow of doubt over the American \nfinancial market system. This is not in the best interests of America.\n  I oppose this amendment because it has never received any \nconsideration in any committee of jurisdiction. We have not heard from \nproliferation experts as to how this amendment would affect our \nnational security. Proliferation is too serious, much too serious to \ndeal with it in this manner. How much time have all our colleagues had \nto understand this, to develop an appreciation for the consequences of \nthis action? How much time have we put into this? We know there have \nbeen four versions. The first I believe that any of us had a chance to \nlook at this was yesterday. That is not responsible legislation.\n  I oppose this amendment because it employs unilateral sanctions which \nhistory has proven are an ineffective way to achieve foreign policy \ngoals. The amendment would tie the hands of the next President before \nhe has had a chance to develop a comprehensive\n\n[[Page S8357]]\n\nglobal nonproliferation policy. It would jeopardize intelligence \nsources and would cut off programs that are designed to benefit \nAmerican exporters such as the Export-Import Bank. None of this makes \nany sense. These consequences would be very harmful to America's \ninterests. I oppose this amendment because it injects foreign policy \nconsiderations into our financial regulatory and market systems. This \nwould start us down a very dangerous and unprecedented path that would \nultimately weaken our markets and consequently weaken this country.\n  The underlying bill, PNTR, is of strategic significance to the United \nStates. Passage of this bill, coupled with China's entering into the \nWTO, will help set China on the path toward economic and political \nreform, which is clearly in our national interest. It is clearly in the \ninterests of the world. If we attach the Thompson amendment or any \namendment to PNTR, we effectively kill PNTR this year and maybe for \nsome time to come.\n  For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, \nall amendments to PNTR, and strongly support PNTR.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I believe we have a unanimous consent agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. The Senator from \nMassachusetts is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/12/senate-section/article/S8357-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8357-S8359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know we are very much involved in this \nextremely important decision on the question of trade with China, but I \ndo want to take a few moments this morning to address another issue \nwhich I think is of central concern to families across this country.\n  I think it is particularly appropriate that we give additional focus \nand attention to the priority of education policy as we are coming into \nthe final days of this session of Congress. I think there is a \nheightened interest in this issue as some 53 million children are going \nback to school. They have started going back to school in the last 10 \ndays and are going back to school this week. And, fifteen million \nchildren are going to colleges, going back to school now, this week and \nnext.\n  Parents are wondering what the circumstances will be for their \nchildren this school year and in the future, and who is going to ensure \ntheir children are going to get an adequate education and will move \nahead. Parents understand full well that education is key to the future \nfor their children and, obviously, education is key to our country's \nfuture as we are moving more and more into a new information-age and \ntechnologically-advanced global economy. This is a matter of enormous \nurgency.\n  We understand that there is a fundamental responsibility for the \neducation of children in the elementary and secondary high schools of \nthis country at the local and State level and that the role of the \nFederal Government is much more limited. Approximately 7 cents out of \nevery dollar that is spent locally actually comes from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  In my travels around my State of Massachusetts, in talking to \nparents, they are interested in a partnership. They are interested in \ntheir children doing well. They want support for programs that work, \nand they are less interested in the division of authority between local \nand State governments and the participation of Congress in assisting \nacademic achievement.\n  The backbone of congressional participation in the education of \nchildren is the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That is an act \nof enormous importance. It is not only myself who is saying this, but \nwe have the statements of the majority leader, Senator Lott, who in \nJanuary 1999 indicated:\n\n       Education is going to be a central issue this year. . . . \n     For starters, we must reauthorize the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act. That is important.\n\n  Remarks to the Conference of Mayors on January 29, 1999:\n\n       But education is going to have a lot of attention, and it's \n     not just going to be words. . . .\n\n  Press conference, June 22, 1999:\n\n       Education is number one on the agenda for Republicans in \n     the Congress this year.\n\n  Remarks to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, February 1, 2000:\n\n       We're going to work very hard on education. I have \n     emphasized that every year I've been majority leader. . . . \n     And Republicans are committed to doing that.\n\n  A speech to the National Conference of State Legislatures, February \n3, 2000:\n\n       We must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act. . . . Education will be a high priority in this \n     Congress.\n\n  Congress Daily, April 20, 2000:\n\n       . . . Lott said last week his top priorities in May include \n     agriculture sanctions bill, Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act reauthorization, and passage of four \n     appropriations bills.\n\n  Senate, May 1:\n\n       This is very important legislation. I hope we can debate it \n     seriously and have amendments in the education area. Let's \n     talk education.\n\n  Press Stakeout, May 2.\n\n       Question: Senator, on ESEA, have you scheduled a cloture \n     vote on that?\n       Senator Lott: No, I haven't scheduled a cloture vote. . . . \n     But education is number one in the minds of the American \n     people all across the country and every State, including my \n     own State. For us to have a good, healthy, and even a \n     protracted debate and amendments on education I think is the \n     way to go.\n\n  Those are the assurances we have been given by the majority leader, \nand we have had 6 days of discussion about elementary education. Two of \nthose days were discussion only. We had a total of eight amendments, \nseven rollcalls, one voice vote, and three of those seven were \nvirtually unanimous. So we have not had this debate which not only the \nmajority leader has said is important, but which families believe is \nimportant. The reason they believe it is important is because of the \nsubstance of education policy that will be included in that debate. I \nremind the Senate where we are on the expansion of the number of \nchildren enrolled in school. In K-12 enrollment, it is at an all-time \nhigh. In 1990, 46 million K-12 children were enrolled, and by the year \n2000, 53 million children. There are increasing pressures on local \ncommunities across the country.\n\n  This chart shows that student enrollment will continue to rise over \nthe next century. There are 53 million students enrolled in the year \n2000, but if you look at the projections, 94 million are estimated to \nbe enrolled by the year 2100--41 million more students over the next \ncentury, virtually doubling the Nation's population in education which \nwill require building schools and hiring more qualified teachers all \nacross this country.\n  This is a matter of enormous importance to national policy and family \npolicy. We believe we should not give short shrift to debating what our \npolicies may be. We may have some differences on different sides of the \naisle, but we should be debating these policy issues.\n  On the issue of priorities this year, such as bankruptcy--which we \ndebated for 16 days, we had 55 amendments; 16 days on bankruptcy, 55 \namendments. As I mentioned, we had eight amendments on elementary and \nsecondary education. Three were unanimous and one vote was by a voice \nvote. So we really have not met our responsibilities, I do not believe, \non debating education policy.\n\n       I strongly favor Federal commitment and investment in \n     programs that have been tried, tested, and proven to be \n     effective and that can be implemented at the local level and \n     have a positive impact on the children.\n\n  I want to take a moment to bring the Senate up to speed about what is \nhappening in schools across the country. More students are taking the \nSAT test: In 1980, 33 percent; 1985, 36 percent; 40 percent in 1990; 42 \npercent in 1995; 44 percent in 2000. More and more of the children in \nthis country are recognizing the importance of taking the scholastic \naptitude test. Children are aware they have to apply themselves, as \nreflected in the number of students taking the test, and that college \neducation is the key to success in America. Also, the results have been \npositive. Even though more students are taking the SAT, and the \nstudents are more diverse, math scores are the highest in 30 years. \nBut, in order to sustain the gains made, children need to continue to \nhave well-qualified teachers, they need an investment in preschool \nprograms, they need afterschool programs, they have to have available \nto them the latest technologies so they can move ahead in their \nacademic work.\n\n[[Page S8358]]\n\n  This is another chart showing more students are taking advanced math \nand science classes. This reflects 1990 to 2000: Precalculus, in 1990, \nwas 31 percent. It is now 44 percent. Calculus, 19 percent in 1990; 24 \npercent in 2000. In physics, 44 percent in 1990 to 49 percent in 2000.\n  We are finding more students are taking college level courses, \nadvanced placement courses, the more challenging courses, and they are \ndoing better and better in these undertakings.\n  However, our work is far from over. We cannot get away from the fact \nthat there are many others in our country, in urban areas and rural \nareas, who are facing extraordinary challenges. Those disadvantaged \nchildren are really the ones on which we are focused in terms of the \nFederal elementary and secondary education programs.\n\n  Basically, there are important ways in which we can give some help \nand assistance to these children. We believe in smaller class sizes, \nwith well-trained teachers, and afterschool programs. We believe in \nmaking sure the children are going to be ready to learn, either through \nthe Head Start Program or through helping and assisting local groups to \ntry to give help and assistance to those children as they are \npreparing, even for Head Start, the ready-to-learn program, which \nbasically was a goal we agreed to--Democrats and Republicans alike--in \ntheir conference in Charlottesville about 10 years ago. That is an area \nin which we have not been able to gain support, although we have a \nbipartisan proposal that is actually currently pending--would be \npending were we to get back to the elementary and secondary education \nbill.\n  We believe the success of the STAR Program in Tennessee and also in \nthe State of Wisconsin demonstrates the importance of smaller \nclassrooms. Also, all of the various studies have shown quite clearly \nthe importance of having well-trained teachers.\n  We can learn from States that have moved ahead in providing adequate \ncompensation of teachers, such as Connecticut, North Carolina, and \nother States, and that have shown that when you have teachers who are \nwell trained and well paid, you get an enhanced academic achievement \nfor these students.\n  We support afterschool programs--they have a tremendous impact on \nhelping children to enhance their academic achievement.\n  We should also make college more accessible to every qualified \nstudent through GEAR UP and college tuition help, the excellent \nproposal that has been advanced by Vice President Gore to provide a tax \ndeduction for tuition for children, for parents whose children are \ngoing on to college.\n  Also, in the area of skills training, we tried to address that in an \namendment. We actually were able to get a majority in the Senate to \nsupport the restoring of a training program, but we have been unable to \nget that implemented because there was a point of order made against \nit. We had to amend a bill which did not make it possible for us to \ncarry that forward into a conference.\n  All of these are matters of enormous importance. We have been \nimpressed--I have--by the debate and discussion at the national level \nabout the Vice President's proposal to understand that learning has to \nbe a continuum and that skills training has to be a continuum.\n  I often am reminded of the fact that when I first was elected to the \nSenate, we had a very efficient shipyard down in Fall River, MA. The \nworkers who worked there, their fathers worked there, their \ngrandfathers worked there. More often than not, the sons wanted to work \nthere. But there has been a change. That yard has been closed. Now what \nwe find out is--not only there but across my own State of Massachusetts \nand across the country--everyone who enters the job market is going to \nhave, on average, seven different jobs over the course of their \nlifetime.\n  We have to be able to have continuing education and training programs \naccessible and available to young and old alike, so that people are \ngoing to be able to upgrade their skills. That is enormously important. \nIt is enormously important not only to the young, but it is enormously \nimportant to communities such as mine, Massachusetts, where we have an \nolder workforce--we have a transition from a lot of the older \nindustries into newer kinds of industries--and where the real \ndifference is in the development of skills.\n  We would have the opportunity to address many of those issues I have \nvery briefly mentioned in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. \nWe certainly would be able to address universal preschool, the issues \nof qualified teachers, and the importance of skills training that is \ngoing to be school based. We could address modern and safe schools. We \nwould be able to address afterschool opportunities, smaller class \nsizes, and the higher education issues.\n\n  Lifelong training would perhaps not be exactly targeted in those \nprograms, but we will have an opportunity to address that, I believe, \nin the final budget negotiations that are going to be taking place \nbetween the two Houses, and with the appropriations. Being able to have \na clear indication about where we in the Congress stand on these issues \ncould be enormously instructive in terms of allocating scarce \nresources.\n  I just want to say, we are continually frustrated that we have not \nbeen able to get this matter back up in the Senate for debate. We note \nthat we were on a two-track agenda just last week, where we did the \ntrade issues during the day and the appropriations in the evening. We \nwould like to suggest that we could do the trade issues, as they are \ngoing along, but we are prepared to move ahead to consider the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act in the evenings. We could \nconsider it this week, next week, until we have reached a conclusion to \nit. We recognize the importance of it.\n  If we are looking around for priorities--we heard last week about the \nimportance of a lockbox; and we ought to certainly address that issue \nbefore we adjourn--but I daresay for most families, this week is \neducation week as their children go back to school. They want to know \nwhat they might be able to expect from the Congress, what kind of \npartnership should they be able to expect, and we should not just give \nthem silence, which we effectively are giving them.\n  I welcome the fact that this week we are having Vice President Gore \nspeak on the various aspects of education for a series of days in \ndifferent parts of the country. I would like to see a national debate \non education. I would like to see him out there speaking about it. I \nwould like to have seen Governor Bush speaking about it. I would like \nto see the engagement of their ideas in the forums of their debates. \nBut we ought to be discussing these issues here on the floor of the \nSenate. That is something I think is of importance.\n  Every day we let this go by, every day that we refuse to bring this \nup, I think we are denying the American people the kind of debate on an \nissue they care about, which they deserve. We hear both of the \ncandidates talk about education. Let the record just demonstrate that \nwe, on our side, want to get back and debate this issue. We want to \ntake action on it. We are prepared to go forward on it. We do not need \nphone calls from the Vice President on this. We are prepared to go \nahead--and go ahead today, tonight, any other time, on it.\n  We wish the Governor would call the Republican leadership and say: \nLook, I am interested in the education issues as well. Why don't you go \nahead and have a good debate on that issue and in the Senate. Let me \ntell you what my positions are. Let's have a debate. Let's let the \nAmerican people understand. Let's give them a window into this \ndiscussion, which is so important for families in this country. Let's \nnot exclude them.\n  I can imagine, as the Vice President is going around talking about \neducation, there are going to be people saying: What is happening in \nthe Congress? I hope he understands that we, on this side, are prepared \nto have these matters debated, discussed, and resolved. We wish we \ncould join with our colleagues on the other side to do so.\n  Historically, the issues on education have never been really \npartisan. We have some differences in terms of accountability, which \nthe Vice President strongly supports. But we believe we ought to be \nable to have a debate and discussion in the Senate on this issue. We \nthink we are denying the American people the opportunity.\n  So I would invite the Governor to contact the Republican leadership \nhere\n\n[[Page S8359]]\n\nand say: If you are really interested in education, let's bring the \nelementary and secondary education bill back to the floor. Let's debate \nit.\n  We are glad to consider it in the evening time. We have now just \nabout a month left in this session of the Senate. We ought to be \nresolving the issues on education, on the Patients' Bill of Rights, on \nprescription drugs, and on the increase in the minimum wage. If we did \nthose four, if we took care of those four issues, I think we could say \nthat this was a Congress of considerable achievement and considerable \naccomplishment.\n  Those are central, focused issues about which both of the candidates \nare talking. But they are speaking all over the country; they are not \nspeaking to us here in the Senate. We have no debate on minimum wage. \nWe are not getting back to the minimum wage or prescription drugs. We \naren't getting back to education.\n  Since we are not going to be able to do that and have it rescheduled, \nwe are going to have to take whatever steps we possibly can on whatever \nbills that are going to come up in the remaining days. We want to do \nthis well. We want to do it with the understanding of the leadership on \nboth sides. But if we are not going to be able to get focus and \nattention on these issues, then we are going to have to take whatever \nopportunity we have, on any of the measures that are coming down the \nline, in trying to press the people's business in the form of \neducation. And that I commit we will do.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I know my colleague from Maine wants 5 \nminutes to respond. I ask unanimous consent that after my colleague \nfrom Maine speaks, my colleague from California have 5 minutes as in \nmorning business, and that I then be able to introduce the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first, I thank my friend and colleague \nfrom Minnesota for his usual graciousness in allowing me to respond to \nthe comments made by my friend from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy.\n  Let's look at the facts. My colleagues on this side of the aisle have \nrepeatedly said that the reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act is our top priority. We produced a very good \nbill from the HELP Committee on which the Presiding Officer serves so \nably. We produced a bill that provides a substantial increase in \nFederal funding for education to help improve education and the lives \nof children all over this Nation.\n  We also adopted an important, innovative, new approach, one that \nrecognizes that Washington is not the fount of all wisdom when it comes \nto educational policy. We recognize that schools have different needs, \nthat some need new computers. Others need to hire new math teachers. \nStill others need to concentrate on providing more programs for gifted \nand talented students. Schools have different needs. They want to \ntailor their policies to the needs of the local community.\n  That is what our bill would do. It would give schools more \nflexibility in spending Federal dollars while holding them accountable \nfor what counts; that is, results, improved student achievement. We \nwant to get away from the Washington-knows-best approach and let local \nschool boards, teachers, and parents make the decisions about what \ntheir children best need.\n  Unfortunately, our efforts were derailed by our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle who insisted on weighing down the education \nbill with issues completely unrelated to education. The majority \nleader, Senator Lott, has tried repeatedly to get a unanimous consent \nagreement that would allow us to return to the education bill that both \nsides agree is so important. Unfortunately, the latest effort was once \nagain met with demands for unrelated, nongermane amendments that would \nsink our ability to produce this important legislation this year.\n  Those are the facts. Our side stands ready to return to the ESEA \nbill. We believe that is an extremely important priority. We are very \nproud of the bill we have produced. We believe it would make a real \ndifference in the lives of American children. We would like to go \nforward. Unfortunately, we have been met with obstacle after obstacle \nfrom our colleagues on Senator Kennedy's side of the aisle.\n  That is unfortunate. But the American people deserve to know why we \nhave been unable to complete our work in this very important arena.\n  I yield the floor and again thank my colleague from Minnesota for his \ngraciousness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I add my thanks to my fine colleague for allowing me \nto have this 5 minutes.\n  I say to my dear friend from Maine that we all seem to be saying we \nwant to bring up the ESEA so we can debate education. Yet the format \nunder which we would be going back to this bill would be a closed \nformat. Those of us who think it is important, for example, that there \nbe school safety, that we be allowed to offer sensible gun laws so we \ncan, in fact, keep these guns away from these kids wouldn't be able to \ndo it. We could not offer an amendment on school modernization. We \ncould not offer an amendment to expand afterschool opportunities, \nsmaller class sizes, more qualified teachers, and accountability for \nresults.\n  When you say you want to discuss education, yet you shut out the \nability for those of us on this side to offer these amendments that, by \nthe way, many people in the country support by majorities of 80 \npercent, it seems to me you are not offering anything at all.\n  The interesting point is that my friends on the other side say: Well, \nyou are just trying to delay things. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth. In 1994, Phil Gramm on your side offered a gun amendment on the \nESEA. All we are asking for is the opportunity to debate this and \ndebate it so that it is relevant to the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/12/senate-section/article/S8359-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8359-S8360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE CLINTON BUDGET\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I asked for the 5 minutes because I want \nto discuss a timely matter in response to my good friend, Senator John \nMcCain, who made a national radio address of 5 minutes to the Nation in \nwhich he criticized the President very strongly for the President's \nbudget plans.\n  It is wonderful to see that John is back and strong, healthy and \nfeisty, and I am looking forward to testifying before his committee on \nthe issue of violence among children. But I have to say, although I \ncompletely respect his opinion, I think his analysis of where we are in \nthe budget debate is so upside down and inside out, I felt compelled to \ntake to the floor today to respond.\n  Senator McCain said in his radio address:\n\n       Our President supports excessive spending that most \n     Americans oppose.\n\n  That is a direct quote. He said the President would:\n\n       . . . wreck the economic progress we have made during these \n     good years.\n\n  That is very strong language.\n  I must say respectfully to my friend from Arizona, why have we had \n``these good years'' about which he talks? Clearly, it is because this \nadministration has given us policies that work. We only need to look \nback to 1992, the Bush-Quayle years. We had the worst recession since \nthe Great Depression. I remember it so well because it is when I ran \nfor the Senate. We had horrific deficits as far as the eye could see, \nalmost $300 billion. We had crime rising; we had hope falling. We had \nunemployment skyrocketing, and there was malaise in the country.\n  The Clinton-Gore budget in 1993 changed all of that by ushering in a \nnew era of economic growth. It was a combination of discipline on the \ndeficit and policies that would invest in our people--economic \ndiscipline on the one hand, saying to the people in the very high \nbrackets: You have to pay your fair share, and investing in our people, \nin education, in the environment, and in infrastructure.\n\n  It does not mean everything is perfect, as Al Gore is saying. He is \nnot satisfied. None of us should be satisfied. There is more work to \ndo, and we need to do better.\n  But let's look at the record since Al Gore has been Vice President: \nAverage\n\n[[Page S8360]]\n\neconomic growth, 3.8 percent a year under Clinton-Gore, compared to 1.7 \npercent under Bush-Quayle; unemployment in 1992, a staggering 7.5 \npercent. In my home State, it was double digits. I will never forget \nthe fear among the people. Today the unemployment rate is 4 percent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator that her time \nhas expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Home ownership is the highest ever. The $290 billion \ndeficit has turned into a $232 billion surplus. Poverty is the lowest \nin 20 years. Real wage growth is up 6.5 percent. Under the Reagan-Bush \nyears, there was a decline in the real wage growth of 4.3 percent. \nThere are 22 million new jobs, the most jobs created in history under a \nsingle administration.\n  Now we have the other party saying the President is wrong on his \nbudget ideas. It is their right to say that. But the American people \nare wise. When you oppose every policy that led to this economic \ngrowth, they are going to question you at this particular point in the \ndebate.\n  Instead of having a radio address where you slam this administration \nafter these great years of growth, why not hold out your hand? Why not \nhold out your hand to the other side? People are tired of this \npartisanship.\n  Let's keep these successful policies going. As Vice President Gore \nhas said, let us do even better. Let's not be satisfied; let's make \nthose deep investments in education and the environment. Let's do even \nbetter on paying down the debt. Let us give middle-class tax cuts, not \ntax cuts to the superwealthy that are going to wreck this economic \nrecovery. Let us save Social Security and Medicare. The other side \nwants to do it. Let's join hands.\n  Let's join hands on a real Patients' Bill of Rights and on a real \nprescription drug benefit as part of Medicare--and not send our seniors \noff to the HMOs which really do not have the patients' benefits at \nheart. Let's do it together before the end of this session. Let's do it \nnow. Let's join hands now rather than throw insults over the radio.\n  My friends, we have a golden opportunity. I think we have shown we \ncan work together. Let's stop the partisanship. Let's join hands. Let's \nfinish this year on a high note, go home, and feel good that we have \ndone these things. Let's keep up the policies of the past 8 years \nbecause they have worked. But let's do even better.\n  I thank my friend for giving me this time. I thank the Presiding \nOfficer for his indulgence.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/12/senate-section/article/S8360-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8360-S8369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TO AUTHORIZE EXTENSION OF NONDISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT TO THE PEOPLE'S \n                      REPUBLIC OF CHINA--Continued\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4119\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, amendment No. 4119 deals with the human rights \nquestion; it deals with the trade question; it deals with the issue of \nChinese exports to the United States of goods made by prison labor.\n  To curb such exports, this amendment is about existing agreements \nthat we already have with China. This amendment just says we want China \nto live up to the existing agreements. The United States and China \nfirst signed a memorandum of understanding in 1992, which I will refer \nto as MOU throughout the debate. Then we signed a statement of \ncooperation in 1994. This amendment would require that the President \ncertify that China is fully compliant with the two trade agreements \nthat China has already made with us before extending PNTR to China.\n  Let me provide some background on U.S.-China agreements on trade in \nprison labor products and discuss China's deplorable record in \ncomplying with these agreements. Actually, they haven't complied with \nthese agreements. The MOU was intended to end the export to the United \nStates of goods produced by prison labor in China. China agreed to the \nUnited States' request back in 1992 that it would promptly investigate \nany companies that were involved in using prison labor to export \nproducts back to our country. But basically the Ministry of Justice in \nChina completely ignored the agreement.\n  In 1994, therefore, we signed another statement of cooperation with \nthem in which China said: We will agree and we will set some time \nlimits so that within 60 days of the United States' request to visit \nsuch a facility we will make that happen. We will be expeditious in \nmaking sure we follow through on this agreement.\n  For the last 3 years, they have not followed through on any of these \nagreements.\n  Because of the good work of my colleagues, Senator Harkin from Iowa \nand Senator Lautenberg from New Jersey--both of whom are going to speak \non the floor of the Senate--for the first time in 3 years we had \nCustoms able to visit one of these factories. But this really was the \nfirst time that China has budged at all. Other than that, we have seen \nno agreement, or no followthrough on these agreements.\n  When I became a member of the Foreign Relations Committee 3 years \nago, I remember the first hearing we held had to do with prison labor \nconditions in China and this whole problem of trade with China. \nBasically the consensus of all of the witnesses who testified, \nincluding administration witnesses, was that the Chinese compliance \nwith our trade agreements was pitifully inadequate. There has been \nvirtually no compliance with these agreements.\n  The State Department issued a country-by-country report in 1999 and \nalso in the year 2000. I will summarize. I could quote extensively. \nBoth of these reports make it clear that during the last 2 years, China \nhas not complied with these existing agreements.\n  Let me simply raise a question with my colleagues. Here we have two \ntrade agreements with China--two understandings. We have basically said \nto the Chinese Government that people in the United States of America \nwould be outraged if they knew that part of what they were doing was \nexporting products to our country produced by prison labor. This is a \nhuman rights issue. It is a labor issue. And it is also a trade issue.\n  It is interesting. I talked about a memorandum of understanding. In \n1994, the administration used as evidence the fact that China had \nsigned the statement of cooperation. For the first time, the President \nsaid: I am going to switch my position and I am going to delink human \nrights from trade because it is a great step forward that China has \nsigned this statement of cooperation. That judgment turned out to be \npremature. China's Ministry of Justice ignored seven U.S. Customs' \nrequests for investigation submitted in March of 1994, the same month \nthat the agreement was passed.\n  China, for years, has refused to allow U.S. officials access to its \nreeducation through labor facilities--let me repeat that--reeducation \nthrough labor facilities, arguing that these are not prisons.\n  China, in spite of these agreements, has said: We will not allow the \nUnited States access to our reeducation through labor facilities \nbecause these are not prisons. Beijing would have us believe that these \nare merely educational institutions. And nothing, if we are at all \nconcerned about human rights in the Senate, could be further from the \ntruth.\n  Reeducation through labor--known as ``laojiao'' in Chinese--is a \nsystem of administrative detention and punishment without trial. That \nis what it is. The U.S. Embassy in Beijing insists that reeducation \nthrough labor camps are covered by our trade agreements, the MOU. And \nthis is confirmed by the MOU record. Beijing disagrees and continues to \nclaim that these reeducation through labor facilities are not prisons. \nFor over 5 years, China has repeatedly denied or ignored all U.S. \nrequests to visit one of these facilities. We haven't been able to \nvisit even one of these facilities.\n  What has been this administration's reaction to China's refusal to \nallow a visit? It has been the same as for all denied visits. We renew \nour request every 3 months, and the Chinese totally ignore us. This \ncharade ought to\n\n[[Page S8361]]\n\nstop. It ought to stop now. That is why I hope there will be strong \nbipartisan support for this amendment.\n  What does ``reeducation through labor'' mean? Let me read some \nexcerpts from Human Rights Watch reports on this subject:\n\n       The usual procedure is for the police acting on their own \n     to determine a re-education term. Sentences run from one to \n     three years' confinement in a camp or farm, often longer than \n     for similar criminal offenses. A term can be extended for a \n     fourth year if, in the prison authorities' judgment, the \n     recipient has not been sufficiently re-educated, fails to \n     admit guilt, or violates camp discipline. The recipient of a \n     re-education through labor sentence has no right to a \n     hearing, no right to counsel, and no right to any kind of \n     judicial determination of his case.\n\n  That is a quote from a Human Rights Watch report on this subject.\n  Human Rights Watch also points out that inmates may have their \nreeducation sentence extended indefinitely, and concludes that \nreeducation through labor violates many of the provisions of \ninternational law, including the International Covenant on Civil and \nPolitical Rights, which China signed in 1998. The covenant states:\n\n       Anyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or \n     detention shall be entitled to take proceedings before a \n     court in order that the court may decide without delay on the \n     lawfulness of his detention.\n\n  Among other things, reeducation through labor bars the presumption of \ninnocence, involves no judicial officer, provides for no public trial \nor defense against the charges.\n  Amnesty International has concluded that it is impossible for China \nto claim a commitment to the rule of law while maintaining a system \nthat sentences hundreds of thousands of people without due process. I \ncouldn't agree more.\n  According to the 1999 State Department report on human rights, there \nare 230,000 people in reeducation through labor camps. Conditions in \nthese camps are similar to those in prisons. What does the report say \nabout these conditions in prisons? It describes them as ``harsh, and \nfrequently degrading for both political criminals and common \ncriminals.'' The report says it is common for political prisoners to be \nsegregated from each other and placed with common criminals. There are \ncredible reports that common criminals have physically beaten up \npolitical prisoners at the instigation of the guards.\n  I am sure my colleagues will agree that reeducation through labor \ndoesn't qualify as an institution whose sole aim is education and \nrehabilitation, as China claims.\n  Before certifying that China is in compliance with the MOU and SOC \nunder this agreement, the President must affirm that China is \npermitting investigation and U.S. inspection of reeducation through \nlabor facilities under the terms of both the memorandum of \nunderstanding and the statement of cooperation, two agreements that we \nhave signed with China in 1992 and 1994.\n  I am offering this amendment because I think it addresses concerns \nthat many Members have in the Senate about PNTR, concerns about China's \nappalling and worsening human rights record.\n  I heard my colleague from Nebraska say that the evidence is clear \nthat opening up trade leads to more respect for human rights. The \nevidence is not clear on that. We have been doing record trade with \nChina. We have a record trade imbalance. They export much more to the \nUnited States than vice versa. They export products made by forced \nprison labor in China. Over the last 10 years, we haven't seen more \nrespect for human rights. Our own State Department reports that all of \nthe human rights organizations reports point to harsh--and in some \ncases, worsening--conditions.\n  How can Senators reviewing our trade relations with China give up \nthis little leverage that we have and think somehow it will promote \nhuman rights when, as a matter of fact, we have seen no evidence \nwhatever that the Government is moving in that direction. We will give \nup what little leverage we have.\n  This amendment is about human rights. It is an amendment that speaks \nto whether or not we can depend upon China to honor trade agreements. \nIt is an amendment that speaks to the concerns of working people, that \nthey can't possibly compete with prison labor in China.\n  Senators, I offer this amendment and I call for support on this \namendment for three reasons: (A) out of respect for human rights; (B) \nbecause we already have these trade agreements with China. This is the \nmost directly relevant amendment to PNTR awaiting action. We already \nhave trade agreements with China and they have not abided by these \nagreements. Tomorrow they could. In this amendment, we call upon China \nto live up to these agreements before we automatically extend normal \ntrade relations. What is unreasonable about that?\n  Finally, I say to Democrats first, and Republicans second--Democrats \nfirst, because we are supposed to be more the party of the ``people''--\nin all due respect, a lot of our constituents, a lot of working people, \na lot of labor people, have every reason in the world to be a bit \nskeptical about this new trade agreement and the new global economics \nwhen we have China exporting to our country products produced by prison \nlabor.\n  I think this amendment is all about on whose side are we. Are we on \nthe side of a repressive government that basically pays no attention to \nanything we say because the message we communicate is: We will, for the \nsake of commerce, sign any agreement; we are not concerned about these \nharsh conditions. But are we on the side of human rights? Are we on the \nside of the idea that China ought to live up to these trade agreements? \nAre we on the side of working people, laboring people in our own \ncountry who, by the way, will say to each one of you back in your \nStates: Senator, we do not want to be put in a position of losing our \njobs because this repressive government can export products made by \nforced prison labor in China and has not been willing to live up to any \nof the agreements they have signed with our country.\n  I ask my colleagues to carefully consider the following questions:\n  (A) How can we expect China to honor trade agreements with us when it \nsystematically violates the two agreements we signed committing China \nand the United States to cooperate in curbing trade in prison labor \nproducts? They are in noncompliance with two agreements.\n  (B) How can we do nothing, year after year, to bar imports of Chinese \nforced labor products when we know that China operates the world's \nlargest forced labor system estimated to encompass over 1,100 camps and \nas many as 8 million Chinese prisoners? This is the Chinese version of \nthe Soviet gulag. It encompasses a massive complex of prisons, labor \ncamps, and labor farms for those sentenced judicially. Do we want to \nturn our gaze away from this, Senators? Do we want to pretend we didn't \nsign these agreements? Do we want to pretend China is complying with \nthese agreements? Do we want to pretend that it is not an important \nhuman rights question? Do we want to pretend that this is not important \nto working people in our country? Do we want to pretend that citizens \nin our country would not have real indignation if they realized that we \nweren't willing to at least insist China live up to these trade \nagreements? And we are not going to if we do not pass this amendment.\n  (C) How can the administration allow China to ignore agreements to \nhalt forced labor exports, thereby abetting a dehumanizing system that \nimprisons and persecutes Chinese democrats--Republicans, I use \ndemocrats with a small ``d''--for peacefully advocating human rights, \nwhile enabling Beijing to profit from exports of prison products?\n  Finally, how can the administration risk the displacement of U.S. \nworkers while we turn a blind eye and China does nothing to bar exports \nto the United States of products made by prison labor. U.S. citizens \nare losing jobs.\n  Colleagues, I look forward to hearing from the other side. H.R. 4444 \nproposes a toothless remedy. I do not want to let anyone in this debate \nget away with saying we are very concerned about this question. H.R. \n4444 mandates the establishment of an interagency task force on \nprohibiting importation of products of forced or prison labor. This \ntask force is to make recommendations to the Customs Service on seeking \nnew agreements.\n\n  Another task force. In all due respect, this toothless remedy has a\n\n[[Page S8362]]\n\nmade-for-Congress look to it. We do not want to bite the bullet, we do \nnot want to do something substantive and important, so we do something \nthat is symbolic--at best. Do we need another task force? We do not \nneed another task force. We do not need an interagency task force. We \nalready have two agreements with China--1992 and 1994. Another task \nforce is meaningless.\n  Let me just point out some of the more pointed Chinese proposals \nwhich were conveyed in a message sent in May from China's Ministry of \nJustice to the U.S. Customs attache in Beijing. The message admonishes \nthe U.S. Embassy to abide by certain principles, which include:\n\n       . . . the rule that Chinese officials conduct \n     investigations first, then if necessary arrange visits for \n     American counterparts.\n\n  I quote again:\n\n       Unnecessary visits will not be arranged if we can clarify \n     and answer questions through the investigations.\n\n  Really what the message from the Chinese Government is, is we conduct \nthe investigations first and only afterwards permit the United States \nto visit suspected sites. This is in total opposition to the memorandum \nof understanding and the statement of cooperation. We already have the \nagreements. They are not in compliance with these agreements. And we \nwant to set up a task force?\n  Let me simply say the view of the Chinese Ministry of Justice that we \nshould trust China's sincerity and therefore reduce the necessity of \nU.S. on-site visits is nothing short of ridiculous. This is pretty \nincredible.\n  The other thing is, H.R. 4444 stipulates that the task force is to:\n\n       . . . work with the Customs Service to assist the People's \n     Republic of China in monitoring the sale of goods mined, \n     produced or manufactured by convict labor, forced labor, or \n     indentured labor under penal sanctions to ensure that such \n     goods are not exported to the United States.\n\n  The Chinese Government controls prison labor in China. It can curb \nthe export of forced prison labor products anytime it chooses. It \ncertainly does not need the assistance of the United States. This is, \nfrankly, ludicrous. It is just ludicrous.\n  The State Department, in 1997, affirmed both the memorandum of \nunderstanding and the statement of cooperation, of 1992 and 1994, to be \nbinding international agreements. The trouble is that China does not. \nIt continues to get away with this because we impose no penalties for \nthese egregious and continuing Chinese violations. In contrast to the \nprovision now in H.R. 4444, which is toothless, my amendment for the \nfirst time will provide China with a strong incentive to comply with \nthe MOE and SOC, for, if it fails to do so, then it will put PNTR at \nrisk. An added benefit is that it would help restore U.S. credibility \nby holding China accountable for violating trade agreements with the \nUnited States.\n  We are just insisting that China stop treating the bilateral \nagreements it has signed with us concerning prison labor exports as \nmere scraps of paper. What does this amendment ask for? It asks simply \nthat PNTR be denied until the President can certify that China is \nhonoring agreements it has repeatedly violated in the past. Is that too \nmuch to ask? Is that too much to ask?\n  Mr. President, I have a document dated May 8, 2000, from the Deputy \nDirector General of the Prison Administration Bureau, PRC, to David \nBenner, U.S. Customs Attache. I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record, and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                     Prison Administration Bureau,\n\n\n                                          Ministry of Justice,\n\n                                                 PRC, May 8, 2000.\n     David Benner,\n     U.S. Customs Attache, American Embassy Beijing.\n       Mr. Benner: It was a pleasure to meet you on April 20, 2000 \n     and the meeting was successful. As a follow-up, this letter \n     presents the concerned principles and suggestions we \n     mentioned at the meeting. We hope that your government can \n     give us a clear reply as soon as possible.\n\n\n            i. brief summary of our cooperation in the past\n\n       The signing of MEMO and COOPERATION AGREEMENT shows our \n     principles and sincerity of cooperation. In the past seven \n     years since the signing of MEMO, we have made great efforts \n     to arrange eight visits to eleven places for American \n     officials. We also conducted investigations into over fifty \n     places and provided the results to American counterpart. We \n     have noticed that American officials have closed most of the \n     cases related to the above places. Among these visits and \n     investigations, no evidence at all has been found to prove \n     the allegation of prison products exportation to the U.S. \n     These facts well show our serious attitude and cooperation \n     sincerity.\n\n\n ii. additional explanation and emphasis on some cooperation principles\n\n       1. The objects that will be investigated are prison \n     products being exported to the U.S. No third country should \n     be involved.\n       2. Abide by the principle that Chinese authorities should \n     hold the sovereign right to conduct investigations.\n       3. Abide by the rule that Chinese officials conduct \n     investigations first, then if necessary arrange visits for \n     American counterparts. Unnecessary visits will not be \n     arranged if we can clarify and answer questions through the \n     investigations.\n       4. So-called ``PENDING'' or unresolved cases should be \n     agreed to both sides.\n       5. All American visitors have to be diplomats.\n       6. Any visits and investigations in China have to abide by \n     concerned Chinese laws and regulations.\n       7. The time limit of sixty days is valid to both sides.\n       8. The results of the visits and investigations made by \n     American officials have to be formally submitted to Chinese \n     government by American government.\n       9. American counterparts should provide sufficient \n     information and evidence to support the allegations and to \n     warrant the investigations and arrangement of visits.\n       10. The investigation of one case must be completed and \n     case closed before starting another or second case.\n\n\n                          i. some suggestions\n\n       1. In the past seven years, both sides have made great \n     efforts to do tremendous work, no prison products exportation \n     to the U.S. has been found so far. Therefore, a summary is \n     very necessary.\n       2. American counterpart must trust our sincerity and \n     investigation results, which is the most important basis upon \n     which we cooperate with each other. Site visits are not \n     necessary if we can clarify the allegation by our \n     investigations. Reduction of site visits can result in higher \n     efficiency and avoid unnecessary troubles and unexpected \n     snags.\n       3. American officials should standardize the ways and norms \n     when close cases regarding the suspected units.\n       4. American counterpart should be cautious and prudent \n     towards the sources of information and its authenticity. As a \n     matter of fact, a lot of information obtained by American \n     officials was not accurate, some even groundless. This \n     creates unnecessary troubles for both of us. Pertaining to \n     the practice these years, we think it is very necessary for \n     both sides, especially our side to verify the information and \n     evidence obtained by American counterpart.\n       5. Abide by the regulation in COOPERATION AGREEMENT to \n     conduct investigation one case by one case. This is a serious \n     and responsible attitude and standardized and effective \n     method.\n                                                   Wang Shu-sheng,\n                                          Deputy Director General.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I make a point of order a quorum is not \npresent.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask consent this not be charged \nagainst my side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The quorum call is charged to the side that \nsuggests it.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleagues, Senator Lautenberg will be \nspeaking in just a moment, but until he comes out, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If no Senator yields time, \ntime will be charged equally to both sides.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, until my colleague from New Jersey is \nready, I want to again summarize this amendment for other Senators. \nThis is the issue of Chinese exports to the United States of goods made \nby prison labor. This is an issue of the memorandum signed in 1992, I \nsay to my colleague from Delaware, to deal with this problem. The \nChinese Government agreed: Yes, we are going to stop this.\n  Then we signed another agreement, a statement of cooperation, in \n1994. I have been on the floor citing State Department reports and \nother evidence--no question about it--that the Chinese\n\n[[Page S8363]]\n\nhave refused to comply with these agreements. It has been blatant. \nPeople in our country would be outraged to know this.\n  I say to Senators, this is a three-pronged issue. I have talked about \nthese reeducation labor camps. I have talked about the deplorable \nconditions. It is a human rights issue. I have cited human rights \nreports. I have said this is a trade issue. They have signed these \nagreements and have not lived up to them. I have said this is a labor \nissue. It permits ordinary people--which I mean in a positive way--in \nthe States to be a little suspicious that they could lose their jobs as \na result of this.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this. It is an eminently reasonable \namendment. It simply says the President needs to certify that China is \nfully compliant with these two agreements, which they have already made \nwith us, before extending PNTR to China.\n  I yield 12 minutes to my colleague from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nMinnesota for offering this amendment. I ask unanimous consent to be \nadded as an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nWellstone amendment on prison labor.\n  China has an extensive prison labor system, and many people are in \nChina's prisons for expressing their opinions, practicing their \nreligion, or engaging in other activities we would regard as the \nexercise of their fundamental human rights.\n  Many of these political prisoners have been sentenced to what the \nChinese call ``re-education through labor'' without even being accused \nof a crime, much less having a fair trial.\n  In the early 1990s, the U.S. had reason to believe China was using \nprison labor to produce goods for export, including goods intended for \nthe U.S. market. China's government denied this until we found a \ndocument directing the use of prison labor to produce goods for export.\n  China had long agreed not to use prison labor to make items destined \nfor the U.S. market. In August 1992, after protracted negotiations, the \nUnited States and China signed a memorandum of understanding on \nprohibiting import and export trade in prison labor products. This was \nfollowed by a statement of cooperation in 1994.\n  For several years, the system put in place by these agreements \nallowed U.S. Customs to investigate when we suspected that prison labor \nwas being used to make goods for sale in the U.S.\n  Under the agreements, U.S. Customs officers--working with their \nChinese counterparts--investigated suspicious sites. Cooperation under \nthe MOU included visits to 11 sites over several years.\n  In 1997--this is 4 years after the agreement was signed--China \nstopped allowing U.S. Customs to conduct these inspections. Apparently, \nthe Chinese felt that the U.S. should give them a clean bill of health \nand accept their assurances on prison labor without further \ninspections. They went so far as to seek a renegotiation of the \nmemorandum of understanding.\n  For me, China's compliance with its freely accepted international \nobligations on prison labor is a critical issue in considering PNTR. \nChina's willingness to suspend implementation of the memorandum of \nunderstanding is very troubling.\n  For China's accession to the World Trade Organization and the 1999 \nbilateral market access agreement to be meaningful, we need to have \nconfidence that China will fulfill the letter and spirit of its \ninternational obligations.\n  Senator Harkin and I recently traveled to China, and China's failure \nto fulfill its commitments on prison labor was a major focus of our \nvisit. Before we left, we worked with the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and \nthe Chinese Embassy in Washington to arrange to accompany U.S. Customs \non a long-overdue prison labor site inspection visit.\n  When we arrived in Beijing, we were told that the Chinese authorities \ndid not understand our request, and then we were told such a visit \nwould not be possible. But we did not give up.\n  We pressed the point in our first formal meeting in Beijing, with \nVice Foreign Minister Yang. We did not make any progress on the issue, \nbut I think the Chinese Government got the message that we were \nserious.\n  Later the same day, we met with Vice Premier Qian Qichen. We again \npressed the point that China must fulfill its obligations to allow U.S. \nCustoms to inspect suspected prison labor sites, and we asked that we \nbe permitted to join an inspection.\n  Vice Premier Qian agreed that the time had come to resume \nimplementation of the MOU on prison labor. He agreed that the first \ninspection would take place in September.\n  We had a debate about the interpretation of understanding. We wanted \nto go with Customs. At first, they said we could go to a prison, but \nthat was not our mission. I was distressed by the fact that they chose \nto interpret what the understanding was after having worked on it for a \nmonth before we left the United States for China.\n  We saw Premier Zhu Rongji and he reaffirmed China's readiness to \nresume full implementation of the prison labor agreement. We urged that \nU.S. Customs be allowed to conduct inspections sooner than they \nplanned.\n  While this trade-related agreement should have been implemented all \nalong, without need for our intervention, I am glad our visit produced \nprogress.\n  The first long-overdue prison labor site inspection by U.S. Customs \ntook place last Friday, September 8. According to a preliminary report \nfrom our Embassy in Beijing, Chinese authorities cooperated well with \nU.S. Customs and other personnel inspecting a factory in Shandong \nProvince.\n  I hope the implementation of the agreement will now resume in full, \nincluding rapid completion of other outstanding inspection requests.\n  The amendment before us would make China's implementation of the \nprison labor memorandum of understanding and statement of cooperation a \ncondition for granting PNTR. In my view, this is a reasonable condition \nthat Premier Zhu has already assured me China will fulfill and that \nappears to be back on track.\n  If the Chinese follow through, the President should have no problem \nreporting to Congress that China is complying with its international \nobligations under the prison labor agreement by the time China enters \nthe WTO.\n  I believe this issue of prison labor is critical to our consideration \nof PNTR for China.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Wellstone amendment so that we \ncan be assured China understands that when we have an agreement, we \nwant it complied with.\n  That is one of the questions that loomed large in our visit. We had \nan opportunity to meet some of the distinguished leadership of the \nChinese Government. We met with the mayor of Shanghai. We met with \npeople who had an influence in provincial policy. More than anything \nelse, I wanted to know that when we had an agreement, when we had an \nunderstanding, it was going to be followed through and it was not \nsufficient to produce excuses such as: Well, we didn't understand what \nwas meant and that wasn't our interpretation; or, we are sorry we can't \nquite do that now.\n  That is not sufficient. This is an important agreement we are facing \noverall--this amendment first and then the overall decision on PNTR.\n  We need, in my view, to have a positive relationship with the Chinese \nRepublic. It is such an enormous country with so much potential that it \nwould be a positive step for the United States and China to work \ntogether for us to have access, not just to their marketplace. The \nmarketplace is important, but there is something more. One billion two \nhundred million people reside in China, and we do not want to have an \narea of constant instability. We want to let them know that democracy \nworks. What they have in place now just does not cut the mustard, as we \nsay. So we want to have this understanding.\n  But in order to move ahead with it, we have to have a clear view that \npromises made--especially those that are so clear as to have been \nsigned on a document--we want upheld; we do not want them skirted with \npurported misunderstandings.\n  So I congratulate my friend from Minnesota for having, as he usually\n\n[[Page S8364]]\n\ndoes, a look at the side of the issue that says: This is what is fair \nand equitable. That is what counts. And when we look at the \nmarketplace, that is important. But in order to have the kind of \nwholesome relationship I would like to see us have with China, I think \nwe have to deal with this issue of prison labor right now. I hope our \ncolleagues will support it.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague from New Jersey. Before he came \nto the floor, I mentioned a report that he and Senator Harkin had done. \nI really appreciate their strong voices as Senators for human rights.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I will wait to respond to arguments from the other side.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is an important amendment and one \nthat deserves careful consideration and debate by the Senate.\n  Senator Lautenberg and I just returned from China last weekend. I'll \nhave a great deal more to say about our trip and its impact on my \nthoughts about our relationships with China later. But I do want to \nspeak briefly to our efforts in China as they related to prison labor \nand directly to this amendment.\n  As my friend and colleague from Minnesota has pointed out, the U.S. \nand China entered into an official agreement on prison labor in 1992. \nIts intent is to prevent the importation of goods into our country made \nby prison labor in China--a practice made illegal here under Section \n1307 of the Tariff Act of 1930.\n  The agreement is officially titled the ``Memorandum of Understanding \nBetween the United States of America and the People's Republic of China \non Prohibiting Import and Export Trade in Prison Labor Products.'' It \nwas signed on August 7, 1992.\n  Let me read some of the key components. Under the terms of the \nagreement the United States and China agree to:\n\n       Promptly investigate companies, enterprises or units \n     suspected of violating relevant regulations and will \n     immediately report results.\n       Upon the request of one Party, meet to exchange information \n     on the enforcement of relevant laws.\n       Will furnish the other Party available evidence and \n     information regarding suspected violations.\n       Promptly arrange and facilitate visits by responsible \n     officials to its respective enterprises or units.\n\n  In March of 1994 we entered into an accompanying statement of \ncooperation on the implementation of the MOU. This statement fleshes \nout the details of how our two governments were to carry out the \nagreement.\n  This is an important agreement. It aims to assure that U.S. workers \naren't forced to compete with hundreds of prison labor factories in \nChina. Factories that are filled at least partially with prisoners \nwhose only crime is seeking democracy or formation of a true labor \nunion. Prisoners who are held in so-called ``re-education facilities'' \nfor up to 3 years without trials.\n  Unfortunateley, China's compliance with this agreement has been \ndismal. From 1992 to 1997 there were joint inspections, but usually \nonly after great effort on our part and often only after long delays--\nnot within 60 days of request as required under the MOU.\n  But since 1997 China has stopped all compliance with the agreement. \nThey have denied all requests by our U.S. Customs to inspect prison \nlabor facilities suspected of exporting products to the United States.\n  Let me read a portion of one of the recent letters sent by U.S. \nCustoms to Chinese officials.\n  So when Senator Lautenberg and I went to China, we asked to accompany \nChinese officials and our U.S. Customs officials on a visit to one of \nthese 8 sites previously requested by Customs.\n  We raised this at every level. We first raised it prior to our visit \nwith the Chinese Embassy here in Washington. Then we raised it with the \nDeputy Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi, then we raised it with Vice \nPremier Quian QiChen.\n  We raised our concerns about the failure to abide by the MOU and \nasked that we be allowed to go along on a visit to see for ourselves \nthat the Tariff Act of 1930 is not being violated.\n  At first we ran into a brick wall. We were simply told ``no.'' Then \nwe were told they misunderstood our request.\n  Then they said it was very complicated and would take more time.\n  Then we had a breakthrough.\n  They refused to let Senator Lautenberg and I go on a visit to one of \nthese facilities, but they have agreed to renew their compliance with \nthe MOU. We got that assurance personally from Premier Zhu Ronji.\n  We got word last Friday--inspections resumed at one site.\n  So the first renewed inspection was completed Friday. Now we all see \nif the Chinese are serious about complying with this agreement. Their \ntrack record clearly does not inspire confidence. That is why I am \nsupporting the Wellstone amendment. It would add to our leverage to \nensure long-term compliance with this important agreement.\n  So I urge a vote for this amendment and commend Senator Wellstone for \nbringing it forward.\n  As I mentioned earlier, I will have a good deal more to say about my \ntrip to China and on the underling PNTR legislation as the debate \ncontinues.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the memoranda of \nunderstanding and a letter to Wang Lixian in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n Memorandum of Understanding Between the United States of America and \n the People's Republic of China on Prohibiting Import and Export Trade \n                        in Prison Labor Products\n\n       The Government of the United States of America and the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China (hereinafter \n     referred to as the Parties),\n       Considering that the Chinese Government has noted and \n     respects United States laws and regulations that prohibit the \n     import of prison labor products, has consistently paid great \n     attention to the question of prohibition of the export of \n     prison labor products, has explained to the United States its \n     policy on this question, and on October 10, 1991, reiterated \n     its regulations regarding prohibition of the export of prison \n     labor products;\n       Considering that the Government of the United States has \n     explained to the Chinese Government U.S. laws and regulations \n     prohibiting the import of prison labor products and the \n     policy of the United States on this issue; and\n       Noting that both Governments express appreciation for each \n     other's concerns and previous efforts to resolve this issue,\n       Have reached the following understanding on the question of \n     prohibiting import and export trade between the two countries \n     that violates the relevant laws and regulations of either the \n     United States or China concerning products produced by prison \n     or penal labor (herein referred to as prison labor products).\n       The Parties agree:\n       1. Upon the request of one Party, and based on specific \n     information provided by that Party, the other Party will \n     promptly investigate companies, enterprises or units \n     suspected of violating relevant regulations and laws, and \n     will immediately report the results of such investigations to \n     the other.\n       2. Upon the request of one Party, responsible officials or \n     experts of relevant departments of both Parties will meet \n     under mutually convenient circumstances to exchange \n     information on the enforcement of relevant laws and \n     regulations and to examine and report on compliance with \n     relevant regulations and laws by their respective companies, \n     enterprises, or units.\n       3. Upon request, each Party will furnish to the other Party \n     available evidence and information regarding suspected \n     violations of relevant laws and regulations in a form \n     admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings of the \n     other Party. Moreover, at the request of one Party, the other \n     Party will preserve the confidentiality of the furnished \n     evidence, except when used in judicial or administrative \n     proceedings.\n       4. In order to resolve specific outstanding cases related \n     to the subject matter of this Memorandum of Understanding, \n     each Party will, upon request of the other Party, promptly \n     arrange and facilitate visits by responsible officials of the \n     other Party's diplomatic mission to its respective companies, \n     enterprises or units.\n       This Memorandum of Understanding will enter into force upon \n     signature.\n       Done at Washington, in duplicate, this seventh day of \n     August, 1992, in the English and the Chinese languages, both \n     texts being equally authentic.\n\n     For the Government of the United States of America:\n\n                                                Arnold Kanter,\n\n                                          Under Secretary of State\n                                            for Political Affairs.\n\n     For the Government of the People's Republic of China:\n                                                       Liu Huoqiu,\n                                       Vice Foreign Minister, PRC.\n\n[[Page S8365]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n  Statement of Cooperation on the Implementation of the Memorandum of \n  Understanding Between the United States of America and the People's \n  Republic of China on Prohibiting Import and Export Trade in Prison \n                             Labor Products\n\n       As the Chinese government acknowledges and respects United \n     States laws concerning the prohibition of the import of \n     prison labor products, and the United States government \n     recognizes and respects Chinese legal regulations concerning \n     the prohibition of the export of prison labor products;\n       As China and the United States take note and appreciate the \n     good intentions and efforts made by both sides in \n     implementing the ``Memorandum of Understanding'' signed in \n     August 1992;\n       The Chinese government and the United States government \n     agree that conducting investigations of suspected exports of \n     prison labor products destined for the United States requires \n     cooperation between both sides in order to assure the \n     enforcement of the relevant laws of both countries. Both \n     sides agree that they should stipulate clear guidelines and \n     procedures for the conduct of these investigations. \n     Therefore, both sides agree to the establishment of \n     specialized procedures and guidelines according to the \n     following provisions:\n       First, when one side provides the other side a request, \n     based on specific information, to conduct investigations of \n     suspected exports of prison labor products destined for the \n     United States, the receiving side will provide the requesting \n     side a comprehensive investigative report within 60 days of \n     the receipt of said written request. At the same time, the \n     requesting side will provide a concluding evaluation of the \n     receiving side's investigative report within 60 days of \n     receipt of the report.\n       Second, if the United States government, in order to \n     resolve specific outstanding cases, requests a visit to a \n     suspected facility, the Chinese government will, in \n     conformity with Chinese laws and regulations and in \n     accordance with the MOU, arrange for responsible United \n     States diplomatic mission officials to visit the suspected \n     facility within 60 days of the receipt of a written request.\n       Third, the United States government will submit a report \n     indicating the results of the visit to the Chinese government \n     within 60 days of a visit by diplomatic officials to a \n     suspected facility.\n       Fourth, in cases where the U.S. government presents new or \n     previously unknown information on suspected exports of prison \n     labor products destined for the U.S. regarding a suspected \n     facility that was already visited, the Chinese government \n     will organize new investigations and notify the U.S. side. If \n     necessary, it can also be arranged for the U.S. side to again \n     visit that suspected facility.\n       Fifth, when the Chinese government organizes the \n     investigation of a suspected facility and the U.S. side is \n     allowed to visit the suspected facility, the U.S. side will \n     provide related information conducive to the investigation. \n     In order to accomplish the purpose of the visit, the Chinese \n     side will, in accordance with its laws and regulations, \n     provide an opportunity to consult relevant records and \n     materials on-site and arrange visits to necessary areas of \n     the facility. The U.S. side agrees to protect relevant \n     proprietary information of customers of the facility \n     consistent with the relevant terms of the Prison Labor MOU.\n       Sixth, both sides agree that arrangements for U.S. \n     diplomats to visit suspected facilities, in principle, will \n     proceed after the visit to a previous suspected facility is \n     completely ended and a report indicating the results of the \n     visit is submitted.\n       Both sides further agree to continue to strengthen already \n     established effective contacts between the concerned \n     ministries of the Chinese government and the U.S. Embassy in \n     Beijing and to arrange meetings to discuss specific details \n     when necessary to further the implementation of the MOU in \n     accordance with the points noted above.\n       Done at Beijing, in duplicate, this fourteenth day of \n     March, 1994, in the English and the Chinese languages, both \n     texts being equally authentic.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Embassy of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                                February 22, 2000.\n     Mr. Wang Lixian,\n     Director for Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Justice, Beijing, \n         100020, China.\n       Dear Mr. Wang: In accordance with the provisions of the \n     Memorandum of Understanding prohibiting Import and Export of \n     Prison Labor Products and the Statement of Cooperation, the \n     U.S. Embassy renews our request for investigation of the \n     following factories for evidence of prison labor exports. The \n     request to investigate these facilities was first made \n     February 28, 1994 and was again made on February 24, 1998, \n     March 8, 1999 and July 7, 1999.\n       The below listed investigations were requested five years \n     ago and again last year. The Ministry of Justice has not \n     responded with information on these cases. Therefore, we \n     would like to renew our request that your ministry \n     investigate the following facilities to determine if these \n     sites are involved in prison labor exports:\n       Nanchong Laodong Factory, Sichuan.\n       Fuyang General Machinery Factory, Anhui.\n       Dingxi Crane Works, Gansu.\n       Jilin forging and Pressing Equipment Plant, Jilin.\n       Jingzhou Xinsheng Dyeing and Weaving Mill. Hubei.\n       Lanzhou Valve Plant.\n       Shaoguan Xinsheng Industrial General Plant.\n       In my letter of February 24, 1998 I enclosed background \n     information which should assist in identifying these \n     facilities. I have maintained copies of identifying \n     information if this would be of assistance to your office. I \n     feel that we have made significant progress in clearing up \n     some of these old prison labor investigations and I look \n     forward to continued cooperation.\n       I would also like to call to your attention my letters of \n     April 24, 1998 and October 7, 1998, which requested \n     investigation of the Zhengzhou Detention Center which was \n     alleged to be manufacturing Christmas lights for export to \n     the US and the Dafeng County Reform Through Labor Camp and \n     the Tilanqiao Prison Labor Facility which were alleged to \n     have manufactured ADIDAS soccer balls which were exported to \n     the United States and other countries. The Ministry of \n     Justice has not responded to these investigative requests \n     within the sixty day time limit as agreed upon in the \n     Statement of Cooperation. Please inform us of the status of \n     these investigations.\n       If you have any questions or need further clarification \n     please do not hesitate to contact me. Thank you.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                  David J. Benner,\n                                                          Attache.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am opposed to the use of forced prison \nlabor in the manufacture of goods for sale in international markets. \nAnd, I firmly believe that any allegation, whether with respect to \nChina or any other nation, regarding the use of prison labor ought to \nbe vigorously investigated under section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930, \nwhich bars imports of prison-made goods into the United States.\n  That said, I nonetheless rise in opposition to the proposed \namendment. I do so for three reasons.\n  First, the amendment is unnecessary. Under section 307 of the 1930 \nact, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Commissioner of Customs \nalready have ample authority to investigate allegations that Chinese \nenterprises are using prison labor. No new authority is needed, and no \nnew certification is necessary.\n  Second, there is nothing about China's accession to the WTO or the \npassage of PNTR that limits in any way the ability of the United States \nto investigate allegations of the use of prison labor in the \nmanufacture of goods destined for the U.S. market and to bar imports of \nsuch goods if the allegations prove true.\n  The WTO contains a provision that expressly permits the United \nStates, as well as other WTO members, to bar entry of goods made with \nprison labor from their markets. Just to be entirely clear about what \nthe WTO allows, let me quote from the relevant title of the WTO \nagreement. It states that:\n\n       nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent the \n     adoption or enforcement by any contracting party of measures \n     . . . relating to the products of prison labor.\n\n  In other words, we will retain the leverage we need following China's \naccession to the WTO to encourage China's compliance with its \ninternational commitments in respect of prison labor, particularly the \n1994 bilateral agreement it signed with the United States.\n  Third, the House bill before us, H.R. 4444, already addresses the \nissue of prison labor and does so more constructively. The bill creates \nan executive branch task force to assist the U.S. Customs Service in \nthe effective enforcement of our laws barring imports of goods made \nwith prison labor.\n  As I said at the outset of my remarks, I join those who have been \nvery critical of the Chinese Government for its failure to be more \ncooperative--on a more consistent basis--in rooting out and ending \nthese practices. But, the proposed amendment would not advance our \nargument with the Chinese; it would, instead, prove counterproductive, \nby killing the chances of the passage of PNTR.\n  In light of that fact, I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing \nthis amendment.\n  Again, let me reiterate, it is my deep concern that any amendment \nwould kill this legislation, would kill PNTR. For that reason, I oppose \nthe amendment, and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S8366]]\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I reserve a little bit of time for my colleague, \nSenator Harkin. But let me just say to my colleague from Delaware, as \nto the argument that it is not necessary to have any new agreements, \nthere is nothing new here. We have existing trade agreements. We signed \nan agreement in 1992 and in 1994. The Chinese Government agreed not to \nexport products to our country made by prison labor.\n  They have not lived up to those agreements. This amendment just says \nwe call on them to live up to the existing trade agreements before we \ngo forward with PNTR. It is really that simple.\n  The bitter irony is they are in violation of one law; they are not \nsupposed to be exporting products made by prison labor. And we are in \nviolation of another law: We are not supposed to be importing those \nproducts.\n  My second point is, my colleague cites H.R. 4444. It is just a \ntoothless remedy. This has a ``made-for-Congress'' look. We are going \nto set up a task force, and we are going to assist the Chinese \nGovernment in living up to these trade agreements. The Chinese \nGovernment does not need any assistance. They control the prison labor \ncamps. They can live up to the agreements today. They can live up to \nthe agreements tomorrow. They do not need a task force set up. So I \ncannot let my good friend from Delaware get away with this.\n  I just think it boils down to this: They have the largest forced \nprison labor system in the world; these are the functional equivalent \nof gulags. I could use, frankly, stronger terms, I say to my colleague \nfrom Delaware, to describe them.\n  Do we really want to be implicated in this? Do we want to be \nbeneficiaries of these gulags? Do the citizens of our country--we are \nnow speaking and voting in their name--want to be beneficiaries of this \nforced prison labor system, the largest in the world, these gulags, \nwhere we get products at a lower price because it is on the backs of \npeople who are political prisoners, who have done nothing more than \nspeak out for their freedom? I think not.\n  If we are concerned about it, we will support this amendment. There \nis no way around that, I say to my colleagues. This is a straight up-\nor-down vote on whether or not this is a concern to us.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, the time will be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I informed the distinguished chair of \nthe Finance Committee that I would be ready to yield back time. I \nwonder if I could take 2 minutes and then I will yield back.\n  We will have a vote on the Thompson-Torricelli amendment, and there \nare going to be Senators who will come out and say: This is not about \ntrying to scuttle this overall trade agreement. We will go to \nconference committee. We will get this worked out. And there is such \nstrong sentiment for this overall agreement, this is a good thing to \ndo.\n  I want to say to Senators, I hope when we vote on the amendment I \nhave offered with Senator Lautenberg--and I believe Senator Harkin will \nwant to be an original cosponsor--there will be the same sentiment. If \nyou think it is the right thing to do to vote for this amendment, if \nyou think it is the right thing to do to say to China: We already have \nthese trade agreements with you in regard to prison labor conditions \nand we are just asking you to live up to those agreements before, in \nfact, we finally go forward with PNTR--if you think this is an \nimportant human rights issue, if you think we should not be implicated \nin any way, shape, or form in the functional equivalent of these \ngulags, if you think this is a labor issue, if you think this is a \ntrade issue--it is a very compelling issue--then please don't vote \nagainst what you think is right.\n  We can't have Senators being selective on this and voting one way on \none amendment. Senators can say: We will not vote for any amendments, \nperiod. I have heard that. But now different people are voting for some \namendments and not others.\n  I say to my colleagues: Vote for what you think is right. If you \nthink this amendment I have offered is wrong, it is not the right thing \nto do based upon your sense of justice or right or anything else, then \nvote against it. Otherwise, please vote for this amendment. Don't make \nthe argument that I am voting against all amendments when, in fact, \nSenators are obviously going to be voting for some amendments.\n\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time, and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nMinnesota.

The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Thompson \namendment.\n  I have been listening to the debate on the Thompson amendment for the \nlast day or so. I am very concerned that his amendment has been \nportrayed as a bill killer.\n  I support PNTR. I want to open trade with China. This is very \nimportant for the future of both of our countries. But I am also very \nconcerned about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. I \ncannot see any situation in which the security of the United States of \nAmerica would take second place to a trade issue, even a most important \ntrade issue. Nevertheless, I would never, ever I put the security of \nour country in a secondary position.\n  To say that we cannot go back to the House and resolve our \ndifferences because we would vote on a responsible amendment that would \nrequire a reporting of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \nis just beyond my comprehension. This is the United States Senate. To \nsay we cannot amend a bill that has been passed by the House would be \nthe height of irresponsibility.\n\n[[Page S8367]]\n\n  I am also speaking today in favor of normal trade relations with \nChina because I want our countries to have a mutually good \nrelationship. The idea that we would have a good relationship on trade \nbut one that gives a wink and a nod to proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction to people intent on hurting the United States of America is \nnot a fair trade. I couldn't possibly exercise my responsibility as a \nSenator and vote against the Thompson amendment.\n  In early 1969, newly elected President Richard Nixon asserted:\n\n       One-fourth of the world's people live in Communist China. \n     Today they are not a significant power, but 25 years from now \n     they could be decisive. For the United States not to do what \n     it can at this time, when it can, would lead to a situation \n     of great danger. We could have total detente with the Soviet \n     Union, but that would mean nothing if the Chinese are outside \n     the international community.\n\n  Today, President Nixon's words sound remarkably prescient. China is \nundeniably a major world power, thanks in large part to leaders such as \nPresidents Nixon and Bush and Reagan, Secretary Jim Baker, Secretary \nHenry Kissinger, China is not outside the international community but \nneither is China fully a member in good standing of the family of \nresponsible nations.\n  The major issues our two nations must confront are difficult and \ncomplex: China's military buildup, arms sales and proliferation, the \nfuture of Taiwan, bilateral trade, and human rights. All of the \nprevious Presidents in my lifetime have recognized the unfolding \nimportance of China, and they have all pursued policies aimed at \nconstructive engagement with the Chinese Government.\n  The question at issue with our vote on PNTR and our vote on the \namendments that condition the Senate's approval of PNTR must be, what \nare the underlying goals of our relationship with China and what are \nthe primary issues that should guide American policymaking and actions.\n  My answer is, our policies should be focused on cultivating a stable \nand peaceful Asia. We should look to economic competition and mutual \nprosperity to bring this about, and we must at all times consider the \nsecurity interests of the United States.\n  As the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, \nJesse Helms, pointed out yesterday, the Chinese proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction poses a direct threat to the national \nsecurity of the United States. I share his view that it would be \nirresponsible for us not to address that threat.\n  The Federal Government has no greater responsibility nor higher duty \nto the people of our country and to our allies than to provide for the \ncommon defense of the United States of America.\n\n  The bipartisan amendment offered by Senators Thompson and Torricelli \nis a responsible vote. It does not scuttle PNTR, as some have warned. \nThis is the responsible action of the Senate. It would be my fervent \nwish that we could vote our conscience on this very important issue, \nand not in any way respond to the scare tactics that have been put \nforth that this will kill the bill, but instead do what is right for \nboth of our countries; that is, open, normal trade relations, and \nsecure the United States from weapons proliferation by China or any \nother country or rogue nation that would seek to harm our people or our \nallies anywhere in the world.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, it has been obvious for some time now \nthat when permanent normal trade relations for China comes to a vote in \nthe Senate, it will, indeed, pass overwhelmingly. My colleagues \nproceeding with this debate in recent days have detailed at length the \nenormous potential economic benefits to the U.S. economy. Other \ncolleagues have appropriately discussed the human rights record in \nChina, problems with religious freedom, and the rights of workers in \nChina. They are all legitimate points and each belongs in a debate on \nPNTR with China, but the debate is not complete.\n  The relationship of the United States with the People's Republic of \nChina is not only about economics; it must include human rights, \nreligious rights, and workers rights. But it is not just about those \nrights; it is also ultimately about the security of the United States.\n  Our relationship with the People's Republic of China, a nation of 1.3 \nbillion people, an immense land of economic, geopolitical significance, \ngoes beyond that, perhaps, of any other trading partner of our country. \nIndeed, how we define this relationship in this vote and in this debate \nhas enormous ramifications in the next generation.\n  Indeed, just as the debate in those first few months and years after \nthe Second World War changed permanently the security and economic \nrelationship between the United States and Western Europe and the \nremainder of the world, this debate will permanently alter our \nrelationship with the People's Republic of China, and it is not right \nand it is not appropriate that it be done on a single plane. Economics \nis important, but it is not everything. That is why Senator Thompson \nand I have offered our amendment to address the continuing problem of \nthe proliferation of weapons and technology from the People's Republic \nof China.\n  It was, of course, our hope that this vote could have been taken \nindependently of PNTR. It was our desire not to complicate PNTR but to \nhave a separate debate and separate vote. Regrettably, that proved not \nto be possible. So we return today with this amendment actually on the \nbill.\n  As I understand the arguments now for the bill, the most compelling \nis that PNTR will integrate China into the international economy, that \nit will encourage China to follow international trading rules. It is a \nstrong argument, but even with passage of PNTR, even if the proponents \nare correct that China will then adhere to international trading rules, \nthat does not automatically make China a member in good standing of the \nglobal community. Trading rules do not govern all international \nconduct. A nation is not a nation in good standing in the world simply \nbecause it trades according to these rules; it is by all the rules by \nwhich it chooses to live.\n  Truly to participate in the global community, China will, as has been \nargued on this floor, have to reform its human rights practices, the \nway it treats its workers, the way it relates to Taiwan, and how it \ndeals with sensitive military technology that threatens all peoples \neverywhere.\n  Despite many assurances that it will reform its behavior, China has \ncontinued to be one of the most persistent and serious violators of \ninternational nonproliferation agreements. Ultimately, that is the \nquestion every Senator must ask themselves: If, indeed, PNTR is passed \nand China continues to violate trade agreements, you can go to your \nlocal townhall meeting and complain to the autoworkers and you can \nexplain it to the Chamber of Commerce, but if China continues to \nviolate proliferation agreements which leads to the spread of nuclear \ntechnology and missiles to a variety of dangerous neighbors that one \nday leads to warfare involving our Nation or others, to whom will you \napologize then? Where will the explanations lie? That is the question \nbefore the Senate.\n\n  Last month, the Director of Central Intelligence delivered to the \nCongress the intelligence community's biannual ``Unclassified Report on \nthe Acquisition of Technology Relating to Weapons of Mass \nDestruction.''\n  The DCI report clearly states that China has increased its missile-\nrelated assistance to Pakistan, and it continues to provide missile-\nrelated assistance to countries such as Iran, North Korea, and Libya. \nWhat is especially troubling about China's activities is that this \nsensitive assistance is going to the most dangerous nations in the most \nvolatile areas of the world, with the greatest potential to do harm.\n  Indeed, looking at this map I have here--from Algeria to Libya to \nSyria to Iran--what is it that China could do more? What would be \nworse? What other nation would have to receive nuclear or missile \ntechnology before it\n\n[[Page S8368]]\n\nwould offend Members of the Senate? In the entire list of rogue \nnations, almost no one is absent.\n  Just a couple of months ago, Chinese sales to Iran led to the test by \nIran of a Shahab-3 medium-range ballistic missile. It is believed that \ncomponents of Iran's missile program are from Beijing.\n  The People's Republic of China companies were sanctioned in 1997 for \ntransfers to Iran, contributing to chemical weapons proliferation. Yet \nthe DCI's August 2000 report said Iran continues to seek production \ntechnology, expertise, and chemicals for its chemical weapons program.\n  So it is missiles and chemicals.\n  Pakistan is a country located, perhaps, in the most volatile region \nof the world, which in recent years exploded a nuclear device and has \ncome to the brink of war with India on several occasions since its new \nnuclear status.\n  The DCI reported last month that the PRC provided ``extensive \nsupport'' to Pakistan's weapons of mass destruction program, and in the \nsecond half of 1999 Iran had ``ongoing contacts'' that could not be \nruled out, despite a 1996 promise by the PRC to stop assistance to \nunsafeguarded nuclear facilities.\n  In unpublished press accounts, U.S. intelligence agencies have \nreportedly concluded that China has stepped up its shipment of \nspecialty steels, guidance systems, and technical expertise to \nPakistan. Chinese experts have also been sighted around Pakistan's \nnewest missile factory, which appears to be partly based on Chinese \ndesign.\n  Libya is a country with a history of promoting regional instability, \nsponsoring state terrorism, including the destruction of our own \naircraft and our own citizens.\n  The August 2000 DCI report publicly confirmed the PRC's assistance to \nLibya for the first time. The Defense Department reportedly discovered \nin December 1999 that the PRC plans to build a hypersonic wind tunnel \nin Libya for missile designs for the Al-Fatah missile program.\n  According to reports in the Washington Times, the director of Libya's \nAl-Fatah missile program is planning to travel to China to attend \nChina's premier training center for missile scientists and technicians.\n  North Korea's missile program is now believed to be achieving the \npotential to reach the United States with a ballistic missile, \npotentially by the year 2005--a direct security concern of the United \nStates, leading this Congress to authorize and appropriate billions of \ndollars for missile defense, leading all of us to a sense of new \nvulnerability.\n\n  The DCI first publicly confirmed in 1999 that the PRC is supplying \ncomponents to North Korea. The August 2000 report states that North \nKorea acquired missile-related raw materials and components \n``especially through firms in China'' in the second half of 1999.\n  These countries--Iran, Pakistan, Libya, and North Korea--are just the \ncountries China has proliferated to in recent years. In the past, \nproliferation by the People's Republic of China has also included \nsending weapons technology to Iraq, Syria, and Algeria.\n  I cannot imagine any accusation against a foreign government that \ncould or should raise more serious concerns in this body. How, indeed, \ncould any Member of this Senate ever explain to the American people \ngranting the greatest economic gift in the world, a normalized trade \nrelationship with the United States, the greatest economy in the world, \nwithout at least, at a minimum, seeking enforcement of previous \nagreements for arms control and nonproliferation?\n  Until China ceases to allow this type of sensitive equipment, \ntechnology, and expertise to flow through its borders, it must \nunderstand that it can never have normalized political and economic \nrelationships with the United States or, indeed, be accepted into the \nfamily of nations on an equal status with all other nations.\n  Opponents of our amendment contend that the current nonproliferation \nlaws are effective; that Chinese proliferation is under control; that \nunilateral sanctions never work. They could not be more wrong.\n  As the reports I have just cited demonstrate, Chinese proliferation \nbehavior is not improving. It is not getting better. And the DCI's \nreport delivered to this Congress proves it. Existing nonproliferation \nlaws are simply not working. This provides a real incentive, in actual \nquantifiable costs, for sharing technology with dangerous nations.\n  Our nonproliferation laws must be strengthened. This amendment--and \nonly the Thompson-Torricelli amendment--offers that opportunity. Under \nthis amendment, the President of the United States would submit a \nreport to Congress by June 1st of each year identifying entities in key \nproliferating nations that have contributed to the development or \nacquisition of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons, or ballistic \nor cruise missiles by foreign countries--every year a report \nidentifying the entities.\n  The President would be required to impose measures against companies \nin key supplier nations that have been identified as proliferators, and \nthe President would also be authorized to impose measures against any \nsupplier countries as he sees fit. The President is given the \ndiscretion, but he is also given the responsibility. And this Congress \nis given the information that it needs to know whether or not the \nNation is being safeguarded.\n  Over the past several months, we have substantially revised this \nlegislation to address a number of concerns by the administration and \nby our colleagues. This amendment was not drafted by Senator Thompson \nor by myself alone. The administration raised legitimate concerns that \nit dealt only with specific technologies, only with the nations about \nwhich we should be concerned. It has been redrafted to deal \nspecifically with those concerns.\n\n  The revised bill now applies to all countries identified by the \nDirector of Central Intelligence as key suppliers of weapons of mass \ndestruction. The list currently includes China, Russia, and North \nKorea. Countries could be added or removed from the list over time \nbased on the DCI's guidelines. So there are no unintended consequences \nof other states.\n  There were objections originally that the President did not have \nenough discretion in applying the sanctions; that the sanctions in the \nbill were too broad; and that they were applied with a standard of \nevidence that was too low. Every one of those problems was changed to \nmeet the administration's objectives.\n  The bill is now drafted so that any sanctions against supplier \ncountries are totally within the discretion of the President. The list \nof measures available to the President are the same as in the original \nbill. But now the President is authorized--not mandated--to apply these \nsanctions.\n  So those within the Senate who had concerns that we were taking away \nPresidential discretion, forcing him to act when the facts may not \nwarrant it, prohibiting him from negotiating by not having this \ndiscretion, have had their concerns addressed. The President is given \nauthorization. He is not mandated.\n  The only mandatory measures remaining in the bill would be applied \nagainst specific entities or countries that are determined by the \nPresident to be proliferators. Only if the President determines they \nare a proliferator will any entity be sanctioned.\n  If a company is determined to be a proliferator, the President must \ndeny all pending licenses and suspend all existing licenses for the \ntransfer to that company that are controlled for export under the Arms \nExport Control Act, the Export Administration Act of 1979, or the \nExport Administration Regulations. Isn't that how the Senate would have \nit? If a company has been identified, if they have been multiple \nviolators, if they have been cited by the President, shouldn't that \ncompany then be denied the benefits of these various export acts?\n\n  There is also an across-the-board prohibition on any U.S. Government \npurchase of goods or services from, and U.S. Government assistance or \ncredits to, the proliferator. Would any Member of the Senate argue with \nthis? To use the taxpayers' money, U.S. Government resources to buy \nfrom a company that has been repeatedly cited as a proliferator by the \nU.S. Government? Certainly they should not be entitled to the benefits \nof trade with the Government itself.\n  Is it too much to ask that we impose the sanctions on companies that \nare already identified, already established as\n\n[[Page S8369]]\n\nhaving been engaged in this conduct? But for some Members of the \nSenate, this was not enough. So we gave the President one further set \nof powers, waiver authority, which allows the President to waive the \nimposition of measures required under this legislation if he determines \nthat the supplier country was taking appropriate actions to penalize \nthe entity for such acts of proliferation and to deter future \nproliferation. The President also can waive the sanctions if he \ndetermines that such a waiver is important to the national security of \nthe United States.\n  How little would be enough? It isn't mandatory. It is optional. It \nrequires multiple instances. It must be an entity already identified by \nthe President. It must be a technology already identified by the \nGovernment. It isn't mandatory. The President can waive it. He can cite \nlarger national interests.\n  I believe there is a positive impact with the passage of this \namendment.\n  Now I ask the Senate another question: What is the impact of failing \nto enact it? Who could ever believe that this Senate considers \nproliferation issues to be serious, that we are concerned that there is \na price to selling these weapons of mass destruction or these \ntechnologies to other nations, if we cannot at a minimum pass this \nauthorizing sanction on an optional basis, to be used if the President \nwants to use it?\n  Imagine the message in Beijing or North Korea or Iran or Iraq. Are we \nso desperate for trade, is this economy so desperate for that one more \ndollar immediately, not to offend a potential investor or buyer, that \nwe would compromise our own good judgment?\n  I don't believe we would lose a dollar of trade with this amendment. \nI don't believe we lose a product, a job. But even if we did, even if I \nwere wrong and we did, is the price too high to send a message that in \nour proliferation policy there is more than words?\n  Words will not defend us. It is not at all clear that our missile \ndefense shield will ever protect us. This might. It can't hurt. It at \nleast can set a serious tone that we will not be dealt with with \nimpunity. Trade with us; get the benefits of our market. But we will \nlook the other way while you send dangerous technologies to nations \nthat kill our people or threaten the peace.\n  In a recent editorial, the Washington Post noted:\n\n       China's continuing assistance to Pakistan's weapons program \n     in the face of so many U.S. efforts to talk Beijing out of it \n     shows the limits of a nonconfrontational approach.\n\n  The Post went on to say:\n\n       The United States should make clear that . . . Chinese \n     missile-making is incompatible with business as usual.\n\n  A Wall Street Journal editorial stated:\n\n       If there is an assumption in Beijing that it can be less \n     observant to U.S. concerns now that its WTO membership seems \n     assured, the Chinese leadership is making a serious mistake.\n\n  Are they? The Wall Street Journal was too optimistic. Whether they \nare making a serious mistake will be judged by the vote on this bill, \nwin or lose. How many Senators consider proliferation issues and \nnational security to be more than words but a policy with strength, \nwith cost, with sanction, if our security is violated?\n  If we pass PNTR alone and do not pass legislation addressing these \nimportant national security concerns, I fear for the message that is \nsent and the priorities of this Senate. This Senate will always be \nsensitive to business investment, trading opportunities, and economic \ngrowth. It is our responsibility to assure that America is prosperous \nand strong and growing. We will meet that responsibility.\n  But it is the essence of leadership to understand that no one \nresponsibility stands alone. As we govern the national economy, we \npossess responsibility for the national security. No economy can be so \nbig, no economy can grow so swiftly, there can be no number of jobs \nwith national income that can reach no level that makes for a secure \nAmerican future if missile technology spreads to Iraq and Iran, if \nnuclear weapons begin to circle the globe and unstable regimes.\n  Where, my colleagues, will your economy take you then? Balance, my \nfriends. The Thompson-Torricelli amendment offers balance. We are \npleased by our prosperity, but we are not blinded by it. We are blessed \nto live in a time of peace, but we understand how we earned it--by \nstrong policies of national security. That is what the Thompson-\nTorricelli amendment offers today.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/12/senate-section/article/S8369-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/12/senate-section/article/S8370-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8370-S8375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MESS AT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to talk again about the \nmess at the Department of Justice. As we all know, this Justice \nDepartment has been subjected to criticism from Democrats and \nRepublicans alike for mishandling cases. Yesterday, the Justice \nDepartment's own Inspector General completed a lengthy report which \npoints to ``egregious misconduct'' by senior officials in the Justice \nDepartment. That phrase ``egregious misconduct'' is not my phrase. \nThat's the conclusion of the IG.\n  This is a sordid story which began in 1997, when I wrote to Attorney \nGeneral Reno asking her not to fire a whistle blower who had alleged \nmisconduct in two components of DOJ's Criminal Division--The \nInternational Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program, also \nknown as ``ICITAP'', and the Overseas Prosecutorial Development, \nAssistance and Training, also known as ``OPDAT''. These offices train \nprosecutors and police in other countries to enforce laws in a way that \nrespects the rule of law and human rights. As such, these offices are \nheavy consumers of intelligence from various intelligence gathering \nagencies that monitor human rights abuses. The IG concluded that some \nSenior DOJ Officials in these offices intentionally refused to follow \nGovernment Regulations regarding the handling of classified information \nand recommended discipline for three DOJ officials.\n  The allegations I received in 1997 related to serious security \nbreaches as well as the misuse of Government authority for the personal \nand financial benefit of top DOJ Officials. I was shocked to hear \nallegations that Bob Bratt, the Executive Officer of the Criminal \nDivision, who had supervisory control over these offices, and Joe Lake \nwho was an assistant to Mr. Bratt, used their Government positions to \nget visas for Russian women that Brat met through a ``match making \nservice.'' I was shocked to hear allegations that a Senior Justice \nOfficial was allowed to retire early with an early retirement bonus, \nand then be re-hired at DOJ as an outside contractor just a few months \nlater in clear violation of Federal law.\n  But, these all proved to be accurate. To quote the Inspector \nGeneral's report ``We concluded that Bratt and Lake committed egregious \nmisconduct'' in obtaining visas for Russian women to enter the country \nunder false pretenses. These women had been denied visas in the past \nand were only given visas when Bratt assured Embassy Officials in \nMoscow that these women would be working for DOJ in the future. The IG \nconcluded that this was a false statement. The IG concluded that Bratt \nand Lake offered explanations for their conduct and denials regarding \nthe visas for the Russian women which were ``not credible.'' The IG \nalso concluded that Bratt's ``intimate involvement'' with these Russian \nwomen left him vulnerable to blackmail and presented a security \nconcern. The IG report indicates that Bratt may have pressured other \nDOJ employees to mislead the IG inspectors. And the IG found that Bratt \nhad DOJ computers sent to a school in Virginia where a girlfriend \nworks.\n  Clearly, this is the kind of misconduct which should be exposed and \ncorrected. This is why I work so hard to support whistle blowers when \nthey ask for my help.\n  But it doesn't end there. The IG also concluded that Joe Lake \nviolated Federal Law when he took an early retirement bonus of $ \n25,000. One provision of the early retirement program prohibited lake \nfrom working for DOJ for 5 years after his retirement. Yet, two months \nafter he retired, Lake was hired as a consultant at DOJ reporting to \nhis old friend Bob Bratt. This was patently illegal, and the IG \nrecommends that DOJ seek the return of lake's $ 25,000 retirement \nbonus.\n  The IG also noted many of the hiring practices at issue were--to use \nthe IG's own words--``questionable.'' For instance, the IG report \ndescribed the hiring of a bartender at a local restaurant frequented by \nthe Associate Director of ICITAP. The bartender was originally hired to \nwork at DOJ on a temporary basis. After this bartender-turned-\nGovernment lawyer began a personal relationship with Bratt, Bratt hired \nher on a permanent basis at DOJ. Another example cited by the IG \ninvolved an ICITAP official hiring the father of an ex-spouse's step-\nchildren even though he had very little experience. Again, the American \npeople deserve better from their Government.\n  The IG report also indicates that Senior Justice officials improperly \nused frequent flier miles. The IG recommends that security clearances \nbe\n\n[[Page S8371]]\n\ngranted to ICITAP officials only after evaluating their poor record of \ncomplying with security regulations.\n  I wrote to the Attorney General on this matter in 1997. It's taken \nuntil September of 2000 for DOJ to finish its report. Just last month, \nMr. Bratt was allowed to retire from Government service. The IG report \nindicates that the IG would have recommended that Bratt be fired from \nthe Justice Department if he were still working for DOJ. It seems to me \nthat Senior Justice officials may need to be held accountable for \nletting Bratt retire rather than face the music for his misdeeds. As \nChairman of the Administrative Oversight Subcommittee on the Judiciary \nCommittee, I intend to keep a close eye on the Criminal Division, in \nlight of this sorry Record.\n  Mr. President, this is merely the latest example of how Justice \nDepartment is a real mess. We all know that. For the benefit of my \ncolleagues, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at \nthe cost of $1,300 an executive summary of the report.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       Te International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance \n     Program (ICITAP) is an office within the Criminal Division of \n     the Department of Justice that provides training for foreign \n     police agencies in new and emerging democracies and assists \n     in the development of police forces relating to international \n     peacekeeping operations. The Criminal Division's Office of \n     Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training \n     (OPDAT) trains prosecutors and judges in foreign countries in \n     coordination with United States Embassies and other \n     government agencies. The Criminal Division's Office of \n     Administration serves the Criminal Division's administrative \n     needs. This report details the results of an investigation by \n     the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) into allegations \n     that managers in ICITAP, OPDAT, and the Office of \n     Administration committed misconduct or other improprieties.\n       The allegations raised a wide variety of issues including \n     managers' improper use of their government positions to \n     obtain visas for foreign citizens, widespread violations of \n     the rules governing the handling and storage of classified \n     documents, managers' use of business class travel without \n     authorization, managers' use of frequent flyer miles earned \n     on government travel for personal use, violations of \n     contractual rules and regulations, failure to supervise \n     contracts leading to substantial cost overruns and \n     overcharges by contractors, and favoritism in the hiring and \n     promotion of certain employees. Many of the allegations \n     concerned the actions of Robert K. ``Bob'' Bratt, a senior \n     Department official who became the Criminal Division \n     Executive Officer in charge of the Office of Administration \n     in 1992. At varying times during the years 1995-1997, Bratt \n     also was the Acting Director of ICITAP and the Coordinator of \n     both ICITAP and OPDAT.\n       We substantiated many of the allegations and found that \n     individual managers, including Bratt, committed serious \n     misconduct. We also concluded that managers in ICITAP, OPDAT, \n     and the Office of Administration failed to follow or enforce \n     government regulations regarding ethics, security, travel, \n     and contracts. As a result of our investigation, we \n     recommended discipline for three employees. We would have \n     recommended significant disciple for Bratt, including \n     possible termination, but for Bratt's retirement effective \n     August 1, 2000. We also found that some of the problems \n     revealed by this investigation go beyond holding individual \n     managers accountable for their actions and that the \n     Department can make changes to enhance the performance of \n     other managers, employees, and offices. Therefore, we made \n     nine recommendations concerning systemic improvements for the \n     Department to consider.\n       The report is divided into chapters addressing the major \n     allegations. In this Executive Summary, we summarize the \n     background of the investigation and the allegations, the \n     investigative findings, and the OIG conclusions with respect \n     to each chapter.\n\n\n                   i. background of the investigation\n\n       ICITAP was created in 1986 and although it is part of the \n     Department of Justice, its programs are funded by the \n     Department of State. OPDAT, created in 1991, is similarly \n     funded. Both ICITAP and OPDAT are headed by Directors, with a \n     Coordinator responsible for overseeing the management of both \n     organizations. The Office of Administration handles the \n     administrative functions for the Criminal Division, including \n     personnel, budget, information technology, and procurement \n     matters. The Executive Officer heads the Office of \n     Administration.\n       Bratt became the Executive Officer for the Criminal \n     Division in 1992. He was appointed the Acting Director of \n     ICITAP in March 1995 following the dismissal of the previous \n     Director. After Janice Stromsem was selected as ICITAP \n     Director and assumed the post in August 1995, Bratt resumed \n     his duties as Executive Officer. Bratt was appointed to the \n     newly created post of Coordinator in September 1996 where he \n     remained until being detailed to the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service (INS) in April 1997 at the request of \n     the Attorney General.\n       ICITAP has had a long history of turmoil. Between 1994 and \n     1997, four different individuals assumed the responsibility \n     of Director or Acting Director. During that period, here were \n     two different investigations into allegations of misconduct \n     as well as reviews of ICITAP's organizationals structure and \n     financial systems. In 1994, at the request of the Criminal \n     Division Assistant Attorney General, the OIG completed two \n     investigations of ICITAP that examined allegations of \n     favoritism in selecting consultants, misconduct in travel \n     reimbursements, poor quality of ICITAP's work products, waste \n     and inefficiency in program and contract expenditures, and \n     management of foreign programs. The OIG did not substantiate \n     the allegations of misconduct but did find that ICITAP did \n     not plan its programs carefully. The OIG also made \n     recommendations to improve ICITAP's financial management. \n     In January 1995, Bratt examined a proposed ICITAP \n     reorganization plan and conducted an investigation \n     following additional allegations of misconduct that were \n     made to the Criminal Division, allegations that Bratt \n     substantiated.\n       This OIG investigation began in April 1997 when an ICITAP \n     employee reported to the Department's security staff that an \n     ICITAP senior manager had provided classified documents to \n     persons who did not have a security clearance. The \n     Department's security staff and the OIG investigated the \n     allegation and confirmed it. The OIG continued the \n     investigation to determine the extent of security problems at \n     ICITAP. While this investigation was ongoing, the OIG \n     received numerous allegations of misconduct and mismanagement \n     at ICITAP and OPDAT, and we broadened our investigation to \n     encompass these new allegations.\n\n\n                    ii. investigation of allegations\n\n     A. Issuance of visas to Russian women\n       Bratt made four trips to Russia in late 1996 and 1997 in \n     conjunction with his duties as ICITAP and OPDAT Coordinator. \n     We received several allegations of impropriety relating to \n     these trips. The most serious allegation was that Bratt and \n     Criminal Division Associate Executive Officer Joseph R. Lake, \n     Jr. improperly used Bratt's government position to obtain \n     visas for two Russian women, one or both of whom it was \n     alleged were Bratt's ``Russian girlfriends.''\n       Our review determined that in 1997 Russians seeking to \n     visit the United States had two methods of obtaining visas \n     from the American Embassy in Moscow: the standard process and \n     the ``referral'' process. The standard process could be used \n     by any Russian seeking to visit the United States. Russians \n     applying through the standard process were required to wait \n     in long lines at the American Embassy in Moscow to submit \n     their applications, and the process included an interview by \n     an American Embassy official. The Embassy official could deny \n     the application if, among other reasons, the official did not \n     believe the applicant had established that he or she would \n     return to Russia. The ``referral'' process could be used in \n     much more limited circumstances. The referral process \n     required that United States government interests be supported \n     by the applicant's visit to the United States or that a \n     humanitarian basis existed for the visit. In the referral \n     process, the visa application was submitted by an Embassy \n     official who completed a form approved by an Embassy Section \n     Chief setting forth the United States government interest in \n     or the humanitarian basis for the applicant's visit. No \n     interview was required, and the use of the referral process \n     generally ensured that the applicant would receive a visa.\n       Two Russian citizens, Yelena Koreneva and Ludmilla Bolgak, \n     received on April 7, 1997, visas to visit the United States. \n     They received the visas because Lake submitted their \n     applications using the referral process and purported that a \n     government interest existed for their visit to the United \n     States. On the referral form Lake wrote that ``[a]pplicants \n     have worked with the Executive Officer (EO) Criminal Division \n     in support of administrative functions, Moscow Office.'' He \n     signed it ``Joe Lake for BB.'' In addition to being the \n     ICITAP and OPDAT Coordinator, Bratt retained the title and \n     many of the responsibilities of the Executive Officer.\n       We determined that neither woman had ever worked for Bratt \n     or the Criminal Division. Both women socialized extensively \n     with Bratt during his visits to Moscow, but Bratt did not \n     have a professional relationship with them. We concluded that \n     the statement written on the referral form was false.\n       We found that Bratt first visited Moscow in November 1996 \n     during which he received a tour of various tourist sites from \n     a Russian interpreter. According to the interpreter, during \n     the tour she told Bratt that she also worked for a Russian \n     ``match-making'' agency. She said that in response, Bratt \n     told her he would like to meet a single Russian woman. The \n     interpreter contacted a business associate, Bolgak, who had a \n     friend who was single, Koreneva. Bratt met Koreneva and \n     Bolgak on his next trip to Moscow, in January 1997. On this \n     trip, as well as his later trips to Moscow, Bratt socialized \n     extensively with Koreneva and Bolgak, usually meeting them \n     for dinner or drinks.\n       During the January trip, Bratt invited the women to come to \n     the United States to visit him. Koreneva told Bratt that she \n     had previously been denied a visa to visit the United\n\n[[Page S8372]]\n\n     States. Between the January trip and his next trip to Moscow \n     in March 1997, Bratt investigated how Russians could obtain \n     visas to visit the United States. He made inquiries of a \n     personal friend who worked for the State Department and also \n     of Cary Hoover, the Special Assistant to the ICITAP Director. \n     Bratt learned that Russians applied for visas at the \n     American Embassy in Moscow, that they were interviewed by \n     Embassy officials, and that the Embassy made a \n     determination as to whether the applicant would return to \n     Russia. Bratt also asked Hoover specifically for \n     information about the referral process.\n       In March 1997 Bratt and Hoover returned to Moscow on \n     business. During this trip Bratt and Hoover met with an \n     unidentified Embassy official to learn more about the visa \n     process. The evidence showed that Bratt, Hoover, and the \n     Embassy official discussed the likelihood of Koreneva being \n     denied a visa. During the meeting Bratt told the official \n     that one or both of the women might work for the Department \n     of Justice in the future. We concluded that Bratt learned \n     through these various inquiries that Koreneva would likely be \n     denied a visa again if she used the standard application \n     process.\n       Although Bratt and Lake deny it, the evidence showed that \n     Bratt returned to the Embassy again during this March trip, \n     this time accompanied by Lake who was also in Moscow, and met \n     with Donald Wells, the head of the Embassy office responsible \n     for issuing visas through the referral process. Bratt and \n     Lake told Wells that they wished to bring two women with whom \n     they had a professional relationship to the United States for \n     consultations. Wells told the men that the referral process \n     could only be used if there was a government interest in the \n     women's visit to the United States.\n       We also learned that within a few days of the meeting with \n     Wells, Lake obtained a visa referral form from the Embassy. \n     The evidence showed that Lake called Bratt, who had returned \n     to the United States, to discuss the form. Lake submitted the \n     women's applications and the visa referral form containing \n     the false statement about the women having worked for the \n     Executive Officer to the Embassy. The visas were issued \n     shortly thereafter although they were never used by the \n     women. Although he initially falsely claimed to the OIG that \n     he was just friends with Koreneva, Bratt later admitted to \n     the OIG that he had an intimate relationship with her.\n       We concluded that Bratt and Lake knowingly used the \n     referral process even though they were aware that it required \n     a government interest in the women's visit and that no such \n     government interest existed. We also found that Bratt's and \n     Lake's explanations of their conduct, as well as their \n     denials that certain events happened, were not credible. We \n     concluded that Bratt and Lake committed egregious misconduct.\n     B. Security failures at ICITAP\n       In April 1997 the Department of Justice Security and \n     Emergency Planning Staff (SEPS) received an allegation from \n     an OPDAT employee that Special Assistant to the ICITAP \n     Director Hoover had improperly given classified documents to \n     individuals who worked at ICITAP and who did not have \n     security clearances. SEPS and the OIG confirmed the \n     allegation. SEPS then conducted an unannounced, after-hours \n     sweep of the ICITAP offices on April 14, 1997, to further \n     assess ICITAP's compliance with security rules and \n     regulations. During that sweep and a follow-up review \n     conducted by the Criminal Division Security Staff, 156 \n     classified documents were found unsecured in the office of \n     Joseph Trincellito, ICITAP Associate Director. The OIG and \n     SEPS conducted further investigation to determine the extent \n     of ICITAP's security problems and ICITAP management's \n     responsibility for the failures.\n       The OIG found that the problems discovered in the 1997 \n     security reviews had existed for many years. Evidence showed \n     that senior managers provided or attempted to provide \n     classified documents to uncleared consultants or other staff. \n     Staff, including senior managers, routinely left classified \n     documents unsecured on desks, including when individuals were \n     away from their offices on travel. Stromsem, Hoover, and \n     Trincellito improperly took classified documents home. Highly \n     classified documents containing Sensitive Compartmented \n     Information (SCI), or ``codeword'' information, were brought \n     to the ICITAP offices even though ICITAP did not have the \n     type of secure facility (a Sensitive Compartmented \n     Information Facility or ``SCIF'') required to store SCI. The \n     evidence showed that ICITAP inaccurately certified to United \n     States Embassies that individuals had security clearances \n     when they did not. We also found one instance where \n     classified information was sent over an unsecure e-mail \n     system.\n       As an example of the inattention ICITAP managers gave to \n     security, we set forth the troubling history of ICITAP \n     Associate Director Trincellito's handling of classified \n     information. From 1995 through early 1997, ICITAP's security \n     officers repeatedly found classified documents left \n     unattended in Trincellito's office. The security officers \n     warned Trincellito that he was violating security rules, and \n     they also notified other ICITAP managers about the problem. \n     One security officer, after becoming aware of repeated \n     violations, documented the violations in writing and \n     recommended discipline for Trincellito. ICITAP Director \n     Stromsem on occasion spoke to Trincellito about his \n     violations and attempted to make it easier for him to \n     comply with rules by putting a safe in his office. \n     However, in the face of repeated violations indicating \n     that Trincellito refused to comply with security \n     regulations, Stromsem and other senior ICITAP managers \n     failed to take sufficient action, such as initiating \n     discipline, to ensure that Trincellito complied with \n     security regulations.\n       We found that ICITAP managers' own violations of the \n     security rules, their tolerance of Trincellito's known \n     violations, and the removal of the security officers who \n     attempted to enforce the rules sent a message that security \n     was not important at ICITAP. We also found that the Criminal \n     Division did not adequately supervise ICITAP's security \n     program even though security reviews conducted by both SEPS \n     and the Criminal Division beginning in 1994 showed a pattern \n     of security violations.\n       In this chapter we also discuss the security implications \n     raised by Bratt's involvement with Koreneva. Bratt held a \n     high-level security clearance and had access to highly \n     classified documents. We concluded that Bratt's intimate \n     involvement with a Russian citizen about whom he knew very \n     little, has invitation to her to visit the United States and \n     his office, his improper use of his government position to \n     obtain a visa for Koreneva and Bolgak, and his attempt to \n     conceal the true nature of the relationship left him \n     vulnerable to blackmail and represented a security concern.\n       We found that the actions of another ICITAP employee who \n     was intimately involved with a Russian national also \n     represented a security concern.\n     C. Business class travel\n       We found that Bratt and other ICITAP and OPDAT manager \n     improperly flew business class when traveling to and from \n     Moscow in 1996 and 1997. Government and Department Travel \n     Regulations restrict the use of business class by government \n     travelers. Even in circumstances when business class may be \n     used, it must be authorized by the traveler's supervisor. We \n     found that Bratt instigated and approved a scheme to \n     improperly manipulate his flight schedules in order to \n     qualify for business class travel. We concluded that Bratt's \n     and the other managers' use of business class was not \n     authorized and violated the rules limiting the use of \n     business class travel.\n       On one trip, in November 1996 Bratt, Lake, and Thomas Snow, \n     the Acting Director of OPDAT, traveled to Moscow and several \n     other European cities using business class on at least one \n     leg of the trip. Business class was arranged by the \n     Department's travel agency because the method used by the \n     airlines to calculate the cost of trips with several stops \n     made the use of business class less expensive than coach \n     class. However, we found that a weekend stop in Frankfurt, \n     Germany, violated the Travel Regulations and that the stop \n     should not have been used as a basis to obtain business class \n     accommodations. We also found that the Department's travel \n     agency had suggested an alternative itinerary for this trip \n     that would have saved the government substantial money but \n     that the itinerary was improperly rejected by Lake.\n       On a second trip, in January 1997 Bratt and Hoover flew \n     business class to Moscow purportedly pursuant to the ``14-\n     hour'' rule. If authorized by a supervisor, government \n     regulations permit travelers to fly business class when a \n     flight, including layovers to catch a connecting flight, is \n     longer than 14 hours. For this trip, Bratt requested that his \n     Executive Assistant determine whether the flight proposed by \n     the travel agency qualified for business class under the 14-\n     hour rule. His Executive Assistant checked with three \n     different individuals and based on the information she \n     received, she told Bratt that he did not qualify for business \n     class because both legs of the flight took less than the \n     requisite time.\n       Nonetheless, according to Bratt's Executive Assistant, \n     Bratt told her to ``do what you can to get me on business \n     class.'' As a result, Bratt's Executive Assistant arranged \n     with the Department's travel agency to lengthen Bratt's \n     flight for the purpose of obtaining a flight long enough to \n     qualify for business class travel. Even with the \n     manipulations, however, the flight from the United States to \n     Moscow was still less than 14 hours. We concluded that Bratt \n     and Hoover did not qualify for the use of business class and \n     that they were not authorized to use that class of service.\n       In March 1997, on a third trip, Bratt, Hoover, and Stromsem \n     flew business class from Moscow to the United States even \n     though there were economy flights available that would have \n     fit the business needs of the travelers. Although Hoover and \n     Stromsem were originally scheduled to fly on an economy class \n     flight, Bratt directed that their flights be changed to avoid \n     the disparity between his subordinates traveling economy \n     while he traveled on business class. We held Bratt \n     accountable for all the excess costs of the March trip. On \n     his fourth trip, in June 1997 Bratt flew business class on \n     both legs of his trip to and from Moscow. Contemporaneous \n     documents show that the choice of flights for both of \n     these trips was dictated by Bratt's desire to use business \n     class rather than for business reasons. In one facsimile \n     to the travel agency concerning the June 1997 trip, \n     Bratt's Executive Assistant asked, ``Can you rebook him \n     [Bratt] with a slightly longer layover in Amsterdam. . . . \n     So that at least two extra hours is added onto the trip?\n\n[[Page S8373]]\n\n     . . . '' In addition, the travelers were not authorized to \n     travel on business class for either the March or June \n     trip.\n       In sum, we found that Bratt pressured his staff to obtain \n     business class travel and approved a scheme to lengthen his \n     travel time solely for the purpose of obtaining flights that \n     would qualify for business class travel under the 14-hour \n     rule. We concluded that Bratt's manipulation of flight \n     schedules to qualify for business class travel violated the \n     Travel Regulations and was improper. The government spent at \n     least $13,459.56 more than it should have for these four \n     trips.\n       We also found that the Justice Management Division (JMD), \n     which is responsible for auditing foreign travel vouchers, \n     did not question the use of business class travel by Bratt or \n     the other managers who accompanied him even when the lack of \n     authorization was apparent on the face of the travel \n     documents that the travelers submitted to be reimbursed for \n     their expenses.\n       In this chapter we also detail a conversation between Bratt \n     and his Executive Assistant that led her to believe that \n     Bratt was coaching her how to answer OIG questions. Through a \n     series of rhetorical questions that falsely suggested that \n     Bratt was not involved in making decisions regarding his use \n     of business class, Bratt tried to shift to his Executive \n     Assistant the responsibility for the decisions leading to \n     Bratt's business class travel. Bratt also told her that she \n     should not report their conversation to anyone. For some time \n     after that conversation, Bratt continued to contact her \n     asking whether she had been interviewed by the OIG and what \n     she had said. Despite OIG requests to Bratt that he not \n     discuss the subject of our interviews with individuals other \n     than his attorney, we found that Bratt discussed topics that \n     were the subject of the investigation with individuals who \n     would be interviewed by the OIG. Bratt also called \n     individuals, such as the two Russian women for whom he had \n     improperly obtained visas, to alert them that the OIG would \n     be seeking to interview them.\n     D. Failure to follow Travel Regulations\n       During the course of the investigation, we found that \n     ICITAP, OPDAT, and Office of Administration managers violated \n     government Travel Regulations with respect to the use of \n     frequent flyer benefits. Government regulations state that \n     all frequent flyer miles accrued on government travel belong \n     to the government. Because airlines generally do not permit \n     government travelers to keep separate accounts for business \n     and personal travel, travelers may ``commingle'' miles earned \n     from business and personal travel in one account. However, \n     the Travel Regulations are explicit that it is the \n     responsibility of the traveler to keep records adequate to \n     verify that any benefits the traveler uses for personal \n     travel were accrued from personal travel.\n       We found that between 1989 and 1998 Bratt used 380,000 \n     miles for personal travel. Bratt told the OIG that while he \n     had no records to verify how many miles he had accrued from \n     his personal travel, he believed that he had collected at \n     least 150,000 miles from personal travel as well as miles \n     from the use of a personal credit card. Even giving Bratt the \n     benefit of his recollection, we concluded that Bratt \n     improperly used between 156,000 and 230,000 miles earned from \n     government travel for his personal benefit.\n       We found that Hoover also used frequent flyer miles accrued \n     from government travel to purchase airline tickets and other \n     benefits for personal travel for himself and a family member. \n     Stromsem used miles accrued on government travel to upgrade \n     her class of travel in violation of government rules.\n       The investigation revealed that managers violated other \n     Travel Regulations as well. Lake was inappropriately \n     reimbursed by the government for some of the travel expenses \n     associated with weekends that he spent in Frankfurt, Germany, \n     when he was on personal travel. In violation of the \n     regulations requiring a traveler's supervisor to authorize \n     travel and approve travel expenses, Bratt repeatedly either \n     authorized his own travel or had subordinates sign his travel \n     requests. Both Bratt and Stromsem routinely had subordinates \n     approve their travel expenses.\n       We received an allegation that Stromsem took a business \n     trip to Lyons, France, as a pretext that allowed her to visit \n     her daughter who was in Tours, France. Although Stromsem \n     did not list a business purpose on her travel paperwork \n     for her stop in Lyons, we did not conclude that her trip \n     to Lyons was pretextual.\n       We also received an allegation that Bratt's trips to Moscow \n     in 1997 were for the purpose of furthering his romantic \n     relationship with a Russian woman. We found that the lack of \n     advance planning for the trips, the fact that most of his \n     meetings in Moscow were with his own staff rather than \n     Russians, and his romantic relationship with a Russian woman \n     strongly suggested that the trips to Moscow were not \n     necessary or were unnecessarily extended for personal rather \n     than government reasons.\n     E. Lake buyout\n       On March 31, 1997, Lake retired from the federal government \n     after receiving $25,000 as part of a government-wide buyout \n     program (the Buyout Program) to encourage eligible federal \n     employees to retire. The following day Lake began working for \n     OPDAT as a consultant. Lake worked as a subcontractor to a \n     company that had been awarded a contract to provide various \n     support services to ICITAP. In May 1997 at Bratt's request, \n     Lake worked as a consultant to the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service (INS) after Bratt was detailed there.\n       The Buyout Program prohibited former federal employees from \n     returning to government service as either employees or as \n     contractors working under a ``personal services'' contract \n     for five years after their retirement. A personal services \n     contract is defined by federal regulations as ``a contract \n     that, by its express terms or as administered, makes the \n     contractor personnel appear, in effect, [to be] Government \n     employees.'' Violation of the prohibition requires repayment \n     of the incentive bonus.\n       We found that while at OPDAT and INS after his retirement \n     Lake reported to and was supervised by Bratt, that Lake \n     supervised and gave directions to federal employees or other \n     contractors, that he used government equipment, and that \n     other staff were often unaware that Lake was not a federal \n     employee. The evidence showed that Lake essentially did the \n     same job as an OPDAT consultant that he had performed while a \n     government employee. We concluded that Lake worked at OPDAT \n     and the INS under a personal services contract in violation \n     of the Buyout Program requirements.\n       The evidence showed that Lake planned for several months to \n     return to work for the Department as a consultant. Both Bratt \n     and Lake were warned by officials in JMD and the Criminal \n     Division Office of Administration that Lake's return as a \n     consultant could constitute a personal services contract. We \n     concluded that Bratt and Lake improperly failed to ensure \n     that Lake's work met the requirements of the Buyout Program.\n       After allegations were raised in the media that Lake had \n     received Buyout money and then improperly returned to work \n     for the Department, Bratt asked JMD for an opinion as to \n     whether Lake should repay the Buyout bonus. A JMD official \n     concluded that Lake was not obligated to pay back the money \n     based upon a ``good faith'' exception to the rule requiring \n     repayment. We determined that there is no ``good faith'' \n     exception to the requirement that a person who violates the \n     Buyout Program prohibition against performing personal \n     services must repay the bonus. We also concluded that even if \n     a good faith exception existed in the law it would not apply \n     in this case as Lake was aware of the prohibition against \n     personal services and was warned that his return as a \n     consultant might constitute the performance of personal \n     services.\n       We also found that JMD permitted Lake to work at INS \n     without a contract for several months. In addition, while JMD \n     issued a purchase order for Lake's INS work in July 1997, \n     senior JMD procurement officials later expressed concerns \n     that the purchase order that had been issued by their office \n     was a personal services contract. We also found that hiring \n     Lake as a subcontractor to a third party contractor added \n     unnecessary costs to the contract.\n     F. Harris contract\n       Jo Ann Harris was the Assistant Attorney General for the \n     Criminal Division from November 1993 until August 1995, when \n     she left the federal government. Under federal regulations, \n     Harris was barred from contracting with the government for \n     one year after her government service. In December 1996 \n     Harris agreed to become an OPDAT consultant to organize, \n     moderate, and evaluate three conferences that OPDAT was \n     planning to hold at the International Law Enforcement Academy \n     (ILEA) in Budapest, Hungary, and to assist OPDAT in \n     developing curriculum for other OPDAT training programs. \n     The OIG investigated allegations that the award of this \n     contract to Harris violated ethical rules that prohibit \n     contracting with former government officials on a \n     preferential basis. We found that OPDAT's award of a \n     contract to Harris to develop curriculum for OPDAT \n     programs and the processes used to develop the contract, \n     to determine Harris' fee, and to modify her contract \n     raised the appearance of favoritism.\n       In September 1996 Harris had discussions with Criminal \n     Division managers, including Bratt, about the possibility of \n     her assisting OPDAT as a consultant. In November 1996 Harris \n     discussed on the phone with Bratt specific projects that she \n     could work on such as the ILEA conferences and curriculum \n     development. At Bratt's direction, an OPDAT official called \n     Harris in early December 1996 and had a similar conversation \n     with Harris during which she reiterated her interest in \n     working on OPDAT projects. On December 12, 1996, Bratt, \n     Harris, and Lake met in Harris' former office at the \n     Department of Justice, and Harris agreed to Bratt's proposal \n     that she work as a consultant on OPDAT projects. The \n     Statement of Work, a contract document that set out the tasks \n     that OPDAT was seeking from a consultant, was issued on \n     January 23, 1997. The tasks included preparing for the ILEA \n     conferences, acting as the conference moderator, and \n     developing curricula for other OPDAT programs.\n       Because no competition was involved in awarding Harris' \n     contract, we evaluated the propriety of OPDAT's award of her \n     contract under the rules pertaining to the award of sole-\n     source contracts. Sole-source contracts, which do not require \n     the solicitation of competing bids, may be awarded when the \n     exigencies of time or the consultant's expertise justify the \n     waiver of the competitive process. We concluded that OPDAT \n     could have awarded a sole-source contract for her work on the \n     ILEA conference given her extensive experience and the short \n     time frame that existed\n\n[[Page S8374]]\n\n     to prepare for the conference. However, we concluded that \n     Bratt's decision to hire Harris to develop curricula for \n     OPDAT projects other than the ILEA conferences created the \n     appearance of favoritism. We also found that Bratt discussed \n     with Harris what projects she could perform and the Statement \n     of Work was written to fit those projects. We concluded that \n     the process OPDAT used to develop Harris' contract violated \n     the principle that the task to be accomplished should drive \n     the development of a contract rather than the desire to hire \n     a particular consultant.\n       We disproved the allegation that Harris was paid $65,000 \n     for eight days work. She was paid approximately $27,000 for \n     42 days work on two ILEA conferences. However, we found that \n     Harris' rate of pay was not the result of an ``arms length'' \n     negotiation. Harris told Bratt, her former subordinate, to \n     set the fee and to ``scrub it'' because she did not want to \n     read about the fee in the newspaper. She agreed to accept \n     $650 per day although her contract was later modified to \n     permit her to be paid based on an hourly rather than a daily \n     rate. We were unable to determine the basis for the $650 per \n     day fee or find any evidence that Bratt and Lake used any \n     comparable consultant fee arrangement as the basis for \n     setting Harris' rate. Evidence showed that the Department of \n     State, ICITAP, and OPDAT generally set the fees for their \n     consultants at a lower rate. We concluded that the lack of a \n     clear record setting forth the basis for the fee raised the \n     appearance that Harris was given preferential treatment by \n     her former subordinates.\n       We also found that OPDAT hired Harris to perform work \n     outside the scope of the contract, which only authorized \n     services to ICITAP not OPDAT.\n     G. Improper personnel practices\n       The OIG received various allegations relating to ICITAP's \n     and OPDAT's hiring and management of personnel. The evidence \n     showed that ICIPAT and OPDAT managers misused contractor \n     personnel. Federal regulations prohibit contractor personnel \n     from directing federal employees or exercising managerial \n     oversight. Yet, ICITAP and OPDAT managers did not distinguish \n     between employees and contractor personnel and often failed \n     to identify personnel working for contractors as such. As a \n     result, ICITAP and OPDAT staff were often confused about \n     consultant's roles and the scope of their authority.\n       We found that contractor personnel were used as managers. \n     For example, one of ICITAP's Deputy Directors was a \n     subcontractor employed by a contractor that provided a \n     variety of services to ICITAP. After ICITAP Director Stromsem \n     was advised by an administrative official that there were \n     limits to the authority of personnel employed by contractors, \n     Stromsem cautioned the Deputy Director about the limitations. \n     However, Stromsem did not notify other staff about the Deputy \n     Director's status as a subcontractor, and he remained in \n     the position of Deputy Director until he became a federal \n     employee six months later.\n       We found other problems with the use of contractor \n     personnel including ICITAP's selection of particular \n     consultants to be hired by its service contractors. This left \n     ICITAP vulnerable to claims that it was violating the rules \n     restricting personal services contracts. The practice of \n     directing the hiring of consultants wasted money because \n     ICITAP was performing the administrative work associated with \n     hiring consultants at the same time that it was paying its \n     service contractors administrative fees. In addition, \n     consultants often began work before the Statement of Work was \n     issued to the prime contractor. This practice required the \n     paperwork to be backdated or ratified in order for the \n     consultant to be paid. We also found that consultants were \n     hired as federal employees and then made decisions affecting \n     their former contractor employer in violation of ethical \n     regulations. This practice was stopped by Mary Ellen Warlow, \n     who became the Coordinator for ICITAP and OPDAT in 1997 after \n     Bratt left for the INS.\n       We investigated allegations that ICITAP managers engaged in \n     favoritism in the hiring of staff. Federal employees are \n     hired after a competitive process that begins with the public \n     issuance of a vacancy announcement that describes the \n     application process and sets forth the responsibilities and \n     other particulars of the position. Managers were alleged to \n     have engaged in ``preselection,'' that is, they decided whom \n     to hire before beginning the competitive selection process \n     required by federal regulations.\n       The hiring of Jill Hogarty in particular raised complaints. \n     Hogarty was an attorney who worked as a bartender at Lulu's \n     New Orleans Cafe, an establishment located near the ICITAP \n     offices which was visited regularly by ICITAP Associate \n     Director Trincellito and other ICITAP staff. While visiting \n     Lulu's, Trincellito discussed ICITAP's work with Hogarty, and \n     eventually Trincellito invited Hogarty to consider working as \n     a consultant to ICITAP. Hogarty gave Trincellito her resume, \n     and Trincellito wrote the paperwork that resulted in her \n     being hired as an ICITAP consultant in September 1994. \n     According to Hogarty, while she was a consultant to ICITAP, \n     she dated Bratt for several months, from September 1995 to \n     December 1995. At that time Bratt had resumed his position as \n     Executive Officer but he retained authority to approve \n     personnel decisions at ICITAP. In November 1995, during the \n     time that Hogarty and Bratt were dating, Hogarty applied to \n     become a temporary federal employee at ICITAP. She was \n     selected by Trincellito for this position in December 1995.\n       On January 5, 1997, Hogarty's employment status changed \n     once again, and she became a permanent federal employee. It \n     was this selection that raised the complaint about \n     preselection. The vacancy announcement of the position that \n     Hogarty obtained opened on November 1, 1996. An ICITAP \n     employee who held a term position told the OIG that while the \n     position was still open for applications, he was discussing \n     the announcement for the position with another employee when \n     Hogarty told them it was her position and that she had been \n     selected for it. The employee told the OIG that even though \n     he was interested in the position himself, he did not apply \n     for it because he believed Hogarty's statement that she had \n     already been selected.\n       To investigate the allegation of preselection, we attempted \n     to determine which manager had selected Hogarty for the \n     position and the reason for the selection. The paperwork \n     listed Stromsem as the official requesting the recruitment. \n     The paperwork did not show who had made the selection, \n     however. All of ICITAP's top managers--Director Stromsem, \n     Associate Director Trincellito (who was also Hogarty's direct \n     supervisor), the ICITAP Deputy Directors, and Special \n     Assistant to the Director Hoover--denied having selected \n     Hogarty for the permanent position. Bratt also denied \n     selecting Hogarty.\n       We found strong evidence that Bratt and Stromsem \n     preselected Hogarty. An e-mail from Bratt on October 8, 1996, \n     showed that Bratt authorized hiring Hogarty before the \n     vacancy announcement that opened the position for competition \n     was issued. We also learned from an ICITAP administrative \n     official that in October or November 1996, Stromsem asked the \n     official to determine how they could get Hogarty health \n     benefits, which Hogarty did not have at that time. The \n     administrative official said that he and Stromsem agreed to \n     create a ``term'' position vacancy for Hogarty, but that \n     instructions came back from Bratt through Stromsem to make \n     the position permanent. We concluded that Bratt and Stromsem \n     engaged in preselection in violation of federal regulations \n     governing personnel hiring.\n       We investigated other allegations of favoritism, including \n     the hiring of a consultant who was the father of Stromem's \n     former husband's stepchildren. He was subsequently selected \n     by Stromsem to become an ICITAP term employee although his \n     qualifications for the position were questionable. He was \n     ultimately not hired for the term position because of the \n     intervention of Warlow when she became Coordinator. We \n     concluded that Stromsem's involvement with this hire gave \n     rise to the appearance of favoritism.\n       The OIG also received numerous allegations that Bratt gave \n     favored treatment to a select group of Office of \n     Administration and ICITAP staff and that he dated \n     subordinates. Although we only conducted a limited \n     investigation into these allegations, we found that some of \n     the employees who socialized with Bratt received rapid career \n     advancement and that Bratt was often involved in the \n     promotions. We saw evidence that he dated staff in the Office \n     of Administration and ICITAP and that in one instance he \n     intervened to protect the salary of a subcontractor with whom \n     he had a social interest but who have been found unqualified \n     by Office of Administration staff for the position she held. \n     We concluded that Bratt's actions gave right to an appearance \n     of favoritism.\n     H. Financial management\n       In response to allegations that ICITAP's finances were \n     mismanaged, the OIG examined ICITAP's financial management \n     system. We found that until 1997 ICITAP could not account for \n     its expenditures. ICITAP did not receive sufficient \n     information from its contractors to permit it to track \n     whether it received the goods and services for which it had \n     paid. This led to significant problems in 1997 when the State \n     Department, which was funding ICITAP's programs, asked for \n     detailed information on how the money for programs in the \n     Newly Independent States had been spent. ICITAP spent several \n     months trying to provide an acceptable answer to the State \n     Department's request and only succeeded by the use of \n     estimates and extrapolations from the financial information \n     ICITAP did collect. Although the OIG had advised ICITAP in \n     its 1994 report following an earlier investigation into \n     ICITAP's financial management system that ICITAP needed to \n     collect more detailed information from its contractors, the \n     problem was not remedied until after the State Department \n     requested detailed financial information in 1997.\n       We found that ICITAP did not pay sufficient attention to \n     the services its contractors provided and left itself \n     vulnerable to overcharges. In one instance, a contractor \n     notified ICITAP that it was unilaterally raising one of its \n     fees, an action not permitted by the contract. Despite this \n     notice, ICITAP did nothing for two years until a JMD \n     contracting officer noticed the overcharge. Subsequent \n     negotiations with the contractor resulted in reimbursement to \n     ICITAP of some of the money.\n       Office of Administration managers hired staff for the \n     Criminal Division by using contractor personnel for jobs that \n     were outside the scope of the contract under which they \n     worked. In 1991 the Criminal Division awarded a contract to \n     provide computer support\n\n[[Page S8375]]\n\n     services and in 1996 the Criminal Division awarded the same \n     contractor a second contract for computer support services. \n     The contractor provided employees to work in Criminal \n     Division's correspondence units performing tasks such as \n     reading and responding to correspondence. This work was \n     outside the scope of the first contract, which only \n     authorized computer support services. The contractor also \n     provided employees who worked as writers, planned \n     conferences, published reports, and organized parties. The \n     services of these personnel were outside the scope of both \n     contracts.\n       We also found that Criminal Division managers failed to \n     adequately supervise the contract and the contractor charged \n     the government for the services of personnel who were \n     unqualified under the terms of the contract. The contract set \n     out very specific labor categories, such as Senior Programmer \n     Analyst, and set forth the tasks to be accomplished and the \n     qualifications for each labor category. We found problems \n     with 25 of 56 of the contractor's personnel under the first \n     contract and problems with 19 of 54 of the contractor's \n     personnel under the second contract. We concluded that the \n     minimum the contractor overcharged the government was \n     $1,164,702.01.\n       The OIG received an allegation that ICITAP had spent \n     substantial sums of money on an automated management \n     information system (IMIS) that did not function properly. Our \n     investigation showed that the development of IMIS was \n     difficult, that users were unhappy with the product, and that \n     a system designed to replace IMIS could not be completed by \n     the contractor. We concluded that managers did not adequately \n     analyze ICITAP's needs in the initial stages of development, \n     and consequently IMIS was constantly being upgraded and \n     modified leading to new problems. Also, the decision to use \n     floppy disks to transfer information from the field to \n     headquarters rather than develop a network capacity that \n     could be utilized by all users led to significant problems, \n     such as that the data from floppy disks was often out of date \n     or could not be accessed once it was received at \n     headquarters. IMIS and the attempt to develop the \n     replacement system ultimately cost more than one million \n     dollars. We did not investigate to determine how much \n     money might have been saved had IMIS been better planned.\n       ICITAP's lack of planning also led to a substantial cost \n     overrun of the translation budget for the first ILEA \n     conference. A hypothetical transnational crime and the \n     statutes of various countries were translated for the \n     conference. The budget for translations was $16,000; the \n     ultimate cost was $128,258. Lake delegated much of the \n     responsibility for coordinating the ILEA conference to his \n     assistant, who worked for a contractor. Lake's assistant \n     ordered large amounts of material to be translated on an \n     expedited basis without adequately determining the cost of \n     the translations. The assistant failed to research whether \n     some of the material was already translated and ordered some \n     of the material on a costly expedited basis when it was \n     unnecessary to do so. We concluded that Lake delegated \n     responsibility to someone who was not qualified to manage the \n     task and then failed to adequately supervise her.\n       We examined whether ICITAP could account for the goods it \n     ordered for use in Haiti by selecting 131 expensive items to \n     track. The investigation showed that the contractor \n     responsible for providing goods and services to ICITAP in \n     Haiti had in place an effective inventory control system and \n     that ICITAP could account for all but one of the selected \n     items.\n     I. Miscellaneous allegations\n       In this chapter we summarize the results of our \n     investigation of additional allegations, most of which we did \n     not substantiate.\n       We found that Bratt directed that Criminal Division excess \n     computers be sent to a school associated with a girlfriend, \n     and Deputy Executive Officer Sandra Bright initiated and \n     pursued the donation of computers to a school associated with \n     her husband. In 1996 Bratt directed that 35 computers be sent \n     to an elementary school in Virginia where his then girlfriend \n     was employed as a teacher. On one occasion in 1996 Bright \n     directed that 25 computers be sent to the school district in \n     Virginia where her husband was employed as a principal and on \n     another occasion in 1996 Bright directed that 30 computers be \n     sent to the school at which her husband was employed. We \n     concluded that Bratt's and Bright's actions created the \n     appearance of favoritism.\n       We did not substantiate an allegation that Robert Lockwood \n     was awarded an OPDAT grant because of his alleged association \n     with Attorney General Janet Reno. The American-Israeli \n     Russian Committee that Lockwood directed received a $17,000 \n     grant from OPDAT in 1997. At the time, Lockwood was the Clerk \n     of Courts of Broward County, Florida, and was acquainted with \n     the Attorney General, although not closely so. We determined \n     that the Attorney General received a phone call from Lockwood \n     in 1997 but that they only discussed Lockwood's organization \n     and its mission; he did not seek any funding from her. \n     Lockwood became involved with OPDAT through the OPDAT \n     Resident Legal Advisor in Moscow. We did not find evidence \n     that the Attorney General encouraged anyone to award a grant \n     to Lockwood's Committee or that she knew that an award had \n     been made. We also did not find any evidence that the \n     Attorney General or anyone from her office took any action \n     after Lockwood's grant was not renewed the following year.\n       The remainder of the chapter discusses allegations that we \n     failed to substantiate concerning personnel issues, financial \n     matters, allegations of retaliation, and other issues.\n\n\n                  iii. recommendations and conclusions\n\n       In this chapter of the report, we offer a series of \n     recommendations to the Department, including that certain \n     employees receive discipline and that the Department seek \n     compensation from employees who improperly received money or \n     benefits from the Department. We also made nine \n     recommendations concerning systemic improvements in the areas \n     of travel, ethics, and training.\n       Bratt retired from the Department effective August 1, 2000, \n     and is not subject to discipline. We recommended that the \n     Department recover the costs of his improper use of business \n     class travel and his improper use of frequent flyer miles.\n       Lake is also not employed by the Department any longer and \n     is not subject to discipline. We recommended that the \n     Department recover the $25,000 Buyout bonus and the cost of \n     travel expenses that Lake improperly charged the government, \n     including costs associated with the November 1996 trip to \n     Moscow.\n       We found that Stromsem violated security regulations, \n     improperly used frequent flyer miles accrued on government \n     travel for personal benefit, and was involved in the \n     preselection of Hogarty in violation of personnel \n     regulations. We concluded that Stromsem's conduct warrants \n     the imposition of discipline. We also recommended that the \n     Department recover the costs of Stromsem's improper use of \n     frequent flyer miles.\n       We found that Hoover violated security regulations by \n     disclosing classified information to uncleared parties and by \n     removing classified documents to his home. We also found that \n     he improperly traveled on business class on a flight to \n     Moscow in January 1997 and that he improperly used frequent \n     flyer miles accrued on government travel for his personal \n     benefit. We concluded that Hoover's conduct warrants the \n     imposition of discipline. We also recommended that the \n     Department recover the costs of Hoover's improper use of \n     business class travel and frequent flyer miles.\n       We concluded that Trincellito's repeated failure to observe \n     fundamental security practices and his continued resistance \n     to the advice and warnings of ICITAP's security officers \n     warrants the imposition of discipline.\n       We also recommended that SEPS and other agencies \n     responsible for issuing security clearances carefully \n     consider the findings and conclusions set forth in this \n     report before issuing a security clearance to the individuals \n     most involved in the security breaches. In addition, we made \n     non-disciplinary recommendations with respect to two other \n     individuals.\n       During the course of the investigation, we observed various \n     systemic issues, and we suggested improvements for the \n     Department to consider relating to oversight of ICITAP and \n     OPDAT, security, investigative follow-up, travel, training, \n     performance evaluations, and early retirement programs. For \n     example, we recommended that the Department monitor ICITAP's \n     compliance with security regulations by continuing to perform \n     periodic unannounced security reviews.\n       Because many of the travel violations that we found were \n     apparent on the face of the travel forms, we recommended that \n     the Department review the process JMD uses to audit travel \n     vouchers. We believe the Department should offer increased \n     training on travel regulations to employees and secretarial \n     or clerical staff who process travel-related paperwork. And \n     we offered suggestions designed to increase Department \n     employees' use of frequent flyer miles for government travel \n     and to decrease the incidents of improper use.\n       We recommended that increased attention be given to the \n     recommendations and lessons learned from investigations. We \n     found that despite numerous investigations of ICITAP, the \n     same problems continued to surface and that managers failed \n     to act on investigative recommendations. Management must take \n     increased responsibility for ensuring that the results of \n     investigations are appropriately considered and addressed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/12/senate-section/article/S8375-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8375-S8398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TO AUTHORIZE EXTENSION OF NONDISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT TO THE PEOPLE'S \n                      REPUBLIC OF CHINA--Continued\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4125\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, may I ask the situation on the time \nlimitation on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time limitation.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, around this place I have learned, in 28 \nyears, that you are fortunate in many instances to be able to work with \npeople with whom you have not earlier worked, and you learn of their \ninterest and their dedication. Such is the case with the distinguished \nSenator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone, with whom I have worked in the \npreparation of this amendment. He is a principal cosponsor of it.\n  The pending amendment, simply said, directs the President to certify \nthat China has met a series of human rights conditions prior to \ngranting PNTR to Communist China. The conditions set forth in this \namendment are\n\n[[Page S8376]]\n\nstraightforward. The President would be required to certify formally \nand officially that China has, among other items:\n  No. 1, dismantled its system of reeducation through labor;\n  No. 2, has opened up all areas of China for U.N. human rights \nagencies;\n  No. 3, has accounted for and released political and religious \nprisoners; and,\n  No. 4, has provided human rights groups with unhindered access to \nreligious leaders.\n  So what this amendment really does is to remind Communist China, and \nall the rest of the world, that we Americans stand for something--\nsomething other than for profits, for example. In this case, what this \namendment makes clear is that we believe China should not be welcomed \ninto international organizations such as the WTO just so long as the \nChinese Government continues to repress, to jail, to murder, to \ntorture, its own citizens for their having opposed the Beijing \ndictatorship.\n  It seems to me, to fail to take this stand would be a double whammy \nagainst even the possibility of freedom for the people of China. First, \nthe Senate will be sending a signal to Beijing that the Government of \nthe United States will turn a blind eye to Communist China's grave \nabuses against humanity if this amendment is not approved, if only \nChina will just let U.S. businesses make a profit in dealing with \nChina.\n  Second, it will send a message to those miserable souls who languish \nin China's gulags that the United States is willing to ignore their \nmisery just so some in America can profit from it. If we do not send \nthe signal that this amendment proposes to send, that will happen.\n  I realize the WTO is not, itself, a paragon of virtue, let alone a \ndemocracy, given the membership already held by thuggish regimes such \nas Cuba and Burma and a host of African dictatorships. But that does \nnot justify further sullying the WTO by adding Communist China to its \nmembership. Rather, it is a reminder of the absurd notion that this so-\ncalled rules-based WTO will somehow help transform China into a \ndemocracy.\n  As does Cuba and Burma, the Chinese Government continues to have one \nof the worst human rights records in the world, despite two decades, 20 \nyears of having received so-called most-favored-nation status from the \nU.S. Government. The findings in the pending amendment, mostly verbatim \nquotes from the U.S. State Department's own annual reports, provide a \nsketch of the disgraceful conduct, the disgraceful situation in China. \nFor example, this is a quote from the U.S. State Department's 1999 \nhuman rights report shown on this chart. The chart shows:\n\n       The Government of the People's Republic of China's poor \n     human rights record deteriorated markedly throughout the \n     year, as the Government intensified efforts to suppress \n     dissent.\n\n  Note two key words in that passage, ``deteriorated'' and \n``intensified,'' because these words describe a trend, a trend for the \nworse as reported by the U.S. State Department. That is not Jesse Helms \ntalking. That is the State Department's official report to this Senate.\n  I doubt that even the most enthusiastic supporter of Communist \nChina's admission to the WTO will claim that China's human rights \nrecord is good. I don't know how they could do it, but some will do it. \nBut year after year, we have become accustomed to hearing that China's \nhuman rights record is improving, don't you see. The trouble is, the \nState Department's own report, as I have indicated, emphasizes over and \nover again that this simply is not true and never has been true.\n  Consider, if you will, this passage from the U.S. State Department, \nreproduced on this chart:\n\n       Abuses by Chinese authorities included instances of \n     extrajudicial killings, torture and mistreatment of \n     prisoners, forced confessions, arbitrary arrest and \n     detention, lengthy incommunicado detentions, and denial of \n     due process.\n\n  That is in the U.S. State Department's annual report, delivered to \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee of which I am chairman.\n  What is that report, when you get down to the nitty-gritty? The \nofficial report of our State Department, which advocates giving away \nthe store to Communist China, is telling the truth on one hand and asks \nto reward China on the other.\n  Are we to dismiss China's vicious crackdown on the Falun Gong \nmovement? The bloody numbers are staggering: More than 35,000 people \ndetained, more than 5,000 people sentenced without trial, and more than \n300 put on makeshift trials and sentenced to prison terms of up to 18 \nyears.\n  I have some photographs I want the Chair to see. The first one is how \nthe Chinese Government treats its own people whose worst offense has \nbeen their daring to meditate in public, to sit alone and think.\n  At least 37 of these people died of mistreatment while they were in \ncustody. According to human rights groups, one Falun Gong practitioner \nwho had been confined in a psychiatric hospital by the Chinese \nGovernment died of heart failure 2 weeks after being forcibly injected \nwith nerve agents. Another died after being force-fed by authorities. \nThese reports are reminiscent of those worst days long ago in the \nSoviet Union and in Germany under Adolf Hitler.\n  But there is more. The merciless extinction of Tibet continues. In \nthis past year, China has perpetuated its so-called reeducation \ncampaign aimed, in fact, at destroying Tibetan culture, border patrols \nhave been tightened, and the arrests of Tibetans have increased \ngreatly.\n  There is a fine lady named Dr. Elizabeth Napper who works with \nescaped Tibetan nuns in India. She testified before the Foreign \nRelations Committee that if a nun peacefully demonstrates saying, for \nexample, ``Free Tibet,'' she is immediately arrested and taken into \ncustody for saying, ``Free Tibet.''\n  Basing her testimony on accounts by victims of China's cruelty, Dr. \nNapper added:\n\n       The beatings start in the vehicle on the way to the police \n     station and continue through an interrogation that can take \n     place over several days. Various instruments of torture are \n     routinely used, such as electric cattle prods inserted in the \n     orifices of the body and electric shocks that knock a person \n     across the room.\n\n  These victims, mind you, are nuns. They are defenseless women.\n  The Chinese Government refuses even to talk with the Dalai Lama. Why \nshould they? Nobody in the U.S. Government ever does anything tangible \nto help the Dalai Lama. Some of us who know him and are his friends do \nour best to help him. I have taken him to North Carolina to meet with a \ngroup there, specifically to Wingate University. It was announced he \nwas coming, and there was standing room only on the campus of that \nuniversity. People came from everywhere just to see him. They did not \nhave a chance to meet him; they just had a chance to see him.\n  Permanent normal trade relations with China is not merely a routine \nforeign policy matter. As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, \nI have never viewed it as such. The future direction of Chinese foreign \npolicy will depend upon whether the rulers of China agree to \ndemocratize its Government and begin to treat its own citizens with \nsome respect, which they are not doing now.\n  It will be a tragic mistake to pass this legislation now precisely at \nthe time the Chinese Government has succeeded in almost emasculating \nall opposition to its tyrannical rule.\n  Without requiring some kind of improvement in China's terrible human \nrights situation before bringing China into the WTO and granting China \npermanent normal trade relations will be welcoming China into the club \nof supposedly civilized nations. It seems to me this would throw away \nthe most effective leverage we could ever have with China and would \ndeal a terribly severe blow to the millions of Chinese people who \noppose their regime and are totally incapable by circumstances of doing \nanything to improve it.\n\n  Question, Mr. President: Would that not be profoundly immoral on the \npart of the Senate in consideration of this measure? I know the words \nhave been passed: Don't let any amendment be adopted; don't let any \namendment be approved; don't let anything happen to derail or to delay \nthe enactment of this piece of legislation.\n  The answer is, yes, it would be immoral; it is going to be immoral. I \ndo not hold my distinguished colleagues accountable on this, but I \nthink it is a strategic mistake on their part, a mistake of historic \nproportions, that the\n\n[[Page S8377]]\n\nAmerican people will one of these days profoundly regret the move the \nSenate is about to take.\n  Mr. President, this unanimous consent request has been approved on \nboth sides. I therefore ask unanimous consent that prior to a vote on \nor in relation to the Helms amendment No. 4125, there be 90 minutes of \ndebate on the amendment, with 60 minutes for the proponents and 30 \nminutes for the opponents, with no second-degree amendment in order, \nand that the vote occur by 3:30 p.m. or at a time to be determined by \nthe two leaders. I further ask unanimous consent that the time consumed \nthus far on the amendment be deducted from the above limitation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I see other colleagues on the floor. I \nshall not take up all of our time. I am certainly interested in what \nthe Senator from Wyoming and the Senator from New York have to say in \nthis debate.\n  First, I thank my colleague, Senator Helms from North Carolina, for \noffering this amendment. Also, there are probably not too many times I \ncan remember over my 9\\1/2\\ years in the Senate that I have been a \ncosponsor of a Helms amendment, but I am very proud to support this \namendment and to speak, debate, and advocate with him on this question.\n  I say to my colleague from North Carolina and other Senators as well, \nI want to guard against appearing to be self-righteous about this, but \nI feel strongly about the question before us. I feel strongly about \nthis amendment which says that China ought to abide by basic human \nrights standards. We ought to insist on that before we automatically \nextend normal trade relations with China, before we give up our right \nto annually review normal trade relations with China.\n\n  Before I speak in giving this some context and talking about why, let \nme, one more time--I have heard some discussion on the floor and also \nseen in the press discussion about this debate--try to correct the \nrecord.\n  No one is arguing that we should now have an embargo on trade with \nChina. Nobody is arguing for a boycott. Nobody is saying that we should \nnot have trade with China. We do; we will. It is a record trade \ndeficit, as a matter of fact. That is not the issue. Nobody is arguing \nthat we should have no economic ties with China at all. We do; we will.\n  The question is whether or not we give up our annual right to review \ntrade relations with China, which is what little leverage we have as a \nnation, as a country, to speak up about the violations of human rights, \nto speak up for religious freedom in China. That is the question before \nus.\n  I have always been intensely interested in human rights questions, \nwhether it is as to China or whether it is as to any other country. I \nam sorry to say on the floor of the Senate that there are some 70 \ngovernments in the world today that are engaged in the systematic \ntorture of their citizens.\n  I think it is important for the Senate, I think it is important for \nour Government, I think it is important for the American people, to \nspeak up about these kinds of basic violations of people's human \nrights.\n  I say it for two reasons. First of all, I come from a family where my \nfather was born in the Ukraine; then lived in the Far East; then lived \nin China before coming to the United States of America at age 17 in \n1914, 3 years before the revolution in Russia. He thought he could go \nback, and then the Bolsheviks took over. His parents told him: Don't go \nback. And all his family, from all I can gather, were probably murdered \nby Stalin. All contact was broken off. No longer did my father receive \nany letters from his family. He never saw them again.\n  I say to my colleague from North Carolina--I am getting a little \npersonal before getting into the arguments--at the end of my dad's life \nwe were trying to take care of him so we would go over and spend the \nnight with him. He had lived in this country for, oh, almost 70 years. \nHe spoke fluent English. I don't know that I detected even any accent. \nBut it was amazing; all of his dreams--they were nightmares; there was \nshouting and screaming--were in Russian. None of it was in English. He \nlived in this country all of those years; I only heard him speak \nEnglish--talk about the child being father of man or mother of woman--\nand I think that is what happens when you are separated from your \nfamily at such a young age; your family is probably murdered. You never \ncan go back to see them. You can never see your family again.\n  I believe strongly in human rights. I thank the Senator from North \nCarolina for his leadership on this question.\n  Then I had a chance to meet Wei Jingsheng. I say to my colleague, you \nknow Wei very well. Here is a man who spent, I think, about 17 years in \nprison, several years in solitary confinement. What was the crime that \nhe committed? The crime he committed was to continue to write and speak \nout for democracy and freedom in his country. That was the crime he \ncommitted.\n  I say to my colleagues that I really believe the rush for the money \nand the focus on the money to be made by our trade policy with China \nwithin the new global economics that we talk about--this kind of rush \nfor money, this focus on commercial ties on the money to be made has \ntrumped our concerns about human rights, trumped our concerns, whether \nit is a Buddhist or a Christian or a Jew, you name it--it makes no \ndifference--about whether people can even practice their religion \nwithout winding up in prison, trumped our concerns about whether or not \nwe have a relationship with a country that has broken the 1992 and 1994 \nagreements where they said they would not export products to our \ncountry made by prison labor in the so-called reeducation labor camps, \ntrumped our concerns about all of the women and men who were imprisoned \nbecause of the practice of their religion or because they spoke out for \ndemocracy, trumped our concerns about women and men who tried to \nimprove their working conditions and found themselves serving 3 years, \n8 years, 14 years, 15 years, trumped our concerns about a country that \nhas more prison labor camps--it is like the equivalent of the gulags in \nRussia, in the former Soviet Union. And we do not want to speak out on \nthis?\n\n  We don't want to at least say: wait a minute, we reserve our right, \nwhen it comes to normal trade relations, to insist that you live up to \njust basic standards of decency? We reserve our right to speak up for \nhuman rights. We reserve our right to speak up for religious freedom. \nWe reserve our right to speak up against products that are exported to \nour country made by prison labor. We reserve our right to speak up for \nthe right of people in China--and people all over the world--to bargain \ncollectively to try to improve their standard of living. We do not want \nto consider any of that? We do not consider any of that?\n  I think we diminish ourselves, I say to Senator Helms, when we do not \nsupport the kind of amendment the Senator has brought to the floor. I \nsay to my colleagues, I hope there will be strong support for this \namendment.\n  I have heard a number of Senators--all of whom I like, all of whom I \nlike a lot--who have said, first of all: We cannot isolate ourselves.\n  We are not isolating ourselves. All we are saying is, don't we want \nto at least keep our leverage, so that we continue to have what little \nleverage we have to annually review our trade relations to make sure \nChina lives up to the trade agreements, lives up to the human rights \nstandards?\n  Then the other argument is: We have had all this trade with China, \nand it is so important, that, actually, when you automatically have \ntrade relations with China, you promote human rights. I have heard that \nsaid at least 10, 15 times. But I say to Senators, where is your \nevidence?\n  I will tell you, if you look at the State Department reports of this \nyear and last year, they talk about an absolutely brutal atmosphere in \nChina. Your evidence certainly is not our own State Department report \nabout human rights. Is your evidence the commission that we appointed, \nthe Commission on International Religious Freedom, chaired by Rabbi \nSaperstein? They said, on the basis of their careful examination, we \nshould not automatically renew trade relations with China because of \nthe brutality, the denial to\n\n[[Page S8378]]\n\npeople of their right to practice their religion.\n  I say to Senators, where is your evidence that we have had this trade \nwith China and it has led to more freedom and less violation of human \nrights? Where is your evidence for that? You do not have any evidence. \nI have not heard one Senator come out here with any evidence.\n  My evidence, on behalf of this amendment, is that according to the \nState Department--this is last year's report--\n\n       The Government's poor human rights record deteriorated \n     markedly throughout the year, as the Government intensified \n     efforts to suppress dissent, particularly organized dissent. \n     Abuses included instances of extrajudicial killings, torture, \n     mistreatment of prisoners, and denial of due process.\n\n  That is the evidence.\n  Hundreds of thousands of people languish in jails and prison camps \nmerely because, I say to my colleague from North Carolina, they dare to \npractice their Christian, Buddhist, or Islamic faith. Respected \ninternational human rights organizations have documented hundreds of \nthousands of cases--hundreds of thousands of cases--of arbitrary \nimprisonment, torture, house arrest, or death at the hands of the \nGovernment.\n  That is the record. I welcome any Senator to come out here and \npresent other evidence to the contrary.\n  In recent months, we have witnessed--and I heard my colleague from \nNorth Carolina talk about this--a brutal crackdown against the Falun \nGong, a harmless Buddhist sect. According to international news media \nreports, at least 50,000 Falun Gong practitioners have been arrested \nand detained, more than 5,000 have been sentenced to labor camps \nwithout trial, and over 500 have received prison sentences in show \ntrials. Detainees are often tortured, and at least 33 practitioners of \nthis religion have died in Government custody. Senators, we are silent \nabout this.\n\n  Chinese courts recently sentenced three leading members of the \nChinese Democracy Party, an open opposition party. That is what we \nbelieve in. We believe in our country people should have the right to \njoin parties. They should have a right to speak out. They should have \nthe right to run for office, and they certainly should not wind up in \nprison. Three leading members of the Chinese Democracy Party, an open \nopposition party, were sentenced to terms of 11, 12, and 13 years. \nTheir crime was ``for conspiring to subvert state power.''\n  Charges against these three political activists included helping to \norganize the party, receiving funds from abroad, promoting independent \ntrade unions, using e-mail to distribute materials abroad, and giving \ninterviews to foreign reporters. That is their crime. They have been \ntried in closed trials with no procedural safeguards. The Government \nhas crushed the party by doling out huge prison sentences to any man or \nwoman who should dare to form their own political party.\n  I would think if there was any example that would resonate with every \nsingle Senator here, regardless of party, it would be this.\n  My colleague from North Carolina already talked about Ms. Kadeer's \ncase. I will not go over that.\n  I will just say to Senators, I hope that on this amendment we will \nget your support. With all due respect, I hope that you do not make the \nfollowing argument because I don't think it works. I hope you do not \nmake the argument: No, I am going to turn my gaze away from all of \nthese human rights abuses. I am going to turn my gaze away from \nsupporting religious freedom. I am going to turn my gaze away from this \nrecord of brutality. I am going to turn my gaze away from the \nextrajudicial killings and torture. I am going to turn my gaze away \nfrom human rights because if an amendment passes, this will go to \nconference committee.\n  We have conference committees all the time. That is the way we \noperate. That is our legislative process. We have a conference \ncommittee and then it reports back.\n  With all the support for this overall bill, the conference committee \nwould meet, the bill would come back, and then we would have a vote. \nBut to say to people in our States, we couldn't vote for what was \nright, we couldn't vote for this amendment which was all about human \nrights, which is what our country is about, because, you see, it might \ngo to conference committee and we have to have a bill with the exact \nsame language between the House and the Senate, people will look at you \nand say: Senator, just vote for what is right.\n  I say to my colleagues, vote for what is right. Vote for this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, noting the presence of the distinguished \nmanagers of the bill, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly to the important \nissues my friend, the Senator from North Carolina, has raised and to \nsuggest that we have the necessary international agreements already in \nplace to address the more fundamental issues with which he is \nconcerned, as is my friend from Minnesota.\n  It happens I have spent a fair amount of my early years as a student \nof the International Labor Organization which was created as part of \nthe Versailles Peace Treaty of 1918. Samuel Gompers of the AFL-CIO was \nchairman of the commission in Paris that put it together. A very major \nmatter in the mind of President Wilson as he campaigned for the treaty, \nhe talked about the ILO as much as any other thing.\n  The first international labor conference met here in Washington, just \ndown Constitution Avenue at the building of the Organization of \nAmerican States. It was a dramatic time.\n  President Wilson had been struck down by a stroke. The Congress, the \nSenate was tied up with the question of ratifying the treaty. But the \ntreaty provided that this meeting should take place in Washington, and \nit did. It did so with great success. International labor standards \nwere set forth, and China was one of the nations present at the \ninternational labor conference. The person who provided most of the \nfacilities for it was the young Assistant Secretary of the Navy, a man \nnamed Franklin D. Roosevelt, who later became involved. One of the \nfirst things he did when he became President was move to join the ILO.\n  Now, over the years the United States has been an active member of \nthe ILO. We had the Secretary General at one point, Mr. Morris, a \nformer Under Secretary of Labor.\n  We have not ratified many conventions. I have come to the floor at \nleast four times in the last 24 years and moved a convention. Once it \nwas done by our revered Claiborne Pell, who then turned the matter over \nto me. We think of there being eight core conventions. The simple fact \nis that the United States has only ratified one of them, in a \nmembership that goes back to 1934.\n  However, it is not necessarily the case that if you have ratified a \nlot of conventions, you are very much in compliance with the principles \nthere involved. I once suggested, not entirely facetiously, that there \nwas an inverse relationship between the number of ILO labor conventions \nthat had been signed by a country and the actual condition of labor \nrelations in that country. But no matter.\n  In 1998, at the 86th session of the International Labor Organization, \nthe oldest international organization in the world of this nature--the \npostal union is the oldest--adopted an ILO declaration on fundamental \nprinciples and rights at work and its followup. I will read this \nprovision:\n  The international labor conference declares that all members, even if \nthey have not ratified the conventions in question, have an obligation, \narising from the very fact of membership in the organization, to \nrespect, to promote, and to realize, in good faith and in accordance \nwith the Constitution, the principles concerning the fundamental rights \nwhich are the subject of those conventions; namely:(a), freedom of \nassociation and the effective recognition of the right of collective \nbargaining;(b) the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory \nlabor;(c) the effective abolition of child labor; and\n\n[[Page S8379]]\n\n(d) the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and \noccupation.\n  These are international obligations. They obligate the People's \nRepublic of China, and they obligate the United States. The provision \nfor bringing the issues to the International Labor Conference which \nmeets every year in June in Geneva are well established.\n  I find it very curious, almost at times sinister, that just at the \npoint the ILO has said these are the world's standards, international \nstandards, binding legal commitments, and here we are to do something \nwith them, suddenly people are saying, no, these matters should be \ndealt with in the World Trade Organization, which can't deal with them.\n  It is interesting that the WTO now occupies the original buildings on \nLake Leman in Geneva of the ILO. But why not stay with the ILO and work \nwith this history and hold China to its commitment as China can hold \nus? It is something we have believed in and worked with from 1918 on.\n  The issue of trade and its effect on the internal behavior of \ngovernment is an elusive one. But, if I may say, I was in China during \nthe regime of Mao Zedong. I stood there in Tiananmen Square and looked \nup at these two enormous flagpoles. On one pole were two 19th century \nGerman gentlemen, Mr. Marx and Mr. Engels. What they were doing in the \ncenter of the Middle Kingdom, I don't know. Over on the next pole was \nthe rather Mongol-looking Stalin, and Mao.\n  That is gone.\n  At one of the entrances to the Forbidden City there is a sort of \nsmallish portrait of Mao. That is all. That world is behind us. The \nworld is looking forward from the 1960s.\n  The Cultural Revolution, which Mao declared because there had always \nbeen revolutions, may have resulted--I don't think anybody knows, and I \ndon't think we will ever know--in somewhere between 20 million and 40 \nmillion persons murdered, starved, dead. It is beyond our reach of our \nimagination. It happened. That doesn't happen anymore. Do disagreeable \nthings happen? Do illegal things happen? Do bad things happen? Yes. But \na certain sense of proportion, I thought, that was very much in \nevidence in testimony that our revered chairman will perhaps recall, I \nam sure he will.\n  Before the Finance Committee on March 23 of this year, Professor \nMerle Goldman, who is at the Fairbank Center at Harvard University--a \nname for a great Chinese scholar and very fine group of people--said:\n\n     . . . the linkage of economic sanctions to human rights is \n     counter-productive. As Wang Juntao [a Tiananmen Square \n     coordinator who was sentenced to 13 years of prison] says, it \n     arouses the antagonism of ordinary Chinese people toward the \n     U.S. and fuels increasing nationalism in China, which \n     ultimately hurts the cause of human rights in China. Even \n     when the threat of economic sanctions in the past led to \n     China's release of a small number of famous political \n     prisoners, it did not in anyway [sic] change or end the \n     Chinese government's abuse of human rights.\n       Nevertheless, China's views on human rights have been \n     changing ever so slowly in the post Mao Zedong era primarily \n     because of China's move to the market and participation in \n     the international community. During the Mao era (1949-1976) \n     when China was isolated from the rest of the world, China's \n     government did not care about human rights and international \n     pressure. But as China opened up to the outside world \n     politically as well as economically during the Deng Xiaoping \n     period (1978-1997) and during that of his successor Jiang \n     Zemin (1989-    ), China began to care about how it was \n     viewed. It wants to be considered a respected, responsible \n     member of the world community. . . .\n       Human rights abuses continue and in fact, increased in \n     1999, but compared with the Mao era when millions were \n     imprisoned and silenced, the numbers in the post-Mao era are \n     in the thousands.\n\n  That was from Professor Merle Goldman.\n  I say in conclusion of these small remarks that the head of the \nChinese Government, Jiang Zemin, last week was in New York City talking \nto a luncheon of business executives. That is a world that would have \nbeen inconceivable when I visited George Bush in Peking, as it then was \nin 1975. A quarter century has gone by, and there is the President of \nChina in a blue suit and a white shirt with the correct tie at the \nWaldorf Astoria or somewhere talking to a luncheon of businessmen \ninterested in trade and development and such matters. That is another \nworld. Let's not put that in jeopardy by losing this extraordinary \nimportant trading agreement.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time do we have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents have 29\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will take a couple of minutes to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. First of all, let me say to the Senator from New York \nthat there is a bit of irony in his remarks because I had intended in \nthis debate to also quote the Declaration of Fundamental Principles and \nRights of the ILO which states:\n\n       All members, even if they have not ratified the convention \n     in question, have an obligation arising from the very fact of \n     membership in the International Labor Organization to \n     respect, promote, and to realize in good faith, in accordance \n     with the ILO Constitution, the principles concerning the \n     fundamental rights which are the subject of those \n     conventions; namely freedom of association and effective \n     recognition of the right to collective bargaining.\n\n  I could not agree more with my colleague from New York. It is very \nrelevant language.\n  Here is the problem: the ILO has no enforcement problem.\n  Here is the problem: China has belonged to the ILO since 1918. How \nmuch longer are we supposed to wait for the Chinese Government to live \nup to this? This has been a pretty long time now.\n  My colleague raises a very fair question. Why is this amendment \nnecessary? Given this declaration of principles, and given the \nestablishment of the ILO, my point is: (a) no enforcement power; (b) we \nhave seen no evidence that the Chinese Government has lived up to it.\n  I quote from our own State Department's human rights report of the \npast year which confirms the Chinese Government has been persecuting \nand incarcerating labor activists. According to our State Department:\n\n       Independent trade unions are illegal. Following the signing \n     of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Culture \n     Rights in 1997, a number of labor activists petitioned the \n     Government, the Chinese Government to establish free trade \n     unions as allowed under the covenant. The Government has not \n     approved the establishment of any independent unions to date.\n\n  The State Department then goes on. My colleague says: Why is this \nneeded? I will take a couple of minutes to list what has happened to a \nnumber of these different citizen activists. This is directly from our \nState Department report.\n  The Senator from New York is the intellectual force of the Senate. He \nmakes the point that the harsh repression during Mao's years has \nimproved. I have no doubt that the situation has improved. But I would \njust have to say, look, go to our State Department report. I can only \ngo from the empirical evidence over the last number of years and \nlooking at our own Commission on International Freedom and their \nrecommendations. They did a very careful study. We commissioned them to \ndo the study of what the situation is on religious freedom. It is a \npicture of repression. It is not a picture of the ILO having \nenforcement power making any difference. It is not a picture of a \ncountry that has a respect for human rights. It is not a picture of a \ncountry respecting people who practice their religion.\n\n  From our own State Department report: Two labor activists were \nsentenced in January to reeducation through labor--and the Chinese \nGovernment insists their reeducation through labor camps are not \nprisons. They give no human rights organizations any access. They say \nthey are not prisons. Where have we heard this before on reeducation \nthrough labor--for 18 months and 12 months, respectively. The two were \narrested in 1998 after leading steelworkers in a protest because they \nhad not been paid wages.\n  Another example: In January, the founder of a short-lived association \nto protect the rights and interests of laid off workers unsuccessfully \nappealed a 10-year prison sentence he received. He had been convicted \nof ``illegally providing intelligence to foreign organizations,'' after \ninforming a Radio Free Asia reporter about worker protests in the Hunan \nprovince.\n\n[[Page S8380]]\n\n  I could go on and on. In August, in our own State Department report, \nanother activist was sentenced to 10 years for subversion. They were \narrested in January after establishing the China Workers Watch, an \norganization to defend workers rights. The family of one of these \nactivist alleges that the police hung him by his hands in order to \nextract information on a fellow dissident. That is from a State \nDepartment report this year that I am now using as my evidence.\n  In August, another labor activist was given a 10-year prison sentence \nfor illegal union activities in the 1980s, and more recently because he \norganized demonstrations in Hunan. This time he was convicted for \nproviding human rights organizations overseas with information on the \nprotests.\n  I have about 30 examples from this 1 report.\n  I say to the Senator from New York, I understand the ILO, its \nmission, its history--not as well as the Senator. I understand it does \nnot have enforcement power and that China has belonged to it since \n1918. I understand that China is not abiding by or bound by this. I \nalso understand that all the reports we have over the last several \nyears do not paint a picture of improvement. We do not have an \namendment that says we don't have trade with China; we do not have an \namendment that says we should boycott China or we should have an \nembargo of trade with China. We have an amendment that just says that \nbefore automatically extending trade relations every year or before \nautomatically extending PNTR, our Government should insist that the \nChinese live up to basic human rights standards.\n  My colleague from New York cited one of the great heroines of \nTiananmen Square. I take what these brave people say very seriously. \nBut it is also true that others, including Harry Woo and other men and \nwoman who were at Tiananmen Square who are now in our country leading \nthe human rights organizations, say the opposite. We know there are two \ndifferent views.\n  I think we should not be silent on these basic human rights \nquestions. We should not be silent when it comes to repression against \npeople. We should not be silent about the prison labor conditions.\n  In 1992, the memorandum of understanding, and in 1994, we had another \nagreement with China where they agreed they would not export products \nto our country made by prison labor. They haven't complied with any of \nthese agreements.\n  I think this amendment is timely. I think there is plenty of evidence \nthat speaks for this.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Since the 1930s, section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930, \nand the Smoot-Hawley tariff, has made it illegal to send prison labor \nproducts to this country. If it still continues to be done, doesn't \nthat problem involve our vigilance? Shouldn't we focus our attention on \nour own Customs Service, the law is ours to be enforced.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The Senator is right, but the irony is that by this \nlaw the Chinese shouldn't be exporting and we shouldn't be importing. \nThe problem is, because of the good work of Senator Lautenberg and \nSenator Harkin, for the first time in 3 or 4 years we were finally able \nto go to one of these factories and do an on-site investigation.\n  The problem has been not that we haven't tried; it is that every 3 \nmonths we make a request and every 3 months we have been turned down. \nThis has been going on for years now. It is hard to argue that this \namendment is not timely, relevant, and important in terms of whether or \nnot we go on record for human rights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am as concerned about China's repression \nof its citizens as anyone in this Chamber. But I believe that in \npassing PNTR, Congress will actually take its most important step by \nfar in fostering democracy and improving human rights in China.\n  That's because by enacting H.R. 4444, we will permit Americans to \nfully participate in China's economic development, thereby opening \nChina to freer flows of goods, services, and information. Ultimately, \nthat opening will change China's economy from one based on central \nplanning to one based on free markets and capitalism. Moreover, H.R. \n4444 will create a special human rights commission that will expose, \nand suggest remedies for, China's abusive human rights practices.\n  The forces unleashed by American and other foreign participation in \nChina's market opening will help sow the seeds of democracy and human \nrights.\n  As Ren Wanding, the brave leader of the 1978 Democracy Wall Movement \nsaid recently, ``A free and private economy forms the base for a \ndemocratic system. So [the WTO] will make China's government programs \nand legal system evolve toward democracy.''\n  We should remember that in East Asia, the flowering of democracy in \nsuch former authoritarian countries as South Korea, Taiwan, and \nThailand did not occur until economic growth in each had produced a \nsubstantial middle class.\n  American trade and investment, which will be fostered by PNTR, will \nhelp create just such a middle class in China, a group who will wield \ninfluence, and whose interests will inevitably diverge from the \ninterests of the Communist Party.\n  But American companies will do more than simply assist in the \ndevelopment of a middle class. These firms will also bring with them \nbusiness practices which coincide with traits best suited to \ndemocracies.\n  As Michael A. Santoro, a professor at Rutgers University who has \nstudied the impact of foreign corporations on human rights conditions \nand democratization in China for over a decade, said in testimony \nbefore the Finance Committee, ``When Chinese workers learn the lessons \nof the free market they are also learning an important lesson about \nhuman rights and democracy.''\n  Unlike workers in state-owned enterprises whose advancement often \ndepends on fealty to the Communist Party, workers in American firms \nadvance based on merit.\n  Such workers, who acquire wealth, status, and power through their own \nhard work instead of connections to the Communist Party are far less \nlikely to respect the party or its functionaries. And make no mistake, \ntoday's best and the brightest in China all want to work for foreign \nbusinesses rather than in stifling state-owned enterprises, let alone \nfor the government itself. Moreover, American firms are almost \nuniformly considered the most desirable because of the opportunities \nthey offer.\n  Now, to compete in the global market place, foreign firms doing \nbusiness in China must permit free flows of information. And such flows \nof information, of course, are the lifeblood of democratic government.\n  Professor Santoro stated the case well before the Finance Committee: \n``In the same way that information sharing is essential to good \ndecision-making and operational effectiveness in a corporation, free \nspeech is essential to good decision-making in a democracy. It is hard \nto imagine that ideas about the importance of information flow can be \nconfined to corporate life. Inevitably, those who work in foreign \ncorporations and have gotten used to the free flow of economic \ninformation will wonder why their government restricts the flow of \npolitical information.''\n  In addition to introducing ideas about information flow within their \norganizations, foreign corporations are at the leading edge in terms of \npressing the Chinese government toward greater legal reform and \nregulatory transparency. Indeed, if China is to realize the full \nbenefits of trade with the rest of the world and comply with its WTO \nobligations, it has no other choice than to institute the rule of law.\n  In fact, China is readying itself for this transformation by \nengaging, among others, Temple University in providing training in the \ndevelopment of China's business law system with a special emphasis on \nWTO compliance. Temple Law School has been asked by senior officials of \nthe Chinese government to educate more judges and government officials \nand to establish a business law center.\n\n  This endeavor will enable American and Chinese legal scholars to do \njoint research on issues related to business law and WTO compliance in \nChina. It will also enable American legal scholars, attorneys, judges \nand government\n\n[[Page S8381]]\n\nofficials to meet with their Chinese counterparts on a regular, \norganized basis to provide input into proposed or needed legislation \nand enforcement in an emerging Chinese legal system that will regulate \naspects of a market economy.\n  Mr. President, foreign firms, in a very real sense, constitute the \nvanguard of social change in the PRC. As Professor Santoro said, \n``Ultimately these social changes will pose a formidable challenge to \nChina's government, as profound contradictions emerge between the \nCommunist Party's authoritarian rule and China's increasingly free \neconomy and society being created by private enterprise and the free \nmarket.''\n  Meanwhile, the United States and other countries must continue to \npress China on its human rights abuses. Such public condemnation \ncomplements the special changes that will accelerate with China's \naccession to the WTO.\n  That's why the Congressional-Executive Commission on human rights in \nChina that is created by H.R. 4444 is so important and potentially so \neffective. Among the tasks of that commission will be monitoring \nChina's compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and \nPolitical Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. \nSpecifically, the Commission will monitor: the right of Chinese \ncitizens to engage in free expression without fear of prior restraint; \nthe right to peaceful assembly without restriction; religious freedom, \nincluding the right to worship free of interference by the government; \nthe right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose a residence \nwithin China and the right to leave from and return to China; the right \nof a criminal defendant to a fair trail and to proper legal assistance; \nthe right to freedom from torture and other forms of cruel or unusual \npunishment; protection of internationally-recognized worker rights; \nfreedom from incarceration for political opposition to the government \nor for advocating human rights; freedom from arbitrary arrest, \ndetention, or exile; the right to fair and public hearings by an \nindependent tribunal for the determination of a citizen's rights and \nobligations; and free choice of employment.\n  In addition, the Commission will compile and maintain lists of \npersons believed to be persecuted by the Government of China for \npursuing their rights. It will monitor the development of the rule of \nlaw, including the development of institutions of democratic \ngovernance.\n  And the Commission will give special emphasis to Tibet by cooperating \nwith the Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues in the Department of \nState.\n  Finally, the Commission will submit to Congress and to the President \nan annual report of its findings including, as appropriate, \nrecommentdations for legislative and/or executive action.\n  Given the breadth of the Commission's work and the impact of foreign \nfirms in China, it should come as no surprise that so many of China's \nmost prominent dissidents and human rights advocates support the United \nStates providng permanent normalized trade relations to China.\n  Wang Juntao who was arrested after June 4, 1989, and was sentenced in \n1991 to thirteen years in prison as one of the ``black hands'' behind \nthe Tiananmen demonstrations provided the Finance Committee with the \nfollowing statement, and I quote, ``. . . if one needs to choose \nbetween whether or not China should be admitted [to the WTO], I prefer \nto choose `Yes' . . . In an international environment, independent \nforces will be more competitive than the state-owned enterprises. Such \nindependent forces will eventually push China toward democracy . . . An \noveremphasis on economic sanctions will contribute to the growth of \nnationalism and anti-westernism in China. This will limit both the \ninfluence of the U.S. as well as that of the democracy movement in \nChina.''\n  Wang Dan, who was one of the principal organizers of the 1989 \ndemocracy movement; and who during the crackdown that followed, was \nlisted as number one on the Chinese government's black-list of student \ncounter-revolutionaries provided the Finance Committee with a similar \nstatement. ``I support China's entry into the WTO,'' he said, because \n``I feel this this will be beneficial for the long-term future of China \nbecause China will thus be required to abide by rules and regulations \nof the international community.''\n  Martin Lee, the brave and outspoken leader of the pro-democracy \nDemocratic Party of Hong Kong, which yesterday took the largest share \nof seats in Hong Kong's elections, said that the ``participation of \nChina in WTO would not only have economic and political benefits, but \nwould also bolster those in China who understand that the country must \nembrace the rule of\nlaw. . . .''\n  Mr. President, it was when China was most isolated in the 1950s \nthrough the early 1970s that the Chinese people suffered the most \nsevere depredations. The so-called Great leap Forward and the Cultural \nRevolution led to tens of millions dying from starvation and untold \nmillions more suffering social dislocation and the worst forms of human \nrights abuses.\n  Mr. President, at a very minimum, China's opening to the world \nthrough its accession to the WTO will make a repeat of atrocities on \nsuch an unthinkably vast scale far, far less likely.\n  But I am convinced, Mr. President, that in passing PNTR we will do \nmore. I believe that in passing PNTR we will have taken our most \nimportant step in advancing human rights and democratic values in \nChina.\n  I'd like to close with another quote from Ren Wanding, the leader of \nChina's Democracy Wall Movement. Here's what he said: ``Before the sky \nwas black. Now there is light . . . [China's WTO accession] can be a \nnew beginning.''\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing this \namendment.\n  I yield back all the time on both sides.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of the Byrd amendment No. 4131.\n  The time period is 3 hours equally divided.\n  The distinguished Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I don't think it is \nnecessary to spend 3 hours on this amendment. I would like to have a \nvote on the amendment tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. ROTH. The Senator probably could have the vote tonight, if he \nwanted to.\n  Mr. BYRD. If I had my druthers, as they say back in the hill \ncountry--all right.\n  Mr. President, I yield such time as I may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this amendment seeks to improve the \ncertainty of the implementation of import relief in cases of \naffirmative determinations by the International Trade Commission with \nrespect to market disruption to domestic producers of like or directly \ncompetitive products. The amendment is simple and straightforward and \nit may be vital to many U.S. industries, such as steel, footwear, and \napples. It certainly causes no harm.\n  U.S. trade law provides for import relief authorities under sections \n201, 202, 203, and 204 of the Trade Act of 1974, and relief from market \ndisruption by imports from Communist countries, such as China, under \nsection 406 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended. These safeguard \nactions are intended to provide temporary import relief from serious \ninjury to domestic producers. These provisions are essential in order \nto provide U.S. manufacturers or farmers with an opportunity to address \nsudden waves of imports--such as those brought on by economic crises in \nforeign markets, and under other unexpected conditions beyond domestic \ncontrol.\n  Regrettably, however, the import relief procedures are widely \nrecognized as overly complicated and generally ineffective. Import \nrelief authorities require exhaustive investigations and must meet \ntough litmus tests. Remedies granted under these authorities are so \ndifficult to achieve that only a handful of the most egregious cases \never receive an affirmative verdict. The number of cases that have \nreceived relief under the import relief provisions speak for \nthemselves: In the last five years, only six Section 201 cases resulted \nin some form of remedy out of 21 cases filed.\n  Market disruption caused by imports from a communist country, such as \nChina, is even more complicated. Traditional remedies for import surges \nand unfair trade practices, such as Section 201 and the antidumping and \ncountervailing duty laws, are inadequate to deal with a sudden and \nmassive influx of imports that can be manipulated by government control \nof state-owned enterprises, including pricing and distribution schemes. \nThe Trade Act of 1974 attempted to address these complications through \nthe establishment of Section 406. Although similar to Sections 201, \n202, 203, and Section 406 was intended to provide a lower standard of \ninjury and a faster relief procedure, and requires the investigation to \nfocus on imports from a specific country. Given the difficulty of \nproving Section 406, however, only 13 cases have received remedy under \nthe laws since the provisions were enacted in 1974.\n  In other words, in 26 years only 13 cases have received remedies \nunder the law. It is not a very good batting average.\n  The United States Trade Representative acknowledged that the import \nrelief authorities provided under current law are flawed, and, thus, to \nher credit, the Product-Specific Safeguard protocol language in the \nU.S.-China bilateral agreement was negotiated to enhance the ability of \nthe U.S. to respond more genuinely and immediately to market \ndisruptions caused by Chinese products entering the United States.\n  Nevertheless, the House of Representative recognized that the \nprotocol language could not provide real relief to U.S. industries that \nmight be threatened by a surge of imports from China, and, therefore, \nthe House-passed PNTR measure includes the Levin-Bereuter language on \nimport surges. This language is a significant improvement over current \nlaw and the language included in the protocol to the U.S.-China \nbilateral agreement.\n  However, the House import surge safeguard provisions continue to lack \nan essential element. They continue to fall short on a point of utmost \nimportance. While very, very close to providing meaningful benefits, \nthe Levin-Bereuter import surge safeguard language does not provide a \nreasonable assurance to U.S. industry or workers that remedies against \nharmful import surges will be taken in a timely manner.\n  One of the most serious problems encountered with the use of import \nsurge safeguards is the delays in taking action. Whether required by \nlaw or not, the administration can never seem to meet specific dates, \nand days turn into weeks and weeks turn into months. Meanwhile, U.S. \nindustries and workers must sit by, unable to respond, as they watch \ntheir market share, their profits and their jobs dwindle away.\n  My amendment finally adds a certainty to the import surge safeguards. \nIt is simple and to the point. My amendment would put into effect the \nrelief recommended by the International Trade Commission (ITC) in the \ncase of an affirmative determination of market disruption in the event \nthat no action is taken by the President or the U.S. Trade \nRepresentatives, seventy days after the ITC report is submitted. Again, \nmy amendment assures U.S. manufacturers and farmers and workers that \naction will occur on an ITC affirmative determination that a market \ndisruption has occurred, and under the exact time frame as provided \nunder the Levin-Bereuter provisions.\n  The Levin-Bereuter provisions provide legislative time frames on \nmarket disruption investigations. First, the Levin-Bereuter provisions \nrequire an ITC determination within 60 days of the initiation of an \ninvestigation, or 90 days in the investigation of confidential business \ninformation. Following the ITC action, the U.S. Trade Representative \nhas 55 days to make a recommendation to the President regarding the \ncase. Within 15 days after receipt of a recommendation from the U.S. \nTrade Representative, the President is directed to take action. Thus, \nthe Levin-Bereuter provisions were intended to initiate action within \n70 days following the ITC affirmative determination.\n  In real life, however, Section 401 cases have not existed for years, \nand many of the six Section 201 decisions that received some remedy \nover the last five years were delayed by weeks and even months beyond \nthe current statutory deadline! U.S. firms have lost confidence in \nthese provisions, and they cannot afford to pay legal expenses for \ndecisions that might never be.\n  I have been particularly concerned about the U.S. steel wire-rod \ncase. Wire-rod producers had to wait almost five months beyond the \nstatutory deadline to receive a decision by the President that remedies \nwould be put into place! The U.S. steel wire rod industry filed for \nrelief under Section 201 of the trade law on December 30, 1998, and \nfollowed lengthy, costly procedures consistent with the statute. The \ndomestic wire rod industry was encouraged after a recommendation for \nrelief was provided by the International Trade Commission, and the \nindustry looked eagerly to the President's decision, which was required \nunder statute within 60 days, or by September 27, 1999. The U.S. steel \nwire rod company officials, workers and their families and communities \nwaited, and waited, and waited. However, September 1999 came and went, \nthe fall foliage dropped from the trees, leaving them bare to the \nnorth, south, east and west, the Thanksgiving feast was held and the \nfamily gathered round and sang songs, and the Christmas season came and \nthe Christmas season went--there was no Santa Claus, Virginia--New \nYear's Day was celebrated--and yet, no action. As the days slipped from \nthe calendar, imports rose! In fact, imports rose 12 percent from \nNovember to December 1999 and were up 15 percent over 1998.\n  The real story is that, with each passing day, production was lost \nand\n\n[[Page S8383]]\n\nAmerican jobs were sacrificed. Lost income to the company became lost \nincome to the bankers, to the company suppliers, to the tax base that \nsupports local schools and roads. Worse, there was lost income to \nAmerican families. Who pays for the Christmas presents that every \nlittle child dreams of?\n\n  Time is money. That is what they say.\n  In February 2000, the President announced that relief would be \ngranted to the U.S. steel wire rod industry. This was very happy news \nand received joyfully in the steel community. But, the fact remains \nthat the money lost in the wait for a decision was lost forever.\n  China's trade with the U.S. continues to skyrocket. Imports of \nconsumers goods, agricultural goods, and manufactured products from \nChina are currently entering the U.S. market at an unprecedented rates! \nThe United States has it largest bilateral deficit with China, which \ngrew $910 million to a record $7.22 billion in June 2000 alone.\n  Why is my amendment necessary? Because when we are successful in \nplugging one hole in the Chinese dike, thousands more seem to spring \nthrough, gushing imports. According to official Department of Commerce \nimport statistics, low-priced Chinese imports of steel rail joints have \nincreased approximately 788 percent from 1997 to 2000. As in the steel \nwire rod situation, these Chinese imports have resulted in lost sales \nand depressed prices for the American industry. I have a manufacturer \nof steel rail joints in Huntington, West Virginia, the Portec Rail \nProducts, Inc.\n  Speaking of Huntington, my recollection reminds me that there was a \ncongressman from West Virginia who resided in Huntington, WV, around \nthe turn of the century. His name was Hughes. He had a daughter on the \nTitanic when that great ship went down and carried with it his daughter \nalong with more than 1,500 other victims. Only 713 persons were rescued \noff that Titanic that went to its watery grave on the morning of April \n15, 1912.\n\n  I care about the future of this manufacturer of steel rail joints in \nHuntington, WV. I care about its future, and I care about the future of \nthe people who work there. There are thousands and thousands of small \nmanufacturers that have a critical need for strong trade laws and a \ncritical need to have an assurance that the laws will work as intended. \nPortec Rail Products, Inc., is a small business. It makes steel rail \njoints that hold rail sections together and allow the construction of \nthe many miles of railroad that provide smooth transit in this country \nfor both commercial and passenger trains.\n  Portec has provided solid, semiskilled manufacturing jobs for many \nhard-working West Virginians. It also supports the State's economy by \npurchasing high quality steel bars from other West Virginia steel \nproducers. This company has added to the prosperity of my State of West \nVirginia and to the Nation. This company is facing a flood of Chinese \nimports, however. During the first quarter of 2000, for example, \nChinese imports were at a record pace of 175,000 pounds, a figure \nwhich, if annualized, would amount to a 788-percent increase since \n1997. The situation facing Portec is an authentic, true-life example of \nwhy this Senate should adopt the Byrd amendment. The workers of Portec \nare being bled dry under this hail of imports. I urge the Senate to \nhelp these workers to ensure that they are not subject to the ugly \nsituation that the U.S. steel wire rod workers endured. Let us not sit \nby idly, twiddling our thumbs and biting our fingernails and watching \nour toenails grow, by watching also these workers' savings, so \npainfully secured, become washed away, and watch the slow erosion of \nmorale and confidence. This amendment would help Portec to fight back.\n  I say to my colleagues, help me to help Portec and other U.S. \nmanufacturers and farmers.\n  Chinese state-owned enterprise continues to remain a major source of \njobs in China. Many of these state-owned enterprises are directly \ncontrolled by the Chinese Government and they play a central role in \nChina's monetary scheme. In fact, the Bureau of National Affairs \nreported on July 21 of this year that the China Daily quoted Yang \nZilin, President of the Export-Import Bank of China, as saying that \nChina's state-backed financing played a strong role in boosting China's \nexports in the first half of this year. That's right, a Chinese \nofficial readily acknowledges the systematic use of export subsidies to \nhelp boost China's skyrocketing exports. In case anyone is wondering, \nexport subsidies directly impede the ability of American firms to \ncompete with the Chinese.\n  My amendment is consistent with the goals of the House-passed China \nPNTR bill. It improves the certainty of the implementation of import \nrelief in cases of affirmative determinations by the International \nTrade Commission of market disruption to domestic producers of like or \ndirectly like products. It has been widely proclaimed by the White \nHouse and many in Congress supporting the China PNTR legislation that \nthe product-specific safeguard provisions are a critical component of \nthe U.S.-China bilateral agreement. My amendment ensures compliance to \nthe timeframe that Congress intends. More importantly, it provides a \nstandard upon which American workers and American businesses can rely.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The distinguished Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment of my \ngood friend.\n  I do so with some reluctance because I am actually quite supportive \nof taking whatever action necessary to ensure that the President takes \nseriously the deadlines set forth in our trade remedy statutes.\n  In fact, I would like to take a few minutes now to express my \nmounting concern about the White House's actions--or should I say, \ninaction?--in administering our trade laws. Frankly, I am very unhappy \nabout the President's failure to issue decisions in sensitive trade \nmatters by the deadlines set forth in the statutes.\n  There are many examples. The most notable may be two recent section \n201 cases, the first involving lamb meat and the second relating to \nsteel wire rod.\n  Both these decisions languished somewhere at the other end of \nPennsylvania Avenue for weeks--in direct violation of the law--before \nthe President finally issued his decision. We are seeing the same thing \nnow in the context of the President's decision on modifying the \nretaliation list in the bananas dispute.\n  I may agree or disagree with whatever decision the President \nultimately chooses to make in each of these cases. But the credibility \nof the trade laws rests on the process being handled with a great deal \nmore respect and seriousness than it has been thus far.\n  With that said, I must still oppose this amendment.\n  As a practical matter, there are many instances in which the process \nestablished in the proposal will simply be unworkable. For example, it \nis not unusual for the ITC to be divided on its recommendation of \nrelief in a particular case. Because the Commission often speaks with \nmany voices, it is unclear which of the Commissioner's recommendations \nwould take effect under my colleague's amendment.\n  This problem may be remedied easily, but it clearly underscores the \nimportance of allowing my committee the time to consider the proposal \nof Senator Byrd to ensure that we have considered its full \nimplications. At least some of the problems that will arise if this \namendment were to become law are already apparent to me, so I must \noppose this amendment for the time being.\n  I am also concerned that we are isolating the Chinese for \ndifferential treatment in how a trade remedy is applied.\n  While this provision may not be inconsistent with the United States-\nChina bilateral agreement, applying different rule to China in how we \nadminister our trade laws could well\n\n[[Page S8384]]\n\njeopardize our ability to secure the benefits of the uderlying trade \nagreement.\n  I must also oppose the amendment for the reasons that I have stated \nmany times during these deliberations, and that is because of the \npotential impact that amendments will have on the passage of this \nlegislation. In my view, a vote for any amendment, including this one, \nis a vote to kill PNTR.\n  The stakes are too high for our workers and farmers to allow this \nlegislation to die. That is why I urge my colleagues to vote against \nthe amendment of my good friend.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I was wondering if I can take some time, \nif the distinguished chairman has finished.\n  Mr. ROTH. I ask the distinguished Senator how much time would he \nlike.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, it depends on what his plans are. If I \ncan have 20 minutes, it will be greatly appreciated. I understand we \nhave 3 hours on this amendment.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized for 20 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4132\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Chair, and I thank Senator Roth for his \ngenerosity.\n  Mr. President, I want to speak for a moment to a couple of things \nthat have come up in the debate today with regard to the amendment on \nChina proliferation offered by myself and Senator Torricelli. Of \ncourse, once again, our reason for offering this amendment is because \nwe have been told time and time again by various bipartisan commissions \nthat we are facing an imminent threat; that China, Russia, and North \nKorea--but historically as of 1996, for example, China--have led the \nway in selling weapons of mass destruction to rogue nations. We are \ntold that these rogue nations pose a threat to our country.\n  The question now is whether or not we intend to do anything about it. \nSome say diplomacy should work. Perhaps it should. However, we see that \ndiplomacy has not worked. The problem is getting worse. Our \nintelligence estimates, which have been made public, have shown that \nthe problem is getting worse with regard to missile technology, \nespecially with Pakistan, instead of getting better.\n  A couple of my colleagues, speaking on behalf of PNTR, have pointed \nout that the Chinese have signed several nonproliferation-type \nagreements that should give us some cause for optimism, and that is \ntrue. The problem is that they have repeatedly violated every agreement \nthey have ever made. I emphasize that. At this time, when we are \ngetting ready to engage in a new trading relationship, hoping for the \nbest, we should acknowledge that China has violated every \nunderstanding, agreement, and treaty they have ever made.\n  My concern is proliferation, although human rights is very important \nand religious freedom is very important. There is only one activity of \nthe Chinese Government that poses a mortal threat to this Nation, and \nthat is the one of proliferation, spreading weapons of mass destruction \naround the globe. How in the world can we claim we need a missile \ndefense system because of the threat of rogue nations and the nuclear \nmissiles they are developing that will have the capability of hitting \nus, when we will not address the folks such as the Chinese who are \nsupplying these rogue nations? It is all carrot and no stick. They \ncannot take us seriously when we express concern about proliferation.\n\n  Let's talk about the proliferation agreements they have signed. In \nMarch of 1992, China ratified the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. \nHowever, in 1994, China sold to Pakistan 5,000 unsafeguarded ring \nmagnets which can be used in gas centrifuges to enrich uranium.\n  In 1995, China built in Iran a separation system for enriching \nuranium.\n  As we know, China has outfitted Pakistan from soup to nuts. Under our \nwatchful eye, they have made it so that Pakistan can now build their \nown missiles. We have watched them do this over the last few years in \ntotal violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which some of \nmy colleagues so optimistically claim they signed; therefore, they must \nbe abiding by it. They are not.\n  In May of 1996, China reaffirmed its commitment to nuclear \nnonproliferation. Again, however, in 1996, China sold a special \nindustrial furnace and high-tech diagnostic equipment to unsafeguarded \nnuclear facilities in Pakistan.\n  In 1997, China was the principal supplier of Pakistan's nuclear \nweapons program.\n  In 1997, China transferred to Iran a uranium conversion facility \nblueprint.\n  In 1997, China promised not to begin a new nuclear cooperation \nagreement with Iran after completing a small nuclear reactor and a \nfactory for building nuclear fuel rod encasements.\n  In 2000, U.S. intelligence reports state that ongoing contact between \nPRC entities and Pakistan's nuclear weapons program cannot be ruled \nout.\n  China is a member of the Zangger Committee which considers procedures \nfor the export of nuclear material and equipment under the NPT but is \nthe only major nuclear supplier of the 35-nation nuclear suppliers \ngroup whose nations agreed to guidelines covering exports for peaceful \npurposes to any non-nuclear weapon state and requires full-scope \nsafeguards. The Chinese Government has agreed to a list of \nnonproliferation treaties and agreements and then violated them, but \nwith regard to those treaties that require safeguards, where someone \ncan come in and inspect whether or not they are doing it, they will not \nagree to those, and that has been the history.\n  Are we so eager for trade that we accept this kind of behavior as in \nsome way acceptable to us?\n  In February of 1992, China pledged to abide by the missile technology \ncontrol regime and renewed this commitment in 1994. However, I have an \nentire list which I will not read, but in 1993 they transferred M-11 \nshort-range missile equipment to Pakistan. In 1996, China helped \nPakistan build an M-11 missile factory. In 1997, telemetry equipment to \nIran.\n\n  In 1999, China supplied specialty steel, accelerometers, gyroscopes, \nand precision-grinding machinery to North Korea; a wind tunnel to \nLibya--on and on and on--the roughest nations on the face of the Earth \nin terms of their proliferation and dangerous activities. China \nconsistently supplies them in violation of their own agreement.\n  In 1997, China ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention; however, \nthey have violated it on numerous occasions.\n  In 1997, the PRC transferred chemical weapons technology and \nequipment to Iran.\n  In 1998, the PRC entities sold 500 tons of phosphorus materials, \nwhich is controlled by the Australia Group, to Iran--and on and on and \non and on.\n  We cannot turn a blind eye to this. We can trade even with people \nwith whom we have strong disagreements. We can trade with China. But \ncan we really address a trade issue with them and envelop them into a \nnew understanding with trade, from which we believe we will get some \neconomic benefit, without telling them that they cannot continue to \nmake this world a dangerous place? And it is the United States of \nAmerica that is going to be most vulnerable to this; Belgium and \nFrance, with all due respect, are not going to be the primary targets \nof these rogue nations if and when they get the ability to hit foreign \nnations. It is going to be the blackmail that they will try against us.\n  What if Saddam Hussein had this capability in the gulf war? Do we \nreally think it would have turned out the way it did? How much activity \nwill breach the tolerance level of the Senate when it comes to the \nChinese? We do not have to jeopardize trade with China. We must have \nsome measures to get their attention.\n  What our bill does, when all is said and done, is provide a report on \nthose proliferation activities and provide the President the \nopportunity to do something about it. It makes it a little more \ndifficult for him to turn a blind eye to these proliferation activities \nbecause if he does not do something about it, he has to tell Congress \nwhy.\n  It also provides that if Congress feels strongly enough about it--if \nenough\n\n[[Page S8385]]\n\npeople sign up--we can actually take a vote on the President's \ndecision.\n  That is what it boils down to. We have had people come to this floor \nand say: If we pass this amendment, these unilateral mandatory \nsanctions, the sky will absolutely fall. It will mess up everything. It \nwill make the Chinese mad. We might lose trade.\n  No. 1, even if all those things happened, I ask, what is the primary \nobligation of this body? To protect ourselves from these problems and \ntrying to address them or not? But these things are not going to happen \nbecause we already have laws on the books that are unilateral sanctions \nthat this body has voted for oftentimes without a dissenting vote, time \nand time again, to impose sanctions on various entities for various \nreasons. Perhaps we have done too much in some respects. Perhaps we \nhave not done enough in others. But there are numerous laws on the \nbooks.\n  What our amendment does is provide for a more extensive report and \nprovide for congressional input, as I have said. But in terms of \nsanctions, it is right along the lines of what we have done on numerous \noccasions. It is only when it comes to China, it is only when we \nidentify China that everyone comes rushing to the floor saying: My \ngoodness, we can't do this; Our allies will be against us; China will \nbe against us; It will upset Russia; It will be a bad example to the \nworld, and all of that. It is only when someone thinks that we are \ncomplicating the China trade deal that all of these concerns come to \nthe fore. We can do better than that.\n\n  People say we need hearings, that no committee of jurisdiction has \nhad hearings. My committee, the committee I chair, is a committee of \njurisdiction. We have had 30 hearings on the issue of proliferation. \nThere have been 60-some-odd hearings on the issue of proliferation.\n  Some people say: Thompson's committee has had several drafts. They \nkeep coming up with different drafts. That is true because we keep \ntrying to satisfy the critics who do not want to do anything to \nirritate the Chinese Government.\n  They have said: You identified China specifically. We broadened it to \ninclude Russia and North Korea because they are also major suppliers.\n  They say: You do not give the President enough discretion. Now we \ngive him almost total discretion. He has to make a determination before \nanything happens.\n  They say: You are going to hurt farmers or small businessmen. We \nspecifically eliminated any potential involvement of farmers or small \nbusinesses.\n  Some people say: Farmers still don't like it because if we are mean \nto the Chinese Government, they might retaliate, and it might be \nagainst farmers. Not my farmers in Tennessee. I think if my farmers in \nTennessee had a choice between us responding responsibly to this \nirresponsible behavior on the part of the Chinese Government and \nrisking their getting mad, and in some way affecting them in some \nexport that they might have, they would be willing to take that chance. \nThe farmers are not involved in this.\n  Some said that any Member of Congress could force a vote to override \nthe President. So we made it so it had to be 20 Members of Congress.\n  Yes, there have been several reiterations of this bill because we \nhave been trying to answer the reasonable complaints.\n  What it boils down to is that not all of these various complaints are \nthe reason for the opposition. My opinion is that the root of it is a \ngenuine desire not to irritate the Chinese Government at a time we are \ntrying to enter into a new trading relationship with them.\n  Generally speaking, I think that is a laudatory idea. I cannot \ncomplain about that as a general rule. But these are not times to apply \nthe general rules. These are extraordinary circumstances. We have been \ngetting reports on what they have been doing for years now and have not \ndone anything about it.\n  Now we are about to enter into a new trade relationship which they \nwant desperately. They have a favorable trade balance with this Nation \nof $69 billion. They are not going to turn their back on that. They \nwant this.\n  If we do not have the wherewithal to raise the issue of the fact that \nthey are making this a more dangerous world and threatening our country \nnow, when are we going to do it?\n  A Senator actually said yesterday that one of the problems he had \nwith this bill, in light of the nuclear proliferation that we are \ndealing with, is that this report will be too onerous, this report \nwhich we are requiring on these activities will be too voluminous for \nour intelligence. Why would it be so voluminous? I agree with him. It \nwould be. Why? Because of all of the proliferation that is going on. Do \nwe not want to know about it because it is too voluminous?\n\n  I suggest that we get serious about this. Some complained that we \nmight catch up some innocent Chinese company, where there is credible \nevidence that they are selling these dangerous weapons, but they may \nlater prove to be innocent. That is not a major problem is all I have \nto say.\n  If I have to come down on the side of doing something to address this \nproblem or running the risk that we may for a period of time unjustly \naccuse a Chinese company and, therefore, cut off military exports to \nthem, I am willing to run that risk.\n  Others say we have to give engagement a chance. One of the most \ndistinguished Senators ever to serve in this body spoke a little while \nago, someone I respect tremendously, the senior Senator from New York. \nHe talked about the fact that Jiang Zemin met with our President last \nFriday at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York. He also mentioned the fact \nthat he met with American businessmen, and it was a good thing for the \nleader of the Chinese Government to be meeting and talking with \nAmerican businessmen. I think, generally speaking, that is true. But we \nhave to consider the context in which this happened.\n  According to the New York Times story the next day, that luncheon \nmeeting with America's top business executives was to declare that \nChina was plugging into the New World. Jiang Zemin said: We have over \n18 million citizens, more than 27,000 World Wide Web sites, over 70,000 \nChinese domain names, and 61 million mobile phones in China.\n  It goes on to say what he did not mention: China's recent efforts to \ncrack down on the use of the Internet for the spread of dissenting \nopinions in China. Mr. Clinton said that he never broached the subject.\n  It went on to say that President Clinton brought up the proliferation \nwhich we all know, and they admit that we know, they were doing and \nasked him to do something about it.\n  He smiled and wished the President well in his retirement and thanked \nthe President for his assistance with regard to getting China into \nWTO--smiled and went on, knowing there would be no repercussions.\n  We have sent three delegations to China this year beseeching them, on \nthe eve of this PNTR vote, to stop some of their activities. According \nto our own people who were there in the meetings, they were told by the \nChinese Government officials that they intended to continue their \npolicies with regard to weapons of mass destruction unless we backed \noff on our missile defense system and our positions on Taiwan.\n  You have to give the leadership of the Communist Chinese Government \ncredit for being up front about it. They are doing it and telling us \nthey are going to continue to do it. We are over here worried about \nwhether or not to upset them because it might cost us some trade or it \nmight in some way be counterproductive and we need to exercise \ndiplomacy.\n  What has diplomacy gotten us so far? They say: Unilateral sanctions \nnever work; we need to get our allies together. What have we been able \nto get our allies together on in the last several years? When you can't \nget multilateral action on something that is dangerous to your country, \nwhat do you do, go home? We can't get a U.N. resolution to criticize \nChina's behavior with regard to human rights. We can't get our European \nfriends to let us send them bananas. Yet we are supposed to sit back, \nin light of this nuclear and biological and chemical threat to our \nNation, until we can get all of our allies together to do it at once. \nOtherwise, it would be ineffective and somebody might be critical of \nus?\n  Some say Chairman Greenspan thinks our provision that allows the\n\n[[Page S8386]]\n\nPresident to cut some of these companies out of our capital markets is \na bad idea. What we did is list one option. The President has this \nauthority anyway, but I think it has a salutary effect to have it \nlisted up front, telling the world this is what we intend on doing as a \npossibility. One of the options the President has, when he catches \nthese folks doing this and he makes a determination--or when it comes \nto a country, in his complete discretion, one of the options he has is \nto tell the companies that are in our capital markets in the New York \nStock Exchange that they can't be raising any more money.\n  The Deutch Commission, comprised of distinguished Americans, told us \none of the things that is happening to us--and the American people \nought to know about it--is that proliferating companies under the \ncontrol of the Chinese Government are raising billions of dollars on \nthe New York Stock Exchange from American citizens who don't know what \nthey are doing. The Deutch Commission suggested the capital markets are \namong a wide range of economic levers we could use as carrots or sticks \nas part of an overall strategy to combat proliferation. That is from \nthis thoughtful commission of experts in this area. How many Americans \nknow that these companies are raising billions of dollars on the New \nYork Stock Exchange? That is an option the President could or could not \nuse as he sees fit.\n  Some of my colleagues--in fact, all of my colleagues--who oppose this \namendment have quoted Mr. Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve. \nHe was in the Banking Committee. I am not sure what the subject was. I \ncan assure you it was not nuclear proliferation. Opponents of my \namendment asked him this specific question: Basically, do you oppose \nthe idea of cutting people out of our capital markets? He said, no, he \nthought that was not a good idea generally, and went on to explain why.\n\n  I have a couple of comments about that. This is not a capital market \nissue, this is a proliferation issue. I have extreme respect for \nChairman Greenspan, but I would not ask a proliferation expert whether \nor not he thought interest rates ought to be raised. I don't think \nChairman Greenspan would claim to be an expert on the nature of the \nproblem this country faces and what we should do about it.\n  As a general proposition, I agree with him. I think we ought to be \nexpanding all of our markets, including our capital markets. But on an \noccasion, if we catch a company and our intelligence agencies come \nforth and say there is credible evidence that this company just sold \nmissile capabilities to Libya, and we have caught them, we have the \nintelligence on it, the President looks at it, makes his own evaluation \nand says, yes, I believe it is true. I hereby make that determination, \nand this same company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, should \nwe not do something about that, raising money from the very American \ncitizens who would be targeted potentially by a Libya?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time requested by the distinguished \nSenator has expired.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I urge adoption of the amendment, Mr. President. I \nthank the Chair and my chairman, Senator Roth, for their indulgence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH assumed the Chair.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I am going to be speaking on the PNTR \nissue. From the time allotted, I yield myself 15 minutes.\n  The pending business is the Byrd amendment, but I was intensely \ninterested in the comments and remarks by my good friend and colleague, \nSenator Thompson.\n  I thought now would be an appropriate time to urge my colleagues to \noppose the China nonproliferation act--that is how the act is \ndescribed--offered as an amendment to the legislation. But, again, I \nwant to point out to my good friend and distinguished colleague from \nTennessee that as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and as \nchairman of the Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, I \nspeak with at least some understanding on this very serious subject of \nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The fact is the \ndistinguished majority leader has appointed Senator Bob Bennett to be \non the task force, as well as Senator Thompson, myself, Senator Kyl, \nand Senator Gregg on this very issue.\n  More especially, in regard to the threat of terrorism, which is a \nvery serious threat, among its many duties the Emerging Threat \nSubcommittee is responsible for congressional oversight of programs \ncalled the Nunn-Lugar cooperative threat reduction programs. They \nannually authorize the use of Defense Department funds--the fact is we \nare right in the middle of the defense authorization bill--to assist \nwith the safe and secure transportation, storage, and dismantlement of \nnuclear, chemical, and other weapons of the former Soviet Union. We \nwould hope we could do similar activities with the other nations \nconcerned more specifically mentioned by my distinguished colleague.\n  In that enterprise, I have spent countless hours in committee \nmethodically and hopefully meticulously debating these issues. This is \na very important issue to me.\n  As the Senator pointed out, our first obligation is our national \nsecurity. Our first obligation as Senators is to do what we can to \nsafeguard our national security. There is no question about that.\n  As the distinguished Senator and, I guess, all of my colleagues, I \nhave very serious concerns about China. I have no illusions about \nChina. They are spreading, as he has indicated, weapons of mass \ndestruction technology all around the world, more specifically to \nnations of concern. But I don't think this is the reason to erect what \nwe call trade barriers, which is exactly what I think this amendment \nwill do. Quite the opposite. It seems to me we should really reject \nthis amendment because trade, on the other hand, has a stabilizing \neffect on international relations. The more that two nations trade and \ninvest in regard to the economics of both countries and each other, the \nless likely it is that they will engage in any kind of military \nconflict.\n  Let me spend a few moments explaining to my colleagues why I think \nthis amendment, which requires the President to once again impose \nsanctions on China, would be counterproductive.\n  First, again, I don't know how many times we have to say this on the \nfloor. I have had the privilege of being in public service in the other \nbody since 1980, and, as a matter of fact, I was working as a staff \nmember 10 or 12 years prior to that time. In speech after speech after \nspeech, primarily involved with agriculture, we have tried to point out \nthat unilateral sanctions simply don't work as a foreign policy tool. \nStudy after study by respected foreign policy experts and economists, \nacademics, not to mention the farmer who has gone through this I don't \nknow how many times, all agree that unilateral sanctions are overused; \nthat they are ineffective and counterproductive. I know that they send \na message.\n  I know from the intervention standpoint the sanctions we have on \napproximately 71 countries around the world send a very strong \nperception. We have them on almost virtually everything that we are \nworried about. But unilateral sanctions do little to change the \nbehavior of the offending country. Yet they put American businesses and \nAmerican workers and farmers at a huge competitive disadvantage.\n\n  I remember so well the 1980 embargo by President Carter. The Russians \nhad invaded Afghanistan--something we all disagreed with without \nquestion and viewed as a great tragedy. I remember that the United \nStates canceled the Olympics. At that time, President Carter said no \nmore grain sales to Russia. Not one Russian troop left Afghanistan. \nAnd, yet, in terms of contract sanctity and our trade policy, our \nexport policy was like shattered glass. I tell you who paid the price. \nIt wasn't Russia. The fact is they were becoming more dependent on our \nfood supply,\n\n[[Page S8387]]\n\nand the Russian people were demanding more in that regard because of a \nhigher protein diet.\n  It was the Kansas wheat farmer and farmers all over this country. Our \nexport policy suffered for years afterwards. It took us 2 years after \nthat to get any contract sanctity. The price of wheat at the country \nelevator in Dodge City, KS, went from $5 down to about $2. Boy, did we \nfeel good, except that Vietnam veteran who went out there to harvest \nhis field and who had a good crop all of a sudden found it diminished \nin value and price. He was wondering and scratching his head: Wait a \nminute, these sanctions are not helping quite the way I thought they \nwould.\n  I am saying again that sanctions simply don't work as a foreign \npolicy tool. Unilateral sanctions are often used as an easy substitute \nfor the harder work of finding more effective and long-term responses \nto foreign policy problems. They create the false impression that these \nproblems have been solved. We need to take, it seems to me, a harder \nlook at alternatives such as multilateral pressure and more effective \nU.S. diplomacy.\n  The Senator from Tennessee indicated what time we had in regard to \nmultilateral pressure in regard to China. He makes one excellent point: \nWe have not been successful to the degree that we should have been.\n  More effective U.S. diplomacy. Let's see, 18 months ago, or 2 years \nago, we were going ahead with this trade agreement. We worked on it for \nyears. All of a sudden, it was pulled back. Then we got into a conflict \nin regard to Kosovo. We had the unfortunate incident of the Belgrade \nbombing. I am going to be very frank. This is after about six times of \ndrawing lines in the sand in regard to Bosnia and Kosovo, the Balkans, \nand the former Yugoslavia.\n  It seems to me that our word in regard to standing firm with what we \nwould do in reference to foreign policy objectives would go a long way \nin convincing the Chinese, more especially the hard liners and the \nCommunists in that country, that we mean what we say. It seems to me \nthat a clear and rational and defined foreign policy of the United \nStates where we define precisely what our U.S. vital national security \ninterests are and make that very clear to the Chinese would go a long \nway to helping this matter rather than sanctions.\n  Let me point out that unilateral economic sanctions almost never help \nthe people we want to help and almost always fail to bring about the \nactions that we seek to promote. By acting alone, America only ensures \nthat its responses are ineffective since the target country can always \ncircumvent a U.S. unilateral sanction by working with one of our \ncompetitors. That certainly will be the case and would be the case with \nregard to China. Unilateral sanctions should be one of the last tools \nout of America's foreign policy toolbox--not the first.\n  Second, the China nonproliferation act requires the mandatory--I have \nit in caps, in a higher type case here, to underline it--imposition of \nsanctions rather than allowing the President the discretion in \ndetermining whether sanctions or some other response will promote our \nU.S. goal.\n  The measure requires the imposition of the full complement of U.S. \nsanctions for even minor infractions instead of mandating a \npredetermined one-size-fits-all response. It seems to me that history \nand prudence tells us that the President's hands should not be tied. \nFlexibility is a must when dealing with sensitive foreign policy \nissues.\n  The thought occurs to me that if we are unhappy about the President \nnot using all the venues, all of the opportunities, and all of the \nvarious means at his disposal to send strong messages to China in \nregard to this specific issue, we might want to quarrel with the \npolicies and the recommendations and the actions of the President--not \nimpose more unilateral mandatory sanctions that, quite frankly, might \nbe followed up by more wrong-headed policy decisions, say, by the \nExecutive.\n  First, this amendment is redundant. A substantial body of law already \nexists in regard to governing the real proliferation of weapons. The \nPresident already has authority to adequately respond and report to the \nCongress on this issue, on this concern, which is real, about China and \nother nations. Examples include the Arms Export Control Act. I know the \ncriticism will be; we haven't done that. Let's get back to the people \nwho are implementing the policy. It is certainly not the alternative \nthat is there.\n  Second, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n  Third, the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act. All those are on the \nbooks.\n  Fourth, the Export Administration Act.\n  Fifth, the Export-Import Bank Act.\n  And many others too numerous to list. You can go on and on.\n  Let's utilize and enforce the laws already on the books instead of \nhastily creating new statutes without properly studying the issue in \nthe committee process, although, the Senator from Tennessee has spent \nmany long hours on this subject area. I truly appreciate that.\n  Finally, it seems to me we must defeat this amendment because of the \nobvious: Its success will kill the effort to achieve trade concessions \nwith China. It will kill the PNTR. My former House colleagues have \nassured me. I know it is easy to say let's pass it and see. In my view, \nin talking with people on both sides of the aisle on this issue, from \nthe Speaker to the rank-and-file Members of the House, this is a killer \namendment.\n  I also know the Senator from Tennessee has tried for a free-standing \namendment. I understand that. That is a different matter. But tied to \nthis particular effort, it represents the death of I don't know how \nmany years of work in regard to PNTR. I think Senators must understand \na vote for this amendment, or any amendment, serves ultimately as a \nvote against PNTR.\n  It will be a tough vote for many of my colleagues simply because, as \nthe Senator has pointed out, that is our first obligation. That is why \nwe are here. It is such a serious issue.\n  I am much more discouraged by the thought of explaining to the \nAmerican people why we failed to rise to the occasion and remain \neconomically and diplomatically engaged with one-fifth of the world's \npopulation. I think that course of action would help us in regard to \nour national security.\n  I took some notes while I had the privilege of being the acting \nPresiding Officer, and perhaps this will be a little redundant. \nHopefully, it will be helpful. Senator Thompson said the reason he has \nintroduced the amendment, he has told all of us--especially those \nprivileged to serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senate Armed \nServices Committee, bipartisan commission, and virtually all Members of \nthe intelligence community--that we have a problem here in regard to \nthe real, certain spread of weapons of mass destruction and selling \nthese weapons to rogue nations. We don't call them rogue nations \nanymore; we call them nations of concern. I am not too sure what the \ndifference is. We all know who they are.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is exactly right. He says the problem is \ngetting worse. He refers to Pakistan and says, What do we do about it? \nThen he says the Chinese have violated virtually all the agreements we \nhave entered into with them prior to this date. I am not sure they have \nviolated each and every one, but obviously we have not reached the \nprogress we would like to reach with the Chinese.\n\n  He says, How on Earth can we claim the need for a national missile \ndefense when these adversaries are causing the proliferation of weapons \nof mass destruction?\n  Excellent point.\n  Then he indicated that he could read a considerable amount of the \nintelligence reports--the itemized situation there in regard to the \nnations of concern and the spread of weapons of mass destruction.\n  That is true. But my question is, How can killing trade answer that \nchallenge? How can killing this bill answer that challenge from a \npractical standpoint? With our competitors all over the world and the \nconcessions we have arranged for in this trade bill, how can taking \nthose sales away from American businesses, American farmers, and \nAmerican ranchers help this situation? I don't understand that. I \nunderstand the means, but I don't understand the end.\n  If nothing else happens, China will become a member of the WTO and \none-\n\n[[Page S8388]]\n\nfifth of the world's population will be a market to all the rest of the \npopulation, except the United States, and our competitors will take \nthose markets. Kansas sales will not go to China; they will go to our \ncompetitors. I don't understand how that affects the Chinese decision \nin regard to these matters of grave national concern.\n  Will the Chinese change their military policy? I doubt it. I have no \nillusions. I share the Senator's concerns about Taiwan. I have been to \nTaiwan several times. I share the concern in regard to human rights. I \nshare the concern, as I have indicated, about the spread of weapons of \nmass destruction. I sit on those subcommittees. I am worried about the \nespionage.\n  I worried a great deal 2 years ago when the distinguished Senator \nfrom Tennessee led the effort to have a little transparency, to shine \nthe light of truth into darkness in regard to the campaign contribution \nviolations involving China. He was stymied in that effort--we won't go \ninto that--and tried very hard to reach a logical conclusion.\n  The Senator mentioned it is our primary obligation in regard to \nnational security. I agree. But it seems to me, again, a partial answer \nis a clear foreign policy.\n  I am very hopeful with a change of administration we can achieve \nthat, so that the Chinese fully understand what is acceptable and what \nisn't in regard to our national interests. It is not only China; it is \nall nations of concern. As a matter of fact, this administration has \nalready announced we have exempted food and medicine sanctions in \nreference to all these nations of concern. They have not gone ahead and \nsaid that we can compete with our competitors and use our export credit \nprograms, which is another step. Right now, with Iran we are trying to \nwork this out as best we can. Obviously, we have a lot of concerns \nabout the nation of Iran.\n  So it involves all of the nations. The same thing with Cuba. You can \nmake the same argument with Cuba, except obviously Cuba today does not \npose a national security threat. We hear the same arguments with regard \nto sanctions.\n  Trade is not a productive way to achieve foreign and military policy \ngoals. I mentioned the Carter embargo. I will not go back over that. \nThe issue is in regard to all of the reports. Send strong signals. We \nshould be willing to take a strong stand. We should be able to draw a \nline in the sand and have reasonable policy discussions with the \nChinese.\n\n  If we don't have that kind of engagement with the current leadership \nin regard to trade, to whom does it turn over the decisionmaking? Who \ngains ascendancy if we kill PNTR? I will tell you who it is: It is the \ntwo generals who wrote the book on how they can gain supremacy with the \nUnited States by the year 2020. I haven't read all the book, but I read \na portion of it. It is a chilling book. Equal superpower status with \nthe United States. I think they probably wrote the last chapter after \nwe were involved in the bombing of the embassy in Belgrade because they \nworry about NATO going outside of its boundaries and taking action like \nthis. I think that crosses the T's and dots the I's. I am not saying \nthat was a one-for-one cause, but I think that certainly was the case. \nIf we don't remain engaged with trade, it will turn that decisionmaking \nover to those very people.\n  Let's say we pass the Thompson amendment, the House doesn't take the \nbill up, and PNTR is dead. We sure showed them. We showed them. \nBasically, the Chinese hardliners will gain ascendancy, the Chinese \nwill buy some Ericsson cell phones, and the Chinese will buy French \nwheat and the Airbus aircraft. The President will still have the \noptions he should be using right now to convince the Chinese we ought \nto be making progress on this, but we won't be trading with Chinese. It \nseems to me that is the question.\n  I thank Senator Thompson for making this such an issue of concern and \nhaving what I think has been excellent dialog and debate. I share his \nconcern about the national security risk this poses. I do think this is \nthe wrong way to get it done. I think this is a killer amendment. It is \nas simple as that. We have come far too far in our efforts to engage \nthe Chinese with trade and, yes, with a serious national policy dialog \nwith regard to our national security, to go down this road.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I ask unanimous consent I may have 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Kansas for the \nlevel of his debate. This is a good discussion. This is what we ought \nto be doing. This is what we should have been doing for some time now. \nThese are legitimate problems and legitimate disagreements.\n  But let me disagree with my good friend on a couple of very important \npoints. The trade we talk about here, the only trade that would be \nstopped by my amendment, is trade that is already prohibited in other \nlegislation. It is trade that is basically on the munitions list; that \nis, armaments and things of that nature, munitions and dual-use items. \nUnder the Export Administration Act, if these entities are caught \nproliferating, it is already required that we stop that. We are \ncertainly not arguing, are we, that the President should not enforce \nthat law? It is already on the books. The worst that can be said about \nours is that it is duplicative.\n  I have had a lot worse things said about things that I have done than \nthat I have been duplicative. I hardly think that is a major problem, \nin light of the fact there are additional items in our bill which help \nwhich are not on the books now.\n  But in terms of the trade that we would be losing, if that is the \ncase, we would be losing it now if the President was applying the law \nthe way he is supposed to apply the law. It is already on the books. \nSuppose it was not. Do we really want to be sending munitions list \nitems and dual-use items to companies we find are proliferating? Can't \nwe stand to lose that trade? We are not talking about Kansas farmers. \nWe are not talking about Tennessee farmers. We are talking about those \nfolks in this country--if you are in the business that would be \naffected by the munitions or the dual-use items that have \neither domestic or military capability, you would be affected if the \nPresident decided he wanted to go that route. That is the limitation. I \nthink it is over $1 billion a year in exports that we have in a $9 \ntrillion economy. Can't we afford that in light of this threat? Can't \nwe afford that?\n\n  My friends on the other side say this is a killer amendment. Let's \nanalyze that for a minute. I submit to you that is not the case. It is \nbeing used, but it is not the case.\n  The House of Representatives passed PNTR by about a 40-vote margin--\nmore than anybody thought. All of us in this body have had a chance to \nexpress ourselves, and the votes are overwhelming here. The support and \nthe leadership in the House is solid. You cannot stir with a stick the \nlobbyists in support of it around this town. The fight is over. We are \ngoing to have PNTR. The idea that we would send it back to the House \nwith a proliferation amendment on it and people will say, ``My \ngoodness, we are trying to do something about Chinese proliferation. We \ncan't have that. I voted for it before but I am going to change my vote \nnow and vote against it,'' is ludicrous.\n  People say: Who is going to change their vote? With that 40-vote \nmargin, who is going to change? Is it going to be the Republicans \nbecause we added a proliferation amendment? Of course not. Is it going \nto be the Democrats because the labor unions are pressuring them? When \nthe Democrats are so close to taking back control of the House? When \nthe labor unions have already lost this PNTR battle, and they know it, \nthey are going to put their members in that kind of position so they \ncan go into the election with a vote for it and a vote against?\n  With all due respect, that is not going to happen. If we add a \nproliferation amendment and do what we should have been doing a long \ntime ago--and say we are just going to ask for a report, and if we \ncatch you, we are going to give our President the clear option to do \nsomething about it or, if he does not, he is going to have to tell us \nwhy--if it went back to the House, it would be ratified within 24 hours \nand that would be the end of it.\n\n[[Page S8389]]\n\n  We are not going to know until it happens. If we are so intent on \navoiding what I consider to be a minute risk that we will turn a blind \neye to what is going on because we are so intent on this trade \nagreement that we cannot even do the minimal of requiring an additional \nreport, requiring some additional congressional involvement and making \nit a little tougher for the President to game the system--the way, \nquite frankly, this President has--then we have bigger troubles than I \nthink we have.\n  How can this help? My friends ask: How can this help? I will ask a \nquestion. Why is the PRC so against this amendment? Is it because it is \nineffective or duplicative? They are against this amendment because \nthey don't want the additional attention on their activities. They \ndon't want the President to have it highlighted that he has this \ndiscretion and has to give a reason why he does not take action. They \nthink it will be effective. I think it will be effective. I think it \nwill have an effect on them where they will think at least one more \ntime before they do something that they know is going to be another \nmajor debate on this floor. That is my belief.\n  My friend makes a good point with regard to the issue of sanctions in \ngeneral. That has been the source of a great debate for a long time. He \nmakes some good points. But I reiterate: Sanctions are not sanctions \nare not sanctions. There are different kinds of sanctions. We can't \nlump all sanctions in one group. There are sanctions that differ in \nterms of the targeted country. There are sanctions that differ in terms \nof the activity that is going to be addressed. There are sanctions that \nare different in terms of the commodities or goods on which you are \nplacing some limitation. We have had sanctions that have dealt with \nagriculture, as he points out. They have dealt with goods in general in \ntimes past. What we are dealing with here basically is munitions and \ndual-use items. Should we not stop that, if we catch these companies \nproliferating weapons of mass destruction?\n\n  Over the years when the U.S. has been serious about implementing \nmeasures to signal our displeasure with a foreign government's actions, \nthese measures have had an effect. For example, U.S. economic pressure \nin the late 1980s and early 1990 led to China's accession to the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1992. In June of 1991, the Bush \nadministration applied sanctions against the PRC for missile technology \ntransfers to Pakistan.\n  They have been doing this for a long time, folks. These measures led \nto China's commitment 5 months later to abide by the Missile Technology \nControl Regime. They systematically violate it, but perhaps, hopefully, \nnot as much as if they had not even agreed to abide by it.\n  In August of 1993, the Clinton administration imposed sanctions on \nthe PRC for the sale of M-11 missile equipment to Pakistan in violation \nof the Missile Technology Control Regime. Over a year later, Beijing \nbacked down by agreeing not to export ground-to-ground missiles if \nsanctions were lifted. They entered into this agreement in order to get \nsanctions lifted. I wonder why they wanted those sanctions lifted--\nbecause they were having no effect? And that occurred in 1994.\n  Some of these examples were provided to me by Sandy Berger, the \nNational Security Adviser, to illustrate how unilateral sanctions and/\nor the threat of sanctions have been effective when dealing with the \nPRC in the past.\n  The President's security adviser opposes my amendment because he \ndoesn't want any complications to PNTR. We respectfully disagree with \nthat. We certainly disagree over the extent to which they have \nattempted to do something about China's activities, but they have, on \noccasion, taken some action. He cites these particular instances when \nthey have taken action, and he acknowledged they had some effect.\n  So we cannot have it both ways. We cannot lump all this together and \nsay sanctions are bad, period, forever, regardless. We can't say, \n``Let's not tie the President's hands,'' when all of this is \ndiscretionary. He has to make a determination. I do not know how many \ntimes I have to repeat this. We are not tying the President's hands. He \ncan do it if he wants to and he doesn't have to do it if he doesn't \nwant to. That is not tying the President's hands. We are not talking \nabout agriculture or any other general goods. We are talking about \ndual-use items.\n  So we have a legitimate debate here. Some think we should go ahead \nand pass PNTR and have no amendment strategy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The time requested by the \ndistinguished and articulate Senator from Tennessee has expired.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The chair hears none. The \ndistinguished Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Legitimate debate. Some think we ought to pass this: No \ncomplications, no amendments, no muss, no fuss; worry about this later.\n  If not now, when? I thank the Chair and relinquish the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to take a couple of moments. I \nalready mentioned my concerns about the Thompson amendment, but I have \nto say it is interesting that the Senator is curious as to why there \nare objections to this amendment. He ought to recall that the Senate \nhas already rejected three or four amendments for the same reason, and \nthat is, we want to send a clean bill to the President.\n  The idea that his is being rejected because of certain things is just \nnot the case. There is a notion here that this bill ought to be sent, \nright or wrong. I happen to think that he is exactly right. There is \nalso the implication that if you do not agree with this amendment, you \ndo not care about these things. That is not true, either. We do \nseparate things. There are seven or eight bills now in place.\n  The Senator says we are not going to tie the President's hands and \nthen on the other hand says this is going to force the President to do \nsomething. We need to get it clear.\n  I wanted to make the point that there is no evidence that people do \nnot care about these things. They do, indeed. There is a belief that \nthese issues ought to be separated and we ought to deal with PNTR and \nthen deal with the other issue. We should not think this is going to \ncause the President to do a number of things when we already have in \nplace at least seven laws that are not being adhered to.\n  Those are the things on which I wanted to be clear. I yield to the \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from New Hampshire \nis recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak on the underlying bill as in morning business so as not to take \ntime away from the Byrd amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, yesterday and today we \nheard my distinguished colleague, Senator Thompson, speak eloquently on \nthe whole issue of the Chinese nonproliferation amendment. It is \ninteresting that no one in the Senate wants to give us the opportunity \nto amend the legislation for fear somehow it might mess it up. On the \nother hand, it did not bother the House. They amended HR 4444 and sent \nit over here, and I believe the Senate has a responsibility to do \nlikewise. Frankly, I believe we have that right to offer amendments, \nsuch as the Thompson amendment, whether I agree or disagree with it. I \nbelieve people ought to vote on those amendments based on how they feel \nabout it.\n  This is a very important issue. Permanent meant permanent when I went \nto school. When you say ``permanent normal trade relations with \nChina,'' permanent means permanent. I am going to touch on a number of \nissues, including the subject Senator Thompson has spoken so eloquently \non over the past couple of days, but there are many other issues one \nmight want to stop and have serious reflections on whether or not this \nis really what we want to do.\n  To the leader's credit, he has given us ample opportunity to have \nthese debates. As Senator Thompson just said, one gets the feeling that \nit is a foregone conclusion; that we are wasting our time; we are \nbasically taking the Senate's time for no apparent reason;\n\n[[Page S8390]]\n\nthat it is already in the cards; that everybody is for permanent normal \ntrade relations; we do not have to worry; we are just wasting time.\n  We waste a lot of time around here. I suppose we can say some of the \ngreatest debates of all time have taken place in this Chamber. If it is \na waste of time, so be it, but I believe these comments should be made, \nand I believe they ought to be considered. If people want to vote \nagainst the Thompson amendment, a Smith amendment, or other amendments, \nthey have every right to do so. If they want to say proliferation \nmatters, then they have a right to do so, and they will have a right to \nvote.\n  I applaud Senator Thompson for adding this amendment to the PNTR \ndebate. He has been involved in the committee investigating some of \nthese matters. He is able. He knows about these issues. It would be a \nshame if the Senate did not heed what he has advised them to consider.\n  I believe one of the greatest threats to the U.S. today is China's \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction--nuclear, chemical, and \nbiological, all three--and the means to deploy them; not just produce \nthem, but have the mechanism to deploy them. We do not know whether \nthey have the will or the desire. We do not deal with will and desire. \nWhat we deal with is capability.\n  This is a fact. This is not opinion, as Senator Thompson has pointed \nout. It is a fact that the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction--biological, chemical and nuclear--are occurring today by \nthe Chinese. It is a fact. Despite words to the contrary, China \ncontinues to transfer technology to Pakistan, Iran, North Korea, and \nLibya. One can say: Fine, I do not care; it is more important to sell \nmy agricultural products to China than it is to worry about \nproliferation of nuclear and missile technology.\n  That is fine if that is your opinion, but do not come to the floor \nand say that it is not happening because it is happening. This \ntechnology is being transferred to North Korea, to Libya, to Iran, and \nto Pakistan. It is happening, and that is a fact. One can say: Fine, I \ndon't care about that; we will go ahead and feed the people who are \ndoing it, but it is a fact that this technology is being transferred.\n  The Director of Central Intelligence reported on August 9 that China \nremains a ``key supplier,'' his words, of these technologies, \nparticularly missile or chemical technology transfers. Some of these \ntransfers have raised questions about violations of the Non-\nProliferation Treaty which China signed and contradictions to the \nMissile Technology Control Regime which China promised to abide by, and \nU.S. laws, violations which may require sanctions.\n  China has not joined some of the international nonproliferation \ngroups. The Clinton-Gore administration policy of ``comprehensive \nengagement'' with Beijing seeking to improve bilateral relations has \nfailed. It is time for a tougher approach to advance U.S. \nnonproliferation interests.\n  This is not about coming out here and beating up on a country. The \nfacts are the facts. They threatened Taiwan. They have threatened us if \nwe interfere with them threatening Taiwan. They have actively engaged \nin seeking to control the Long Beach naval shipyard, the Panama Canal, \nand other regions in the Caribbean, and yet we are supposed to stand by \nand ignore this threat, all of it in the name of free trade.\n  Not only are we supposed to ignore it, we are not even supposed to \nhave a vote on it; we are just wasting the Senate's time to point out \nthat this is happening in the world today.\n  Maybe Senators have made up their minds, but I want to speak to the \nAmerican people because, frankly, I am not sure the American people \nhave made up their minds on this issue. Maybe they need to know.\n  I ask you: If you are a parent with a 17- 18- 19-year-old son or \ndaughter--I have one 21 and one 18--whether or not you feel safe in \nproviding this country of China with permanent normal trade relations; \nthat is, giving them the best opportunities we can to trade with them \nand you are not worried about the fact that they are spreading weapons \nof mass destruction all over the world. If you are not, then I think \nyou should sit silently and say to yourself: I am going to get my way; \nthe Senators are going to vote the way I want them to vote. But if you \nare not satisfied, then you ought to let your Senators know because we \nare going to have a vote on this in the very near future.\n  Many in this body are adamantly opposed to amending this trade \nlegislation. They argue that trade and national security concerns are \nnot connected. We should go ahead and trade with China. We open up our \ncountry. We open up the dialog. We open up debate and just ignore all \nthe other issues. Proliferation, human rights abuses, religious \npersecution, and all the other issues I plan to speak about will take \ncare of itself. Don't worry about China. They will not hurt us. Don't \nworry about it. Just keep trading with them and provide more \nassistance.\n  No one is talking about ignoring 1 billion-plus people in the world. \nThat is not what this debate is about. No one proposes to ignore them. \nI do not propose to ignore them. No one proposes to not talk with them \nor not to have relations with them. That is not what we are talking \nabout.\n  What we are talking about is permanently establishing these normal \ntrade relations, which gives them benefits that American companies do \nnot even have and American citizens do not have. So if you want people \nwho are trying to spread weapons of mass destruction all over the \nworld--chemical, biological, and nuclear--to have better situations--\ntheir companies don't have to abide by environmental standards; they \nput people in slave labor in the textile mills, or whatever, for 50 \ncents a day--if that does not bother you, then fine, don't call your \nSenators and tell them. Leave it alone. They are going to vote your \nway. But if it does bother you, you may want to speak up.\n  This amendment, the Thompson amendment, is very relevant. People \nshould be heard on it. Every Senator should be heard on it.\n  The Chinese Government realizes we are willing to abdicate our \nnational security concerns to gain access to their meager markets at \nall costs. You think the Chinese are not watching this debate? You \nthink they don't know what is going on? Here is what they are hearing: \nYou know what. These guys will do anything to get our business. They \nwill do anything to get our business. They will let us go ahead and \nspread weapons of mass destruction all over the world. They don't care \nabout that. The United States will let us move into Panama and threaten \nthe people of Taiwan as long as we can buy their corn and their wheat. \nMan, that is a good deal for us.\n  Boy, I will bet they are laughing in Beijing right now at this \ndebate. But I will tell you what. If it ever comes, God forbid, to a \nconflict in the future, if you have a son or a daughter in that \nconflict, you are not going to be laughing. That is the reality. That \nis the way life is.\n  Ronald Reagan stood firm against the Soviet Union; and it worked. \nWhen President Reagan told Gorbachev to tear the Berlin Wall down, he \ntore it down. We won the Cold War because we stood firm. We did not \nkowtow to the threats and the intimidation to sell products. Some \nwanted us to, but we didn't.\n  Leaders in China believe the actions of this body are a foregone \nconclusion--over and done. The Chinese have acted accordingly by \ncontinuing to proliferate nuclear and missile technology during this \nwhole process. It is still going on, as is evident by the latest report \nfrom the Director of the CIA. They are still doing it. And we are still \ngoing to give them permanent normal trade relations.\n  Sometimes--and I have been on both sides of many issues; I have lost \ndebates and I have won debates--sometimes you have to have the debate. \nYou know what. I want history to judge me on what my position is on \nthis issue. I hope to God that I never ever have to come back to the \nSenate floor and say: See, I told you so.\n  I hope tomorrow the Chinese all become democrats--little ``d''--and \nwe become one big, happy world family between the Chinese and the \nAmericans. I hope that happens.\n  You know what, folks. Are you sure that is going to happen? Do you \nfeel real good about that happening based on what is occurring right \nnow as we speak? Spies spying, stealing our secrets, stealing the whole \narsenal of our\n\n[[Page S8391]]\n\nweapons, and we are about to let the person who stole that--he is going \nto go free very shortly. We are the laughingstock of the world. \nUnbelievable. Yet we sit here--so many of us--without even uttering a \nwhimper and criticize those of us who speak up and talk about it, \ncriticize us for even offering amendments to try to stop it.\n\n  I commend Senator Thompson. I admire him. I respect him. I served \nwith him on that committee when he did this investigation. I respect \nwhat he has done. He is right. History will judge him right. Those of \nus who stood up and spoke out, history will judge us right as well.\n  That is all that matters because when you stand up here, you can \nspeak and you can vote. That is about it on the Senate floor. And \nsometimes you lose. But it doesn't mean you shouldn't be heard. It \ndoesn't mean you are always wrong when you lose. It doesn't mean you \nare always right, either.\n  The recent release of the State Department's annual human rights \nreport states that China's human rights record has worsened, not \nimproved. Are these the actions of a country that we believe are going \nto curb their dismal record of missile and weapons of mass destruction \nproliferation, atrocious human rights violations, or honor their trade \nagreements signed with the United States?\n  Quite frankly, actions speak louder than words--a trite expression. \nChina has not even attempted to clean up its act. As Congress has \ndebated this issue this year, they have not even attempted to clean it \nup because they know what the result will be. They have known all \nalong: Free and open trade, and reduced vigilance. Free trade will \nfacilitate the proliferation of technologies and systems for weapons of \nmass destruction and the means to deploy them. Make no mistake about \nit. Free and open trade, permanent normal trade relations with the \nChinese, will foster the ability of this nation, China, to send weapons \nof mass destruction around the world, and the means to deploy them. We \nshould speak up on the Senate floor about it. Frankly, we should adopt \nthe Thompson amendment. If that means it defeats PNTR, good.\n  The same technologies that create Chinese space threats to the U.S. \nalso enhance Chinese capabilities. We in Congress should not stand by \npassively and watch that happen, either.\n  Voting against the Thompson amendment will send a green light to Red \nChina to continue to destabilize regions already mired in centuries-old \nconflicts. China's proliferation activities have sparked a nuclear arms \nrace on the Indian subcontinent and have assisted Iran's nuclear \nmissile programs, not to mention Libya's desire to become a nuclear \npower--a very comforting thought. The Chinese are helping Libya, Mr. \nQadhafi, to become a nuclear power. I am sure that will comfort \neveryone. Why not? Let's help them. Let's feed them. Let's trade with \nthem. Let's treat them as if they are a nice nation that does not do \nany of this; ignore it all, and let Libya be a nuclear power. That will \nbe nice.\n  It is time that this body takes action. I urge Members to reconsider. \nThose of you who believe that Thompson is wrong, I urge you to \nreconsider that in the face of this debate.\n  It would seem that the main argument against these and every other \namendment that is being offered is that since it was not in the House \nbill, as I said before, then we can't have it in the Senate bill. That, \nfrankly, is an insult to all of us in the Senate. We have an \nobligation, as I said, to amend if we want to.\n  The proponents argue there can be no conference; that is, don't have \nthe House and Senate sit down to work out any deal. That takes too much \ntime. That is too much trouble. We just want to pass what the House \nsent over, even though they amended it.\n  Are the proponents suggesting that the Senate will not ask for any \nmore conferences between now and the end of the session on any bill? \nAre we going to conference appropriations bills?\n\n  We do 13 conferences usually on appropriations bills. But we can't do \na conference on permanent normal trade relations with China? That is \nthe process. The process calls for conferences between the House and \nthe Senates. Even if we conceded that it was too late for a conference, \nthe suggestion that a conference is needed is totally inconsistent with \nour framework of government.\n  When we pass a bill, it does not go to conference. It goes to the \nHouse. We all know that. If the Senate--given the overwhelming support \nfor PNTR in this body--approves some commonsense modifications, then \nthose amendments would eagerly be accepted by the House. It would not \nbe a big deal. If there is an argument over it, fine. We settle the \nargument, as we do in every conference.\n  So if we amend the bill, it goes to the House. It takes no time. The \nclerk engrosses the amendments and sends it over. We can pass an \namended bill at lunchtime, have it passed in the House in time for the \nMembers to be home for dinner; President Clinton wakes up in the \nmorning, has a little breakfast, and signs the bill. Over and done \nwith.\n  What is the big deal? We make things too complicated around here. \nFrankly, they are phony arguments, as if this conference is going to \ntake decades to finish. We are going to finish the conference. The fact \nthat we might add a couple of amendments, whether it is proliferation \nor anything else, to this bill and that it is going to delay the \nconference and somehow mess up PNTR is nonsense, total nonsense.\n  I taught history. I taught civics. I taught how a bill becomes law. I \nhave been on conferences. I am on two right now, the Department of \nDefense and the Water Resources Development Act. I can assure you, \nthose bills are much larger and have many more time-consuming issues \nthan this one. But I might ask you, are those bills any more important \nthan this one? I don't think so. So why, then, are we conferencing them \nand not wanting to conference here?\n  Some have argued that the annual debate over whether to renew this \nwas counterproductive. I would argue that it served as one of the few \nconstraints on Chinese behavior. The fact that we had this debate in \nthe Senate is good. At least China knows there are some of us who are \nconcerned about it.\n  If we yield permanent MFN on PNTR to China, then we forever \nrelinquish one of the few tools we have to foster change in China, \nwhich is our agricultural leverage. Unfortunately, since 1989, when MFN \nwas once again renewed despite the carnage at Tiananmen Square \nwitnessed by the rest of the world, the Chinese came quickly to \nunderstand that the U.S. Government valued its trading relationship \nwith China above all else. It is a fact; that is how they view it.\n  What is of greatest concern is that a majority in Congress, like the \nCEOs of many major companies, appear to be mesmerized by this mythical \nChinese market and are willing to ignore the egregious conduct. China's \nconduct should have, at a minimum, postponed China's admittance in the \nWTO. It is the kind of conduct you cannot ignore. You cannot ignore the \natrocities that are occurring in this country. We don't have to ignore \nit. We can pass amendments to PNTR that highlight those atrocities in \nan effort to leverage the Chinese to stop it. I will get into some of \nthose in a moment.\n  We are familiar with the 1996 campaign finance scandal where millions \nof dollars were delivered from China through conduits in an attempt to \nbuy the White House. It was a big embarrassment for our country. We \nknow that China plundered nuclear secrets from our national labs and \nthat in fact, according to our own intelligence agencies, Chinese \nagents continued to steal that technology in the United States, \nincluding from DOE labs. This is happening. Countless news articles \nhave underscored China's dangerous proliferation of missile technology \nand weapons of mass destruction to rogue regimes all over the world. As \nI said, two Sovremenny-class destroyers equipped with Sunburn missiles, \nthese missiles were specifically designed to defeat our Aegis system \nand our carrier battle groups. That is the specific purpose of this \nclass of destroyers. This represents a great leap forward on the part \nof the Chinese Navy and a serious threat to the 7th fleet and our \nallies in the Pacific. Are we so blinded by trade and the lure of \nprofits that we can't recognize the danger to our strategic vital \ninterests? Are we that blind?\n  In Hong Kong, only recently turned over to the Chinese Government, \nnews reports over the weekend indicated\n\n[[Page S8392]]\n\nthat pollsters are being discouraged from reviewing information which \nshows the declining popularity of Hong Kong's Chief Executive. The \nChinese Government has warned businessmen on Taiwan they cannot be pro-\nindependence if they expect to do business with Beijing. The Chinese \nmilitary on a regular basis truly speaks of invading Taiwan, and the \nproliferation of missiles aimed at Taiwan lends credibility to this \nthreat. While the Clinton administration rewards Beijing with support \nfor MFN and PNTR and has supported military-to-military exchanges with \nthe People's Liberation Army, it has opposed the Taiwan Security \nEnhancement Act which seeks to bolster the capabilities of the degraded \nTaiwanese military and upgrade United States-Taiwan military relations.\n  Most recently and, frankly, most shamefully, the Clinton \nadministration discouraged members of both parties of Congress from \neven meeting with the democratically elected leader of Taiwan. What an \ninsult. I just don't understand it. We are going to give permanent \nnormal trade relations to China, sell them our products and feed them, \nand we are not going to offend them by talking to the leader of Taiwan. \nWe are the world's greatest superpower. The rest of the world, I hope, \nstill views us as the land of liberty and the beacon of freedom. And we \nare afraid to offend China by talking to the leader of Taiwan? What \nmust they think when the administration denies the freedom of assembly, \nthat all Americans enjoy, to a visiting democratically elected \ndignitary? Think about that. What signal are we sending? Are we not \nrewarding the intelligence of the regime in Beijing by snubbing the \nduly elected leader of the Chinese democracy? It is un-American and it \nis inexplicable. It just can't be about money because, in fact, we sell \nmore goods to Taiwan than we do to China.\n  So why are we doing it? If we sell more goods to China than we do to \nthe People's Republic, why are we snubbing the leader of Taiwan? We \nwon't even talk with him. What is it about this administration that \nmakes it so eager to kowtow to Communist leaders?\n  It may not be an accident. I ask unanimous consent that this be \nsubmitted as part of the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                         House of Representatives.\n\n Vote With America's Veterans on Memorial Day--Vote ``No'' on PNTR for \n                                 China\n\n       Dear Colleague: This week the VFW, the Military Order of \n     the Purple Heart and AMVETS, joined the American Legion, and \n     several other veterans organizations in opposition to PNTR \n     for China.\n\n\n            veterans organizations opposed to pntr for china\n\n       Veterans of Foreign Wars, Military Order of the Purple \n     Heart, AMVETS, The American Legion, United States Army \n     Warrant Officers Association, Reserve Officers Association, \n     Naval Reserve, and Fleet Reserve.\n       This vote is scheduled just a few days before Memorial Day, \n     a day which honors our armed forces personnel who have given \n     their lives for our freedom. We should heed the voices of our \n     men and women in uniform and America's veterans who are \n     asking us to vote no on PNTR for China.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Frank Wolf,\n                                               Member of Congress.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. This is from Congressman Frank Wolf, \nwhich is a listing of the organizations opposed to PNTR. It is not an \naccident that most of the veterans organizations are opposed. They are \nthe folks who have sacrificed. The Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, \nNaval Reserve, Fleet Reserve, Amvets, Order of the Purple Hearts; these \nare the guys who paid the price. They are not for PNTR. They have a \nright to talk. They have a right to be heard. They have a right to this \ndebate occurring. They have a right to say to those folks who say let's \nnot debate this, let's just pass it: Sorry, we paid the price; we paid \nthe price to have this debate, and we should have this debate.\n  I am standing up for the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign \nWars and the Military Order of the Purple Heart and others. I am proud \nto do it. They are right. They have been right before. They have been \nright in the past and they are right now.\n  I conclude on six very brief amendments I have already offered but \ndidn't get an opportunity to speak on the other day because of time \nconstraints.\n  There is a commission that is created under this permanent normal \ntrade relations bill to monitor certain levels of Chinese cooperation. \nOne of the amendments I introduced last week was called the POW-MIA \namendment. The purpose is to monitor the level of Chinese cooperation \non the POW-MIA issue and to pass this information on to the American \npeople as part of an annual report the commission will issue. All I am \nasking is that this be part of the commission's report, that we do a \nstudy on this, put it into the report. That is all the amendment is.\n  I have been a longtime advocate of the POW issue. I believe the U.S. \nGovernment should make every effort to account for its missing \nservicemen in our Nation's conflicts, all of them. I am sure my \ncolleagues would agree that we have a solemn obligation to these brave \nmen and women and their families. There are over 10,000 accounted for \nAmerican soldiers, airmen, and marines from the North Korean, Vietnam, \nand cold wars. The fate of many of these Americans, especially from the \nKorean war, could be easily clarified and determined by the People's \nRepublic of China.\n  I have written to the People's Republic of China. They have basically \nignored my letters. They are not willfully coming forth with \ninformation. This is a humanitarian issue. What is wrong with having an \namendment that says the Chinese should cooperate and help us account \nfor our missing? Yet the sponsors of this bill are saying don't vote \nfor the Smith amendment--it is being put around here on all the desks--\ndon't vote for the Smith amendment because it will cause a problem. If \nwe sent it over to the House, the House would have to agree that we \nshould account for our missing POWs, that we ought to ask the Chinese \nto help us. Don't complicate things, don't put that amendment on.\n  I hope the American people are listening. Don't complicate PNTR by \nhaving China help us find our missing. Really. Unbelievable.\n  Let me share a small fraction of information that leads me to believe \nChina knows a lot more than they are telling us. It is precisely this \ntype of information that makes it all the more important for the \nChinese to cooperate. I know some people say that is just a bunch of \nbaloney, the Chinese don't have any information on POWs and MIAs. There \nare numerous declassified CIA intelligence reports from the 1950s that \nindicate Chinese knowledge about American POWs from the Korean war. I \nwill enter all of these in the Record, but let me cite a couple of \nthem.\n  Central Intelligence Agency, May of 1951, subject: American prisoners \nof war in Canton, China. It goes on to describe the sighting. June \n1951, subject: American prisoners of war in South China. It goes on to \ntalk about it. Fifty-two American prisoners were incarcerated in a \nBaptist church in Canton, on and on. A staff member of the state \nsecurity bureau in Seoul on 12 February stated--this is 1951--that all \nAmerican prisoners of war were sent to camps in China, Manchuria, where \nthey were put to hard labor in mines and factories. Documented, and yet \nthey don't give us any answers.\n  Prisoners of war in Communist China is another subject. In 1961, \nanother report; another report in September 1951. American prisoners of \nwar in Communist China; Chinese student had a sighting.\n  Whether these are true or not--I make no representation whether or \nnot they are, but they have been brought to our attention. We know the \nChinese have information as to what happened to those people. Yet, I \nrepeat: We are told not even to amend PNTR because it is going to cause \na couple of minutes of delay over on the House side to conference this \nand get it in there.\n  That is a real fine ``how do you do'' for the people who served our \nNation and are now missing Americans. That is a fine ``how do you do.''\n  I hope Senators who oppose this amendment can look into the eyes of \nthe families of those prisoners and say: I had to do this because I \nwanted China's permanent status so badly, I couldn't care less whether \nI got any information on POWs and MIAs; I am going to be able to look \nin the mirror quite fine.\n  I could go on and on through 100 more. I have them. But I am not \ngoing to do that.\n\n[[Page S8393]]\n\n  Secretary Cohen, to his credit, raised this issue with the Chinese \nduring his visit to China last summer at my request. He raised it very \nforcefully. Once again, the Chinese simply said: We don't have any \ninformation on your POWs. And under their breath, as they walked out of \nthe room, they said: What the heck, we have going to get PNTR anyway. \nWhy bother? It is a foregone conclusion.\n  They make billions and billions of dollars in trade with the United \nStates. Shame on us if we fail to demand that they provide answers on \nour missing servicemen. Shame on us for the sake of a few minutes in a \nconference with the House of Representatives--shame, shame, shame, \nshame.\n  Three-hundred and twenty-thousand Chinese military personnel served \nin Vietnam from 1965 to 1970. It seems to me pretty likely that some of \nthose troops could tell us something about what they saw in Vietnam \nthat may account for 1, 2, 3, 10, or 100 of our missing. We need the \nChinese to tell us what they know.\n  Although I am opposed to permanent normal trade relations with China, \nthis amendment would address these concerns. And at least, if it \npasses, it would be in there so that we would be saying to the Chinese: \nHere is your PNTR, but at least we care about our missing; help us. No. \nIt might take a few minutes in conference. We can't do that.\n  The second amendment I offered deals with Chinese companies.\n  According to the proponents of PNTR, surrendering America's only real \nleverage to Communist China's actions on a myriad of national security \nand human rights issues is being heralded as a win-win scenario for the \nAmerican people and the oppressed Chinese. This not only false, but it \nis detrimental to the American people and U.S. national security.\n  In the zeal to gain potential profits in China, we will be \nsurrendering our most useful leverage tool that can be used to redirect \nChina's atrocious human rights, religious persecution, and increasingly \nbelligerent military. The proponents of PNTR have claimed that the \nChinese citizens will enjoy economic prosperity and eventually \ndemocratic freedoms.\n  Both of these assumptions are uncertain. However, what is certain and \ncan be tangibly observed right now is that the PLA and their \ncompanies--many of them increasingly high-tech in scope--are eagerly \nanticipating the benefits and profits of increased exposure to American \nconsumers in the United States. It is almost ``laugh-out-loud funny'' \nto hear people say those companies in China don't have anything to do \nwith the Government, that they are private companies. Hello. Private \ncompanies in China? Maybe you ought to look at the Lippo flow chart, \nand how all of that works, and find out where it leads. Where does the \ntrail lead to all of these companies? It leads directly to the People's \nLiberation Army. That is where it leads--to the Chinese Communist \nleaders.\n\n  Without a doubt, PNTR will facilitate and improve the People's \nLiberation Army's military capabilities. The profit they will make and \nthe money we are going to provide them in these sales is going to go \ndirectly into the technology spread of weapons of mass destruction and \nimprove their military capabilities, which--may God forbid and I hope \nnot--may be used against us in the future.\n  Experts have concluded that the U.S. trade deficit with China is \nexpected to grow if China wins PNTR. Our deficit will grow. That means \nmore capital for China to modernize its military. That is what it \nmeans. Let's face it. Fine. OK. We sell wheat. Great. Sell corn. Great. \nEnjoy your profits, because let me tell you where it is going: More \ncapital to China to modernize its military.\n  As PLA companies gain increased access to U.S. high-tech, dual-use \ntechnology, they will be able to buy increasingly advanced weapons from \nRussia and other nations. What they can't build they can buy.\n  To illustrate, the PLA navy has been aggressively improving its \nsurface fleet by purchasing, as I said earlier, state-of-the-art \nSovremenny-class destroyers from Russia. The Chinese military's ability \nto purchase these types of weapon platforms poses a direct threat to \nU.S. Navy aircraft carrier battle groups in the Pacific and our friends \nin Taiwan.\n  Is there anyone out there listening with a son or a daughter on a \nmilitary or Navy ship in the South Pacific? You ought to be worried. \nYou ought to be thinking about what your Senators are going to shortly \ndo here. They are going to provide the capability of the Chinese \nmilitary to knock those carriers and those destroyers right out of the \nwater with the most sophisticated technology known to mankind. We are \ngoing to help them do it. We are going to help them do it.\n  If somebody wants to come down here and debate that and tell me that \nis not the case, come on down.\n  Currently the U.S. Navy has no defense--none--against the Sunburn \nmissile which the Sovremenny destroyers of the Chinese military could \nuse against U.S. aircraft carriers with 3,000 or 4,000 people, and some \nhave as many as 6,000 people. It is a vulnerable city out there with \nyour sons and daughters on it, and we are helping them to have the \ncapacity to knock it out.\n  While many have opted to dismiss the national security risks that \nwill accompany China PNTR, our own intelligence apparatus--that is the \nworst part of this for me to deal with. Our own intelligence has \nidentified the threat the United States faces from trade. They have \ntold us. It is not an opinion. They have directly told us trading with \nChina threatens our national security. It threatens our national \nsecurity, and we still ignore it. Not only do we ignore it, but we are \nbeing told not to debate it.\n  According to the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, the PLA has \nestablished ``sixteen character'' policy guiding the mission and \nprofits as companies realize from the sale to U.S. consumers. \nSpecifically, these companies wish to profit from the manufacture of \nordinary consumer goods to pay for the development and production of \nweapons; subsidize and profit from these industries in times when the \nPLA does not need to use their manufacturing infrastructure to produce \ndefense-related weapons and goods; and to seek foreign trade and \ninvestment to modernize its defense infrastructure.\n  According to reports in the South China Post, the PLA has kept 1,346 \ncompanies, dumping thousands that were not profitable for the Chinese \nmilitary.\n  Think about that--dumping companies that were not profitable to their \nown military.\n  These military-owned companies produce and ship a wide variety of \ngoods to the United States for sale to unknowing American consumers.\n  What do we do? We say to them: As long as we can sell our corn and \nour wheat, we don't care. No problem here.\n  Regrettably, these same U.S. consumers were unaware that the People's \nLiberation Army goods they purchased in 1989--do you want to know what \nhappened when American consumers purchased goods in 1989? They helped \nto fund the Chinese Communist Party's brutal crackdown and massacre of \nthe countless pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. That is \nwhere the money went.\n  Currently, President Clinton and his administration have impeded the \nprocess by which the United States monitors and keeps track of PLA \nbusinesses allowing American citizens to fill the PLA coffers \nunchecked. The increased trade embodied in PNTR may only contribute to \na future of more brutal crackdowns by the PLA and Chinese security \nforces funded by unknowing American citizens.\n  I am trying to help American citizens know: Don't do it. Urge your \nSenators to vote against this.\n  I propose at the very least that the Senate consider and accept a \nsimple commonsense amendment, which I am offering, which would allow \nthe Defense Intelligence Agency of the United States and the FBI to \nmonitor and report to Congress on the activities and national security \nassessments and implications where U.S.-consumer-generated money is \nbeing directed within the PLA. That is all my amendment asks.\n\n  I believe the American people would be aghast if they knew that their \nhard-earned money was greasing Communist China's brutal crackdowns, \ndangerous saber-rattling toward the democratic island of Taiwan, and \nincreasing the credibility of the Chinese Communist\n\n[[Page S8394]]\n\nArmy's weapons of mass destruction as top generals in Beijing threaten \nto vaporize cities on the American west coast should the U.S. come to \nthe defense of our democratic friends in Taiwan.\n  That is an eye opener. Not a comforting thought if you live on the \nwest coast.\n  As this Nation's top decisionmakers, I believe the American people \ndeserve to have a Congress that watches out for their best interests. \nSometimes in the short run what one thinks is in the best interests are \nnot the best interests in the long run; it is nice to make a little \nprofit on the sale of food, but look at the long run.\n  I know I am not supposed to be up here taking all this time to talk \nabout this. ``Permanent'' is a long time after this debate--a long, \nlong time. Once the damage is done, recovery is going to be difficult.\n  I have an amendment regarding space and the implication of the \nChinese and what PNTR will do to that. Space is of huge importance. \nWhoever controls the skies in the future, I believe, is the winner in \nthe next war. The U.S. is becoming ever more reliant on space \ncapability, especially in the areas of command and control. While we \nare ahead of any potential rival in exploiting space, we are not \nunchallenged, and our future dominance is by no means assured. We have \nalready observed major national efforts to conceal the Indian and \nPakistan nuclear tests and the North Korean space launch capability \nfrom U.S. space assets. It would be naive to think our adversaries are \nnot considering and capable of a wide range of methods to counter U.S. \nmilitary muscle in general, and our current space advantage, in \nparticular.\n  A 1998 report said, one, China is constructing electronic jammers \nthat can be used against our GPS receivers; two, China's manned space \nprogram will contribute to an improved military space system.\n  We hear the argument in the United States, let's not put weapons in \nspace. That is exactly what the Chinese are doing. That is their goal. \nWe will help them do it. We will help them out. Feed them, trade with \nthem, have them make some money, and help them to move right on and get \ntheir technology into space while we sit back and argue whether or not \nwe should militarize space.\n  I will not go into all of the arguments on that other than to simply \nsay this amendment directs the Congressional Executive Commission on \nthe People's Republic of China, which was created in the House \nlanguage, to monitor--that is all I am asking--a number of important \nissues so that we can report annually on Chinese space capabilities and \nthe activities that affect the development. All we are asking in this \namendment is it be monitored as part of this Commission.\n  Again, same argument; same old story: Don't waste the Senate's time, \ndon't amend it. If we amend that we have to confer with the House--it \nmight take a couple of hours, who knows--to come to a conclusion. No \namendments. We don't want to delay this. But look at the long-term \nimplications.\n  Another amendment that I have offered, No. 4, is in the area of \nenvironment. I serve as the chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee in the Senate. I will briefly explain this. In America, \nif you run a business, there are environmental regulations; strict, \nEPA-regulated laws that you have to abide by. It costs money. I am not \ncomplaining. I think some of the environmental regulations are good. \nSome have been a little bit too harsh. On the whole, the Clean Water \nAct, Safe Drinking Water Act, the Clean Air Act, all the bills and laws \nwe have passed through the years have been effective in cleaning our \nair, lands, and water. I think companies now realize that.\n\n  However, it has cost a lot of money. We have accepted it. Why do we \nwant to allow the Nation of China, which we are now giving permanent \nnormal trade relations to, to not enforce any environmental laws? Why \ndo we want to say to China, you can produce a product, dump it on \nAmerica's market to one-third or one-fourth, or one-tenth of what we \ncan sell it for, and not have to abide by any of the environmental \nregulations?\n  China is part of the world. America is part of the world. The \natmosphere and the oceans and the land are all part of the globe. Why \ndo we let them off the hook? Why do we punish our people and not even \nask that the Chinese be forced to somehow abide with basic \nenvironmental laws? That is why we need this amendment. It simply says \nthat the Commission will monitor the lack of environmental regulations \nand use that as leverage for when we trade with them.\n  Here again, the same old argument: Let's not debate it. Let's not add \nit on. Don't vote for the Smith amendment on environmental regulations \nbecause we may have to go to conference and it might slow the bill \ndown.\n  Why is the environment such a disaster in China today? The answer is \nsimple: Because the people in China don't enjoy political and economic \nfreedom. They don't have any choice. They have no choice but to breathe \nthat filthy air. Per capita emissions in China are 75 percent higher \nthan in Brazil which has an economy of similar size. The difference is, \ncommunism doesn't work. A prosperous economy and healthy environment \ncan go together. A free people wouldn't consent to this type of \nenvironmental disaster. We shouldn't consent to it, either. But we are. \nWe are saying: No problem, don't want to have a conference, don't want \nto waste any time, don't want to take an extra day or two to add an \namendment here that says we will monitor China's lack of environmental \nstandards and regulations. No problem. We don't want to slow it down.\n  That is what my amendment does. If you feel it is fine that China \ncontinues to pollute at a 75-percent higher rate than any other country \nin the world, for the most part you don't care, you want to keep right \non trading with them and keep on making profits, keep on feeding them, \nfine.\n  Former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick once criticized my \ncolleagues across the aisle on the Democrat side for their tendency to \n``blame America first,'' for their belief that there must be something \nwrong with this great Nation that causes the world's ills.\n  Keep that in mind when you consider my amendment. If laws such as the \nClean Air Act and the Clean Water Act are necessary for the \nenvironmental health of this Nation, shouldn't they be beneficial to \nChina as well? Do we really want to make a profit so badly that we are \nwilling to say let those people live in that filth, in that dirty air; \nlet that dirty air move out of China and across the ocean and into \nother parts of the world? Do we really want to make a profit that \nbadly? If we do, shame on us.\n  I have two more amendments.\n  No. 5, one of the most shameful experiences regarding human rights \nviolations in the country of China. I have already heard the argument \nand been told by colleagues, don't offer this amendment because we \ndon't want to delay the process again. I think the picture that I am \nshowing is not pleasant to look at. I don't like to look at it. But the \nAmerican people need to see this picture. My colleagues need to see it. \nThis amendment that I am offering seeks to improve the quality of life \nfor orphans such as this little girl who are currently waiting to be \nadopted out of Chinese orphanages. What a horrible experience, to be a \nchild in a Chinese orphanage.\n  What are we saying? No problem, no problem, that is China. We need to \nsell our wheat, man. We need to sell our corn. We need to make a \nprofit. We will just ignore that. That will take care of itself. Don't \nworry.\n  What would happen if that was an orphanage in the United States? We \nall know what would happen, and justifiably so; it would be shut down. \nThe Government would be in there like hornets, as well they should be.\n  But we are not going to worry about it, it is China, it is not our \ncountry.\n  We can't shut their orphanages down. I am not proposing to do that. \nBut we can monitor it and we can say to the Chinese if PNTR passes, you \nkeep this up and we are not going to trade with you.\n  But, oh no, that might mess up the deal. This amendment would \nencourage the Chinese Government to provide specific data such as the \nsurvival rates of orphans--like this young lady, certify that orphans \nare receiving proper medical and nutritional care, and show that all \nefforts are being made to help\n\n[[Page S8395]]\n\nthe children--particularly those with special needs, who are the ones \nwho are the most punished in these orphanages--to be adopted into \nloving homes by way of Chinese international or U.S. adoption agencies.\n  How can we ignore this? How can anybody in good conscience say: \nSenator Smith, you are right, this is a terrible atrocity but we are \nnot going to put this on the bill because it might delay the bill and \nit might cause a problem with the Chinese and we might not get PNTR \npassed. How can you say that?\n  The conditions of millions of orphans in China are deplorable, just \nlike this. Many Chinese people want--and frankly feel they need--to \nhave a baby boy with the expectations that a son will take care of them \nwhen they are old. A son carries the family name. It is considered \nhonorable to have a son. Not so with a girl. A girl is expected to grow \nup and leave the family with her husband and will not care for her \nparents when they are old. If a Chinese woman bears a baby girl, many \ntimes they will drop her off anonymously at an orphanage, abandon her, \nkill her outright, or throw her into the garbage. Or even worse, as I \nthink Senator Helms is going to talk about shortly--abort the child \nwithout the consent of the mother.\n  It is unbelievable what these little children suffer. Some are lucky \nand they get adopted, but believe me, not many. Americans have adopted \n20,000 Chinese baby girls. Some babies leave China for America every \nmonth. However some of these little girls and baby boys with special \nneeds are left to languish and die in dark rotting rooms in state-run \norphanages in China.\n  How can you ignore it? How can you come down here and say we are \ngoing to ignore all this and give them permanent normal trade \nrelations?\n  One of my constituents, a young couple, came to me a few months ago. \nThey were here on a green card. They said: Senator, if I go back, I am \npregnant, they have told me they are going to abort my child. I want my \nchild.\n  One of the greatest experiences I have ever had was crying with them \nwhen we got their deportation blocked and she had that baby right here \nin America. You cannot ignore this kind of horrible atrocity.\n  Many of these babies were not even fed or given water. Some are \nstarved to death. Why is it so bad? Why is it so harmful, I plead with \nmy colleagues, to say let's ask the Commission to report on this in \nPNTR? It is not so bad. Is that so terrible that maybe the House has to \nagree with me and the conferees have to agree and send it back over for \nanother 5 minutes of debate? Really?\n  This baby girl is Mei-Ming. Do you know what Mei-Ming means in China? \n``No name.'' She was discovered in one of these orphanages in 1995 and, \naccording to the orphanage staff, Mei-Ming became sick. They had no \nmedication for her--none. So they put her in a back room under a pile \nof clothes and they shut the door.\n  This is a picture of her at 10 days without food or water--in an \norphanage. She lived another 4 days just like this and then she died. \nThe orphanage denied that she even existed. They said she was never \nthere, this Chinese Government that allows this, the Government that \nallows this to take place.\n  The only remaining memory of Mei-Ming--let's hold it up here--the \nonly remaining memory of Mei-Ming is this photograph right here. I say \nto my colleagues, in the name of Mei-Ming: Please, agree to this \namendment; agree to this amendment. Let the House take a few minutes to \nadd language in there that the Commission, in the name of Mei-Ming, \ncould report on this kind of atrocity as you reap your profits. Is that \nasking too much?\n\n  Some orphanages in the 1990s had death rates estimated as high as 90 \npercent. I have heard reports that, since the public scrutiny of the \nlast decade, the conditions in the Chinese orphanages have improved. I \nwould like to thank the Chinese Government if that is, indeed, true. \nBut it would be nice to have this as part of the language, to find out.\n  The last amendment and then I will not delay the Senate any longer, \nSenator Bob Smith will no longer hold up the Senate business, you will \nbe able to pass PNTR, ignore all these things, ignore all the \namendments and we will be able to move on and make our profits. Just a \nfew more minutes.\n  Organ harvesting in the People's Republic of China. You think that's \nbad? It is bad. Let me tell you about organ harvesting.\n  In America what organ harvesting means is in America you are willing \nto donate your kidney to your sister or brother or mother or dad; or \nyour heart when you die in an accident you give so someone else may \nhave life. That is organ donors.\n  Organ harvesting in the Peoples Republic of China, sponsored by this \nChinese Government that we are so hell-bent to help--let me tell you \nwhat they do. They take prisoners--we are not talking about murderers \nhere, we are talking about prisoners who have, for the most part \nsometimes minor crimes--and they take their organs so they can place \nthem in the military officers or other high, important people in the \nCommunist hierarchy.\n  In 1997, ABC News televised a very shocking documentary on the \npractice of organ harvesting in Communist China. The documentary--this \nis ABC, now, not Bob Smith talking--depicted prisoners who were \nvideotaped lined up, executed by a bullet to the head--a technique of \nexecution which unlike lethal injection preserves the organs for \nharvesting.\n  Don't tell me it doesn't go on and don't tell me you are going to \nignore it, because it goes on, it happens. Probably right now as we \nspeak. This documentary claimed that prisoners are executed routinely \nand their organs are sold to people willing to pay as much as $30,000 \nfor a kidney. Human rights organizations estimated at the time the ABC \ndocumentary aired, that more than 10,000 kidneys alone--not to mention \nother organs--from Chinese prisoners had been sold, potentially \nbringing in tens of millions of dollars. Guess where those dollars \nwent? To the Chinese military. That is where the money went.\n  The Chinese Government, as it does with most human rights abuses, \ndenies that this happens. My amendment simply requires the commission, \nunder permanent normal trade relations, to monitor this, to try to \nsecure as much information as they can so they can report on it \nannually as we continue the process under PNTR.\n  It is important to keep in mind that China has no rule of law, \ntherefore prisoners are subject to arbitrary arrest and punishment \nwithout any due process. Can you imagine a young man or woman being \narrested, not told what they are charged with, because there is a need \nfor an organ, to be shot in the head, executed with no due process, no \ntrial, and then their organs are donated to somebody who is willing to \npay $30,000 to the Communist Chinese Government.\n  Pretty bad. After the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, when \npeaceful student protesters, including the sons and daughters of the \nCommunist Party's elite, were mowed over by PLA tanks, there are far \nfewer dissidents in China than there were 11 years ago. It is pretty \ntough to speak up against China. Do you want to go to jail for publicly \nspeaking out against the Government? That is the good news. The bad \nnews is you will be shot in the head and your kidneys, your heart, and \nother organs will be donated to somebody in the Chinese military.\n  ABC's report also found that Chinese nationals living on student \nvisas were harvesting these organs to Americans. Hello? That is right, \nharvesting these organs to Americans and other foreigners who have the \nfunds to make a $5,000 deposit, who then travel to China to the PLA, \nPeople's Liberation Army, hospital where they receive the kidney \ntransplant. The kidneys are tissue typed, and the prisoners are also \ntissue typed in order to achieve an ideal match.\n  Can you imagine the horror of being thrown in jail for a political \ncrime--speaking out against the Government, perhaps--and having your \ntissue samples taken, knowing full well what it is for, then to be \nsummarily shot and your kidneys sold perhaps to an American? There is \nno way anyone in the Senate or the House would not recognize the name \nof Harry Wu, the renowned human rights activist and Chinese dissident \nwho was arrested in China, detained, and finally released. Thanks to \nthe work of the Laogai Research Foundation, we are aware of ongoing \nChinese engagement in organ\n\n[[Page S8396]]\n\nharvesting of executed prisoners. I will not go into any more detail on \nthis.\n  In conclusion, we are talking about the most unbelievable and \natrocious violation of human rights. I have just identified six. There \nare dozens more. I did not want to come down and offer 40 amendments. I \nbelieve I made my point. I had about 20 of them identified, and we were \nlooking at another 20 more, but I said I am going to take some of the \nworst. I do not support PNTR, but all I am asking is for those of who \ndo, allow these amendments--the proliferation amendment of Senator \nThompson and the other six amendments I have outlined, and maybe others \nas well. Allow them to pass. What harm does it do? Take a few minutes \nand go to conference for the sake of people such as this little girl or \nsomebody right now who may be fattened up for execution for kidneys.\n  It is time that America wakes up and understands what is happening in \nthe world. I know some are going to say this is Smith again beating on \nChina. It is not a matter of beating on China. These are facts. These \nare not opinions. These are facts. These are documented. Every single \nthing I read to you, every single thing I said to you is documented \nfrom proliferation to organ harvesting. It is documented.\n  The issue before the Senate when we vote on PNTR and on these \namendments is very simply this: I am against PNTR and not going to vote \nfor any of it, which is fine, that is my position. Or I am for PNTR and \nI am willing to pass these amendments to at least monitor these kinds \nof atrocities in an effort to stop them.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from South \nCarolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily laid aside so the Senator from South Carolina \ncan call up four amendments. They are short. I thank the distinguished \nSenator from Tennessee and the distinguished Senator from New York, the \nmanager of the bill. It is not my purpose to debate these amendments \nbut to call them up so they can be printed in the Record. I will not \nconsume over 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the first amendment to H.R. 4444, No. \n4134, has to do with jobs and the trade deficit. It says:\n\n       The Securities and Exchange Commission shall amend its \n     regulations to require the inclusion of the following \n     information and 10-K reports required to be filed with the \n     Commission:\n       (1) The number of employees employed by the reporting \n     entity outside the United States directly, indirectly, or \n     through a joint venture, or other business arrangement, \n     listed by country in which employed.\n       (2) The annual dollar volume of exports of goods \n     manufactured or produced in the United States by the \n     reporting entity to each country to which it exports such \n     goods.\n       (3) The annual dollar volume of imports of goods \n     manufactured or produced outside the United States by the \n     reporting entity from each country from which it imports such \n     goods.\n\n  It is not a burdensome amendment. They report where they are working \nand the number of employees in those countries. I was intrigued by the \nreport from the National Association of Manufacturers that came out \ntoday. I quote from it:\n\n       Of the total $228 billion U.S. merchandise trade deficit so \n     far this year, 77 percent has been in manufacturing.\n\n\n[[Page S8397]]\n\n\n  We are losing our manufacturing capacity, and as Akio Morita, the \nformer head of Sony, said some years back, the world power that loses \nits manufacturing capacity will cease to be a world power.\n  The second amendment has to do with technology and the export of \ntechnology. Our distinguished Ambassador engaged in the conduct of \ntrade, Ambassador Barshefsky, said before the press and the Finance \nCommittee:\n\n       The rules put an absolute end to forced technology \n     transfers.\n\n  This particular amendment is to then monitor that statement:\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The trade deficit with the People's Republic of China \n     for . . . 1999 was approximately $3.2 billion.\n\n  It is estimated that it will be $5 billion this year. So beginning \nwith the first business day of January 2001 and thereafter, ``the \nPresident shall report to the Congress on the balance of trade between \nthe United States and the People's Republic of China in advanced \ntechnology products . . . .''\n\n       If the President reports a trade deficit in favor of the \n     People's Republic of China . . . in excess of $5 billion--\n\n  I want to be realistic; it probably will get to that $5 billion this \nyear--\n\n     the President is authorized and requested to initiate \n     negotiations to obtain additional commitments from the \n     People's Republic of China to reduce or eliminate that \n     imbalance.\n\n  And, of course, report.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an article entitled \n``Raising the Technology Curtain.''\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Financial Times (London), August 16, 2000\n\nRaising the Technology Curtain: China's Burgeoning High-Tech Sector Is \n                        Squeezing Out US Imports\n\n               (By Ernest Hollings and Charles McMillion)\n\n       The US faces sharply worsening deficits with China in the \n     trade of crucial advanced technology products. Moreover, \n     these losses are accelerating and spreading to new products \n     even after China's tariff cuts and official promises \n     regarding the protection of intellectual property and an end \n     to technology transfer requirements.\n       Although high-tech companies are enthusiastically lobbying \n     to end the annual negotiation and review of China's trade \n     status--a vote in the US Senate is expected in September--\n     they could be big losers if US trade law and commercial \n     leverage is permanently forsaken in dealings with China's \n     unelected rulers.\n       Advanced technology products have represented a rare, \n     consistent source of earnings for the US: during the last \n     decade alone the surplus in global sales is Dollars 278bn.\n       During the same period, US trade deficits with China \n     totaled Dollars 342bn, and have worsened sharply each year. \n     That has occurred in spite of numerous agreements with China \n     to end the obligatory transfer of technology from US \n     companies to their Chinese counterparts, to protect \n     intellectual property and to assure regulatory transparency \n     and the ``rule of law''. Failure to implement these \n     agreements goes a long way in explaining why the total US \n     deficit with China has doubled from Dollars 33.8bn in 1995 to \n     Dollars 68.7bn in 1999.\n       The US also lost its technology trade surplus with China in \n     1995 and has suffered deficits in this area every year since \n     then. Last year, US technology exports to China fell by 17 \n     percent while imports soared by 34 percent. The record \n     Dollars 3.2bn technology trade deficit in 1999 may reach \n     Dollars 5bn this year as technology imports now cost twice as \n     much as US falling exports.\n       Quite simply, China is developing its own export driven \n     high-tech industry with US assistance.\n       A recent Department of Commerce study found that \n     transferring important technologies and next-generation \n     scientific research to Chinese companies is required for any \n     access to China's cheap labor force or market. Three of the \n     most critical technology areas are computers, \n     telecommunications and aerospace.\n       The US lost its surplus in computers and components to \n     China in 1990 and now pays seven times as much for imports as \n     it earns from exports.\n       Compaq and other foreign computer brands dominated the \n     Chinese market a decade ago but now are displaced by local \n     companies such as Legend, Tontru and Great Wall that are also \n     beginning to export.\n       After 20 years of ``normal'' trade relations with China, no \n     mobile phones are exported from the US to China. Indeed, US \n     trade with China in mobile phones involves only the payment \n     for rapidly rising imports that now cost Dollars 100m a year.\n       China has total control of its telephone networks, recently \n     abrogating a big contract with Qualcomm. Motorola, Ericsson \n     and Nokia sold 85 percent of China's mobile phone handsets \n     until recently. But last November China's Ministry of \n     Information and Industry imposed import and production quotas \n     on mobile phone producers and substantial support for nine \n     Chinese companies. The MII expects the nine to raise their \n     market share from the current 5 percent to 50 percent within \n     five years.\n       The US now has a large and rapidly growing deficit with \n     China in advanced radar and navigational devices. Nearly half \n     of all US technology exports to China during the 1990s were \n     Boeing aircraft and 59 percent were in aerospace. But \n     according to filings by the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission, Boeing's gross sales to--and in--China have \n     generally fallen since 1993. The first Chinese-made Boeing \n     MD90-30 was certified by the US Federal Aviation \n     Administration last November with Chinese companies providing \n     70 percent local content.\n       More troubling, with the help of Boeing, Airbus and others, \n     China has developed its own increasingly competitive civilian \n     and military aerospace production within 10 massive, state-\n     owned conglomerates and recently announced a moratorium on \n     the import of large passenger jets.\n       China is a valuable US partner on many matters but it is \n     also a significant commercial competitor. Experience in the \n     US with deficits worsening after tariff cuts and other \n     agreements shows this is not the time to abandon strong US \n     trade laws but rather to begin to apply them, fairly but \n     firmly. Since 42 percent of China's worldwide exports go to \n     the US--and their value is equal to China's total net foreign \n     currency earnings--the US certainly has the commercial means \n     to enforce fair trade laws.\n       That is the type of real world engagement that can help to \n     assure both peace and prosperity for the two countries in the \n     future.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the next amendment is the Export-Import \nBank:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, \n     and in addition to any requirements imposed by . . . the \n     Export-Import Bank . . . or the Overseas Private Investment \n     corporation . . . .\n\n  The applicant, in making those applications before those entities, \nwill certify that they have not transferred advanced technology after \nJanuary 1, 2001, to the People's Republic of China, and, two, have not \nmoved any production facilities after January 1, 2001, from the United \nStates to the People's Republic of China.\n  With more time, I can go into the reason for it. I only want to \nsubstantiate what the distinguished Ambassador said.\n  Finally, the fourth amendment has to do with agriculture. I ask \nunanimous consent to print in the Record a schedule of commodity \ngroupings of the trade balances with the People's Republic of China in \nthe years 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               UNITED STATES AGRICULTURAL TRADE BALANCE WITH CHINA\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                      In millions of dollars each year--\n                   HS Community groupings                    ---------------------------------------------------\n                                                                  1996         1997         1998         1999\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal Agricultural Trade Balance............................       $1,512         $937         $615        -$218\n01  Live Animals............................................          6.2          6.1          4.3          3.9\n02  Meat And Edible Meat Offal..............................         64.2         61.8         53.4         58.3\n03  Fish And Crustaceans, Molluscs, Other Aquatic...........       -179.5       -181.2       -228.9       -266.6\n04  Dairy Produce; Birds' Eggs; Honey; Edible...............        -28.2        -16.8        -11.6        -14.8\n05  Products Of Animal Origin, Nesoi........................        -65.2        -77.3        -96.2        -93.7\n06  Live Trees And Other Plants; Bulbs, Roots...............         -6.2         -2.7         -2.5         -3.7\n07  Edible Vegetables And Certain Roots, Tubers.............        -34.5        -36.8        -48.9        -55.8\n08  Edible Fruit And Nuts; Peel Of Citrus Fruit.............        -20.1        -20.5        -13.3        -30.6\n09  Coffee, Tea, Mate And Spices............................        -35.6        -38.8        -45.9        -43.1\n10  Cereals (Wheat, Corn, Rice).............................  ...........         43.4         90.1         39.6\n11  Milling Industry Products; Malt; Starches; Inulin;......         -2.8         -3.3         -1.4         -1.2\n12  Oil Seeds, Oleaginous Fruits; Misc Grain (Soybeans).....        366.7        355.1        224.6        288.1\n13  Lac; Gums; Resins And Other Vegetable Saps..............        -33.3        -49.4        -70.3        -44.9\n14  Vegetable Plaiting Materials And Products...............         -4.4         -1.2          0.2          0.5\n15  Animal Or Vegetable Fats And Oils (Soy Oil).............        106.1        160.1        310.3         67.9\n16  Edible Preparations Of Meat, Fish, Crustaceans..........        -23.6        -24.4        -22.6        -69.9\n\n[[Page S8398]]\n\n \n17  Sugars And Sugars Confectionary.........................         -4.8         -7.9         -8.1         -7.8\n18  Cocoa And Cocoa Preparations............................        -32.4        -42.4        -29.2        -15.2\n19  Preparations Of Cereals, Flour, Starch Or Milk..........        -17.7        -16.1        -20.7        -23.1\n20  Preparations Of Vegetables, Fruit, Nuts.................       -133.6       -146.2       -136.6       -118.9\n21  Miscellaneous Edible Preparations.......................         -9.1        -10.3         -8.4        -17.1\n22  Beverages, Spirits And Vinegar..........................         -6.1         -6.5         -6.4         -6.6\n23  Residues And Waste From Food (Soy Residues).............        131.2        103.4        187.1         25.7\n24  Tobacco And Tobacco Substitutes.........................         -7.4         -4.2         -4.3         -2.7\n41  Raw Hides And Skins.....................................        115.6        134.5        157.4        126.3\n520 Cotton: Not Carded/Combed...............................        728.3        575.9        118.4        -12.3\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census and MBG Information Services.\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/12/senate-section/article/S8398-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8398-S8406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, amongst all articles, you can see, \ngenerally speaking, China has a glut in agriculture. Their problem, of \ncourse, is transportation and distribution. But there is no question \nthat once that problem is solved, that 7800 million farmers can \ncertainly outproduce, if you please, the 3.5 million farmers in the \nUnited States.\n  All of the farm vote is in strong support of PNTR because they think, \nof course, it is going to enhance their agricultural trade. The fact is \nthere are only a few here--the significant ones--and I have picked \nthose out; cereals--wheat, corn, rice--and soybeans. Yes, there is a \nplus balance of trade in the cereals--wheat, corn, and rice--but it has \ngone from 440 million bushels down to 39 million bushels. With \nsoybeans, it has gone from 366 million bushels, in the 4-year period, \ndown to 288 million bushels.\n  So this particular amendment states that beginning on the first day \nof next year:\n\n       [T]he President shall report to the Congress on the balance \n     of trade between the United States and the People's Republic \n     of China in cereals (wheat, corn, and rice) and on the \n     balance of trade between the United States and the People's \n     Republic of China in soybeans for the previous year.\n       If the President reports a trade deficit in favor of the \n     People's Republic of China . . . for cereals or for soybeans, \n     then the President is authorized and requested to initiate \n     negotiations to obtain additional commitments from the \n     People's Republic of China to reduce or eliminate the \n     imbalance.\n       The President shall [also] report to the Congress the \n     results of those negotiations . . . .\n\n  In a line last week, I saw the Prime Minister of Great Britain at the \nconference in New York. He was all stirred and upset with respect to \n1,000 cashmere jobs in the United Kingdom. He was really going to bat \nfor them. The story had his picture politicking, trying to convince the \nUnited States in particular not to take retaliatory action against his \n1,000 cashmere jobs.\n  Here I stand, having lost 38,700 textile jobs in the State of South \nCarolina since NAFTA--over 400,000 nationally. According to the \nNational Association of Manufacturers, we are going out of business. \nAnd I can't get the attention of the White House and I can't get the \nattention of Congress.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from New York for permitting me to \nhave these amendments called up and printed, and then, of course, \nobviously set aside. Let me take my turn in behind the distinguished \nSenator from Tennessee and the Senator from West Virginia. The Byrd \namendment is up, and I think several others. I will take my turn.\n  But I want my colleagues to look at these reasonable, sensible, \npleading kind of amendments so that we can fulfill, as a Congress, \nunder the Constitution, article 1, section 8: The Congress of the \nUnited States shall regulate foreign commerce.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me say again that I think we have made \ngood progress. We have had good debate on both sides of the underlying \nChina PNTR bill, and also on the amendments. But we are reaching the \npoint where we really need to pick that speed up. We need to get an \nagreement on what amendments will be offered, time agreements for them \nto be debated, and votes. And we ought to do it tomorrow. Without that, \ncertainly we will have to file cloture; and I may have to anyway. But I \nthink the fair thing to do is give everybody who is serious a chance to \noffer amendments, have a time for debate on both sides, and then have \nvotes.\n  I am going to try to get that started with this request. And we may \nhave other requests. We are working on both sides of the aisle to \nidentify amendments that really must be moved.\n  I just want to say to one and all that in the end we are going to get \nthe bill to a conclusion. It is going to pass. We have been fair to \neverybody. But it is time now we begin to get to the closing. With a \nlittle help, we can finish this bill Thursday, or Friday, or, if not, \nearly next week. I just have to begin to take action to make that \nhappen so we can consider other issues.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a vote occur on or in relation to the \npending Thompson amendment at 11 a.m. on Wednesday, and the time \nbetween 9:30 and 10:30 be equally divided in the usual form, and that \nno second-degree amendments be in order prior to the vote in relation \nto the amendment.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that a vote occur on the pending Byrd \namendment immediately following the 11 a.m. vote and there be time \nbetween 10:30 and 11 a.m. for closing remarks on that amendment to be \nequally divided in the usual form.\n  Before the Chair rules, I want to say that if any objection is heard \nto this agreement, we will attempt to set two votes tomorrow on these \nor other issues beginning at 11 a.m.\n  Therefore, there will be no further votes this evening, and votes \nwill occur at 11 a.m.--hopefully including the Thompson amendment in \nthose 11 o'clock votes. But if there is a problem with that, then we \nwill ask consent to put in place two of the other amendments.\n  With that, I ask the Chair to put the request to the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have a \ngreat deal of respect for Senator Thompson and the issues he has \nraised. The problem is these issues fit more closely on the Export \nAdministration Act. They have not been considered in committee. I think \nthey represent a very real problem in this bill. I think it is \nimportant that if we are going to debate issues such as this, they be \nnot just fully debated but they be subject to amendment.\n  On that basis, let me yield. Senator Enzi wants to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, there isn't \njust an amendment that is being put on. It is an entire bill--33 \npages--of very important information that has been changed each and \nevery time we have seen a copy. My staff and I on the International \nTrade Subcommittee of the Finance Committee have been working on these \nissues for a long time. We have tried to take this moving target and \nworked on some amendments that could be put on it. It would need to be \nextensively amended to keep both national security and industry moving \nforward in the United States.\n  On that basis, I have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe there will be another consent \nrequest\n\n[[Page S8399]]\n\npropounded later so that we can have two--the Byrd amendment and \nanother--considered and voted on at 11 o'clock.\n  I note that the Senator from Tennessee will want to respond to the \nobjection just heard.\n  Let me say on that issue that I have been supportive of the Export \nAdministration Act and tried several different ways earlier to get that \nto the floor. There were problems raised by a number of our committee \nchairmen. We were not able to get that done. I think the Thompson \namendment is a very serious and legitimate amendment that has been \nconsidered, and it should be voted on. I think we should go ahead and \nvote on it tomorrow. I think people know where we are. We ought to go \nahead and have that vote and move on.\n  I also must say I am trying to get these votes done so that the \nlargest number of Senators can be accommodated and be here for the \nvote.\n  I also want to say I don't know exactly what the Senator from \nTennessee is going to do. But I predict right now that if we don't get \nthis agreement to vote on the Thompson amendment tomorrow, we are going \nto vote on it at some point--I believe probably on or in relation to \nthis bill.\n  I don't think it serves anybody's purpose to try to put this off or \nto object to it. In fact, it may make the situation worse, not better. \nI think we are ready to go. I think everybody knows how they are going \nto vote. I think while it may be a close vote, everybody pretty much is \nreconciled to getting it done tomorrow.\n  I regret that there was objection. I hope we can still find a way to \nget a vote on it in the next sequence that we will try to put together.\n\n  By the way, on the Export Administration Act, I believe we are \nprepared to try to find a way to consider that because I think we need \nto act on it, making sure that we consider national security interests. \nThat, obviously, is an underlying factor on the Export Administration \nAct. I have no doubt that the Senator from Wyoming wouldn't be for it \nif he had any doubts in that area himself because he has worked so \nextensively on it.\n  The same thing applies on this amendment. Senator Thompson is trying \nto raise a general concern about national security interests. The \nChinese are not complying with the nuclear proliferation regimes to \nwhich they have committed.\n  What worries me is we are going to have this vote, we are going to \npass this bill, and in a month or 6 months we may have a lot of \nexplaining to do. I spent 2 months trying to get a way to have this \nissue considered separately. That is the way it should have been \nconsidered. But it will be considered, I predict, before we get out of \nhere.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. First, I thank the majority leader and agree with him \ncompletely on the proposition that we will have a vote on this issue. \nIt might not be the exact wording of this bill, but we will have a vote \non this issue.\n  We introduced this bill last May because, as chairman of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, the committee that has jurisdiction on \nproliferation matters under the statute, we receive briefings, as a few \ncommittees do, on proliferation developments, for example. In that \nposition, we have had numerous hearings and have been told there is a \nlongstanding and growing threat because of proliferation of China, \nprimarily, and Russia and North Korea.\n  We haven't had a lot of attention with regard to that, or a whole lot \nof interest, until we started discussing it in the context of trade. \nTrade interests everybody because there is money to be made. That is \nunderstandable. I am all for it.\n  We introduced this bill because we were told by our intelligence \npeople that there was a threat to this country. I can't think of \nanything more serious that we could possibly be dealing with than a \nnuclear, biological, or chemical threat, and the fact that rogue \nnations are rapidly developing the capability to hit this country with \nall three of those. Let that sink in for a little bit.\n  All the time that we spend around here in budget and other votes that \ntake up most of our time, trying to divide up the money, we are being \ntold by our experts--whether it is the Rumsfeld Commission, the Deutch \nCommission, the Cox Commission, or the biennial intelligence \nassessment--there is a present danger and it is growing, and the \nChinese are actually increasing their activities as far as missiles are \nconcerned.\n\n  That is why we introduced the bill. People raise various objections. \nLast night some were saying the report that we want to have produced is \ntoo extensive and we might catch up some innocent Chinese companies \nthat might later prove to be innocent when we accuse them of \nproliferating. Frankly, I am willing to take that risk.\n  We tried to get a separate vote. We said: Let's not put it on PNTR. \nOur amendment shouldn't be considered a trade measure. The bipartisan \nbill shouldn't be considered a trade bill. It is a proliferation bill. \nSo let's discuss it in the context of our overall relationship with \nChina, but don't force us to put it on the China trade bill.\n  No, you wouldn't have that. We couldn't have that. You wouldn't give \nme a separate vote on that because it might complicate things.\n  So I said OK, if you don't do that, I will put it on the bill. So I \nput it on bill. Senator Torricelli and I did. And now it is an \namendment to the China trade bill.\n  They said: My goodness, we wish you wouldn't have done that. We wish \nit was a freestanding bill now that we see you are serious, but we \ncan't possibly vote on it as an amendment to the trade bill because it \nmight complicate the trade bill.\n  So we have gone through all of that.\n  Frankly, we were told from the minority side that our Democratic \ncolleagues were the ones who sunk--a few over there were the ones who \nhad a problem with this. We have discussed this since May and there \nhave been some changes. Anybody who wanted to discuss this bill--and \nthere were staffers from many, many Senators, Democrats and \nRepublicans, who have worked with Senator Torricelli and my staff--\nanyone who wanted some input certainly had the opportunity to do that \nfor months. There have been changes because we have been trying to \naccommodate the concerns: It is too tough; we didn't give the President \nenough discretion. We made changes because of that. We have been \ndiscussing this since May, with all of the foot-dragging that we have \nseen along the way.\n  We had a good debate last night, and we had a good debate today. We \ndebated over sanctions and whether or not they were effective--things \nthat we ought to be debating. Good things, good substance, important \nsubjects that we ought to be debating, and raising the issue now. When \nwe are obviously getting ready to engage in this new trade relationship \nwith China, what better time to address the fact that they are the \nworld's worst in selling weapons of mass destruction to these rogue \nnations.\n  We claim we need a national defense system because of the threat of \nthese rogue nations. How can we talk to the Chinese Government without \naddressing it? That is what the debate has been about. It has been \ngood.\n  Now it is time for a vote. I have been around here a few years. I \ndon't remember another occasion where a colleague has objected to a \nvote under these circumstances. My Democratic colleagues have raised no \nobjection, but my two good friends on this side of the aisle raise \nobjections. I am sad to say that it appears the real objection all \ncomes down to one of jurisdiction. My friend from Wyoming apparently \nbelieves this should be a part of his bill if it is going to be \nanything, the Export Administration Act; and that this should be \npresumably under the purview of the Banking Committee if it is going to \nbe considered. He will have the opportunity to correct me if I am \nwrong, but I thought that is what I heard.\n  I think that is a sad set of circumstances, if after all of that we \nfinally flush out the real reasons for the objection to even having a \nvote. Oppose it if you will, but the objection to even having a vote is \nbecause somebody got somebody else's jurisdiction.\n  All my colleagues should know that according to the Parliamentarian, \nthis bill, if it were referred to committee, would be referred to the \nForeign Relations Committee.\n  Let's look at some of the hearings we have had in the Governmental \nAffairs\n\n[[Page S8400]]\n\nCommittee. The Banking Committee has some jurisdiction with regard to \nexport administration. The Governmental Affairs Committee has some \njurisdiction with regard to proliferation. I can't believe we are even \ntalking about this, but here goes. It is like kids squabbling in the \nback of the schoolbus.\n  If the issue is that nobody has paid any attention to this and nobody \nhas had any hearings, this committee of jurisdiction, the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, in May of 2000, had a full committee hearing on \nexport control implementation issues with respect to high-performance \ncomputers.\n  In April of 2000: Full committee hearing on the Wassenaar Arrangement \nand the future of the multilateral export controls;\n  February of 2000: Subcommittee on Internet Security, Proliferation \nand Federal Services hearing on National Intelligence Estimate on the \nBallistic Missile Threat to the United States;\n  June of 1999: Full committee hearing on Interagency Inspector \nGeneral's Report on the Export-Control Process for Dual-Use and \nMunitions List Commodities;\n  June of 1999: Full committee hearing on Dual-Use and Munitions List \nExport Control Processes and Implementation at the Department of \nEnergy;\n  May of 1999: Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation \nand Federal Services--that is Senator Cochran's subcommittee. He had a \nhearing on the Report of the House Select Committee on U.S. National \nSecurity and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People's Republic of \nChina.\n  Senator Cochran's subcommittee, of course, has been in this area, the \nproliferation area, the missile area, the whole problem with China and \nRussia in particular, the problem with the rogue nations--Senator \nCochran has been dealing with this for years and has put out published \nreports. The last one was within the last couple of weeks, for anybody \nwho is interested.\n  September of 1998: Subcommittee on International Security, \nProliferation and Federal Services hearing on GAO Reports on High \nPerformance Computers;\n  June of 1998: Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation \nand Federal Services hearing on the Adequacy of Commerce Department \nSatellite Export Controls;\n  March of 1998: Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation \nand Federal Services hearing on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and \nNuclear Proliferation;\n  October of 1997: Subcommittee on International Security, \nProliferation and Federal Services hearing on North Korean Missile \nProliferation--again Senator Cochran's subcommittee. Once again, in \nSeptember of 1997, his Subcommittee on International Security \nProliferation and Federal Services had a hearing on Missile \nProliferation in the Information Age.\n  In June of 1997, his subcommittee had a hearing on Proliferation and \nU.S. Export Controls.\n  In May of 1997, his subcommittee had a hearing on National Missile \nDefense and the ABM Treaty. Senator Cochran, of course, is chairman of \nthis subcommittee. He is the leader on the national missile defense \nissue and has been for some time. Of course, again, it is directly \nrelevant because the reason we are claiming we need a national missile \ndefense is the very issue our amendment brings up.\n  April of 1997: Subcommittee on International Security--again, Senator \nCochran's subcommittee--hearing on Chinese Proliferation--Part II;\n  April of 1997: His subcommittee, Chinese Proliferation hearing, Part \nI.\n  So, for the uninformed, we have various committees here with various \njurisdictions. Sometimes jurisdiction overlaps, where more than one \ncommittee has jurisdiction in the subject area. This is one of those \ncases.\n  Over the past 4 years, the Governmental Affairs Committee alone has \nheld 15 hearings on proliferation; over 30 hearings have been held by \nmy committee, the Armed Services Committee, and in the Foreign \nRelations Committee. Furthermore, this legislation has the full support \nof the chairman of jurisdiction, Senator Helms, chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee. The issue of proliferation, of course, has had a \nfull, full consideration for some time now.\n\n  So we will have an opportunity to discuss this further, including \nfurther tonight. I don't know if anyone wants to speak to this. I will \ngive them the opportunity, give my colleague from Wyoming an \nopportunity to further address it. But it is a sad situation, when our \ncountry faces this kind of threat, that we cannot even get a vote on an \namendment that would address that threat.\n  Vote it down if you must. Oppose it if you will. But the very idea of \nus not having a vote because it has not been considered enough by the \nright committee or that it is more properly a part of somebody else's \nbill instead of our bill? Surely it has not come to that.\n  I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his \ncomments. I want to assure him I am not doing this on a jurisdictional \nbasis. I am a little incensed at the implication of that accusation, \nand, in the objection I raised, I did not mention anything about \njurisdiction. In the speech I gave yesterday, I didn't mention anything \nabout jurisdiction. I mentioned the concerns about items that are in \nthis bill and there are amendments that would need to be made to this \nbill. I am sure, if it went through the normal process--and one of the \nthings I am learning about here is process. I learned a lot about \nprocess as I did the bill my colleague mentioned, the Export \nAdministration Act. I took it through a process. I got a 20-0 vote on \nit. I brought it to the floor. I learned a little bit about process \nthat sometimes, even when you think you have the right to bring it up \non the floor, people can object after that point and you can have it \ntaken down. But it went through a process there. That process has \nundoubtedly been effectively stopped for this year. I have not been \nwhining about that.\n  But I did learn a lot of things through that process because it \ninvolved going into a number of the reports the Senator from Tennessee \nhas mentioned. I did not just go through the public part of those \nreports. I took the time to go over to the Intelligence Committee and \nhave the special briefings and read the documents from a number of the \nthings that have been cited, and particularly the Cox report. So I \nlearned a lot of things about these areas of problems.\n  There are some problems there, and they need to be solved, but they \nought to be solved through the regular process so we do not wind up \nwith some things we are going to be embarrassed by, or believe are \nlacking, or have pointed out to us later that just a little bit more \ndeliberation would have changed.\n  We have been suggesting changes. We can make some amendments. It is \nvery difficult to go into another person's bill and make extensive \namendments, but we have mentioned the need for some pretty extensive \namendments. I am certain if this would have gone through the process of \ngoing through the Foreign Relations Committee first--not just hearings. \nHearings are valuable. They build some basis for building things. I \nknow these extensive hearings that have been done are where this bill \ncame from. But it goes through another step in that process called a \nmarkup. That is where very detailed amendments are made to a bill by \npeople who have a wide knowledge of the items that are included. It is \nkind of a free-for-all, putting on amendments. A number of them do not \nmake it and should not make it. But it gives a more thorough review \nthan if one of us drafts a bill, or two of us get together and draft a \nbill, and then occasionally talk to other people and occasionally \nlisten to part of their criticisms but discard large parts of their \ncriticism.\n  I know this bill was originally drafted in May and we have been \nregistering objections to things that are in it since May. They have \nbeen tweaked a little bit, and part of the process is, if you are not \ngoing to make the changes, then you have to go through this process \nhere on the floor, which the Senate designs to be an extremely \nexcruciating one--as I learned on my EAA bill.\n  It is a part of the process. There needs to be additional work on it. \nThere needs to be additional amendments.\n\n[[Page S8401]]\n\n  As I mentioned yesterday, if one listens to the debate, it sounds as \nif we can solve the export-import imbalance by doing PNTR, and that is \nnot going to happen. The way that imbalance gets solved is if U.S. \nfolks stop buying Chinese products or we get extensive sales over \nthere. Extensive sales over there probably is not going to happen \nbecause the people over there on an average wage do not make much, so \nthey cannot buy much. We do have a hope of getting in the door with \nsome of the bigger equipment items. To listen to the debate, everything \nwill be solved by PNTR, and that is not going to happen.\n  I have to congratulate the Senator from Tennessee for the title he \nput on the bill. I noticed when he expanded the bill to include a \ncouple of other countries in light of our objection, that it was aimed \nsolely at China and they are not the only proliferators. A couple of \nothers were stuck in there. But the title was not changed because the \ntitle is so great. One of the things I learned a long time ago in \nlegislation is one does not vote on a bill because of a good title. One \nvotes on it because it is good through and through.\n  Those have been the reasons for my objections. I am sorry if the \nSenator from Tennessee put in all of that work. This delays his plan \nfor a vote, but it does not stop it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, first, I am sorry if I drew the wrong \nconclusion this might be jurisdictional. When the Senator mentioned \nthis would be a better part of the Export Administration Act \nlegislation, which happens to be his legislation, and it was not \nreferred to the right committee, I just thought that might be \njurisdictional. That is where I got that idea. If he resents that \nimplication, I am sorry, but that is the source of that idea.\n  I think back to a time not too long ago when the Senator from Wyoming \nand the Senator from Texas worked long and hard on a bill called the \nExport Administration Act. Several of us who are committee chairmen had \nproblems with that because of some of the same things we are talking \nabout.\n  In my view, and I think my colleagues' view, it liberalized our \nexport rules at a time when we should have been tightening them up. The \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, the chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee, the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, and myself as chairman of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, looked at this and said that it had some major problems. The \nstatement was made by the sponsors of the bill that they would not \nbring it up, as I recall, without our signing off on it, and we never \nsigned off on it.\n  If the hangup here is the fact my colleagues have not gotten a vote \non their Export Administration Act, I suggest they offer it as an \namendment to my amendment. Let's have a second-degree amendment. If \nthat is the problem, then let's have a vote on both of them.\n  Let's be frank with each other. The Senator's opposition is the same \nopposition and arguments in many respects that we have heard from four \nother amendments that have been considered. The only difference is we \nhave had votes on those four other amendments. The Senator was not over \nhere complaining that we had not had sufficient process, I guess, with \nregard to the Wellstone amendment or the Byrd amendment or the Hollings \namendment or the Helms amendment. The process was OK with regard to \nthose, but now we have an amendment, the only amendment that deals with \na direct threat to this Nation, and we are talking about process.\n\n  One of the big complaints of the opponents of the Thompson-Torricelli \namendment has been that we have changed it so much they hardly know \nwhat is going on here anymore. The reason we changed it is we kept \nresponding to the complaints. Staffs met numerous times. Everybody knew \nthese meetings were going on. It was not an open forum for somebody to \ncome down and lay down a bunch of requirements if they did not get what \nthey wanted the first day, leave, and not show up again. It was an \nopen, rolling forum with various staff members.\n  I sat in on an occasion or two. It was very open since May that we \nwere talking about trying to come together because we all appreciate \nthe proliferation problem and we need to do something.\n  While we are talking about trade with China, we ought to be talking \nwith them also about the fact they are endangering this country by \narming these rogue nations, and we tried to work it out. Some Members \nobjected. We had mandatory sanctions and they said we did not give the \nPresident enough discretion. We gave him more discretion. Some people \nclaimed we are singling out the Chinese; it will make them angry; and \nit will be counterproductive. We broadened it. Some people claimed we \nwere giving Congress too much authority; that any Member of Congress \ncould come in and have a vote to override a Presidential decision in \nthis regard, so we raised the requirement to 20 Members. There have to \nbe 20 Members who have to have that concern. We made all of these \nchanges.\n  Now I understand the complaint is that we did not change it enough, \nor is it the process? Is that process? Is that a process issue? There \nare still problems with it. Everybody who has spoken against this bill \nhas raised problems with it, but none of them have raised an objection \nto taking a vote.\n  I just received the latest in a series of fliers I have been graced \nwith over the last several days; this one from an industry coalition. \nThe first thing we got today was a report from the president of the \nChamber of Commerce who came out against our bill. Somebody told me \nthey were at a Chamber of Commerce meeting not long ago and they \nmentioned my bill, and most of the people there broke into applause. I \nought to be careful talking about the Chamber of Commerce.\n  This is coming from the president of the Chamber of Commerce, who I \ndo not think speaks for the average business person in America on this \nissue. Let's get that straight. First of all, he complains that it is \nlimited to one country--obviously, he has not read the bill--that if we \ndo this, it will effectively kill the bill, not that we have this \nserious problem and we should do something about it, but effectively it \nwill kill the bill.\n  Then he says he is getting ready to leave for a tour of Asia and \ngoing to wind up in Beijing, but before he leaves, he delivers his last \nsalvo against my amendment, purporting to speak for all the members, I \nsuppose, of the Chamber of Commerce. I hope while he is in Beijing, he \nwill ask them to quit selling weapons of mass destruction to our \nenemies. I hope that is on his agenda while he is talking about his \ntrade.\n  The latest has been a sheet put out by the High-Tech Industry \nCoalition on China, the American Electronics Association, Business \nSoftware Alliance, Computer Systems Policy Project, Computer Technology \nIndustry Association, Consumer Electronics Association, Electronic \nIndustry Alliance, Information Technology Industry Council, National \nVenture Capital Association, Semiconductor Industry Association, \nSemiconductor Equipment Materials International, Software and \nInformation Industry Association, Telecommunications Industry \nAssociation, and United States Information Technology Offices.\n  All of them have joined together to put out this opposition sheet to \nthis bill. Some people have been so crass as to imply that maybe it was \nthis feverish lobbying that is going on from exporters that might have \nsomething to do with the opposition to this bill.\n  But I have the greatest respect, from what I know, about this entire \ngroup here. Our high-tech industry has done phenomenally well. They are \ncreative. They have contributed mightily to our economy. They want to \nexport; I understand that. They want to make more money; I understand \nthat. God bless them. More power to them. But I do not see any \nassociation listed on here that has any responsibility for the \nprotection of this country.\n  We can vote on human rights, religious freedom, and all the other \nimportant things, but the only thing that poses a danger to this \ncountry we can't get a vote on because we didn't go through the \n``process'' because it needs to go back to a committee. The chairman of \nthat committee gave the most eloquent statement that has been given on \nbehalf of my amendment. One Senator just said he wants to send it to a \ncommittee that does not want it, whose chairman, Senator Helms, says\n\n[[Page S8402]]\n\nwe do not need it; that we have had enough hearings; that we know what \nthe problem is.\n  Give me a break. There will be a vote on this issue. But let's get \nback to the latest salvo, which may or may not have something to do \nwith what we are dealing with tonight. The information they are putting \nout says this undercuts China PNTR; that it will undo PNTR; that it \nwill return us to inflammatory annual votes on China.\n  I have been involved in a few annual votes on China. I do not \nremember the flames, but be that as it may, this will not kill PNTR. \nThe die is cast on PNTR. The House has passed PNTR. We are going to \npass PNTR. The only issue is whether or not in doing so, we raise the \nissue with our new ``strategic trading partners,'' the issue that we \nare making this world a more dangerous one.\n  The House passed it by a 40-vote margin. Are you here to tell me that \nif we passed it and added on a nuclear proliferation component, that it \nwould make it more difficult for the House to pass it again? It would \nhave to go back to the House if we add anything new. So for the folks \nwho might be listening and watching, the deal is, they say: You can't \npass the Thompson amendment because it is different from what the House \npassed. If you make any changes, it has to go back to the House for \nanother vote, and they might not vote for it again. That is the bottom-\nline argument for those who oppose this amendment.\n  My first response is, so what. If we have a serious national security \nproblem and issue that is paramount, it begs the question: Is this \nproblem serious enough for us to address? I can join issue on that \nargument and respect my friends who disagree with it. But don't tell me \nthat even though it may be that serious, we can't add it on over here \nbecause the House might have to take another vote. That is an insult to \nthis body. Since when did we stop being the world's greatest \ndeliberative body and become a rubber stamp for the House of \nRepresentatives?\n  The practical answer to this particular accusation is that it will \nnot kill PNTR. Before the sun sets, they will have it back over there, \nand they will revote on it. Nobody is going to go into an election just \nhaving cast a vote for it and then a vote against it, and the vote \nagainst it has a proliferation tag-on. That is going to make it more \ndifficult to vote for it? Give me a break.\n\n  Please, be serious in your arguments, I say to my friends. There are \nsome serious arguments to be had around here. I had a good discussion \nwith the Senator from Kansas today on sanctions in general--a good \ndiscussion. But don't tell me, as a Senator, I have to rubber stamp \nsomething, when the House of Representatives identifies problems--\nreligious persecution, slave labor, Radio Free Asia--and then it comes \nover here, and we can't identify the only thing that is a threat to \nthis Nation.\n  All those things are things that ought to be identified. They were \ncorrect in doing that. But to tell us that we have to rubber stamp it, \nthat the benefits of PNTR to this country are so great, and so obvious, \nand so overwhelming, and so clear, that we are afraid to risk letting \nthe House, with a 40-vote margin, with a nuclear proliferation add-on, \nhave another shot at it because it is going to cost us a few more \ndays--while the Chinese Government, as we speak, is trying to undercut \nthe WTO agreement. That is just kind of a sideline. We see this in the \npaper now. We understand. They are trying to mess with Taiwan coming \ninto the WTO later. They are trying to renege on some of the agreements \nthat they have previously made in their bilateral agreement with us. \nThey must not have any respect at all for us right now. We have danced \nto their tune now for a few years. We do not make any big fuss about \nthe theft of nuclear secrets. We say: Boys will be boys. Everybody does \nthat.\n  The Chinese military puts money into our campaigns, and they say, \nagain: Maybe the higher-ups didn't know about it. We give them WTO. We \ngive them a veto on a national missile defense system. That is the \nreason the President put off that decision, because the Russians and \nthe Chinese objected to it.\n  We send delegations over there asking them to please stop their \nproliferation activities. They give us the back of their hand and say: \nWe're going to continue our activities as long as you continue with the \nmissile defense system and your friendship with Taiwan.\n  Then the President meets Jiang Zemin at the Waldorf in New York on \nFriday. According to the New York Times, the President once again \nraised the issue of what they were doing with regard to Pakistan. They \nhave outfitted Pakistan. They took a nation, a small nation with no \nnuclear capability, and have outfitted Pakistan, soup to nuts. Not only \ndo they have missiles, M-11 missiles, goodness knows what else, but \nthey now have, apparently, missile plants where they can make their \nown.\n  The Chinese are probably ready to sign a new agreement now not to \nship any more in there. They do not need to. They have equipped \nPakistan so they can do it themselves. They have made that place a \ntinderbox. So the President rightfully brings this up, according to the \nNew York Times.\n  Jiang Zemin's response, apparently, according to the New York Times, \nwas to smile, wish the President well on his pending retirement, and to \nthank him for his assistance in getting them into the WTO. They must \nnot have much respect for us anymore.\n  And we are over here saying we are afraid to give our House of \nRepresentatives another vote on this, regardless of the merits of the \ncase. It would kill, as they say, the PNTR. They are incorrect. They \nare wrong. They are brilliant people. They have contributed mightily to \nour economy. I am talking about all these high-tech people. I want to \nhelp them in every way I can. I am with them on most things. But they \ndo not know this subject. We are supposed to know it. We are given \naccess to classified information. We are paid the big bucks to spend \nlong hours poring over these documents that the intelligence people \nbring to us--and the Rumsfeld Commission and the Deutch Commission and \nthe Cox Commission, and all the rest. It is not their responsibility.\n  But they are papering this town. I said today, you can't stir the \nlobbyists with a stick. Everybody is petrified of this amendment. I \nthink the reason is because they fear it will irritate the Chinese and \nmaybe cause us some problems, trade retaliation, or something like \nthat. But the Chinese want this mightily. They want this PNTR badly. \nThey have a $69 billion trade surplus with us.\n  There will be no killing of that golden goose. They are not foolish \npeople.\n  They also said that it is ineffective because it is a unilateral \nsanction. Unilateral sanctions rarely achieve the intended results of \nthe targeted country, but they penalize American companies, workers, \nand investments. Let me tell you when an American company or worker \nwould be penalized. If we catch the Chinese entities selling missile \nparts or the ability to make bombs, nuclear weapons, to Libya, let's \nsay, then we are going to cut off military and dual use that can be \nused for military purposes, we are going to cut those sales off. So if \nyou make those items, you are going to be affected. The President has \nthe discretion--let me add that--and it does not happen automatically.\n  The process, under our bill, is that we have a report. Our \nintelligence agencies give a report. It identifies these entities, \ncompanies that are doing these things. Then our President has the \ndiscretion or he has to make a determination, depending on the \ncategory, but it is within his power to exercise the appropriate \nremedy. We are not talking about cutting off sales of wheat or food or \nshoes--we would not be selling them shoes--or any other commodity. We \nare talking about munitions and dual-use items.\n  If you are affected by that, you will be affected by this bill. I \ndon't know about the company president, but I will bet you, if you said \nto the average worker--that is 2 percent, by the way, of our dual use \nand munitions; our entire trade with China is 2 percent of our exports; \n2 percent is what we are so afraid of here--if you said to the average \nworker: we are going to impose these restrictions or these sanctions on \nChina for a year to try to get them to clean up their act because we \nhave caught these Chinese companies doing these things. Obviously, it \nis going to make it a more dangerous place for\n\n[[Page S8403]]\n\nyour kids if we keep on down this road. We need to get their attention. \nIt is going to mean some loss of sales for the company you work for. Do \nyou think we ought to do it?\n  I don't think there is any question about that. I have more faith and \nconfidence in the American worker and the American farmer.\n  They talk about farmers being concerned. Well, agriculture is not \ndirectly affected, but what if the Chinese get mad at us and decide to \ncut off some of our agricultural exports?\n  I think my Tennessee farmers are willing to take that chance. If that \nis the price we have to pay to sell corn, then that is too high a price \nto pay. I am like all these other agriculture Senators here. I have \nagriculture. I have farmers. They are concerned about these issues. But \nthey are also very patriotic. When you come right down to it, there are \na lot of organizations running around using the names of various \npeople, but when you come right down to the workers of America and the \nfarmers of America, you are not cutting off exports of goods across the \nspectrum, and you are certainly not cutting off agricultural exports. \nThey would see through that. They would say, well, yes, there is an \nindirect possibility, if I am in a certain area, that there might be \nsome ramifications down the road. But if that possibility were to \noccur, if that is what I have to do to help make this place a little \nbit safer and get their attention because, goodness knows, if we can't \nget their attention while we are about to give them this trade bill, we \nare never going to get their attention, I think they would be willing \nto go along with that.\n\n  What else do they say? It duplicates current U.S. proliferation laws. \nThe last point was the unilateral sanction. Of course, this was drafted \nby some lobbyists downtown. We all know that that works for these \nfolks. All the points are always the same. They hand them around town. \nEverybody uses them. Do you really think their real concern is that \nthese sanctions won't work or that we are duplicating current laws? Is \nthat what is stirring up all this activity, that we are being \ninefficient in some way? Please.\n  Unilateral sanctions don't work. Well, some don't. And there is a \nchance these might not. But there is a good chance they might.\n  Why is the Chinese Government so upset? If you read the French \nnewspapers--and I assure you, they are translated in English before I \nread them--or the Chinese, you will see that there is tremendous \nconsternation over the Thompson-Torricelli amendment. Why do you think \nthat is, if we are only duplicating what is already on the books and \nunilateral sanctions don't work? Do you think they are concerned \nbecause we are about to do something that doesn't work, or do you think \nthey are going to maybe think twice before they continue their activity \nbecause they know that at least the Congress is serious about this? \nThey are going to continue to get highlighted and embarrassed in the \nworld community for making this a more dangerous world. I think it is \nthe latter.\n  I have had Mr. Berger, the President's national security adviser, \ntell me that on occasions when they have actually used or threatened \nunilateral action in times past, that it has had an effect. I don't \nthink they have done it nearly enough, and we have strong disagreements \nabout that. That is part of the problem we have had. They have gone \naround the barn to apologize for 95 percent of what the Chinese \nGovernment has done here. That is the reason we are here tonight. But \nwhen they have on occasion done this, he has told me it has had effect.\n  You can't have it both ways. Unilateral sanctions sometimes do work. \nWe are not talking about these blanket agricultural sanctions or going \ntowards some particular country. We are going to the supplier and \nsaying that we are going to cut off the relevant goods and items if we \ncontinue to catch you doing these things that you are flaunting \ndisrespectfully.\n  Unilateral sanctions undercut PNTR, will kill PNTR, and duplicates \ncurrent laws. To a certain extent that is right. There are laws on the \nbooks now that require sanctions, just as we are proposing, or close to \nit.\n  So you say, Thompson, why are you doing this? Well, because we have \nother provisions, such as a little more congressional oversight, such \nas a more extensive report where it would make it more difficult for a \nPresident to game the system and do what President Clinton said he had \nto do on occasion--that is, to fudge the facts--because if he made a \nfinding against a company that he didn't want to move against for \ndiplomatic reasons, the law would require him to do that. He didn't \nwant to do that.\n  What this does is make it more transparent. The President can still \ndo it, but he has to give Congress a reason why he is not imposing \nsanctions on an entity that has been found to have been selling weapons \nof mass destruction.\n  While it duplicates current law in many respects, which is a point in \nour favor because we are not doing something new and dangerous and \nonerous and burdensome, the President should already be doing some of \nthese things. What we are doing is saying, yes, that, but also in \naddition to that, a mechanism whereby we can have some enforcement to \nit, have some congressional oversight and highlight the fact that the \nPresident has some options here.\n  The President can address the capital markets issue. One of the \nthings the opponents have complained about is the fact that our bill \nactually gives the President the authority to say to a particular \nChinese company or, for that matter, a Russian or a North Korean \ncompany, but the big players right now, such as Petro China or the \nChinese companies, raising billions of dollars in our stock markets, in \nthe New York Stock Exchange, going back, in some cases, to enhance the \nChinese military--and in many cases, according to the Deutch Commission \nand according to the Cox committee, these are proliferators of weapons \nof mass destruction, raising all this money in our capital markets. How \nmany people know about that? You know, we don't want to close our \ncapital markets. We can't do that without thought. But, for goodness' \nsake, that is a privilege; that is not a right for them to come in and \nraise money from our people who do not know who they are dealing with--\nraise billions of dollars, while at the same time selling stuff that is \nmaking the world more dangerous for that investor's kids. Do we really \nwant to keep financing these people that way? I don't think so.\n\n  According to this latest leaflet, it is inconsistent with current \nnonproliferation regimes. It would be activated by a hair-trigger \nmechanism--a hair-trigger mechanism--based on credible information. \nWell, that just comes from a misunderstanding of the law and what the \nbill says.\n  What the bill says is that if you get credible information that they \nare doing these things, you have to put it in the report. That is the \nonly thing it activates. That is the hair-trigger they are talking \nabout. If our intelligence people find that you are selling these \nthings to these rogue nations, you have to put it in the report.\n  Now, the President takes a look at that. If it has to do with a \ncountry, he has total discretion as to what to do. If it has to do with \na company, an entity, say a state-owned company in China, as so many of \nthem are, the President has to make a determination that in fact the \ncredible evidence is true. Then the President has an option to have a \nwaiver. Even after he makes a determination that the allegations are \ntrue, he still has a waiver that he can exercise before all of this \nhappens, before any sanctions are levied. That is the hair-trigger they \nare talking about.\n  They are just misinforming folks. I think it comes from a lack of \nunderstanding of what is in the bill. Somebody downtown, hopefully, \nwill read it more carefully. You can have a lot of complaints about it, \nand so be it, but let's not misrepresent what it does. There is no \nhair-trigger, there is no automatic sanction, no automatic anything; it \nis discretionary with the President. If it is credible evidence, it \ngoes into the report.\n  Some people say: Well, it might be credible evidence, but it might \nnot be proof beyond a reasonable doubt; we might catch up some innocent \nChinese company. We are not trying a criminal lawsuit here. We are \ntalking about information to go into a report for the\n\n[[Page S8404]]\n\nAmerican people to see and for Congress to see. If it turns out we are \nincorrect, we can correct that when the time comes.\n  I don't want to be callous about this just because they are Chinese \ncompanies and maybe had proliferation problems in the past. I don't \nwant to accuse anybody of anything of which they are not guilty. My \nguess is, if our intelligence community takes the time and effort and \nconcludes that this information is credible enough to go into the \nreport, they probably did it. Considering the fact that they are the \nworld's leading proliferators of weapons of mass destruction, somebody \nover there is doing it--not proof beyond a reasonable doubt, but, then \nagain, we are not putting anybody in the penitentiary. We are trying to \nprotect the American people.\n\n       Contains automatic overbroad sanctions. The bill mandates \n     automatic U.S. sanctions against any private or governmental \n     entity, even for acquisition of commodity level products.\n\n  Somebody is not paying attention, are they? ``Mandates automatic U.S. \nsanctions.'' It is just not true. The bill doesn't do that. There is \nnothing automatic about it. It is within the power and determination of \nthe President if he chooses to do that. Then he has a waiver if he \nwants to use that. It is a modest step.\n\n  I think this report is the most important part of this legislation. \nIt is a more extensive report. We get these halfway jobs, summaries, \nbut this is a more extensive report. The President will know we are \ngetting it, and we will have a dialog about who is on it and why and to \nthe extent the President is doing anything about it. The report \nrequires the President to tell us what he intends to do about it. He \ndoesn't have to do anything. But there is the pressure, I would think, \nfor most Presidents, to want to have a pretty good reason if they \ndidn't choose to do anything about it once that credible evidence was \nthere.\n  So, my friends who may be listening to this, there is an awful lot of \nfalse information going around. I know these people didn't intend to do \nthis. They are in the business of advancing technology. They are the \nworld's best, and God bless them. But they are not in this business. \nSomebody downtown is doing this who wants to win too badly. There are \nno automatic sanctions.\n\n       Underwent an inadequate public process.\n\n  Well, we are getting back to my friends from Wyoming and Texas.\n\n       Deserves a full vetting by the Senate, not the hurried and \n     nonpublic process that has characterized the consideration of \n     this bill. Subsequent drafts and basic proposals have not \n     addressed the bill's deficiencies. Should not be substituted \n     for critical processes, such as public hearings.\n\n  In other words, we haven't had any public hearings. Somebody is not \npaying attention. I just read off two pages of the public hearings that \nwe have had on this general subject matter. Nobody paid attention then \nbecause trade was not involved; it was only national security. Now they \nare shocked to find out that all this time we have been having public \nhearings, and we have been getting the reports from bipartisan \ncommissions all this time warning us, warning Congress, warning the \nAmerican citizens, that it is becoming more dangerous. Countries such \nas North Korea will have the capability of hitting us within 5 years of \ntheir decision to do so. We know that some time ago they decided to \nhave that capability. We know that some years ago they already decided \nto have the capability.\n  Shortly after we got the report, they fired a two-stage rocket over \nthe country of Japan--another one of our allies. I guess, now that I \nthink about it, that delivered more than one message, didn't it? It \ntold the good old USA: Yes, we have that capability that you are \ndebating over there. This is what we have. It shocked our intelligence \ncommunity and surprised us. The Rumsfeld Commission told us they feared \nthat was the case, and then they showed us the capability. Of course, \nJapan is one of our closest allies. So I suppose that accentuated it.\n  So we have gone through all that. How much does it take? And now my \nfriends from Texas and Wyoming say we can't have a vote. We can't even \nhave a vote on an issue that poses a direct threat to the security of \nthis Nation because it hasn't sufficiently gone through the process.\n  Then we had the Deutch Commission telling us some of the same things. \nAnd then the Cox Commission told us that, relevant to our export laws, \nthe Chinese Government was using our technology and the supercomputers \nwe were sending to them to perfect and enhance their nuclear \ncapability.\n  Was it Lenin who said, ``The U.S. would sell the rope with which to \nhang itself''?\n  That is what that issue is all about. That is serious business. That \nopens another whole question about our export laws. That is why we have \nthis debate and concern. My friends from Wyoming and Texas and I \ndisagreed. So did these other Senators from various other committees, \nchairmen of these committees. It wasn't just me. At this particular \ntime, while we can't put the genie back in the bottle, we can't keep \ntechnology from circling the globe eventually. But there is great \ndispute among experts as to what people can get their hands on and how \nlong it will take other countries to get their hands on our technology. \nWe shouldn't ship it out willy-nilly and let the Commerce Department \ndecide. Some of our friends would let the Commerce Department decide \nwhether or not these things ought to be sent around. The Commerce \nDepartment is in the business of business. Again, more power to them. \nBut this is not a commerce issue. This is a national security issue. We \nshould not be blind to our commercial interests, and we should not be \nunreasonable about that.\n\n  But there are more important things than whether we should be \nloosening our export laws and saying, well, if we can make it, \neverybody is going to have it eventually. So we might as well give it \nto them tomorrow. Even if we are able to slow them down somewhat, this \nis a dangerous world. I am looking to the day we find out the direct \nproof that one of these rogue nations has what we shipped to China and \nChina just passed it along. I assume it has already happened, but we \ndon't have any proof of that. That is what all of this is really about, \nin my opinion.\n  It goes on to say here--this is the last objection--it provides for \ndangerous procedures and fast-track procedures would inevitably lead to \nhighly politicized annual votes.\n  Our bill, of course, says the President's actions have been, frankly, \ninadequate. I think some of President Clinton's actions have been \ntotally inadequate with regard to some of these decisions.\n  Our intelligence has proof that the Chinese Government sent M-11 \nmissiles to Pakistan, and the response from the State Department is: \nNo. We are not going to impose sanctions there because we cannot prove \nit. We only see canisters on the ground that we know were put there by \nthe Chinese on Pakistani docks. But we do not really know that there \nare missiles inside the canisters.\n  What can you say to that?\n  Then there was another occasion where we proved that they sent ring \nmagnets to the Pakistanis, and those go to enhance the uranium \nenrichment process that goes into these nuclear weapons. The answer \nthere was that we did not have sufficient proof that those high up \nenough in the Chinese Government really signed off on that.\n  We are requiring courtroom-level proof. Instead of requiring them to \nbear the burden, you had better prove to us that you didn't do it \nbecause it sure looks as if you did it. No, we are putting the burden \non ourselves to have a level of proof that no one can ever reach \nbecause our diplomats and some of our administration officials are \nliving in another world. They think if they can continue to dialog with \nthe leadership of the Communist Chinese Government that things are \ngoing to magically fall into place.\n  In this bill we said if we run into one of those situations Congress \nought to have some input. Congress hasn't done enough in this regard. \nWe can't sit back and say that we can't mess with the President's \nauthority. We have done that too much--go into wars, and everything \nelse--partially under the jurisdiction of this body. And we really do \nnot want to take the political heat for making the decisions.\n  Our tendency, it seems to me nowadays, is to sit back and let the \nPresident do the tough stuff and make those decisions. We will \ncriticize him every once in a while. We don't want to be involved. That \nexposes us to criticism if we make a mistake.\n\n[[Page S8405]]\n\n  If you look at the national political polls, national security and \nforeign affairs ranks, only 2 percent of the people in this country \nwould put it at the top of their area of concern--2 percent. That \ndoesn't get the attention of a lot of people around here. So we sit \nback. We have done it too long. The problem is that this administration \nhas sat back right along with us. The result of that has been a more \ndangerous world.\n  We signal to our allies that we claim we need a national missile \ndefense system because of rogue nations. But the signal is we are \nreally not that worried about it; Trade is more important. We are \nsignaling to the leadership of the Chinese Government that we may or \nmay not be concerned about this. We may issue a sanction in one out of \nevery five times we catch it.\n  That is still going to lead to a more dangerous world because they \nsomewhere along the line are going to misjudge how far we will go in \nresponse to some action.\n  What we need to do is have something right now that is measured, that \nis reasonable, and that is not extreme to put in place to simply send a \nsignal that while we are approving the trade bill, that trade is not \nthe only thing that is important to us and that we are going to blow \nthe whistle on them and maybe cut off some of their dual-use \ntechnology. Yes--perhaps even with hardship on one or more of those \nconferences. That is the signal we need to send.\n  So we fashioned the provision in this bill that said if 20 Senators \nagree that we should disagree with the President's action--that we \nthink it is clear and he is doing nothing, or that we think it is not \nso clear and he is doing something and we believe we should become \ninvolved--if 20 of us think that way, we can become involved in a \nvariety of actions. He can veto that. Or it would take a tremendously \nunusual situation for us to actually get anything done, quite frankly. \nEverybody knows that. I know that. Overriding the President's veto on \nsomething like that would be tremendous. It would have to be an \negregious situation. That is the kind of thing we need to signal to the \nworld that we are willing to do, at least in an egregious situation.\n  They say that it is dangerous. I say to them that we already have 60 \nlaws on the books that in one form or another have this general \nprocedure I just described. They are making it look as if it is a \ndangerous, unusual thing. We have at least 60 laws on the books which \nprovide for expedited procedure in one way or another.\n  We will have an opportunity to discuss this further. As I say, I \nparticularly want to get a vote on this. I guess I am having a hard \ntime absorbing what has happened here. After all of this debate, all of \nthis discussion, this clearly would not cause any harm and would not \ncause any problem, except some people think it would complicate the \ntrade bill. It is not as if we are about to do something dangerous or \nwe are about to do something where some of our critics say the law is \nalready on the books and you don't need to do it. That is the level of \ndanger we are talking about.\n  Our colleagues are keeping us from even having a vote. And we let all \nof these other things go? The Senator from Wyoming and the Senator from \nTexas say we haven't gone through the process enough. It has nothing to \ndo with the fact that we couldn't get our Export Administration Act up \nfor a vote, or chose not to. Frankly, I don't know which. If that is \nthe case, that is the case. I take them at their word. I don't want to \naccuse them of having jurisdictional concerns. I say when it is in the \nwrong committee and it is on the wrong bill, to me that is a \njurisdictional problem. If I am using the wrong word, I apologize. But \nthe very idea that in light of this threat and in light of the good \ndebate that we have had--and we have pros and cons on the Republican \nside and pros and cons on the Democratic side as to whether or not we \nought to pass this. We have had a good debate. We are talking about one \nof the few things that really matter around here.\n\n  Our first obligation in the preamble of our Constitution is the \nreason for the creation of this Government, the kind of matters we are \nconsidering here tonight.\n  To come down to this, after all these hearings and all this time, \nwith no one denying the nature of the threat, saying it needs to be \nsent to the committee of jurisdiction--they know by now, of course, \nthat the Parliamentarian has said it would go to the Foreign Relations \nCommittee; it would not even go to their Banking Committee. The only \nproblem they have with that is Senator Helms is chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee and says he doesn't want that to happen. He wants \nmy amendment to pass.\n  I don't understand. It has nothing to do with anything other than \nsome jurisdiction. We need to go back and massage this a little bit \nmore, send it back to a committee that doesn't want it. Maybe we can \noffer some amendments. Why not offer it now, I ask my friends from \nWyoming and Texas. If you want to offer amendments, offer them now. I \ndon't understand the nature of the problem. I cannot for the life of me \nunderstand the nature of the problem.\n  But we will have a chance, perhaps, to explore that further.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we have heard a lot on the Senate floor \nthe last few days about the advantages to the United States of granting \nPNTR to China. In commercial terms, PNTR means that American farmers, \nranchers, workers, manufacturers, and service providers can take \nadvantage of what will be an unprecedented liberalization in the \nworld's most populous market, and an economy that has grown almost ten \npercent annually for two decades. PNTR and China's accession to the WTO \nmeans that China will enter the global trade community, liberalize and \nopen up much of its economy, and be subject to the operating rules and \nregulations of the WTO.\n  I would like to focus my remarks on the effect of PNTR on one very \nimportant sector of America's economy--agriculture.\n  We are in the third year of a severe agricultural crisis in the \nUnited States. Our farmers are suffering terribly from drought, record \nlow prices, increased costs, and now damage due to unprecedented forest \nfires this summer. At the same time, the American food market is a \nmature one with almost no room for growth for our farmers and ranchers. \nTherefore, one part of the solution to the agricultural crisis lies in \nincreasing the quantity and value of our agricultural exports, bringing \nthe products of the world's most efficient farming to the people of the \nworld.\n  That means ensuring that our producers are not besieged by dumped \nimports. That means our producers need time to adjust to surges in \nimports. That means working to dismantle the European Union's system of \nmassive trade-distorting export subsidies to its farmers. That means \nreversing the trends that have reduced our agricultural exports by ten \nbillion dollars since 1996. And that means bringing China into the WTO \nand granting them PNTR so that our farmers and ranchers can benefit \nfrom the significant liberalization commitments that China is making.\n  Let me review those changes that China has agreed to make as part of \nits WTO accession commitments. And remember, if we don't grant China \nPNTR, our competitors can take advantage of this new liberalization in \nChina, while our ranchers and farmers will lose out.\n  First, the US-China Agricultural Cooperation Agreement. Although this \nwas technically separate from China's negotiations for WTO accession, \nit was an integral part of our bilateral negotiations. This \nagricultural agreement provides three specific benefits to American \nproducers.\n  On wheat, China agreed to end a thirty year ban on Pacific Northwest \nwheat. This ban was based on spurious sanitary and phyto-sanitary \nstandards. We completed the first shipment of Pacific Northwest wheat \nto China earlier this year.\n  On beef, under the agricultural agreement, China will accept meat and \npoultry from all USDA Food Safety Inspection Service-approved plants, \nhonoring USDA inspection certificates.\n  On citrus, the agreement provided for a series of measures that would \napprove citrus for export to China. Chinese officials made several \ninspection trips to the United States, and the first shipment occurred \nearlier this year.\n  Second, China made significant trade concessions on bulk commodities. \nFor\n\n[[Page S8406]]\n\nexample, China agreed to a tariff rate quota on wheat of 7.3 million \nmetric tons for its first year of membership in the WTO, increasing to \n9.6 million tons in 2004. This contrasts with recent annual import of \nwheat at around two million tons. Ten percent of the tariff rate quota \nwill be allocated to non-state trading entities. If state trading \nentities do not use their portion of the quota, the unused part will be \ngiven to non-state entities. Tariff rate quotas at similarly high \nlevels will also be in effect for other commodities such as corn, \ncotton, rice, and soybean oil.\n  Third, tariffs themselves will be cut significantly. By January, \n2004, the overall average for agricultural products of importance to \nthe United States will drop from 31 percent to 14 percent. Beef goes \ndown from 45 percent to 12 percent for frozen and to 25 percent for \nfresh. Pork drops from 20 percent to 12 percent. Poultry goes from 20 \npercent to 10 percent.\n  Fourth, foreigners will have the right to distribute imported \nproducts without going through a state-trading enterprise or middleman.\n  Fifth, China has committed not to use export subsidies for \nagricultural products. They have also committed to cap, and then \nreduce, trade-distorting domestic subsidies.\n  Sixth, there are several provisions that most people think apply only \nto manufactured goods, but, in fact, apply to agriculture as well. The \nUnited States can continue to use our non-market economy methodology in \nanti-dumping cases for 15 years, an important protection against dumped \nChinese products. Also, for the next 12 years, we can take safeguard \nmeasures against specific products from China that cause, or threaten \nto cause, disruption in our market.\n  In short, once we grant China PNTR and the WTO accession process \nconcludes, our farmers, ranchers, and food processors can begin to take \nadvantage of vast new opportunities in China. Americans need to move \naggressively to follow-up on these Chinese commitments. And we in the \nCongress and in the Executive Branch must put resources into monitoring \nclosely Chinese compliance with those commitments.\n  Following my own advice about follow up, I will lead a delegation of \nMontana ranchers, farmers, and business people to China in December. I \nencourage all my Congressional colleagues to do likewise. I have also \nsent a letter to Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji insisting that China fully \ncomply with its agriculture commitments.\n  We have a lot to do in the Congress this year and next to help our \nfarm economy. Approving PNTR is one important part of that agenda.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to explain why I oppose \nall amendments offered to H.R. 4444, a bill to establish Permanent \nNormal Trade Relations (PNTR) with China.\n  Much is at stake here; the effects of this vote may be felt for years \nto come. I am convinced that amendments at this stage create a \nprocedural problem that could derail passage of this important bill. \nAdopting any amendments would mean sending this bill to conference, \nwhere it could become mired in wrangling over differences of language \nand content. It is clear to me that we do not have time remaining in \nthis Congress to resolve a bicameral conflict over this bill. We can \nallow nothing to interfere with what may be this Congress's most \nimportant decision concerning China.\n  I am convinced we must not let our focus be drawn away from the real \npoint in question: pure and simple, this vote is about deciding whether \nor not the United States wishes to join with the world community in \nhaving normal trade relations with China, and whether we are prepared \nto conduct our dealings with China according to the terms and \nconditions established by that community under the World Trade \nOrganization framework (WTO).\n  This vote is about protecting U.S. interests in an increasingly \ncompetitive global marketplace and about ensuring that American \nworkers, managers, entrepreneurs, and investors do not miss out on the \nopportunities that are bound to grow as China brings itself further \ninto the modern world.\n  I do not think we further U.S. interests by undermining this nation's \nability to function effectively in the world's most important \nmultinational trade organization, or by cutting Americans off from the \nfull benefits of WTO membership.\n  This is what will happen if we pass a bill that does not conform to \nWTO requirements, or if we are forced to send the bill to conference, \nand fail to pass a bill, at all. I believe it is in America's best \ninterests that this body pass a clean, focused bill establishing \npermanent normal trade relations with China that is the same as the \nHouse bill and does not need conferencing.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 10 a.m. \non Wednesday there be 60 minutes for closing remarks for two \namendments, with the following Senators in control of time: Senator \nRoth, 15 minutes; Senator Moynihan, 15 minutes; Senator Byrd, 15 \nminutes, Senator Bob Smith, 15 minutes. I further ask consent that the \nvote on the pending Byrd amendment occur immediately at 11 a.m., to be \nfollowed by a vote in relation to division 6 of Senator Smith's \namendment, No. 4129.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/12/senate-section/article/S8398-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8398-S8406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, amongst all articles, you can see, \ngenerally speaking, China has a glut in agriculture. Their problem, of \ncourse, is transportation and distribution. But there is no question \nthat once that problem is solved, that 7800 million farmers can \ncertainly outproduce, if you please, the 3.5 million farmers in the \nUnited States.\n  All of the farm vote is in strong support of PNTR because they think, \nof course, it is going to enhance their agricultural trade. The fact is \nthere are only a few here--the significant ones--and I have picked \nthose out; cereals--wheat, corn, rice--and soybeans. Yes, there is a \nplus balance of trade in the cereals--wheat, corn, and rice--but it has \ngone from 440 million bushels down to 39 million bushels. With \nsoybeans, it has gone from 366 million bushels, in the 4-year period, \ndown to 288 million bushels.\n  So this particular amendment states that beginning on the first day \nof next year:\n\n       [T]he President shall report to the Congress on the balance \n     of trade between the United States and the People's Republic \n     of China in cereals (wheat, corn, and rice) and on the \n     balance of trade between the United States and the People's \n     Republic of China in soybeans for the previous year.\n       If the President reports a trade deficit in favor of the \n     People's Republic of China . . . for cereals or for soybeans, \n     then the President is authorized and requested to initiate \n     negotiations to obtain additional commitments from the \n     People's Republic of China to reduce or eliminate the \n     imbalance.\n       The President shall [also] report to the Congress the \n     results of those negotiations . . . .\n\n  In a line last week, I saw the Prime Minister of Great Britain at the \nconference in New York. He was all stirred and upset with respect to \n1,000 cashmere jobs in the United Kingdom. He was really going to bat \nfor them. The story had his picture politicking, trying to convince the \nUnited States in particular not to take retaliatory action against his \n1,000 cashmere jobs.\n  Here I stand, having lost 38,700 textile jobs in the State of South \nCarolina since NAFTA--over 400,000 nationally. According to the \nNational Association of Manufacturers, we are going out of business. \nAnd I can't get the attention of the White House and I can't get the \nattention of Congress.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from New York for permitting me to \nhave these amendments called up and printed, and then, of course, \nobviously set aside. Let me take my turn in behind the distinguished \nSenator from Tennessee and the Senator from West Virginia. The Byrd \namendment is up, and I think several others. I will take my turn.\n  But I want my colleagues to look at these reasonable, sensible, \npleading kind of amendments so that we can fulfill, as a Congress, \nunder the Constitution, article 1, section 8: The Congress of the \nUnited States shall regulate foreign commerce.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me say again that I think we have made \ngood progress. We have had good debate on both sides of the underlying \nChina PNTR bill, and also on the amendments. But we are reaching the \npoint where we really need to pick that speed up. We need to get an \nagreement on what amendments will be offered, time agreements for them \nto be debated, and votes. And we ought to do it tomorrow. Without that, \ncertainly we will have to file cloture; and I may have to anyway. But I \nthink the fair thing to do is give everybody who is serious a chance to \noffer amendments, have a time for debate on both sides, and then have \nvotes.\n  I am going to try to get that started with this request. And we may \nhave other requests. We are working on both sides of the aisle to \nidentify amendments that really must be moved.\n  I just want to say to one and all that in the end we are going to get \nthe bill to a conclusion. It is going to pass. We have been fair to \neverybody. But it is time now we begin to get to the closing. With a \nlittle help, we can finish this bill Thursday, or Friday, or, if not, \nearly next week. I just have to begin to take action to make that \nhappen so we can consider other issues.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a vote occur on or in relation to the \npending Thompson amendment at 11 a.m. on Wednesday, and the time \nbetween 9:30 and 10:30 be equally divided in the usual form, and that \nno second-degree amendments be in order prior to the vote in relation \nto the amendment.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that a vote occur on the pending Byrd \namendment immediately following the 11 a.m. vote and there be time \nbetween 10:30 and 11 a.m. for closing remarks on that amendment to be \nequally divided in the usual form.\n  Before the Chair rules, I want to say that if any objection is heard \nto this agreement, we will attempt to set two votes tomorrow on these \nor other issues beginning at 11 a.m.\n  Therefore, there will be no further votes this evening, and votes \nwill occur at 11 a.m.--hopefully including the Thompson amendment in \nthose 11 o'clock votes. But if there is a problem with that, then we \nwill ask consent to put in place two of the other amendments.\n  With that, I ask the Chair to put the request to the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have a \ngreat deal of respect for Senator Thompson and the issues he has \nraised. The problem is these issues fit more closely on the Export \nAdministration Act. They have not been considered in committee. I think \nthey represent a very real problem in this bill. I think it is \nimportant that if we are going to debate issues such as this, they be \nnot just fully debated but they be subject to amendment.\n  On that basis, let me yield. Senator Enzi wants to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, there isn't \njust an amendment that is being put on. It is an entire bill--33 \npages--of very important information that has been changed each and \nevery time we have seen a copy. My staff and I on the International \nTrade Subcommittee of the Finance Committee have been working on these \nissues for a long time. We have tried to take this moving target and \nworked on some amendments that could be put on it. It would need to be \nextensively amended to keep both national security and industry moving \nforward in the United States.\n  On that basis, I have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe there will be another consent \nrequest\n\n[[Page S8399]]\n\npropounded later so that we can have two--the Byrd amendment and \nanother--considered and voted on at 11 o'clock.\n  I note that the Senator from Tennessee will want to respond to the \nobjection just heard.\n  Let me say on that issue that I have been supportive of the Export \nAdministration Act and tried several different ways earlier to get that \nto the floor. There were problems raised by a number of our committee \nchairmen. We were not able to get that done. I think the Thompson \namendment is a very serious and legitimate amendment that has been \nconsidered, and it should be voted on. I think we should go ahead and \nvote on it tomorrow. I think people know where we are. We ought to go \nahead and have that vote and move on.\n  I also must say I am trying to get these votes done so that the \nlargest number of Senators can be accommodated and be here for the \nvote.\n  I also want to say I don't know exactly what the Senator from \nTennessee is going to do. But I predict right now that if we don't get \nthis agreement to vote on the Thompson amendment tomorrow, we are going \nto vote on it at some point--I believe probably on or in relation to \nthis bill.\n  I don't think it serves anybody's purpose to try to put this off or \nto object to it. In fact, it may make the situation worse, not better. \nI think we are ready to go. I think everybody knows how they are going \nto vote. I think while it may be a close vote, everybody pretty much is \nreconciled to getting it done tomorrow.\n  I regret that there was objection. I hope we can still find a way to \nget a vote on it in the next sequence that we will try to put together.\n\n  By the way, on the Export Administration Act, I believe we are \nprepared to try to find a way to consider that because I think we need \nto act on it, making sure that we consider national security interests. \nThat, obviously, is an underlying factor on the Export Administration \nAct. I have no doubt that the Senator from Wyoming wouldn't be for it \nif he had any doubts in that area himself because he has worked so \nextensively on it.\n  The same thing applies on this amendment. Senator Thompson is trying \nto raise a general concern about national security interests. The \nChinese are not complying with the nuclear proliferation regimes to \nwhich they have committed.\n  What worries me is we are going to have this vote, we are going to \npass this bill, and in a month or 6 months we may have a lot of \nexplaining to do. I spent 2 months trying to get a way to have this \nissue considered separately. That is the way it should have been \nconsidered. But it will be considered, I predict, before we get out of \nhere.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. First, I thank the majority leader and agree with him \ncompletely on the proposition that we will have a vote on this issue. \nIt might not be the exact wording of this bill, but we will have a vote \non this issue.\n  We introduced this bill last May because, as chairman of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, the committee that has jurisdiction on \nproliferation matters under the statute, we receive briefings, as a few \ncommittees do, on proliferation developments, for example. In that \nposition, we have had numerous hearings and have been told there is a \nlongstanding and growing threat because of proliferation of China, \nprimarily, and Russia and North Korea.\n  We haven't had a lot of attention with regard to that, or a whole lot \nof interest, until we started discussing it in the context of trade. \nTrade interests everybody because there is money to be made. That is \nunderstandable. I am all for it.\n  We introduced this bill because we were told by our intelligence \npeople that there was a threat to this country. I can't think of \nanything more serious that we could possibly be dealing with than a \nnuclear, biological, or chemical threat, and the fact that rogue \nnations are rapidly developing the capability to hit this country with \nall three of those. Let that sink in for a little bit.\n  All the time that we spend around here in budget and other votes that \ntake up most of our time, trying to divide up the money, we are being \ntold by our experts--whether it is the Rumsfeld Commission, the Deutch \nCommission, the Cox Commission, or the biennial intelligence \nassessment--there is a present danger and it is growing, and the \nChinese are actually increasing their activities as far as missiles are \nconcerned.\n\n  That is why we introduced the bill. People raise various objections. \nLast night some were saying the report that we want to have produced is \ntoo extensive and we might catch up some innocent Chinese companies \nthat might later prove to be innocent when we accuse them of \nproliferating. Frankly, I am willing to take that risk.\n  We tried to get a separate vote. We said: Let's not put it on PNTR. \nOur amendment shouldn't be considered a trade measure. The bipartisan \nbill shouldn't be considered a trade bill. It is a proliferation bill. \nSo let's discuss it in the context of our overall relationship with \nChina, but don't force us to put it on the China trade bill.\n  No, you wouldn't have that. We couldn't have that. You wouldn't give \nme a separate vote on that because it might complicate things.\n  So I said OK, if you don't do that, I will put it on the bill. So I \nput it on bill. Senator Torricelli and I did. And now it is an \namendment to the China trade bill.\n  They said: My goodness, we wish you wouldn't have done that. We wish \nit was a freestanding bill now that we see you are serious, but we \ncan't possibly vote on it as an amendment to the trade bill because it \nmight complicate the trade bill.\n  So we have gone through all of that.\n  Frankly, we were told from the minority side that our Democratic \ncolleagues were the ones who sunk--a few over there were the ones who \nhad a problem with this. We have discussed this since May and there \nhave been some changes. Anybody who wanted to discuss this bill--and \nthere were staffers from many, many Senators, Democrats and \nRepublicans, who have worked with Senator Torricelli and my staff--\nanyone who wanted some input certainly had the opportunity to do that \nfor months. There have been changes because we have been trying to \naccommodate the concerns: It is too tough; we didn't give the President \nenough discretion. We made changes because of that. We have been \ndiscussing this since May, with all of the foot-dragging that we have \nseen along the way.\n  We had a good debate last night, and we had a good debate today. We \ndebated over sanctions and whether or not they were effective--things \nthat we ought to be debating. Good things, good substance, important \nsubjects that we ought to be debating, and raising the issue now. When \nwe are obviously getting ready to engage in this new trade relationship \nwith China, what better time to address the fact that they are the \nworld's worst in selling weapons of mass destruction to these rogue \nnations.\n  We claim we need a national defense system because of the threat of \nthese rogue nations. How can we talk to the Chinese Government without \naddressing it? That is what the debate has been about. It has been \ngood.\n  Now it is time for a vote. I have been around here a few years. I \ndon't remember another occasion where a colleague has objected to a \nvote under these circumstances. My Democratic colleagues have raised no \nobjection, but my two good friends on this side of the aisle raise \nobjections. I am sad to say that it appears the real objection all \ncomes down to one of jurisdiction. My friend from Wyoming apparently \nbelieves this should be a part of his bill if it is going to be \nanything, the Export Administration Act; and that this should be \npresumably under the purview of the Banking Committee if it is going to \nbe considered. He will have the opportunity to correct me if I am \nwrong, but I thought that is what I heard.\n  I think that is a sad set of circumstances, if after all of that we \nfinally flush out the real reasons for the objection to even having a \nvote. Oppose it if you will, but the objection to even having a vote is \nbecause somebody got somebody else's jurisdiction.\n  All my colleagues should know that according to the Parliamentarian, \nthis bill, if it were referred to committee, would be referred to the \nForeign Relations Committee.\n  Let's look at some of the hearings we have had in the Governmental \nAffairs\n\n[[Page S8400]]\n\nCommittee. The Banking Committee has some jurisdiction with regard to \nexport administration. The Governmental Affairs Committee has some \njurisdiction with regard to proliferation. I can't believe we are even \ntalking about this, but here goes. It is like kids squabbling in the \nback of the schoolbus.\n  If the issue is that nobody has paid any attention to this and nobody \nhas had any hearings, this committee of jurisdiction, the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, in May of 2000, had a full committee hearing on \nexport control implementation issues with respect to high-performance \ncomputers.\n  In April of 2000: Full committee hearing on the Wassenaar Arrangement \nand the future of the multilateral export controls;\n  February of 2000: Subcommittee on Internet Security, Proliferation \nand Federal Services hearing on National Intelligence Estimate on the \nBallistic Missile Threat to the United States;\n  June of 1999: Full committee hearing on Interagency Inspector \nGeneral's Report on the Export-Control Process for Dual-Use and \nMunitions List Commodities;\n  June of 1999: Full committee hearing on Dual-Use and Munitions List \nExport Control Processes and Implementation at the Department of \nEnergy;\n  May of 1999: Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation \nand Federal Services--that is Senator Cochran's subcommittee. He had a \nhearing on the Report of the House Select Committee on U.S. National \nSecurity and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People's Republic of \nChina.\n  Senator Cochran's subcommittee, of course, has been in this area, the \nproliferation area, the missile area, the whole problem with China and \nRussia in particular, the problem with the rogue nations--Senator \nCochran has been dealing with this for years and has put out published \nreports. The last one was within the last couple of weeks, for anybody \nwho is interested.\n  September of 1998: Subcommittee on International Security, \nProliferation and Federal Services hearing on GAO Reports on High \nPerformance Computers;\n  June of 1998: Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation \nand Federal Services hearing on the Adequacy of Commerce Department \nSatellite Export Controls;\n  March of 1998: Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation \nand Federal Services hearing on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and \nNuclear Proliferation;\n  October of 1997: Subcommittee on International Security, \nProliferation and Federal Services hearing on North Korean Missile \nProliferation--again Senator Cochran's subcommittee. Once again, in \nSeptember of 1997, his Subcommittee on International Security \nProliferation and Federal Services had a hearing on Missile \nProliferation in the Information Age.\n  In June of 1997, his subcommittee had a hearing on Proliferation and \nU.S. Export Controls.\n  In May of 1997, his subcommittee had a hearing on National Missile \nDefense and the ABM Treaty. Senator Cochran, of course, is chairman of \nthis subcommittee. He is the leader on the national missile defense \nissue and has been for some time. Of course, again, it is directly \nrelevant because the reason we are claiming we need a national missile \ndefense is the very issue our amendment brings up.\n  April of 1997: Subcommittee on International Security--again, Senator \nCochran's subcommittee--hearing on Chinese Proliferation--Part II;\n  April of 1997: His subcommittee, Chinese Proliferation hearing, Part \nI.\n  So, for the uninformed, we have various committees here with various \njurisdictions. Sometimes jurisdiction overlaps, where more than one \ncommittee has jurisdiction in the subject area. This is one of those \ncases.\n  Over the past 4 years, the Governmental Affairs Committee alone has \nheld 15 hearings on proliferation; over 30 hearings have been held by \nmy committee, the Armed Services Committee, and in the Foreign \nRelations Committee. Furthermore, this legislation has the full support \nof the chairman of jurisdiction, Senator Helms, chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee. The issue of proliferation, of course, has had a \nfull, full consideration for some time now.\n\n  So we will have an opportunity to discuss this further, including \nfurther tonight. I don't know if anyone wants to speak to this. I will \ngive them the opportunity, give my colleague from Wyoming an \nopportunity to further address it. But it is a sad situation, when our \ncountry faces this kind of threat, that we cannot even get a vote on an \namendment that would address that threat.\n  Vote it down if you must. Oppose it if you will. But the very idea of \nus not having a vote because it has not been considered enough by the \nright committee or that it is more properly a part of somebody else's \nbill instead of our bill? Surely it has not come to that.\n  I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his \ncomments. I want to assure him I am not doing this on a jurisdictional \nbasis. I am a little incensed at the implication of that accusation, \nand, in the objection I raised, I did not mention anything about \njurisdiction. In the speech I gave yesterday, I didn't mention anything \nabout jurisdiction. I mentioned the concerns about items that are in \nthis bill and there are amendments that would need to be made to this \nbill. I am sure, if it went through the normal process--and one of the \nthings I am learning about here is process. I learned a lot about \nprocess as I did the bill my colleague mentioned, the Export \nAdministration Act. I took it through a process. I got a 20-0 vote on \nit. I brought it to the floor. I learned a little bit about process \nthat sometimes, even when you think you have the right to bring it up \non the floor, people can object after that point and you can have it \ntaken down. But it went through a process there. That process has \nundoubtedly been effectively stopped for this year. I have not been \nwhining about that.\n  But I did learn a lot of things through that process because it \ninvolved going into a number of the reports the Senator from Tennessee \nhas mentioned. I did not just go through the public part of those \nreports. I took the time to go over to the Intelligence Committee and \nhave the special briefings and read the documents from a number of the \nthings that have been cited, and particularly the Cox report. So I \nlearned a lot of things about these areas of problems.\n  There are some problems there, and they need to be solved, but they \nought to be solved through the regular process so we do not wind up \nwith some things we are going to be embarrassed by, or believe are \nlacking, or have pointed out to us later that just a little bit more \ndeliberation would have changed.\n  We have been suggesting changes. We can make some amendments. It is \nvery difficult to go into another person's bill and make extensive \namendments, but we have mentioned the need for some pretty extensive \namendments. I am certain if this would have gone through the process of \ngoing through the Foreign Relations Committee first--not just hearings. \nHearings are valuable. They build some basis for building things. I \nknow these extensive hearings that have been done are where this bill \ncame from. But it goes through another step in that process called a \nmarkup. That is where very detailed amendments are made to a bill by \npeople who have a wide knowledge of the items that are included. It is \nkind of a free-for-all, putting on amendments. A number of them do not \nmake it and should not make it. But it gives a more thorough review \nthan if one of us drafts a bill, or two of us get together and draft a \nbill, and then occasionally talk to other people and occasionally \nlisten to part of their criticisms but discard large parts of their \ncriticism.\n  I know this bill was originally drafted in May and we have been \nregistering objections to things that are in it since May. They have \nbeen tweaked a little bit, and part of the process is, if you are not \ngoing to make the changes, then you have to go through this process \nhere on the floor, which the Senate designs to be an extremely \nexcruciating one--as I learned on my EAA bill.\n  It is a part of the process. There needs to be additional work on it. \nThere needs to be additional amendments.\n\n[[Page S8401]]\n\n  As I mentioned yesterday, if one listens to the debate, it sounds as \nif we can solve the export-import imbalance by doing PNTR, and that is \nnot going to happen. The way that imbalance gets solved is if U.S. \nfolks stop buying Chinese products or we get extensive sales over \nthere. Extensive sales over there probably is not going to happen \nbecause the people over there on an average wage do not make much, so \nthey cannot buy much. We do have a hope of getting in the door with \nsome of the bigger equipment items. To listen to the debate, everything \nwill be solved by PNTR, and that is not going to happen.\n  I have to congratulate the Senator from Tennessee for the title he \nput on the bill. I noticed when he expanded the bill to include a \ncouple of other countries in light of our objection, that it was aimed \nsolely at China and they are not the only proliferators. A couple of \nothers were stuck in there. But the title was not changed because the \ntitle is so great. One of the things I learned a long time ago in \nlegislation is one does not vote on a bill because of a good title. One \nvotes on it because it is good through and through.\n  Those have been the reasons for my objections. I am sorry if the \nSenator from Tennessee put in all of that work. This delays his plan \nfor a vote, but it does not stop it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, first, I am sorry if I drew the wrong \nconclusion this might be jurisdictional. When the Senator mentioned \nthis would be a better part of the Export Administration Act \nlegislation, which happens to be his legislation, and it was not \nreferred to the right committee, I just thought that might be \njurisdictional. That is where I got that idea. If he resents that \nimplication, I am sorry, but that is the source of that idea.\n  I think back to a time not too long ago when the Senator from Wyoming \nand the Senator from Texas worked long and hard on a bill called the \nExport Administration Act. Several of us who are committee chairmen had \nproblems with that because of some of the same things we are talking \nabout.\n  In my view, and I think my colleagues' view, it liberalized our \nexport rules at a time when we should have been tightening them up. The \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, the chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee, the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, and myself as chairman of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, looked at this and said that it had some major problems. The \nstatement was made by the sponsors of the bill that they would not \nbring it up, as I recall, without our signing off on it, and we never \nsigned off on it.\n  If the hangup here is the fact my colleagues have not gotten a vote \non their Export Administration Act, I suggest they offer it as an \namendment to my amendment. Let's have a second-degree amendment. If \nthat is the problem, then let's have a vote on both of them.\n  Let's be frank with each other. The Senator's opposition is the same \nopposition and arguments in many respects that we have heard from four \nother amendments that have been considered. The only difference is we \nhave had votes on those four other amendments. The Senator was not over \nhere complaining that we had not had sufficient process, I guess, with \nregard to the Wellstone amendment or the Byrd amendment or the Hollings \namendment or the Helms amendment. The process was OK with regard to \nthose, but now we have an amendment, the only amendment that deals with \na direct threat to this Nation, and we are talking about process.\n\n  One of the big complaints of the opponents of the Thompson-Torricelli \namendment has been that we have changed it so much they hardly know \nwhat is going on here anymore. The reason we changed it is we kept \nresponding to the complaints. Staffs met numerous times. Everybody knew \nthese meetings were going on. It was not an open forum for somebody to \ncome down and lay down a bunch of requirements if they did not get what \nthey wanted the first day, leave, and not show up again. It was an \nopen, rolling forum with various staff members.\n  I sat in on an occasion or two. It was very open since May that we \nwere talking about trying to come together because we all appreciate \nthe proliferation problem and we need to do something.\n  While we are talking about trade with China, we ought to be talking \nwith them also about the fact they are endangering this country by \narming these rogue nations, and we tried to work it out. Some Members \nobjected. We had mandatory sanctions and they said we did not give the \nPresident enough discretion. We gave him more discretion. Some people \nclaimed we are singling out the Chinese; it will make them angry; and \nit will be counterproductive. We broadened it. Some people claimed we \nwere giving Congress too much authority; that any Member of Congress \ncould come in and have a vote to override a Presidential decision in \nthis regard, so we raised the requirement to 20 Members. There have to \nbe 20 Members who have to have that concern. We made all of these \nchanges.\n  Now I understand the complaint is that we did not change it enough, \nor is it the process? Is that process? Is that a process issue? There \nare still problems with it. Everybody who has spoken against this bill \nhas raised problems with it, but none of them have raised an objection \nto taking a vote.\n  I just received the latest in a series of fliers I have been graced \nwith over the last several days; this one from an industry coalition. \nThe first thing we got today was a report from the president of the \nChamber of Commerce who came out against our bill. Somebody told me \nthey were at a Chamber of Commerce meeting not long ago and they \nmentioned my bill, and most of the people there broke into applause. I \nought to be careful talking about the Chamber of Commerce.\n  This is coming from the president of the Chamber of Commerce, who I \ndo not think speaks for the average business person in America on this \nissue. Let's get that straight. First of all, he complains that it is \nlimited to one country--obviously, he has not read the bill--that if we \ndo this, it will effectively kill the bill, not that we have this \nserious problem and we should do something about it, but effectively it \nwill kill the bill.\n  Then he says he is getting ready to leave for a tour of Asia and \ngoing to wind up in Beijing, but before he leaves, he delivers his last \nsalvo against my amendment, purporting to speak for all the members, I \nsuppose, of the Chamber of Commerce. I hope while he is in Beijing, he \nwill ask them to quit selling weapons of mass destruction to our \nenemies. I hope that is on his agenda while he is talking about his \ntrade.\n  The latest has been a sheet put out by the High-Tech Industry \nCoalition on China, the American Electronics Association, Business \nSoftware Alliance, Computer Systems Policy Project, Computer Technology \nIndustry Association, Consumer Electronics Association, Electronic \nIndustry Alliance, Information Technology Industry Council, National \nVenture Capital Association, Semiconductor Industry Association, \nSemiconductor Equipment Materials International, Software and \nInformation Industry Association, Telecommunications Industry \nAssociation, and United States Information Technology Offices.\n  All of them have joined together to put out this opposition sheet to \nthis bill. Some people have been so crass as to imply that maybe it was \nthis feverish lobbying that is going on from exporters that might have \nsomething to do with the opposition to this bill.\n  But I have the greatest respect, from what I know, about this entire \ngroup here. Our high-tech industry has done phenomenally well. They are \ncreative. They have contributed mightily to our economy. They want to \nexport; I understand that. They want to make more money; I understand \nthat. God bless them. More power to them. But I do not see any \nassociation listed on here that has any responsibility for the \nprotection of this country.\n  We can vote on human rights, religious freedom, and all the other \nimportant things, but the only thing that poses a danger to this \ncountry we can't get a vote on because we didn't go through the \n``process'' because it needs to go back to a committee. The chairman of \nthat committee gave the most eloquent statement that has been given on \nbehalf of my amendment. One Senator just said he wants to send it to a \ncommittee that does not want it, whose chairman, Senator Helms, says\n\n[[Page S8402]]\n\nwe do not need it; that we have had enough hearings; that we know what \nthe problem is.\n  Give me a break. There will be a vote on this issue. But let's get \nback to the latest salvo, which may or may not have something to do \nwith what we are dealing with tonight. The information they are putting \nout says this undercuts China PNTR; that it will undo PNTR; that it \nwill return us to inflammatory annual votes on China.\n  I have been involved in a few annual votes on China. I do not \nremember the flames, but be that as it may, this will not kill PNTR. \nThe die is cast on PNTR. The House has passed PNTR. We are going to \npass PNTR. The only issue is whether or not in doing so, we raise the \nissue with our new ``strategic trading partners,'' the issue that we \nare making this world a more dangerous one.\n  The House passed it by a 40-vote margin. Are you here to tell me that \nif we passed it and added on a nuclear proliferation component, that it \nwould make it more difficult for the House to pass it again? It would \nhave to go back to the House if we add anything new. So for the folks \nwho might be listening and watching, the deal is, they say: You can't \npass the Thompson amendment because it is different from what the House \npassed. If you make any changes, it has to go back to the House for \nanother vote, and they might not vote for it again. That is the bottom-\nline argument for those who oppose this amendment.\n  My first response is, so what. If we have a serious national security \nproblem and issue that is paramount, it begs the question: Is this \nproblem serious enough for us to address? I can join issue on that \nargument and respect my friends who disagree with it. But don't tell me \nthat even though it may be that serious, we can't add it on over here \nbecause the House might have to take another vote. That is an insult to \nthis body. Since when did we stop being the world's greatest \ndeliberative body and become a rubber stamp for the House of \nRepresentatives?\n  The practical answer to this particular accusation is that it will \nnot kill PNTR. Before the sun sets, they will have it back over there, \nand they will revote on it. Nobody is going to go into an election just \nhaving cast a vote for it and then a vote against it, and the vote \nagainst it has a proliferation tag-on. That is going to make it more \ndifficult to vote for it? Give me a break.\n\n  Please, be serious in your arguments, I say to my friends. There are \nsome serious arguments to be had around here. I had a good discussion \nwith the Senator from Kansas today on sanctions in general--a good \ndiscussion. But don't tell me, as a Senator, I have to rubber stamp \nsomething, when the House of Representatives identifies problems--\nreligious persecution, slave labor, Radio Free Asia--and then it comes \nover here, and we can't identify the only thing that is a threat to \nthis Nation.\n  All those things are things that ought to be identified. They were \ncorrect in doing that. But to tell us that we have to rubber stamp it, \nthat the benefits of PNTR to this country are so great, and so obvious, \nand so overwhelming, and so clear, that we are afraid to risk letting \nthe House, with a 40-vote margin, with a nuclear proliferation add-on, \nhave another shot at it because it is going to cost us a few more \ndays--while the Chinese Government, as we speak, is trying to undercut \nthe WTO agreement. That is just kind of a sideline. We see this in the \npaper now. We understand. They are trying to mess with Taiwan coming \ninto the WTO later. They are trying to renege on some of the agreements \nthat they have previously made in their bilateral agreement with us. \nThey must not have any respect at all for us right now. We have danced \nto their tune now for a few years. We do not make any big fuss about \nthe theft of nuclear secrets. We say: Boys will be boys. Everybody does \nthat.\n  The Chinese military puts money into our campaigns, and they say, \nagain: Maybe the higher-ups didn't know about it. We give them WTO. We \ngive them a veto on a national missile defense system. That is the \nreason the President put off that decision, because the Russians and \nthe Chinese objected to it.\n  We send delegations over there asking them to please stop their \nproliferation activities. They give us the back of their hand and say: \nWe're going to continue our activities as long as you continue with the \nmissile defense system and your friendship with Taiwan.\n  Then the President meets Jiang Zemin at the Waldorf in New York on \nFriday. According to the New York Times, the President once again \nraised the issue of what they were doing with regard to Pakistan. They \nhave outfitted Pakistan. They took a nation, a small nation with no \nnuclear capability, and have outfitted Pakistan, soup to nuts. Not only \ndo they have missiles, M-11 missiles, goodness knows what else, but \nthey now have, apparently, missile plants where they can make their \nown.\n  The Chinese are probably ready to sign a new agreement now not to \nship any more in there. They do not need to. They have equipped \nPakistan so they can do it themselves. They have made that place a \ntinderbox. So the President rightfully brings this up, according to the \nNew York Times.\n  Jiang Zemin's response, apparently, according to the New York Times, \nwas to smile, wish the President well on his pending retirement, and to \nthank him for his assistance in getting them into the WTO. They must \nnot have much respect for us anymore.\n  And we are over here saying we are afraid to give our House of \nRepresentatives another vote on this, regardless of the merits of the \ncase. It would kill, as they say, the PNTR. They are incorrect. They \nare wrong. They are brilliant people. They have contributed mightily to \nour economy. I am talking about all these high-tech people. I want to \nhelp them in every way I can. I am with them on most things. But they \ndo not know this subject. We are supposed to know it. We are given \naccess to classified information. We are paid the big bucks to spend \nlong hours poring over these documents that the intelligence people \nbring to us--and the Rumsfeld Commission and the Deutch Commission and \nthe Cox Commission, and all the rest. It is not their responsibility.\n  But they are papering this town. I said today, you can't stir the \nlobbyists with a stick. Everybody is petrified of this amendment. I \nthink the reason is because they fear it will irritate the Chinese and \nmaybe cause us some problems, trade retaliation, or something like \nthat. But the Chinese want this mightily. They want this PNTR badly. \nThey have a $69 billion trade surplus with us.\n  There will be no killing of that golden goose. They are not foolish \npeople.\n  They also said that it is ineffective because it is a unilateral \nsanction. Unilateral sanctions rarely achieve the intended results of \nthe targeted country, but they penalize American companies, workers, \nand investments. Let me tell you when an American company or worker \nwould be penalized. If we catch the Chinese entities selling missile \nparts or the ability to make bombs, nuclear weapons, to Libya, let's \nsay, then we are going to cut off military and dual use that can be \nused for military purposes, we are going to cut those sales off. So if \nyou make those items, you are going to be affected. The President has \nthe discretion--let me add that--and it does not happen automatically.\n  The process, under our bill, is that we have a report. Our \nintelligence agencies give a report. It identifies these entities, \ncompanies that are doing these things. Then our President has the \ndiscretion or he has to make a determination, depending on the \ncategory, but it is within his power to exercise the appropriate \nremedy. We are not talking about cutting off sales of wheat or food or \nshoes--we would not be selling them shoes--or any other commodity. We \nare talking about munitions and dual-use items.\n  If you are affected by that, you will be affected by this bill. I \ndon't know about the company president, but I will bet you, if you said \nto the average worker--that is 2 percent, by the way, of our dual use \nand munitions; our entire trade with China is 2 percent of our exports; \n2 percent is what we are so afraid of here--if you said to the average \nworker: we are going to impose these restrictions or these sanctions on \nChina for a year to try to get them to clean up their act because we \nhave caught these Chinese companies doing these things. Obviously, it \nis going to make it a more dangerous place for\n\n[[Page S8403]]\n\nyour kids if we keep on down this road. We need to get their attention. \nIt is going to mean some loss of sales for the company you work for. Do \nyou think we ought to do it?\n  I don't think there is any question about that. I have more faith and \nconfidence in the American worker and the American farmer.\n  They talk about farmers being concerned. Well, agriculture is not \ndirectly affected, but what if the Chinese get mad at us and decide to \ncut off some of our agricultural exports?\n  I think my Tennessee farmers are willing to take that chance. If that \nis the price we have to pay to sell corn, then that is too high a price \nto pay. I am like all these other agriculture Senators here. I have \nagriculture. I have farmers. They are concerned about these issues. But \nthey are also very patriotic. When you come right down to it, there are \na lot of organizations running around using the names of various \npeople, but when you come right down to the workers of America and the \nfarmers of America, you are not cutting off exports of goods across the \nspectrum, and you are certainly not cutting off agricultural exports. \nThey would see through that. They would say, well, yes, there is an \nindirect possibility, if I am in a certain area, that there might be \nsome ramifications down the road. But if that possibility were to \noccur, if that is what I have to do to help make this place a little \nbit safer and get their attention because, goodness knows, if we can't \nget their attention while we are about to give them this trade bill, we \nare never going to get their attention, I think they would be willing \nto go along with that.\n\n  What else do they say? It duplicates current U.S. proliferation laws. \nThe last point was the unilateral sanction. Of course, this was drafted \nby some lobbyists downtown. We all know that that works for these \nfolks. All the points are always the same. They hand them around town. \nEverybody uses them. Do you really think their real concern is that \nthese sanctions won't work or that we are duplicating current laws? Is \nthat what is stirring up all this activity, that we are being \ninefficient in some way? Please.\n  Unilateral sanctions don't work. Well, some don't. And there is a \nchance these might not. But there is a good chance they might.\n  Why is the Chinese Government so upset? If you read the French \nnewspapers--and I assure you, they are translated in English before I \nread them--or the Chinese, you will see that there is tremendous \nconsternation over the Thompson-Torricelli amendment. Why do you think \nthat is, if we are only duplicating what is already on the books and \nunilateral sanctions don't work? Do you think they are concerned \nbecause we are about to do something that doesn't work, or do you think \nthey are going to maybe think twice before they continue their activity \nbecause they know that at least the Congress is serious about this? \nThey are going to continue to get highlighted and embarrassed in the \nworld community for making this a more dangerous world. I think it is \nthe latter.\n  I have had Mr. Berger, the President's national security adviser, \ntell me that on occasions when they have actually used or threatened \nunilateral action in times past, that it has had an effect. I don't \nthink they have done it nearly enough, and we have strong disagreements \nabout that. That is part of the problem we have had. They have gone \naround the barn to apologize for 95 percent of what the Chinese \nGovernment has done here. That is the reason we are here tonight. But \nwhen they have on occasion done this, he has told me it has had effect.\n  You can't have it both ways. Unilateral sanctions sometimes do work. \nWe are not talking about these blanket agricultural sanctions or going \ntowards some particular country. We are going to the supplier and \nsaying that we are going to cut off the relevant goods and items if we \ncontinue to catch you doing these things that you are flaunting \ndisrespectfully.\n  Unilateral sanctions undercut PNTR, will kill PNTR, and duplicates \ncurrent laws. To a certain extent that is right. There are laws on the \nbooks now that require sanctions, just as we are proposing, or close to \nit.\n  So you say, Thompson, why are you doing this? Well, because we have \nother provisions, such as a little more congressional oversight, such \nas a more extensive report where it would make it more difficult for a \nPresident to game the system and do what President Clinton said he had \nto do on occasion--that is, to fudge the facts--because if he made a \nfinding against a company that he didn't want to move against for \ndiplomatic reasons, the law would require him to do that. He didn't \nwant to do that.\n  What this does is make it more transparent. The President can still \ndo it, but he has to give Congress a reason why he is not imposing \nsanctions on an entity that has been found to have been selling weapons \nof mass destruction.\n  While it duplicates current law in many respects, which is a point in \nour favor because we are not doing something new and dangerous and \nonerous and burdensome, the President should already be doing some of \nthese things. What we are doing is saying, yes, that, but also in \naddition to that, a mechanism whereby we can have some enforcement to \nit, have some congressional oversight and highlight the fact that the \nPresident has some options here.\n  The President can address the capital markets issue. One of the \nthings the opponents have complained about is the fact that our bill \nactually gives the President the authority to say to a particular \nChinese company or, for that matter, a Russian or a North Korean \ncompany, but the big players right now, such as Petro China or the \nChinese companies, raising billions of dollars in our stock markets, in \nthe New York Stock Exchange, going back, in some cases, to enhance the \nChinese military--and in many cases, according to the Deutch Commission \nand according to the Cox committee, these are proliferators of weapons \nof mass destruction, raising all this money in our capital markets. How \nmany people know about that? You know, we don't want to close our \ncapital markets. We can't do that without thought. But, for goodness' \nsake, that is a privilege; that is not a right for them to come in and \nraise money from our people who do not know who they are dealing with--\nraise billions of dollars, while at the same time selling stuff that is \nmaking the world more dangerous for that investor's kids. Do we really \nwant to keep financing these people that way? I don't think so.\n\n  According to this latest leaflet, it is inconsistent with current \nnonproliferation regimes. It would be activated by a hair-trigger \nmechanism--a hair-trigger mechanism--based on credible information. \nWell, that just comes from a misunderstanding of the law and what the \nbill says.\n  What the bill says is that if you get credible information that they \nare doing these things, you have to put it in the report. That is the \nonly thing it activates. That is the hair-trigger they are talking \nabout. If our intelligence people find that you are selling these \nthings to these rogue nations, you have to put it in the report.\n  Now, the President takes a look at that. If it has to do with a \ncountry, he has total discretion as to what to do. If it has to do with \na company, an entity, say a state-owned company in China, as so many of \nthem are, the President has to make a determination that in fact the \ncredible evidence is true. Then the President has an option to have a \nwaiver. Even after he makes a determination that the allegations are \ntrue, he still has a waiver that he can exercise before all of this \nhappens, before any sanctions are levied. That is the hair-trigger they \nare talking about.\n  They are just misinforming folks. I think it comes from a lack of \nunderstanding of what is in the bill. Somebody downtown, hopefully, \nwill read it more carefully. You can have a lot of complaints about it, \nand so be it, but let's not misrepresent what it does. There is no \nhair-trigger, there is no automatic sanction, no automatic anything; it \nis discretionary with the President. If it is credible evidence, it \ngoes into the report.\n  Some people say: Well, it might be credible evidence, but it might \nnot be proof beyond a reasonable doubt; we might catch up some innocent \nChinese company. We are not trying a criminal lawsuit here. We are \ntalking about information to go into a report for the\n\n[[Page S8404]]\n\nAmerican people to see and for Congress to see. If it turns out we are \nincorrect, we can correct that when the time comes.\n  I don't want to be callous about this just because they are Chinese \ncompanies and maybe had proliferation problems in the past. I don't \nwant to accuse anybody of anything of which they are not guilty. My \nguess is, if our intelligence community takes the time and effort and \nconcludes that this information is credible enough to go into the \nreport, they probably did it. Considering the fact that they are the \nworld's leading proliferators of weapons of mass destruction, somebody \nover there is doing it--not proof beyond a reasonable doubt, but, then \nagain, we are not putting anybody in the penitentiary. We are trying to \nprotect the American people.\n\n       Contains automatic overbroad sanctions. The bill mandates \n     automatic U.S. sanctions against any private or governmental \n     entity, even for acquisition of commodity level products.\n\n  Somebody is not paying attention, are they? ``Mandates automatic U.S. \nsanctions.'' It is just not true. The bill doesn't do that. There is \nnothing automatic about it. It is within the power and determination of \nthe President if he chooses to do that. Then he has a waiver if he \nwants to use that. It is a modest step.\n\n  I think this report is the most important part of this legislation. \nIt is a more extensive report. We get these halfway jobs, summaries, \nbut this is a more extensive report. The President will know we are \ngetting it, and we will have a dialog about who is on it and why and to \nthe extent the President is doing anything about it. The report \nrequires the President to tell us what he intends to do about it. He \ndoesn't have to do anything. But there is the pressure, I would think, \nfor most Presidents, to want to have a pretty good reason if they \ndidn't choose to do anything about it once that credible evidence was \nthere.\n  So, my friends who may be listening to this, there is an awful lot of \nfalse information going around. I know these people didn't intend to do \nthis. They are in the business of advancing technology. They are the \nworld's best, and God bless them. But they are not in this business. \nSomebody downtown is doing this who wants to win too badly. There are \nno automatic sanctions.\n\n       Underwent an inadequate public process.\n\n  Well, we are getting back to my friends from Wyoming and Texas.\n\n       Deserves a full vetting by the Senate, not the hurried and \n     nonpublic process that has characterized the consideration of \n     this bill. Subsequent drafts and basic proposals have not \n     addressed the bill's deficiencies. Should not be substituted \n     for critical processes, such as public hearings.\n\n  In other words, we haven't had any public hearings. Somebody is not \npaying attention. I just read off two pages of the public hearings that \nwe have had on this general subject matter. Nobody paid attention then \nbecause trade was not involved; it was only national security. Now they \nare shocked to find out that all this time we have been having public \nhearings, and we have been getting the reports from bipartisan \ncommissions all this time warning us, warning Congress, warning the \nAmerican citizens, that it is becoming more dangerous. Countries such \nas North Korea will have the capability of hitting us within 5 years of \ntheir decision to do so. We know that some time ago they decided to \nhave that capability. We know that some years ago they already decided \nto have the capability.\n  Shortly after we got the report, they fired a two-stage rocket over \nthe country of Japan--another one of our allies. I guess, now that I \nthink about it, that delivered more than one message, didn't it? It \ntold the good old USA: Yes, we have that capability that you are \ndebating over there. This is what we have. It shocked our intelligence \ncommunity and surprised us. The Rumsfeld Commission told us they feared \nthat was the case, and then they showed us the capability. Of course, \nJapan is one of our closest allies. So I suppose that accentuated it.\n  So we have gone through all that. How much does it take? And now my \nfriends from Texas and Wyoming say we can't have a vote. We can't even \nhave a vote on an issue that poses a direct threat to the security of \nthis Nation because it hasn't sufficiently gone through the process.\n  Then we had the Deutch Commission telling us some of the same things. \nAnd then the Cox Commission told us that, relevant to our export laws, \nthe Chinese Government was using our technology and the supercomputers \nwe were sending to them to perfect and enhance their nuclear \ncapability.\n  Was it Lenin who said, ``The U.S. would sell the rope with which to \nhang itself''?\n  That is what that issue is all about. That is serious business. That \nopens another whole question about our export laws. That is why we have \nthis debate and concern. My friends from Wyoming and Texas and I \ndisagreed. So did these other Senators from various other committees, \nchairmen of these committees. It wasn't just me. At this particular \ntime, while we can't put the genie back in the bottle, we can't keep \ntechnology from circling the globe eventually. But there is great \ndispute among experts as to what people can get their hands on and how \nlong it will take other countries to get their hands on our technology. \nWe shouldn't ship it out willy-nilly and let the Commerce Department \ndecide. Some of our friends would let the Commerce Department decide \nwhether or not these things ought to be sent around. The Commerce \nDepartment is in the business of business. Again, more power to them. \nBut this is not a commerce issue. This is a national security issue. We \nshould not be blind to our commercial interests, and we should not be \nunreasonable about that.\n\n  But there are more important things than whether we should be \nloosening our export laws and saying, well, if we can make it, \neverybody is going to have it eventually. So we might as well give it \nto them tomorrow. Even if we are able to slow them down somewhat, this \nis a dangerous world. I am looking to the day we find out the direct \nproof that one of these rogue nations has what we shipped to China and \nChina just passed it along. I assume it has already happened, but we \ndon't have any proof of that. That is what all of this is really about, \nin my opinion.\n  It goes on to say here--this is the last objection--it provides for \ndangerous procedures and fast-track procedures would inevitably lead to \nhighly politicized annual votes.\n  Our bill, of course, says the President's actions have been, frankly, \ninadequate. I think some of President Clinton's actions have been \ntotally inadequate with regard to some of these decisions.\n  Our intelligence has proof that the Chinese Government sent M-11 \nmissiles to Pakistan, and the response from the State Department is: \nNo. We are not going to impose sanctions there because we cannot prove \nit. We only see canisters on the ground that we know were put there by \nthe Chinese on Pakistani docks. But we do not really know that there \nare missiles inside the canisters.\n  What can you say to that?\n  Then there was another occasion where we proved that they sent ring \nmagnets to the Pakistanis, and those go to enhance the uranium \nenrichment process that goes into these nuclear weapons. The answer \nthere was that we did not have sufficient proof that those high up \nenough in the Chinese Government really signed off on that.\n  We are requiring courtroom-level proof. Instead of requiring them to \nbear the burden, you had better prove to us that you didn't do it \nbecause it sure looks as if you did it. No, we are putting the burden \non ourselves to have a level of proof that no one can ever reach \nbecause our diplomats and some of our administration officials are \nliving in another world. They think if they can continue to dialog with \nthe leadership of the Communist Chinese Government that things are \ngoing to magically fall into place.\n  In this bill we said if we run into one of those situations Congress \nought to have some input. Congress hasn't done enough in this regard. \nWe can't sit back and say that we can't mess with the President's \nauthority. We have done that too much--go into wars, and everything \nelse--partially under the jurisdiction of this body. And we really do \nnot want to take the political heat for making the decisions.\n  Our tendency, it seems to me nowadays, is to sit back and let the \nPresident do the tough stuff and make those decisions. We will \ncriticize him every once in a while. We don't want to be involved. That \nexposes us to criticism if we make a mistake.\n\n[[Page S8405]]\n\n  If you look at the national political polls, national security and \nforeign affairs ranks, only 2 percent of the people in this country \nwould put it at the top of their area of concern--2 percent. That \ndoesn't get the attention of a lot of people around here. So we sit \nback. We have done it too long. The problem is that this administration \nhas sat back right along with us. The result of that has been a more \ndangerous world.\n  We signal to our allies that we claim we need a national missile \ndefense system because of rogue nations. But the signal is we are \nreally not that worried about it; Trade is more important. We are \nsignaling to the leadership of the Chinese Government that we may or \nmay not be concerned about this. We may issue a sanction in one out of \nevery five times we catch it.\n  That is still going to lead to a more dangerous world because they \nsomewhere along the line are going to misjudge how far we will go in \nresponse to some action.\n  What we need to do is have something right now that is measured, that \nis reasonable, and that is not extreme to put in place to simply send a \nsignal that while we are approving the trade bill, that trade is not \nthe only thing that is important to us and that we are going to blow \nthe whistle on them and maybe cut off some of their dual-use \ntechnology. Yes--perhaps even with hardship on one or more of those \nconferences. That is the signal we need to send.\n  So we fashioned the provision in this bill that said if 20 Senators \nagree that we should disagree with the President's action--that we \nthink it is clear and he is doing nothing, or that we think it is not \nso clear and he is doing something and we believe we should become \ninvolved--if 20 of us think that way, we can become involved in a \nvariety of actions. He can veto that. Or it would take a tremendously \nunusual situation for us to actually get anything done, quite frankly. \nEverybody knows that. I know that. Overriding the President's veto on \nsomething like that would be tremendous. It would have to be an \negregious situation. That is the kind of thing we need to signal to the \nworld that we are willing to do, at least in an egregious situation.\n  They say that it is dangerous. I say to them that we already have 60 \nlaws on the books that in one form or another have this general \nprocedure I just described. They are making it look as if it is a \ndangerous, unusual thing. We have at least 60 laws on the books which \nprovide for expedited procedure in one way or another.\n  We will have an opportunity to discuss this further. As I say, I \nparticularly want to get a vote on this. I guess I am having a hard \ntime absorbing what has happened here. After all of this debate, all of \nthis discussion, this clearly would not cause any harm and would not \ncause any problem, except some people think it would complicate the \ntrade bill. It is not as if we are about to do something dangerous or \nwe are about to do something where some of our critics say the law is \nalready on the books and you don't need to do it. That is the level of \ndanger we are talking about.\n  Our colleagues are keeping us from even having a vote. And we let all \nof these other things go? The Senator from Wyoming and the Senator from \nTexas say we haven't gone through the process enough. It has nothing to \ndo with the fact that we couldn't get our Export Administration Act up \nfor a vote, or chose not to. Frankly, I don't know which. If that is \nthe case, that is the case. I take them at their word. I don't want to \naccuse them of having jurisdictional concerns. I say when it is in the \nwrong committee and it is on the wrong bill, to me that is a \njurisdictional problem. If I am using the wrong word, I apologize. But \nthe very idea that in light of this threat and in light of the good \ndebate that we have had--and we have pros and cons on the Republican \nside and pros and cons on the Democratic side as to whether or not we \nought to pass this. We have had a good debate. We are talking about one \nof the few things that really matter around here.\n\n  Our first obligation in the preamble of our Constitution is the \nreason for the creation of this Government, the kind of matters we are \nconsidering here tonight.\n  To come down to this, after all these hearings and all this time, \nwith no one denying the nature of the threat, saying it needs to be \nsent to the committee of jurisdiction--they know by now, of course, \nthat the Parliamentarian has said it would go to the Foreign Relations \nCommittee; it would not even go to their Banking Committee. The only \nproblem they have with that is Senator Helms is chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee and says he doesn't want that to happen. He wants \nmy amendment to pass.\n  I don't understand. It has nothing to do with anything other than \nsome jurisdiction. We need to go back and massage this a little bit \nmore, send it back to a committee that doesn't want it. Maybe we can \noffer some amendments. Why not offer it now, I ask my friends from \nWyoming and Texas. If you want to offer amendments, offer them now. I \ndon't understand the nature of the problem. I cannot for the life of me \nunderstand the nature of the problem.\n  But we will have a chance, perhaps, to explore that further.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we have heard a lot on the Senate floor \nthe last few days about the advantages to the United States of granting \nPNTR to China. In commercial terms, PNTR means that American farmers, \nranchers, workers, manufacturers, and service providers can take \nadvantage of what will be an unprecedented liberalization in the \nworld's most populous market, and an economy that has grown almost ten \npercent annually for two decades. PNTR and China's accession to the WTO \nmeans that China will enter the global trade community, liberalize and \nopen up much of its economy, and be subject to the operating rules and \nregulations of the WTO.\n  I would like to focus my remarks on the effect of PNTR on one very \nimportant sector of America's economy--agriculture.\n  We are in the third year of a severe agricultural crisis in the \nUnited States. Our farmers are suffering terribly from drought, record \nlow prices, increased costs, and now damage due to unprecedented forest \nfires this summer. At the same time, the American food market is a \nmature one with almost no room for growth for our farmers and ranchers. \nTherefore, one part of the solution to the agricultural crisis lies in \nincreasing the quantity and value of our agricultural exports, bringing \nthe products of the world's most efficient farming to the people of the \nworld.\n  That means ensuring that our producers are not besieged by dumped \nimports. That means our producers need time to adjust to surges in \nimports. That means working to dismantle the European Union's system of \nmassive trade-distorting export subsidies to its farmers. That means \nreversing the trends that have reduced our agricultural exports by ten \nbillion dollars since 1996. And that means bringing China into the WTO \nand granting them PNTR so that our farmers and ranchers can benefit \nfrom the significant liberalization commitments that China is making.\n  Let me review those changes that China has agreed to make as part of \nits WTO accession commitments. And remember, if we don't grant China \nPNTR, our competitors can take advantage of this new liberalization in \nChina, while our ranchers and farmers will lose out.\n  First, the US-China Agricultural Cooperation Agreement. Although this \nwas technically separate from China's negotiations for WTO accession, \nit was an integral part of our bilateral negotiations. This \nagricultural agreement provides three specific benefits to American \nproducers.\n  On wheat, China agreed to end a thirty year ban on Pacific Northwest \nwheat. This ban was based on spurious sanitary and phyto-sanitary \nstandards. We completed the first shipment of Pacific Northwest wheat \nto China earlier this year.\n  On beef, under the agricultural agreement, China will accept meat and \npoultry from all USDA Food Safety Inspection Service-approved plants, \nhonoring USDA inspection certificates.\n  On citrus, the agreement provided for a series of measures that would \napprove citrus for export to China. Chinese officials made several \ninspection trips to the United States, and the first shipment occurred \nearlier this year.\n  Second, China made significant trade concessions on bulk commodities. \nFor\n\n[[Page S8406]]\n\nexample, China agreed to a tariff rate quota on wheat of 7.3 million \nmetric tons for its first year of membership in the WTO, increasing to \n9.6 million tons in 2004. This contrasts with recent annual import of \nwheat at around two million tons. Ten percent of the tariff rate quota \nwill be allocated to non-state trading entities. If state trading \nentities do not use their portion of the quota, the unused part will be \ngiven to non-state entities. Tariff rate quotas at similarly high \nlevels will also be in effect for other commodities such as corn, \ncotton, rice, and soybean oil.\n  Third, tariffs themselves will be cut significantly. By January, \n2004, the overall average for agricultural products of importance to \nthe United States will drop from 31 percent to 14 percent. Beef goes \ndown from 45 percent to 12 percent for frozen and to 25 percent for \nfresh. Pork drops from 20 percent to 12 percent. Poultry goes from 20 \npercent to 10 percent.\n  Fourth, foreigners will have the right to distribute imported \nproducts without going through a state-trading enterprise or middleman.\n  Fifth, China has committed not to use export subsidies for \nagricultural products. They have also committed to cap, and then \nreduce, trade-distorting domestic subsidies.\n  Sixth, there are several provisions that most people think apply only \nto manufactured goods, but, in fact, apply to agriculture as well. The \nUnited States can continue to use our non-market economy methodology in \nanti-dumping cases for 15 years, an important protection against dumped \nChinese products. Also, for the next 12 years, we can take safeguard \nmeasures against specific products from China that cause, or threaten \nto cause, disruption in our market.\n  In short, once we grant China PNTR and the WTO accession process \nconcludes, our farmers, ranchers, and food processors can begin to take \nadvantage of vast new opportunities in China. Americans need to move \naggressively to follow-up on these Chinese commitments. And we in the \nCongress and in the Executive Branch must put resources into monitoring \nclosely Chinese compliance with those commitments.\n  Following my own advice about follow up, I will lead a delegation of \nMontana ranchers, farmers, and business people to China in December. I \nencourage all my Congressional colleagues to do likewise. I have also \nsent a letter to Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji insisting that China fully \ncomply with its agriculture commitments.\n  We have a lot to do in the Congress this year and next to help our \nfarm economy. Approving PNTR is one important part of that agenda.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to explain why I oppose \nall amendments offered to H.R. 4444, a bill to establish Permanent \nNormal Trade Relations (PNTR) with China.\n  Much is at stake here; the effects of this vote may be felt for years \nto come. I am convinced that amendments at this stage create a \nprocedural problem that could derail passage of this important bill. \nAdopting any amendments would mean sending this bill to conference, \nwhere it could become mired in wrangling over differences of language \nand content. It is clear to me that we do not have time remaining in \nthis Congress to resolve a bicameral conflict over this bill. We can \nallow nothing to interfere with what may be this Congress's most \nimportant decision concerning China.\n  I am convinced we must not let our focus be drawn away from the real \npoint in question: pure and simple, this vote is about deciding whether \nor not the United States wishes to join with the world community in \nhaving normal trade relations with China, and whether we are prepared \nto conduct our dealings with China according to the terms and \nconditions established by that community under the World Trade \nOrganization framework (WTO).\n  This vote is about protecting U.S. interests in an increasingly \ncompetitive global marketplace and about ensuring that American \nworkers, managers, entrepreneurs, and investors do not miss out on the \nopportunities that are bound to grow as China brings itself further \ninto the modern world.\n  I do not think we further U.S. interests by undermining this nation's \nability to function effectively in the world's most important \nmultinational trade organization, or by cutting Americans off from the \nfull benefits of WTO membership.\n  This is what will happen if we pass a bill that does not conform to \nWTO requirements, or if we are forced to send the bill to conference, \nand fail to pass a bill, at all. I believe it is in America's best \ninterests that this body pass a clean, focused bill establishing \npermanent normal trade relations with China that is the same as the \nHouse bill and does not need conferencing.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 10 a.m. \non Wednesday there be 60 minutes for closing remarks for two \namendments, with the following Senators in control of time: Senator \nRoth, 15 minutes; Senator Moynihan, 15 minutes; Senator Byrd, 15 \nminutes, Senator Bob Smith, 15 minutes.

Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the Health Care \nSafety Net Oversight Act of 2000, which is an important step toward \naddressing a critical issue facing our country: the fact that over 40 \nmillion Americans lack health insurance.\n  While it is natural to question the need for any new commission, I \nbelieve this legislation is more than warranted given the fact that \nthere is such a substantial number of Americans who are uninsured and \nthere is to date no comprehensive solution to this problem.\n  Despite the hard work of Community Health Centers in Utah and \nthroughout the Nation, and despite the many, many efforts of others who \nare working to improve health care delivery in hospitals, emergency \nrooms and clinics, two facts remain. First, it is deplorable that in a \nNation as great as the United States, we still have so many people who \nlack basic health care services. And second, there is no national \nconsensus on how this problem should be addressed by the public and \nprivate sectors.\n  It is obvious that we need to begin the process toward developing \nthat necessary consensus, and I believe the Health Care Safety Net \nOversight Commission's work will help us meet that goal.\n  I commend Senator Baucus and my colleagues for their work which has \nled to introduction of our bipartisan bill tonight. As the legislation \nprogresses, I do want to work with them to improve a limited number of \nprovisions in the bill, including the funding source for the \nCommission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/12/senate-section/article/S8407-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8407-S8408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES' CHOICE STABILIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to address a matter of \ncritical importance to our Nation's 39 million Medicare beneficiaries, \n2 million of whom live in Pennsylvania alone. I speak of the current \nerosion of the Medicare+Choice program, a situation which demands \nattention by Congress and this administration.\n  Currently, more than 6.2 million Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled \nin the Medicare+Choice program, receiving high quality, affordable \nhealth care services through HMOs and other private sector health \nplans. Beneficiaries are choosing these plans because they typically \nprovide a more comprehensive package of benefits (including coverage of \nprescription drugs), lower out-of-pocket costs, and a stronger emphasis \non preventive health care services than the old Medicare fee-for-\nservice system.\n  As my colleagues well know, for more than ten years Medicare \nbeneficiaries have had access to this array of enhanced health benefits \nand options through the Medicare's risk contract program, and the \nsuccess of this program was evidenced by the fact that beneficiaries \nsigned up for Medicare HMO coverage in large numbers. From December \n1993 through December 1997, enrollment in Medicare HMOs increased at an \naverage annual rate of 30 percent. In states such as Louisiana, \nPennsylvania, Ohio, and Texas, enrollment in Medicare HMOs increased \neven more rapidly. In December 1997, shortly after the enactment of the \nBBA, Medicare HMO enrollment stood at 5.2 million, accounting for 14 \npercent of the total Medicare population--up from just 1.3 million \nenrollees and 3 percent of the Medicare population in December 1990.\n  The success of the Medicare HMO program inspired Congress to \nestablish the Medicare+Choice program in 1997 through the enactment of \nthe Balanced Budget Act (BBA). In establishing the Medicare+Choice \nprogram, Congress had three goals in mind: (1) to build on the success \nof the Medicare HMO program; (2) to give seniors and persons with \ndisabilities the same health care choices available to Americans who \nobtain their health coverage through the private sector; and (3) to \nfurther expand beneficiaries' health care choices by establishing an \neven wider range of health plan options and by making such options \navailable in areas where Medicare HMOs were not yet available. Three \nyears later, however, the Medicare+Choice program has not fulfilled its \npromise of expanding health care choices for Medicare beneficiaries. \nInstead, a large number of beneficiaries have lost their \nMedicare+Choice plans or experienced an increase in out-of-pocket costs \nor a reduction in benefits.\n  This disturbing trend is especially harmful to low-income \nbeneficiaries, who are almost twice as likely to enroll in Medicare \nHMOs as are other Medicare beneficiaries. For many seniors and persons \nwith disabilities who live on fixed incomes, having access to a \nMedicare HMO means that they can spend their limited resources on \ngroceries and other daily essentials. Beneficiaries also like Medicare \nHMOs because they provide coordinated care and place a strong emphasis \non preventive services that help them to stay healthy and avoid \npreventable diseases.\n  Mr. President, when Congress enacted BBA in 1997, plans were still \njoining the Medicare+Choice program and 74 percent of beneficiaries had \naccess to at least one plan. But today, access dropped to 69 percent, \nwith 2 million fewer beneficiaries having access to a plan. Next year, \n711,000 Medicare beneficiaries will lose access to health benefits and \nchoices as a result of Congressional underpayment and burdensome HCFA \nregulations.\n  In addition, many Medicare HMOs have curtailed benefits, increased \ncost-sharing and raised premiums. Average premiums have increased $11 \nper month in 2000.\n\n  Two major problems are responsible for this outcome: (1) the \nMedicare+Choice program is significantly underfunded; and (2) the \nHealth Care Financing Administration (HCFA) has imposed excessive \nregulatory burdens on health plans participating in the program. The \nfunding problem has been caused by the unintended consequences of the \nMedicare+Choice payment formula that was established by the BBA, as \nwell as the Administration's decision to implement risk adjustment of \nMedicare+Choice payments on a non-budget neutral basis. Under this \nformula, the vast majority of health plans have been receiving annual \npayment updates of only 2 percent in recent years--while the cost of \ncaring for Medicare beneficiaries has been increasing at a much higher \nrate.\n  When plans withdraw from communities, beneficiaries are forced to \nswitch plans, or in some cases revert back to the traditional Medicare \nprogram, which does not cover additional benefits like eye and dental \ncare, or, more importantly, prescription drugs.\n  It is in response to this crisis in the Medicare+Choice program that \nI am pleased to be introducing The Medicare Beneficiaries' Choice \nStabilization Act. This legislation will make numerous changes to the \nway Medicare+Choice rates are calculated and will seek to sensitize the \nfunding mechanisms in the current Medicare system to the difficulties \nof health care delivery in all communities, and particularly in rural \nareas.\n  As the costs of providing care in some areas can be higher than the \npayments from Medicare, The Medicare Beneficiaries' Choice \nStabilization Act will also give plans the opportunity to negotiate for \nhigher payment rates based on local costs.\n\n[[Page S8408]]\n\n  Realizing the importance of assuring that the benefits of \nprogrammatic regulations outweigh their costs, my legislation will also \nprovide Medicare+Choice providers regulatory relief from overreaching \nHCFA dictates. Rather than devoting substantial human and financial \nresources toward compliance activities, which leaves fewer resources \navailable for paying for health care services provided to \nbeneficiaries, Medicare+Choice plans ought to be left to the fullest \nextent possible to the business they know best: providing high quality \nand cost effective health care to our Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Congress must devote more adequate funding to the Medicare+Choice \nprogram, and work to ensure that resources are allocated in such a way \nas to assure that the Medicare+Choice program is viable in areas where \nbeneficiaries have already selected health plan options and that the \nprogram can expand in areas where such options are not yet widely \navailable. I am sponsoring Beneficiaries' Choice Stabilization Act with \njust these goals in mind, and I hope my colleagues will join me in a \nbipartisan effort to save and strengthen the Medicare+Choice program \nand the valuable health benefits it provides for our Medicare \npopulation which relies on them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/12/senate-section/article/S8408-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE REPORT OF RACE AND GEOGRAPHIC DISPARITIES IN \n                      FEDERAL CAPITAL PROSECUTIONS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in recent months, our Nation has begun \nto question the fairness of the death penalty with greater urgency. \nNow, with details of the Justice Department report being released, we \nhave learned that just as we feared, the same serious flaws in the \nadministration of the death penalty that have plagued the states also \nafflict the federal death penalty. The report documents apparent racial \nand regional disparities in the administration of the federal death \npenalty. All Americans agree that whether you die for committing a \nfederal crime should not depend arbitrarily on the color of your skin \nor randomly on where you live. When 5 of our 93 United States Attorneys \naccount for 40 percent of the cases where the death penalty is sought; \nwhen 75 percent of federal death penalty cases involve a minority \ndefendant, something may be awry and it's time to stop and take a sober \nlook at the system that imposes the ultimate punishment in our names.\n  I first urged the President to suspend federal executions to allow \ntime for a thorough review of the death penalty on February 2 of this \nyear. I repeat that request today, more strongly than ever. While I \nunderstand the Attorney General plans further studies of some of the \nissues raised by the report, additional internal reviews alone will not \nsatisfy public concern about our system. With the solemn responsibility \nthat our government has to the American people to ensure the utmost \nfairness and justice in the administration of the ultimate punishment, \nand with the first federal execution since 1963 scheduled to take place \nbefore the end of the year, a credible, comprehensive review can be \nconducted only by an independent commission.\n  This is what Governor Ryan decided in Illinois. He created an \nindependent, blue ribbon commission to review the criminal justice \nsystem in his state, while suspending executions. The wisdom of that \nbold stroke by Governor Ryan is clear, both to supporters and opponents \nof capital punishment. The federal government must do the same. The \nPresident should appoint a blue ribbon federal commission of \nprosecutors, judges, law enforcement officials, and other distinguished \nAmericans to address the questions that are raised by the Justice \nDepartment report and propose solutions that will ensure fairness in \nthe administration of the federal death penalty.\n  I urge the President to suspend all federal executions while an \nindependent commission undertakes a thorough review. That is the right \nthing to do, given the troubling racial and regional disparities in the \nadministration of the federal death penalty. Indeed, it is the only \nfair and rational response to these disturbing questions. Let's take \nthe time to be sure we are being fair. Let's temporarily suspend \nfederal executions and let a thoughtfully chosen commission examine the \nsystem. American ideals of justice demand that much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/12/senate-section/article/S8408-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8408-S8410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CABIN USER FEE FAIRNESS ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, soon the Senate will take up S. 1938, the \nCabin User Fee Fairness Act of 1999. It is designed to set a new course \nfor the Forest Service in determining fees for forest lots on which \nfamilies and individuals have been authorized to build cabins for \nseasonal recreation since the early part of this century.\n  In 1915, under the Term Permit Act, Congress set up a program to give \nfamilies the opportunity to recreate on our public lands through the \nso-called recreation residence program. Today, 15,000 of these forest \ncabins remain, providing generation after generation of families and \ntheir friends a respite from urban living and an opportunity to use our \npublic lands.\n  These cabins stand in sharp contrast to many aspects of modern \noutdoor recreation, yet are an important aspect of the mix of \nrecreation opportunities for the American public. While many of us \nenjoy fast, off-road machines and watercraft or hiking to the \nbackcountry with high-tech gear, others enjoy a relaxing weekend at \ntheir cabin in the woods with their family and friends.\n  The recreation residence programs allows families all across the \ncountry an opportunity to use our national forests. This quiet, \nsomewhat uneventful program continues to produce close bonds and \nremarkable memories for hundreds of thousands of Americans, but in \norder to secure the future of the cabin program, this Congress needs to \nreexamine the basis on which fees are now being determined.\n  Roughly twenty years ago, the Forest Service saw the need to \nmodernize the regulations under which the cabin program is \nadministered. Acknowledging that the competition for access and use of \nforest resources has increased dramatically since 1915, both the cabin \nowners and the agency wanted a formal understanding about the rights \nand obligations of using and maintaining these structures.\n  New rules that resulted nearly a decade later reaffirmed the cabins \nas a valid recreational use of forest land. At the same time, the new \npolicy reflected numerous limitations on use that are felt to be \nappropriate in order keep areas of the forest where cabins are located \nopen for recreational use by other forest visitors. Commercial use of \nthe cabins is prohibited, as is year-round occupancy by the owner. \nOwners are restricted in the size, shape, paint color and presence of \nother structures or installations on the cabin lot. The only portion of \na lot that is controlled by the cabin owner is that portion of the lot \nthat directly underlies the footprint of the cabin itself.\n  At some locations, the agency has determined a need to remove cabins \nfor a variety of reasons related to ``higher public purposes,'' and \ncabin owners wanted to be certain in the writing of new regulations \nthat a fair process would guide any future decisions about cabin \nremoval. At other locations, some cabins have been destroyed by fire, \navalanche or falling trees, and a more reliable process of determining \nwhether such cabins might be rebuilt or relocated was needed. It was \ndetermined, therefore, that this recreational program would be tied \nmore closely to the forest planning process.\n  The question of an appropriate fee to be paid for the opportunity of \nconstructing and maintaining a cabin in the woods was also addressed at \nthat time. Although the agency's policies for administration of the \ncabin program have, overall, held up well over time, the portion \ndealing with periodic redetermination of fees proved in the last few \nyears to be a failure.\n\n  A base fee was determined twenty years ago by an appraisal of sales \nof ``comparable'' undeveloped lots in the real estate market adjacent \nto the national forest where a cabin was located. The new policy called \nfor reappraisal of the value of the lot twenty years later--a trigger \nthat led to initiation of the reappraisal process in 1995.\n  In the meantime, according to the policy, annual adjustments to the \nbase fee would be tracked by the Implicit Price Deflator (IPD), which \nproved to be a faulty mechanism for this purpose.\n\n[[Page S8409]]\n\nAnnual adjustments to the fee based on movements of the IPD failed \nentirely to keep track of the booming land values associated with \nrecreation development.\n  As the results of actual reappraisals on the ground began reaching my \noffice in 1997, it became clear that far more than the inoperative IPD \nwas out of alignment in determining fees for the cabin owners.\n  At the Pettit Lake tract in Idaho's Sawtooth National Recreation \nArea, the new base fees skyrocketed into alarming five-digit amounts--\nso high that a single annual fee was nearly enough money to buy raw \nland outside the forest and construct a cabin. Meanwhile, the agency's \nappraisal methodology was resulting in new base fees in South Dakota, \nin Florida, and in some locations in Colorado that were actually lower \nthan the previous fee.\n  At the request of the chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture \nin 1998, the cabin owners named a coalition of leaders of their various \nnational and state cabin owner associations to examine the methodology \nbeing used by the Forest Service to determine fees. It became obvious \nto these laymen that analysis of appraisal methodology and the \ndetermination of fees was beyond their grasp, and a respected \nconsulting appraiser was retained to guide the cabin owners through \ntheir task. The report and recommendations of the coalition's \nconsulting appraiser is available from my office for those who might \nwish to examine the details. This legislation reflects the coalition's \nconsulting appraiser's report and comments from the Administration and \nthe appraiser they hired to review their appraisal process.\n  This is highly technical legislation. Its purpose is to send a clear \nset of instructions to appraisers in the field and a clear set of \ninstructions to forest managers to respect the results of appraisals \nundertaken to place value on the raw land being offered cabin owners. \nAdditionally, the purpose of this legislation is to ensure that the \ncabin program continues long into the future, that it provides a fair \nreturn to the taxpayers, and continues to generate a profit for the \nTreasury.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the section-by-section analysis for S. \n1938 be entered into the Record following this statement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n\n                              sec. 1 title\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Cabin User Fee Fairness Act \n     of 2000''\n\n\n                            sec. 2 findings\n\n       Current appraisal procedures for determining recreation \n     residence user fees have, in certain circumstances, been \n     inconsistently applied in determining fair market values for \n     cabin lots demonstrating the need for clarification of these \n     provisions.\n\n\n                            sec. 3 purposes\n\n       The purposes of the Act are 1) to ensure that the National \n     Forest System recreation residence program is managed to \n     preserve the opportunity for individual and family-oriented \n     recreation and 2) to develop a more consistent procedure for \n     determining cabin user fees, taking into consideration the \n     limitations of an authorization and other relevant market \n     factors.\n\n\n                           sec. 4 definitions\n\n       This section defines the terms ``agency'' ``authorization'' \n     ``base cabin user fee'' ``cabin'' ``cabin owner'' ``cabin \n     user fee'' ``caretaker cabin'' ``current cabin user fee'' \n     ``lot'' ``natural, native state'' ``program'' ``Secretary'' \n     ``tract'' ``tract association'' and ``typical lot''\n\n\n         sec. 5 administration of recreation residence program\n\n       To the maximum extent practicable, the Secretary will \n     determine a cabin user fee for owners of privately owned \n     cabins, authorized to be built on National Forest land, that \n     reflects the market value of the cabin lot and regional and \n     local economic influences.\n\n\n                           sec. 6 appraisals\n\n       The Secretary will establish an appraisal process to \n     determine the market value of a typical lot or lots at a \n     cabin tract. Section 6 describes the unique characteristics \n     of the lots authorized for use under the Forest Service \n     recreation residence program, and the characteristics of \n     parcels of land sold in the private sector that might \n     appropriately provide comparable market information for \n     purposes of determining market value.\n       As a first step, the Secretary will complete an inventory \n     of existing improvements to the cabin lots in the program to \n     determine whether these improvements were paid for by the \n     agency, by third parties, or by the cabin owner. Improvements \n     paid for by the cabin owner (or his predecessor) are not \n     included in the market value. There is a rebuttable \n     presumption that improvements were paid for by the cabin \n     owner or his predecessor.\n       The Secretary will contract with an appropriate appraisal \n     organization to manage the development of specific appraisal \n     guidelines. An appraisal shall be performed by a State-\n     certified general real estate appraiser in compliance with \n     Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, \n     Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions, \n     and specific appraisal guidelines developed in accordance \n     with this Act.\n       Reappraisal for the purpose of recalculation of the base \n     cabin user fee shall occur not less often than once every 10 \n     years.\n\n\n                         sec. 7 cabin user fees\n\n       To determine the annual base cabin user fee, the Secretary \n     shall multiply the market value of the cabin lot by 5 \n     percent. This calculation reflects restrictions imposed by \n     the permit, including the limited term, absence of \n     significant property rights, and the public's right of access \n     to, and use of, any open portion of the forest lot upon which \n     the cabin is located.\n       If the Secretary decides to discontinue use of a lot as a \n     cabin site, payment of the full base cabin user fee will be \n     phased out in equal increments over the final 10 years of the \n     existing authorization. If the decision to eliminate the \n     authorization for use as a cabin lot is reversed, the cabin \n     owner may be required to pay any portion of fees that were \n     forgone as a result of the expectation of termination.\n       The cabin owner's fee obligation terminates if an act of \n     God or catastrophic event makes it unsafe to continue \n     occupying a cabin lot.\n\n\n               sec. 8 annual adjustment of cabin user fee\n\n       The Secretary shall adjust the cabin user fee annually, \n     using a rolling 5-year average of a published price index \n     that reports changes in rural or similar land values in the \n     State, county, or market area in which the lot is located. An \n     adjustment to the fee may not exceed 5 percent per year, but \n     the amount of adjustment exceeding 5 percent shall be carried \n     forward for application in the following year or years.\n       At the end of the initial 10-year period, the Secretary has \n     the option to choose a different index if it is determined \n     that this index better reflects change in the value of a \n     cabin lot over time.\n\n\n                   sec. 9 payment of cabin user fees\n\n       A cabin user fee shall be prepaid annually by the cabin \n     owner. If the increase over the current base cabin user fee \n     exceeds 100 percent, payment of the increased amount shall be \n     phased in over three years.\n\n\n                   sec. 10 right of second appraisal\n\n       On receipt of notice from the Secretary of the \n     determination of a new base cabin user fee, the cabin owner \n     may obtain a second appraisal at the cabin owner's expense. \n     The Secretary shall determine a new base cabin user fee that \n     is equal to the base cabin user fee determined by the \n     initial appraisal or the second appraisal, or within that \n     range of values.\n\n\n              sec. 11 right of appeal and judicial review\n\n       The Secretary shall grant the cabin owner the right to an \n     administrative appeal of the determination of a new base \n     cabin user fee. A cabin owner that is adversely affected by a \n     final decision of the Secretary may bring a civil action in \n     United States district court.\n\n\n             sec. 12 consistency with other law and rights\n\n       Nothing in this Act limits or restricts any right, title, \n     or interest of the United States in or to any land or \n     resource. The Secretary shall not establish a cabin user fee \n     or a condition affecting a cabin user fee that is \n     inconsistent with the Alaska National Interest Lands \n     Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 3193(d)).\n\n\n                          sec. 13 regulations\n\n       The Secretary shall promulgate regulations to carry out \n     this Act within 2 years of the date of enactment.\n\n\n                     sec. 14 transition provisions\n\n       The Secretary may complete the current appraisal process in \n     accordance with the policy in effect prior to enactment of \n     this Act.\n       For annual cabin fees conducted on or after September 30, \n     1995 but prior to promulgation of regulations required under \n     this Act, the Secretary shall temporarily charge an annual \n     cabin user fee as determined by appraisals occurring since \n     September 30, 1995, provided that the amount charged shall \n     not be more than $3,000 greater than the cabin user fee in \n     effect on October 1, 1996, as adjusted for inflation.\n       In the absence of an appraisal conducted on or after \n     September 30, 1995, the Secretary shall continue to charge \n     the annual cabin user fee in effect on the date of enactment \n     of this Act until a new fee is determined under the new \n     regulations and the right of the cabin owner to a second \n     appraisal is exhausted.\n       Not later than 2 years after promulgation of final \n     regulations, cabin owners who received a new appraisal after \n     September 30, 1995, but prior to promulgation of new \n     regulations under this Act, may request a new appraisal or \n     peer review of the existing appraisal. Such request must be \n     made by a majority of the cabin owners in a group of cabins \n     represented in the appraisal process by a typical lot.\n       Peer review will be conducted by an independent \n     professional appraisal organization. If peer review \n     determines that the earlier appraisal was conducted in a \n     manner inconsistent with this Act, such appraisal may be\n\n[[Page S8410]]\n\n     revised accordingly, or subject to an agreement with the \n     cabin owners, a new appraisal and fee determination may be \n     conducted.\n       Cabin owners and the Secretary shall share, in equal \n     proportion, the payment of all reasonable costs of any new \n     appraisal or peer review.\n       For annual cabin user fees capped by an increase of $3,000, \n     if the new appraisal or peer review resulted in a cabin fee \n     that is 90% or more of the appraisal conducted on or after \n     September 30, 1995 but prior to the promulgation of \n     regulations under this Act, the Secretary shall charge the \n     cabin owner the unpaid difference between those two appraised \n     cabin fees in three annual equal installments.\n       In the absence of a request for a new appraisal or peer \n     review, the Secretary may consider the base cabin user fee \n     resulting from the appraisal conducted after September 30, \n     1995, to be the base cabin user fee in accordance with this \n     Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/12/senate-section/article/S8410-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               WILDFIRES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to acknowledge the efforts of the \ntens of thousands of brave men and women who have fought this year's \nrash of wildfires throughout the West. These firefighters have weakened \nthe menacing flames that have burned millions of acres of western \nstates, taking lives and devouring farmland, forests and homes. More \nthan six and a half million acres have been destroyed this year. My \nhome state of Idaho, with one and a quarter million acres lost to the \nflames, has been one of the most harmed.\n  This fire season is the worst we have faced in fifty years. It is \nclear that without the help of the many people who are fighting these \nfires, many inhabited areas of the West could become smoldering \nexpanses of charred remains. I offer my sincerest gratitude to everyone \nparticipating in the effort to combat the devastating fires. Their work \nprotecting lives, property and the environment is appreciated by all \nwesterners and is crucial to the western economy.\n  Firefighters and fire support teams have been deployed from a range \nof federal and municipal agencies including county sheriffs \ndepartments, local volunteer fire departments, tribes and other local \ncrews throughout the West and the Forest Service, the Bureau of Land \nManagement, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the National Park Service, \nthe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration. Help has also been enlisted from the \nNational Guard and battalions from the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine \nCorps as well as from trained individuals from Canada, Mexico, \nAustralia and New Zealand. Most of these efforts have been coordinated \nout of the National Interagency Fire Center, located in Boise, Idaho.\n  Battling fires is dangerous and exhausting work. The air is warm, \nsmoke-filled and flecked with ash. Most of the firefighter's time is \nspent building firelines, burning out areas, moping up after fires and \ndirectly attacking fires. These tasks often entail miles of walking, \nand hours of tough manual labor, like scraping the ground, chopping and \ndigging, all while wearing uncomfortable protective equipment.\n  The work is so demanding that some firefighters still lose weight \neven though they have consumed five or six thousand calories a day. \nSleep is often inadequate and infrequent. Some teams along the fire \nline have been known to work 48-hour shifts before calling it a day. \nFirefighters can almost count on receiving blistered feet and bloodshot \neyes. Serious injuries and even death are ever-present risks. This \nyear, sixteen people have suffered fire-related fatalities.\n  Fire support teams also have been working overtime as drivers, \nequipment operators, paramedics, medical staff, and trouble shooters. \nIt is an enormous management task just to make sure that all of the \nfirefighters are fed and that they receive the equipment, medical \nattention, and time to sleep.\n  I commend all of the firefighters and support teams for meeting the \nphysical and mental challenges with bravery and steadfast \ndetermination. I know I speak for all when I say that our thoughts and \nprayers are for their safety and we are eager for them to return to \ntheir normal lives.\n  The fire season is not yet over as hundreds of fires blaze and \nthreats of more lightening storms that could bring new fires loom. This \nis indeed a difficult time, although we can take peace of mind from the \nfact that steady, well-trained hands are working on our behalf to keep \nthe towering flames at bay. Right now, it is important to be grateful \nfor the hard work that has been done to protect us and hopeful for an \nend to the destruction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/12/senate-section/article/S8410-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to commend the \nremarkable accomplishments of Ruthie Matthes, an Idaho native and a \ncross-country cyclist, and Stacy Dragila, an Idaho constituent and pole \nvaulter.\n  At the United States Olympic Track and Field trials in July, Stacy \ncleared fifteen feet, two and a quarter inches, which broke her \npersonal record by a half-inch and further solidified her qualification \nto represent the United States at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games.\n  Stacy, a native of Auburn, California, graduated from Idaho State \nUniversity and currently resides in Pocatello in my home state of \nIdaho. It is an honor that she has chosen to live in Idaho and \ncontinues to do a lot of her training in Idaho.\n  Stacy has won three of four national championships since the pole \nvault became an official event in 1997. She currently ranks as the \ndefending world champion and has broken her indoor and outdoor world \nrecords a combined eight times since August. All of her competitions \nhave been approached with maximum effort and dedicated preparation.\n  At the U.S. Track and Field Trials, Stacy tried to break her record \nagain, attempting fifteen feet, five inches, three times. She missed \neach of her three tries, but ended the competition encouraged and \ngratified nonetheless. ``It helps me to know that I can jump under \npressure,'' she said. ``And it's nice to know that I'm attempting 15-5 \nand I still have things to work on.''\n  Ruthie Matthes was born in Sun Valley, ID, and lived in neighboring \nKetchum throughout most of her formative years. She began cycling as \npart of her training for alpine hill ski racing. Her decision to cycle \nfull-time was followed by great success.\n  Between 1990 and 1996, Ruthie took home two bronze, two silver, and \none gold medal at the World Mountain Bike Championships. She was also \nthe National Cross-Country champion from 1996-1998. Her off-road career \nnow includes three consecutive national cross-country titles.\n  Ruthie deserves as much praise for her athletic prowess as she does \nfor her positive sports ethic. ``You have to stay true to your heart,'' \nsays Matthes. ``Do your very best and enjoy it. Whether you finish \nfirst, tenth or last, all of it is an opportunity to learn about \nyourself.''\n  These two women, and other devoted athletes, serve as reminders that,\n\n[[Page S8411]]\n\nthrough healthy competition, our challengers can inspire us to excel. \nThey unify those of us who watch them through shared pride and passion. \nTheir victories leave our souls soaring high and our feet feeling \nlight. In times of defeat, we are humbled by the fact that there is \nmore work to be done to reach our team's victory.\n  The Olympic ideal is perhaps the best evidence that endurance, the \ndesire to challenge oneself, and the pursuit of achieving top physical \nform are agelong endeavors. The events demonstrate that the will to \ncompete in the athletic arena is nearly universal, crossing boundaries \nof culture and geography to bring together most of the world's nations. \nIt is one of the great celebrations of the human spirit and one of the \nfinest examples of our time of peaceful multi-national competition.\n  I am very proud of Ruthie and Stacy's accomplishments and the role \nthat they will play in this international competition. I wish Ruthie, \nStacy, and all the other athletes who are participating in the Olympics \nthis year, the challenge of vigorous competition. May they again know \nthe exaltation of pushing themselves to their limits and the roar of a \ncrowd that lives vicariously through their triumph.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/12/senate-section/article/S8411-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL ASSISTED LIVING WEEK\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today I rise to draw attention to a \nvital service upon which many older Americans depend: assisted living. \nI also want to pay tribute to those who work in this nation's assisted \nliving facilities and dedicate their lives to making someone else's \nlife a little easier.\n  Grandparents Day--Sunday, September 10--marks the beginning of the \nsixth annual National Assisted Living Week (September 10-16), sponsored \nby the National Center for Assisted Living. This year's theme is ``The \nArt of Life,'' highlighting the creative new ways in which seniors are \nexpressing themselves as they strive to maintain their independence and \nautonomy.\n  In the U.S., nearly 28,000 assisted living facilities accommodate \nmore than 1.15 million people by providing supervision, assistance, and \nhealth care services. The need for assisted living services is growing \nwith the rapidly increasing elderly population in America. Advances in \nmedicine and technology have dramatically extended the ability of \nseniors to live independent lives without the need for assistance with \ndaily functions. However, as seniors live longer, more of them \neventually discover they need a helping hand in order to maintain the \nlifestyle to which they have become accustomed--a lifestyle they should \nnot have to give up simply because they are growing older.\n  Just as we are full of excitement from new challenges in our \nadolescence, in our later years, after retirement, we recognize that we \ncannot do it all ourselves. The difficult task is understanding when, \nafter many years of easy mobility in life, an individual needs \nassistance. National Assisted Living Week promotes not only an \nincreased quality of life for the elderly, but builds a team and \nnetwork to accomplish this added quality of life by opening our eyes to \nthe obstacles we can conquer if we only ask for a little assistance.\n  National Assisted Living Week provides an environment which brings \ntogether friends and family with the staff and volunteers of assisted \nliving programs to discover and explore the contributions and services \nthese facilities offer to their communities. These centers will hold \nmany events this week to spotlight their activities and help educate \nthe communities they serve. National Assisted Living Week works as a \ncatalyst, by helping to create strong relationships involving all \nfacets of the community, including places of worship, health care \nfacilities, schools, and businesses.\n  During this National Assisted Living Week, I recognize the selfless \nefforts of those Minnesotans and many other caring Americans who help \nmake dignity in retirement a reality, and I offer them my thanks as \nthey promote assisted living as a quality way of life for America's \nelderly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/12/senate-section/article/S8411-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting two \ntreaties and sundry nominations which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/12/senate-section/article/S8411-3", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 6:47 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1027.

A bill to establish a hospice demonstration and grant \nprogram for beneficiaries under the Medicare Program under title XVIII \nof the Social Security Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                hospice demonstration and grant program\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing groundbreaking \nlegislation to make a difference in the way in which dying patients and \ntheir families can access hospice care. Ninety percent of Americans do \nnot realize that there is a hospice benefit provided under the Medicare \nprogram. Over time, the length of stay in a hospice is decreasing so \nthat patients do not get the full benefit of services that could make \nthem more comfortable at a crucial time in their lives.\n  The issues related to how we die are too important to permit the \nMedicare Hospice benefit to remain fixed in time. Now is the time to \nbegin to test new ways to design the benefit so that the benefit can \nremain truly patient-centered at one of the most crucial times in \npatients' and their families' lives.\n  Just as we push our health care system for medical breakthroughs that \nwill allow more of us to live healthier and longer, we need to drive \nour health care system to create accessible, positive care for those \nfacing the end of life.\n  My legislation, the Hospice Improvement Act of 2000, would require \nthe Secretary to establish a demonstration program to increase access \nand use of hospice care for patients at the end-of-life, and to \nincrease the knowledge of hospice among the medical, mental health and \npatient communities. My legislation stresses the following:\n  Supportive and Comfort Care: To assist families and patients in \ngetting the benefit of hospice care, the Demonstration program will \nallow for a new supportive and comfort care benefit. This benefit, \nelected at the option of the patient, will not require the terminally \nill to elect hospice care instead of other medical treatment, but will \npermit a patient to have supportive and comfort care in place while the \npatient still seeks ``curative treatment.'' This will permit patients \nand families to learn about hospice without forcing them to make a \nchoice between hospice and other care. Case management would be \nprovided through a hospice provider reimbursed on a fee-for-service \nbasis.\n  Severity Index Instead of a Six-Month Prognosis: To determine whether \nor not a patient is eligible for the supportive and comfort care \noption, a severity index will be used instead of the current hospice \nrequirement of a 6 month prognosis. This will permit patients to have \naccess to support services, as needed, instead of relying on an often \ninaccurate time-related prognosis.\n  Increase Rural Hospice Access: Permit nurse practitioners and \nphysician assistants to admit patients to hospice if this is within \ntheir authority under state practice law. In communities without a \nqualified social worker, other professionals with skills, knowledge and \nability may provide medical social services such as counseling on the \neffects of illness on the family.\n  Respite Care: Nursing facilities used for respite care would not be \nrequired to have skilled nurses on the premises 24 hours a day (because \nhospice will be caring for the patient) or respite could be provided in \nthe patient's home.\n  Payment Issues: Permit reimbursement for consultations, preadmission \ninformational visits, even if the patient does not elect hospice/\nsupportive care and provide minimum payment for Medicare hospice \nservices provided under the demonstration program based on the \nprovision of services for a period of 14 days, regardless of length of \nstay.\n  In addition, the demonstration project could address other payment \nissues such as offsetting changes in services and oversight and the \nincreased cost of providing services in rural areas and creating a per \ndiem rate of payment for respite care that reflects the range of care \nneeds.\n  In addition to the Demonstration program, the Secretary would be \nrequired to establish an education grant program for the purpose of \nproviding information about the Medicare hospice benefit, and the \nbenefits available under the demonstration program. Education grants \ncould be used to provide individual or group education to patients and \ntheir families and to the medical and mental health community, and to \ntest messages to improve public\n\n[[Page S8414]]\n\nknowledge about the Medicare hospice benefit.\n  Let me conclude by saying that in the time left for this Congress, we \nhave a unique opportunity to truly begin to improve care for the dying. \nThere are fewer who are more vulnerable than someone who is dying and \nhaving to cope with the physical breakdown of their body and the \nemotional turmoil that imminent death brings to a family. This \nlegislation provides us an opportunity to begin to remove the barriers \nto care for those who facing death.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3026\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Hospice Improvement Program \n     Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Each year more than \\1/3\\ of the people who die suffer \n     from a chronic illness.\n       (2) Approximately \\1/3\\ of Americans are unsure about whom \n     to contact to get the best care during life's last stages.\n       (3) Americans want a team of professionals to care for the \n     patient at the end of life.\n       (4) Americans want emotional and spiritual support for the \n     patient and family.\n       (5) Ninety percent of Americans do not realize that hospice \n     care is a benefit provided under the medicare program under \n     title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et \n     seq.).\n       (6) Health Care Financing Administration data show that \n     beneficiaries were enrolled in hospice for an average of less \n     than 7 weeks in 1998, far less than the full 6-month benefit \n     under the medicare program.\n       (7) According to the most recent data available, although \n     the average hospice enrollment is longer, half of the \n     enrollees live only 30 days after admission and almost 20 \n     percent die within 1 week of enrollment.\n       (8) Use of hospice among medicare beneficiaries has been \n     decreasing, from a high of 59 days in 1995 to less than 48 \n     days in 1998.\n\n     SEC. 3.

and\n\n       (II) in the case of a medicare beneficiary that needs acute \n     care, is equal to the continuous home care day rate for \n     medicare hospice services.\n       (3) Supportive and comfort care benefit.--\n       (A) In general.--For purposes of the demonstration program, \n     the Secretary shall establish a supportive and comfort care \n     benefit for any eligible medicare beneficiary (as defined in \n     subparagraph (C)).\n       (B) Benefit.--Under the supportive and comfort care benefit \n     established under subparagraph (A), any eligible medicare \n     beneficiary may--\n       (i) continue to receive benefits for disease and symptom \n     modifying treatment under the medicare program (and the \n     Secretary may not require or prohibit any specific treatment \n     or decision);\n       (ii) receive case management and medicare hospice services \n     through a hospice provider, which the Secretary shall \n     reimburse on a fee-for-service basis;

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to purchase \nand transfer certain land; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \nand Forestry.\n\n\n   A BILL TO AUTHORIZE THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE TO PURCHASE LAND \n   ADJACENT TO THE COASTAL PLAINS SOIL, AND PLANT RESEARCH CENTER IN \n                        FLORENCE, SOUTH CAROLINA\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator \nHollings, to introduce legislation that will enable the Secretary of \nAgriculture to purchase up to ten acres of land for the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture's Coastal Plains Soil, Water, and Plant Research Center \nin Florence, South Carolina. This land is located within 150 feet of \nthe Center's administrative offices. Part of it has been leased and \nused for agricultural research for almost 25 years. If these ten acres \nwere to be developed commercially the Center's operations would be \nimpaired substantially. This land will be used for agricultural \nresearch.\n  The Coastal Plains Soil, Water, and Plant Research Center focuses its \nresearch on the agricultural needs of farmers in both North and South \nCarolina. However, much of the work done by its staff benefits all U.S. \nagriculture. The Center undertakes basic and applied research with an \nemphasis toward total resource management. I would like to highlight \njust a few of its research programs in soil, water, and plant \nmanagement. The Center's staff investigates the effects of soil \nerosion, non-point-source pollution, and animal waste disposal. \nFurther, they work to develop better cropping systems for major field \ncrops including cotton, corn, soybeans, and small grains; to identify \nhigh-value horticultural crops suitable for production on the soils of \nthe coastal plains; and to improve cotton germ plasm.\n  Mr. President, the Coastal Plains Soil, Water, and Plant Research \nCenter does outstanding work that is not only very important to the \nfarmers of the Carolinas but to all our Nation's farmers.

A bill to amend title 31, United States Code, to provide for \nexecutive agencies to conduct annual recovery audits and recovery \nactivities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n\n              A BILL TO PROVIDE FOR ANNUAL RECOVERY AUDITS\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill which \nbegins to address the issue of improper payments in Federal programs.\n  Each year, the Federal government spends hundreds of billions of \ndollars for a variety of grants, transfer payments, and the procurement \nof goods and services. The Federal government must be accountable for \nhow it spends these funds and for safeguarding against improper \npayments. Unfortunately, the problem of improper payments by Federal \nagencies and departments is immense. Today, I released a GAO report \nwhich I requested which identifies $20.7 billion in improper payments \nin just 20 major programs administered by 12 Federal agencies in Fiscal \nYear 1999 alone. And this represents an increase of more than $1.5 \nbillion from the previous year's estimate. In its report, GAO writes \nthat its ``audits and those of agency inspectors general continue to \ndemonstrate that\n\n[[Page S8416]]\n\nimproper payments are much more widespread than agency financial \nstatement reports have disclosed thus far.''\n  Legislative efforts have focused on improving the Federal \ngovernment's control processes. Recently-enacted laws, such as the \nChief Financial Officers Act, the Government Management Reform Act, and \nthe Government Performance and Results Act, have provided an impetus \nfor agencies to systematically measure and reduce the extent of \nimproper payments.\n  However, the risk of improper payments and the government's ability \nto prevent them continue to be a significant problem. While we continue \nto work to improve the government's widespread financial management \nweaknesses, we also can attempt to recover the tens of billions of \ndollars in improper payments. And that's what the legislation I am \nintroducing today will do.\n  The legislation is modeled on H.R. 1827, a bill sponsored by House \nCommittee on Government Reform Chairman Dan Burton, to require the use \nof a management technique called ``recovery auditing'' which would be \napplied to a Federal agency's records to identify improper payments or \npayment errors made by the agency.\n  Recovery auditing is used extensively by private sector businesses, \nincluding a majority of Fortune 500 companies. These businesses \ntypically contract with specialized recovery auditing firms that are \npaid a contingent fee based on the amounts recovered from overpayments \nthey identify. Recovery auditing is not ``auditing'' in the usual \nsense. Recovery auditing firms do not examine the records of vendors \ndoing business with their client companies or assess the vendors' \nperformance. Instead, these firms develop and use computer software \nprograms that are capable of analyzing their clients' own contract and \npayment records in order to identify discrepancies in those records \nbetween what was owed and what was paid. They focus on obvious but \ninadvertent errors, such as duplicate payments or failure to get credit \nfor applicable discounts and allowances.\n  The bill I am introducing today would require Federal agencies to \nperform recovery audits in order to identify discrepancies between what \nwas actually paid by the agency and what should have been paid. This \nbill seeks to address concerns with H.R. 1827 which were raised after \nits passage by the House. For example, this bill would make clear that \nthe relationship established by this bill is one between the agency and \nthe recovery audit contractor, and all communications and interaction \non the part of the recovery audit contractor is with the agency. \nFurther, this bill includes exemptions for contracts which, under \ncurrent law, already are subject to extensive audit scrutiny and \noversight. Also, this bill includes Federal agency authority for \nrecovery audit pilot programs for contracts, grants or other \narrangements other than those covered by this bill.\n  I appreciate all the work done by Chairman Burton on H.R. 1827. I \nbelieve my legislation appropriately addresses concerns raised with \nthat bill and goes a long way in addressing the wasted taxpayer dollars \nand government inefficiencies resulting from Federal agency payment \nerrors which are made each year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 3031. A bill to make certain technical corrections in laws \nrelating to Native Americans, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Indian Affairs.\n\n\n       Technical Amendments to laws Relating to Native Americans\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill making certain \ntechnical amendments to laws relating to Native Americans. As my \ncolleagues know, Congress typically considers legislation like this \nevery year or so. This bill provides an opportunity to address a series \nof corrections to the law or other non-controversial, minor amendments \nto Indian laws in one broad stroke, rather than having to introduce \nseveral separate bills.\n  This bill includes amendments regarding issues of importance to a \nnumber of my colleagues that have been brought to my attention over \nrecent months. The amendments include, for instance, one-year \nreauthorizations of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act and the \nIndian Alcohol and Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, as \nwell as a clarification of a bill signed into law earlier this year \nrelating to the status of certain lands held in trust by the \nMississippi Band of Choctaw Indians.\n  All amendments included in this bill will serve to promote the \noriginal intent of the affected laws, and do not alter the meaning or \nsubstance of the laws they amend. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this bill, the sole purpose of which is to ensure that the \nlaws this body has already passed are carried forward in the way we \noriginally intended.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the bill was order to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3031\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Chafee):\n  S. 3032. A bill to reauthorize the Junior Duck Stamp Conservation and \nDesign Program Act of 1994, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n             junior duck stamp reauthorization act of 2000\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I would like to introduce \nthe Junior Duck Stamp Reauthorization Act of 2000.\n  The Junior Duck Stamp Program is a wonderful program that allows \nchildren from kindergarten through twelfth grade to participate in an \nintegrated art and science curriculum that is designed to teach \nenvironmental science and habitat conservation. It also raises \nawareness for wetlands and waterfowl conservation. Students and \nteachers work together through a set curriculum that incorporates \necological and wildlife management principles, allowing students to \nlearn about conserving wildlife habitat while they explore the esthetic \nqualities of wildlife and nature.\n  As part of the curriculum, each student is encouraged to focus his or \nher efforts on a particular waterfowl species. The culmination of the \ncurriculum is an artistic depiction of that species. Each state selects \na Best-of-Show winner and that piece of artwork competes to become the \nnational winner of the Junior Duck Stamp contest. The winning depiction \nis chosen as the Federal Junior Duck Stamp, and the student receives \n$2,500. Revenues from selling the stamp are used for conservation \nawards and scholarships to the participants.\n  By all accounts the Junior Duck Stamp Program has been extremely \nsuccessful. Last year alone more than 44,000 students entered the state \ncompetitions. The Fish and Wildlife Service and educators estimate that \nfor every child who enters the state program, ten others are exposed to \nthe curriculum. The program has also been very successful in \nintroducing urban children to nature, allows all children to develop an \nimportant connection to the environment, and motivates students to take \nan active role in conservation of waterfowl species.\n  This legislation is a simple reauthorization of the program through \n2005. The U.S. Fish and wildlife Service would be authorized to receive \n$250,000 a year for the administration of the Junior Duck Stamp \nProgram. In addition, the Junior Duck Stamp Conservation and Design \nProgram Act of 1994 would be amended to allow schools in the District \nof Columbia and the U.S. territories to participate in the program.\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge the passage of this legislation. The \nJunior Duck Stamp Program has played an important role in the education \nof children and the conservation of our natural resources, and it \nshould continue to do so. I ask that the full text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3032\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to delegate the Primary Responsibility for the \nPreservation and Expansion of Affordable Low-Income Housing to States \nand Localities; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n\n\n                       housing needs act of 2000\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce an important piece \nof housing legislation that addresses the affordable-housing needs of \nneedy Americans. The Housing Needs Act of 2000 is a direct response to \nthe affordable housing crisis being experienced by millions of \nAmericans today. By working with State and localities, this legislation \nwill produce thousands of affordable housing units and ensure that \nexisting federally-assisted housing properties are maintained for lower \nincome families.\n  As Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and \nIndependent Agencies, I have become increasingly alarmed by the news \nreports and housing studies that have shown that lower income Americans \nare having a difficult time finding decent, safe, and affordable \nhousing. The Administration's response to this problem has been to \nprovide section 8 tenant-based assistance or vouchers. However, I have \nheard from communities in Missouri to here in the Washington, D.C. area \nthat it is becoming increasingly difficult to use vouchers to find \naffordable housing. It has also come to my attention that despite the \nresources given to the Department of Housing and Urban Development \n(HUD), the Federal government has lost thousands of scarce affordable \nhousing that were once subsidized by the Federal government. Instead of \npreserving these scarce and valuable housing resources, the Department \nhas replaced these units with vouchers. While some families have been \nable to locate replacement housing, many have experienced displacement \nand hardship, resulting in returning the voucher unused or becoming \nhomeless.\n  Due to these well-publicized problems, I instructed my subcommittee \nstaff to conduct a review of the section 8 program and to provide \nrecommendations on how to meet better the housing needs of lower income \nAmericans. The recommendations of the report are captured in the \nHousing Needs Act of 2000, which I am introducing today.\n  Before I discuss the contents of the bill, I summarize the key \nfindings of the Subcommittee Staff report entitled ``Empty Promises--\nSubcommittee Staff Report on HUD's Failing Grade on the Utilization of \nSection 8 Vouchers.'' The key findings of the report are (1) housing \nunits for low-income families are disappearing; (2) worse case housing \nneeds are worsening; and (3) section 8 vouchers are proving to be less \nand less effective in meeting the housing needs of low-income families.\n  Specifically, the staff reported that over the past 4 years, nearly \n125,000 housing units have been lost to the national inventory of \naffordable housing. These units have been lost due to the decision of \nlandlords to leave or opt-out of the section 8 program, HUD's policy to \nvoucher out properties that they have acquired title to and those that \nthe Department actually owns.\n\n[[Page S8418]]\n\n  The staff also found that a record high of 5.4 million households \nhave major housing needs. Based on HUD's Worst Case Housing Needs \nstudy, many of these households are our most vulnerable individuals \nsuch as the elderly, disabled, and children.\n  Lastly, the staff reported that about 1 out of every 5 families that \nreceived a voucher are unable to find housing and thus, the voucher \nremains unused. The report also found not enough landlords were \nparticipating in the voucher program, the payment standard of the \nvouchers were too low for the market area, and voucher holders had \npersonal problems which affected the utilization of vouchers.\n  Mr. President, the staffs' findings were disturbing to me. As a \nresult, I am here today to introduce the Housing Needs Act of 2000 to \naddress the report's findings.\n  Briefly, the legislation creates a new affordable housing block grant \nproduction program that would allocate funds to state housing agencies. \nStates currently administer other federal programs such as the Low-\nIncome Housing Tax Credit program, HOME block grant program, and the \nCommunity Development Block Grant program, which have expanded and \nincreased the capacity of states to create affordable housing units. \nThus, state housing finance agencies have the tools to make this \nprogram work effectively. I am a big believer in local decision-making. \nStates and localities know and understand their housing problems and \nneeds and are in the best position to make decisions on their housing \nneeds.\n  The legislation would also create a new section 8 success program \nthat would allow public housing agencies (PHA) to raise the payment \nstandard for vouchers up to 150 percent of the fair market rent. This \nwill greatly improve the ability of voucher holders to use the vouchers \nin economically strong markets. As the Subcommittee Staff report found, \n19 percent or one in five families that receive a voucher cannot use \nit. I believe that this new success program will improve greatly the \nnumber of voucher holders actually to use the voucher.\n  Lastly, the bill includes a number of smaller provisions that would \nenhance the ability of state and local housing entities to produce low-\nincome housing and ensure that HUD maintains section 8 assistance on \nproperties that it has acquired through foreclosure.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this critical piece of legislation. \nFamilies all over the country are experiencing hardships never before \nseen. It is clear that vouchers alone do not adequately address the \nhousing needs of our vulnerable populations. I believe strongly that \nthe Housing Needs Act of 2000 provides a much-needed, flexible, \nbalanced approach to ensure that the affordable-housing problems can be \nsolved.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 3034. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act with \nrespect to payments made under the prospective payment system for home \nhealth services furnished under the Medicare Program; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n               HOME HEALTH REFINEMENT AMENDMENTS OF 2000\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Home Health \nRefinement Amendments of 2000. This legislation will protect patient \naccess to home health care under Medicare, and ensure that providers \nare able to continue serving seniors who reside in medically \nunderserved areas, have medically complex conditions, or require non-\nroutine medical supplies.\n  Medicare was enacted in 1965, under the leadership of President \nLyndon Johnson, as a promise to the American people that, in exchange \nfor their years of hard work and service to our country, their health \ncare would be protected in their golden years. Today, over 30 million \nseniors rely on the Medicare home health benefit to receive the care \nthey need to maintain their independence and remain in their own homes, \nand to avoid the need for more costly hospital or nursing home care. \nHome health care is critical. It is a benefit to which all eligible \nMedicare beneficiaries should be entitled. But, this benefit is being \nseriously undermined. Since enactment of the Balanced Budget Act, BBA, \nof 1997, federal funding for home health care has plummeted. According \nto the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, Medicare spending on home \nhealth care dropped 48 percent in the last two fiscal years--from $17.5 \nbillion in 1998 to $9.7 billion in 1999--far beyond the original amount \nof savings sought by the BBA. Across the country, these cuts have \nforced over 2,500 home health agencies to close and over 900,000 \npatients to lose their services.\n  In my own State of Massachusetts--a state that, because of economic \nefficiency, sustained a disproportionate share of the BBA cuts in \nMedicare home health funding--28 home health agencies have closed, 6 \nmore have turned in their Medicare provider numbers and chosen to opt \nout of the Medicare program, and 12 more have been forced to merge in \norder to consolidate their limited resources. The home health agencies \nthat have continued to serve patients despite the deep cuts in Medicare \nfunding reported net operating losses of $164 million in 1998. The loss \nof home health care providers in Massachusetts has cost 10,000 patients \naccess to home health services. Consequently, many of the most \nvulnerable residents in my state are being forced to enter hospitals \nand nursing homes, or going without any help at all.\n  To compound the problem, without Congressional action, Medicare \npayments for home health care will be automatically cut by an \nadditional 15 percent next year. It is critical that we defend \nAmerica's seniors against future cuts in home health services, and this \nbill will eliminate the additional 15 percent cut in Medicare home \nhealth payments mandated by the BBA. However, we must do more than \nattempt to stop future cuts. Indeed, it is equally as important that we \nbegin to provide relief to home health providers who are already \nstruggling to care for patients.\n  During the first year of implementation of the Interim Payment \nSystem, IPS, agencies were placed on precarious financial footing \nbecause of insufficient payments, particularly for high-cost and long-\nterm patients. Accordingly, it is critical that we bolster the efforts \nof home health care providers to transcend their current operating \ndeficits, especially as they transition from the Interim Payment System \nto the Prospective Payment System, PPS.\n  The Home Health Refinement Amendments of 2000 would ensure that \nproviders are able to treat the sickest, most expensive patients who \nrely on home health care. Independent studies indicate that, under IPS, \nthousands of patients have been denied home health care benefits--while \n``outlier'' patients (those who require the most intensive services) \nhave been most at risk of losing access to care. To address the costs \nof treating the sickest homebound patients, this legislation provides \nadditional funding for outliers under PPS. Specifically, this bill \nwould set the funding level for outliers at 10 percent of the total \npayments projected or estimated to be made under PPS each year. This \nwould double the current 5 percent allocation without reducing the PPS \nbase payment.\n  In addition, the Home Health Refinement Amendments of 2000 would \nremove the costs of non-routine medical supplies from the PPS base \npayment and, instead, arrange for Medicare reimbursement for these \nsupplies on the basis of a fee schedule. PPS rates include average \nmedical supply costs, but some agencies' patient populations have \ngreater or lesser supply needs than the average. Thus, current rates \nwould underpay agencies that treat patients with high medical supply \nneeds and overpay agencies that treat patients with low medical supply \nneeds. Agencies that treat our most ill, frail, and vulnerable should \nnot be punished with low payment rates.\n  Agencies that treat patients in medically underserved communities \nalso deserve equitable reimbursement for the services they provide. In \norder to address the unique costs of treating patients in underserved \nareas, the Home Health Refinement Amendments of 2000 would establish a \n10 percent add-on to the episodic base payment for patients in rural \nareas, to reflect the increasing costs of travel, and a ``reasonable \ncost'' add-on for security services utilized by providers in our urban \nareas. These add-ons ensure that patients in all types of communities \nacross the country continue to receive the home care they need and \ndeserve.\n  Finally, this legislation would encourage the incorporation of \ntelehealth\n\n[[Page S8419]]\n\ntechnology in home care plans by allowing cost reporting of the \ntelemedicine services utilized by agencies. Telemedicine has \ndemonstrated tremendous potential in bringing modern health care \nservices to patients who reside in areas where providers and technology \nare scarce. Cost reporting will provide the data necessary to develop a \nfair and reasonable Medicare reimbursement policy for telehomecare and \nbring the benefits of modern science and technology to our nation's \nunderserved.\n  Unless we increase the federal commitment to the Medicare home health \ncare benefit, we can only expect to continue to imperil the health of \nan entire generation. We must act to deliver on that promise that \nPresident Johnson made 25 years ago--our nation's seniors deserve no \nless.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 3035. A bill to amend title XI of the Social Security Act to \ncreate an independent and nonpartisan commission to assess the health \ncare needs of the uninsured and to monitor the financial stability of \nthe Nation's health care safety net; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              health care safety net oversight act of 2000\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is often said that, ``Good health and \ngood sense are two of life's greatest blessings.'' Senators Grassley, \nJeffords, and I hope to further the cause of good health and good sense \ntoday, through introduction of the Health Care Safety Net Oversight Act \nof 2000.\n  Mr. President, currently no entity oversees America's health care \nsafety net. This means that all safety net providers--including rural \nhealth clinics, community heath centers and emergency rooms--are \nlaboring on their own. They are like master musicians performing \nwithout a conductor. Each is trying their hardest and performing their \npart--but no one is coordinating their efforts. No one is able to tell \nan actor when his services will be needed, or when he can take a break.\n  This act changes that, by creating the Safety Net Organizations and \nPatient Advisory Commission, an independent and nonpartisan commission \nto monitor the stability of the health care safety net.\n  What does this mean?\n  The Safety Net is made up of providers that deliver health services \nto the uninsured and vulnerable populations across America. These \nproviders are often a last resort for patients who are unable to afford \nthe health care they need and have nowhere else to turn. In my state, \nwe have about 30 community health centers and rural health clinics, \nserving an estimated 80,000 persons per year. That translates into \nabout one in ten Montanans. Were it not for these clinics and health \ncenters, many of these folks--the uninsured and underinsured--would \nhave no place to turn.\n  According to the U.S. Census Bureau, nearly one in five Montanans \nwere uninsured in 1998. This number has risen by 36 percent over the \nlast ten years, and there are now only five states with a higher \npercentage of uninsured residents. When these uninsured seek medical \ntreatment they are often not able to pay. Last year, Montana hospitals \nreported over $67 million in charity care and bad debt. And the problem \nis not going away. At current growth rates for the uninsured, as many \nas one in four Montanans will be uninsured by the year 2007.\n  But Mr. President, these people are not uninsured of their own \nvolition. Eighty three percent of uninsured Montanans are in working \nfamilies. And self-employed workers--including owners of small \nbusinesses--and their dependents account for one-fifth of the uninsured \nin our state. In fact, Montana ranks last in the nation with only 40 \npercent of firms offering a health insurance benefit.\n  So what do we do about this problem? How do we ensure that all \nAmericans, irrespective of color, creed gender or geography, have \naccess to quality health care?\n  Six or seven years ago, Congress and the administration worked on the \nproblem of the uninsured. A tremendous amount of time and effort went \ninto the Health Security Act, on both sides of the issue. As we know, \npassage of that bill failed. Since then, Congress has taken a more \nincremental approach to health care. Congress passed legislation in \n1996 to ensure portability of health insurance. A year later, the CHIP \nprogram was signed into law, bipartisan legislation to cover children \nof working families. And last year, Congress passed the Work Incentives \nImprovement Act to allow disabled folks to continue working and not \nlose health care benefits.\n  But while these legislative actions are extremely important, they \naffect relatively few Americans. The fact remains, for most uninsured \nand underinsured Americans, the safety net is still the only place to \nturn.\n  Yet the safety net has been seriously damaged in recent years. \nAccording to a recent report by the Institute of Medicine, the health \ncare safety net is ``intact but endangered.''\n  For instance, the 1997 Balanced Budget Act cut payments to \nDisproportionate Share Hospitals and Community health centers. It also \ncut reimbursement to rural health clinics, so critical to providing \ncoverage to rural uninsured individuals. At the same time, Congress \nmandates that emergency departments care for anyone and everyone that \ndarkens their door. Though not a reimbursement issue per se, the EMTALA \ndictates that all ER's care for all individuals, regardless of ability \nto pay.\n  Despite all these developments, there is no entity responsible for \nmaking changes to the safety net. And though SNOPAC will not solve the \nproblem of America's uninsured, it will work to ensure that no holes \ndevelop in the Safety Net. An independent, non-partisan commission, \nmodeled on the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), SNOPAC \nwill include professionals from across the policy and practical \nspectrum of health care. And like MedPAC, SNOPAC will report to the \nrelevant committees of Congress on the status of its mission: tracking \nthe well-being of the health care safety net.\n  Though it's not a panacea, SNOPAC is a positive step toward a \ncoordinated approach in caring for the uninsured. Absent large-scale \nimprovements in the number of insured Americans, we should at least \nwork to monitor and care for what we already have--an intact, but \nendangered, health care safety net.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join me in this effort towards good \nhealth and good sense.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI:\n  S. 3036. A bill to assure that recreation and other economic benefits \nare accorded the same weight as hurricane and storm damage reduction \nbenefits as well as environmental restoration benefits; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                     national beach enhancement act\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwhich will ensure the preservation of our nation's coastal areas. \nProtection of our beaches is paramount; they are not only where we go \nto enjoy the sand and surf, but they also generate a significant \nportion of our nation's revenue.\n  Tourism and recreational activity are extremely important to New \nJersey, especially to our small businesses and shore communities. New \nJersey's $17 billion a year tourism industry is supported by the 160 \nmillion people who visit our 127 miles of beaches each year. This \nspending by tourists totaled $26.1 billion in New Jersey in 1998, a 2 \npercent increase from $25.6 billion in 1997.\n  My state is a microcosm of coastal tourism throughout the United \nStates. Travel and tourism is our Nation's largest industry, employer, \nand foreign-revenue earner, and U.S. beaches are its leading tourist \ndestination. In 1997, total tourism expenditures in U.S. coastal areas \nwas over $185 billion, generating over 2.7 million jobs with a payroll \nof nearly $50 million.\n  Americans are not the only ones eager to enjoy our beaches and \ncoastal regions. They are also the top destination for foreign \ntourists. Each year, the U.S. takes in $4 billion in taxes from foreign \ntourists, while state and local governments receive another $3.5 \nmillion.\n  In Florida alone, foreign tourists spent over $11 billion in 1992, $2 \nbillion of that amount in the Miami Beach area. This Florida spending \ngenerated over $750 million in Federal tax revenues. A recent article \nby Dr. James R.\n\n[[Page S8420]]\n\nHouston, published in the American Shore and Beach Preservation \nJournal, shows that annual tax revenues from foreign tourists in Miami \nBeach are 17 times more than the Federal government spent on the entire \nFederal Shore Protection program from 1950 to 1993. If the Federal \nshare of beach nourishment averages about $10 million a year, the \nFederal government collects about 75 times more in taxes from foreign \ntourists in Florida than it spends restoring that State's beaches.\n  Delaware, one of the smallest states in the Union, is visited by over \n5 million people each year. This, in a state where just over 21,000 \npeople actually live in beach communities and another 373,000 live \nwithin a several hours drive. Beach tourism generates over $173 million \nin expenditures each year for ``The First State.''\n  Equally significant, however, beach erosion results in an estimated \nloss of over 471,000 visitor days a year, a figure which is estimated \nto increase to over 516,000 after five years. A 1998 study by Jack \nFaucett Associates (Bethesda, MD) in cooperation with independent \nconsultants for the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and \nEnvironmental Control shows that during this five-year period, beach \nerosion will cost an estimated $30.2 million in consumer expenditures, \nthe loss of 625 beach area jobs, and the reduction of wages and \nsalaries by $11.5 million. Business profits will drop by $1.6 million \nand State and local tax revenues will decrease by $2.3 million. \nFinally, beach erosion will reduce beach area property values by nearly \n$43 million. The situation in Delaware is indicative of beach erosion \nproblems throughout the coastlines of our nation. Unless we increase \nour efforts to protect and re-nourish our coastline, we jeopardize a \nsignificant portion of our country's revenue.\n  The Federal government spends $100 million a year for the Federal \nShore Protection program. While the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers does a \nbenefit-cost analysis in connection with every shore protection \nproject, that analysis suffers from its own myopia. It places its \ngreatest emphasis on the value of the private property that is \nimmediately adjacent to the coastline. It is not reasonable to assume \nthat a healthy beach with natural dunes and vegetation will benefit \nonly that first row of homes and businesses. Homeowners spend money in \nthe region; hotels attract tourists, who also spend money; local \nresidents who live inland come to the beach to recreate. They too, \nspend money. Countless businesses, from t-shirt vendors to restaurants, \nall depend on these expenditures.\n  Prior to the 1986 Water Resources Development Act, the Army Corps of \nEngineers viewed recreation as an equally important component of its \ncost-benefits analysis. However, the 1986 bill omitted recreation as \nbenefit to be considered, and our coastal communities have suffered. \nIndeed, the economy of our nation has suffered. My legislation would \nmake it clear that recreational benefits will be given the same \nbudgetary priority as storm damage reduction and environmental \nrestoration. Companion legislation has been introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives, by Congressmen Lampson and LoBiondo, and enjoys \nbipartisan support.\n  Beach replenishment efforts ensure that our beaches are protected, \nproperty is not damaged, dunes are not washed away, and the resource \nthat coastal towns rely on for their lifeblood, is preserved. It is \nimperative that federal policy base beach nourishment assistance on the \nentirety of the economic benefits it provides. To limit benefits to \nhurricane or storm damage reduction ignores the equally important \neconomic impact of tourism.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Mr. Frist, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Bryan, and \n        Mr. Thompson):\n  S. 2038. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nupdate the renal dialysis composite rate; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n        the medicare renal dialysis payment fairness act of 2000\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nFrist and Representatives Camp and Thurman in introducing the Medicare \nRenal Dialysis Payment Fairness Act of 2000. This legislation takes \nimportant steps to help sustain and improve the quality of care for \nMedicare beneficiaries suffering from kidney failure.\n  Nationwide, more than 280,000 Americans live with end-stage renal \ndisease (ESRD). In my State of North Dakota, the number of patients \nliving with ESRD is relatively small, just over 600. However, for these \npatients and others across the country, access to dialysis treatments \nmeans the difference between life and death.\n  In 1972, the Congress took important steps to ensure that elderly and \ndisabled individuals with kidney failure receive appropriate dialysis \ncare. At that time, Medicare coverage was extended to include dialysis \ntreatments for beneficiaries with ESRD.\n  Over the last three decades, dialysis facilities have provided \nservices to increasing numbers of kidney failure patients under \nincreasingly strict quality standards; however, during this same time \nframe reimbursement for kidney services has not kept pace with the \nincreasing demands of providing dialysis care.\n  Last year, Senator Frist and I introduced legislation to ensure \ndialysis facilities could continue providing quality dialysis services \nto Medicare beneficiaries. I am happy to say that, based on these \nefforts, dialysis providers received increased Medicare reimbursement \nin fiscal years 2000 and 2001 as part of the Medicare, Medicaid, and S-\nCHIP Refinement Act of 1999.\n  While these efforts were a step in the right direction, a recent \nMedicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) report suggests that we \nmust take further action to sustain patients' access to dialysis \nservices. In particular, MedPAC recommends a 1.2 percent payment \nadjustment for Medicare-covered dialysis services in the next fiscal \nyear. In addition, MedPAC recommends that the Health Care Financing \nAdministration provide an annual review of the dialysis payment rate--a \nreview that most other Medicare-covered services receive each year.\n  I believe these recommendations represent critical adjustments that \nmust be addressed this year. For this reason, I have worked with \nSenator Frist, Representative Camp and Representative Thurman to \ndevelop the Medicare Renal Dialysis Payment Fairness Act of 2000. This \nlegislation would provide the payment rate improvements recommended by \nMedPAC and would establish an annual payment review process for \ndialysis services. This proposal would help ensure all dialysis \nproviders receive reimbursement that is in line with increasing patient \nload and quality requirements. This is particularly important for our \nNation's smaller, rural dialysis providers that on average receive \nMedicare payments to do not adequately reflect costs.\n  As the Congress considers further improvements to the Medicare \nProgram, I urge my colleagues to support this important effort to \nensure patients with kidney failure continue to have access to quality \ndialysis services. I thank my colleagues for working together on this \nbipartisan and bicameral proposal.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Conrad, \nThompson, Bryan, and DeWine this afternoon to introduce the Medicare \nRenal Dialysis Payment Fairness Act of 2000. This bipartisan \nlegislation takes important steps to assure both the quality and \navailability of outpatient dialysis services for Medicare patients with \nend-stage renal disease (ESRD).\n  Almost 30 years ago, Congress recognized the pain and suffering \npatients with end-stage renal disease face, and thus moved to provide \ncoverage for dialysis treatment to this population under the Medicare \nProgram. Today, approximately 300,000 patients nationwide live with \nthis disease and receive services through Medicare. Presently, there \nare 3,423 dialysis facilities throughout the Nation that serve the \nMedicare population, 93 of which are in my home State of Tennessee.\n  However, I fear that a lack of proper reimbursement may adversely \nimpact the quality and availability of dialysis care for Medicare \nbeneficiaries. As the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) \nnoted, the payment rate for the critical dialysis services received by \nMedicare beneficiaries was established in 1983, and had never been \nupdated.\n  Last year, Senator Conrad and I sought to remedy this situation by \nintroducing S. 1449, the Medicare Renal\n\n[[Page S8421]]\n\nDialysis Fair Payment Act of 1999, which provided an update to the \nMedicare reimbursement rate for dialysis services for Fiscal Year 2000. \nThus, I was pleased to see the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 \n(BBRA) include a provision increasing the payment rate by 1.2 percent \nfor Fiscal Year 2000 and 1.2 percent for Fiscal Year 2001.\n  However, the BBRA represented only the first step toward securing \naccess to dialysis services for Medicare patients and ensuring they \nreceive the highest quality of care. The legislation we are introducing \ntoday takes the necessary additional steps, as recommended by MedPAC \nthis year, to assure proper reimbursement levels for dialysis services.\n  Specifically, the ``Medicare Renal Dialysis Payment Fairness Act of \n2000'' provides a 1.2 percent increase in the payment rate for FY 2001, \nin addition to the 1.2 percent update included in the BBRA, providing a \n2.4 percent total increase. This follows MedPAC's analysis of dialysis \ncenter costs that concluded that prices paid by dialysis centers would \nrise by 2.4 percent between Fiscal Year 2000 and 2001.\n  Second, the legislation ensure proper reimbursement in future years \nby requiring the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to develop \na market basket index for dialysis centers that measures input prices \nand other relevant factors and to annually review and update the \npayment rate based upon this index.\n  Overall, the Medicare Renal Dialysis Payment Fairness Act of 2000 \nwill ensure that dialysis facilities receive the proper Medicare \nreimbursement to continue to provide high quality dialysis services to \nthe ESRD population.\n  I am grateful to the National Kidney Foundation, the American \nNephrology Nurses Association, the Renal Physicians Association, the \nNational Renal Administrators Association, and the Renal Leadership \nCouncil for their support of the Medicare Renal Dialysis Payment \nFairness Act of 2000, and I urge my colleagues to support this critical \nmeasure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/12/senate-section/article/S8421-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8421-S8422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 577\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the name of the Senator from Georgia \n(Mr. Miller) was added as a cosponsor of S. 577, a bill to provide for \ninjunctive relief in Federal district court to enforce State laws \nrelating to the interstate transportation of intoxicating liquor.\n\n\n                                 S. 642\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the name of the Senator from Georgia \n(Mr. Miller) was added as a cosponsor of S. 642, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for Farm and Ranch Risk \nManagement Accounts, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 681\n\n  At the request of Mr. Daschle, the name of the Senator from New \nJersey (Mr. Torricelli) was added as a cosponsor of S. 681, a bill to \namend the Public Health Service Act and Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act of 1974 to require that group and individual health \ninsurance coverage and group health plans provide coverage for a \nminimum hospital stay for mastectomies and lymph node dissections \nperformed for the treatment of breast cancer.\n\n\n                                 S. 805\n\n  At the request of Mr. Durbin, the name of the Senator from New Jersey \n(Mr. Torricelli) was added as a cosponsor of S. 805, a bill to amend \ntitle V of the Social Security Act to provide for the establishment and \noperation of asthma treatment services for children, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1020\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the names of the Senator from New \nMexico (Mr. Domenici), the Senator from Mississippi (Mr. Lott), and the \nSenator from Rhode Island (Mr. L.

Res. 353\n\n       Whereas according to the American Cancer Society, in 2000, \n     182,800 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 40,800 \n     women will die from this disease;\n       Whereas in the decade of the 1990's, it is estimated that \n     about 2,000,000 women were diagnosed with breast cancer, \n     resulting in nearly 500,000 deaths;\n       Whereas the risk of breast cancer increases with age, with \n     a woman at age 70 years having twice as much of a chance of \n     developing the disease as a woman at age 50 years;\n       Whereas at least 80 percent of the women who get breast \n     cancer have no family history of the disease;\n       Whereas mammograms, when operated professionally at a \n     certified facility, can provide safe screening and early \n     detection of breast cancer in many women;\n       Whereas experts agree that mammography is the best method \n     of early detection of breast cancer, and early detection is \n     the key to saving lives;\n       Whereas mammograms can reveal the presence of small cancers \n     up to 2 years or more before a regular clinical breast \n     examination or breast self-examination, reducing mortality by \n     more than 30 percent; and\n       Whereas the 5-year survival rate for localized breast \n     cancer is over 96 percent: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 20, 2000, as ``National Mammography \n     Day''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe such \n     day with appropriate programs and activities.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a resolution \ndesignating October 20, 2000, as ``National Mammography Day''. I am \npleased that 54 of my colleagues have endorsed this proposal by \nagreeing to be original cosponsors. I might note that I have introduced \na similar resolution each year since 1993, and on each occasion the \nSenate has shown its support for the fight against breast cancer by \napproving the resolution.\n  Each year, as I prepare to introduce this resolution, I review the \nlatest information from the American Cancer\n\n[[Page S8423]]\n\nSociety about breast cancer. For the year 2000, it is estimated that \nnearly 183,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and slightly \nfewer than 41,000 women will die of this disease.\n  In past years, I have often commented on how gloomy these statistics \nwere. But as I review how these numbers are changing over time, I have \ncome to the realization that it is really more appropriate to be upbeat \nabout this situation. The number of deaths from breast cancer is \nfalling from year to year. Early detection of breast cancer continues \nto result in extremely favorable outcomes: 96 percent of women with \nlocalized breast cancer will survive 5 years or longer. New digital \ntechniques make the process of mammography much more rapid and precise \nthan before. Government programs will provide free mammograms to those \nwho can't afford them. Information about treatment of breast cancer \nwith surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy has exploded, \nreflecting enormous research advances in this disease.\n  So I am feeling quite positive about breast cancer. A diagnosis of \nbreast cancer is not a death sentence, and I encounter long-term \nsurvivors of breast cancer so frequently now on a daily basis that I \nscarcely give it a second thought. And the key to this success is early \ndiagnosis and treatment, with routine periodic mammography being the \nlinchpin of the entire process. Routine mammography can locate a breast \ncancer as much as 2 years before it would be detectable by self-\nexamination. The statistics tell the story: the number of breast cancer \ndeaths is declining despite an increase in the number of breast cancer \ncases diagnosed. More women are getting mammograms, more breast cancer \nis being diagnosed, and more of these breast cancers are discovered at \nan early and highly curable stage.\n  So my message to women is: have a periodic mammogram. Early diagnosis \nsaves lives. But I know many women don't have annual mammograms, \nusually because of either fear or forgetfulness. Some women avoid \nmammograms because they are afraid of what they will find. To these \nwomen, I would say that if you have periodic routine mammograms, and \nthe latest one comes out positive, even before you have any symptoms or \nhave found a lump on self-examination, you have reason to be \noptimistic, not pessimistic. Such early-detected breast cancers are \nhighly treatable.\n  Let me consider an analogous situation. We know that high blood \npressure is a killer, and we are all advised to get our blood pressure \nchecked from time to time. Are we afraid to do this? No. Why not? \nBecause we know that even if high blood pressure is detected on a \nscreening examination, it can be readily and successfully treated. We \nalso know that high blood pressure is not going to go away by itself, \nso if we have it, we should find out about it, get it treated, and move \nahead with our lives.\n  The argument for having periodic routine mammograms to detect breast \ncancer is similar. Most of the time, the examination is reassuringly \nnegative. But if it is positive, and your previous routine mammograms \nwere negative, it means that this cancer has been detected early on, \nwhen it has a high chance of being cured.\n  And then there is forgetfulness. I certainly understand how difficult \nit is to remember to do something that only comes around once each \nyear. I would suggest that this is where ``National Mammography Day'' \ncomes in. This year, National Mammography Day falls on Friday, October \n20, right in the middle of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. On \nthat day, let's make sure that each woman we know picks a specific date \non which to get a mammogram each year, a date that she won't forget: a \nchild's birthday, an anniversary, perhaps even the day her taxes are \ndue. On National Mammography Day, let's ask our loved ones: pick one of \nthese dates, fix it in your mind along with a picture of your child, \nyour wedding, or another symbol of that date, and promise yourself to \nget a mammogram on that date every year. Do it for yourself and for the \nothers that love you and want you to be part of their lives for as long \nas possible.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in the ongoing fight \nagainst breast cancer by cosponsoring and voting for this resolution to \ndesignate October 20, 2000, as National Mammography Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/12/senate-section/article/S8423-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 354--AMENDING PARAGRAPHS 2 AND 3(A) OF RULE XXV AND \n PROVIDING FOR CERTAIN APPOINTMENTS TO THE AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION, AND \nFORESTRY COMMITTEE, THE BANKING, HOUSING, AND URBAN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE, \nTHE FINANCE COMMITTEE, THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMITTEE, AND THE VETERANS' \n                           AFFAIRS COMMITTEE\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a resolution on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Jeffords to commemorate 200 years of \nquality higher education at nationally acclaimed Middlebury College \nlocated in Middlebury, Vermont.\n  In the fall of 1800, a group of distinguished Vermonters petitioned \nthe Vermont General Assembly for the establishment of a new institution \nof higher education in the small agricultural town of Middlebury. On \nNovember 1, 1800 these efforts proved successful when the Vermont \nGeneral Assembly adopted a law to establish a college in Middlebury. \nLess than one week after receiving its charter, Middlebury College \nopened its doors to seven students and one professor in space at the \nlocal grammar school.\n  Over the last two centuries, Middlebury College has evolved from one \nof the first colleges in Vermont into one of the most respected liberal \narts colleges in the Nation. Today, Middlebury has more than two \nthousand students, almost two hundred professors, and a main campus of \nover 250 acres. The campus of was first built beginning in 1810 with \nthree larger stone buildings, each sharing a unique architectural \nstyle. On May 19, 2000, the United States Postal Service issued \npostcards to commemorate the Old Stone Row and the first buildings of \nthe Middlebury College campus.\n  In recognition of 200 years of educating students from across this \ncountry and the world, the Middlebury College Bicentennial Planning \nCommission has designed Celebration 2000 to commemorate this milestone \nin Vermont's and the Nation's educational history. The year-long \nbicentennial celebration honors the people and events that have made \nand continue to make Middlebury College a leader in higher education. \nCelebration 2000 features concerts, plays, and symposia, both on campus \nand at additional locations such as the New York Public Library, and \nthe dedication of a new science building, Bicentennial Hall, with an \nexterior that resembles the Old Stone row and the school's early \narchitectural history. This year-long celebration will culminate later \nthis fall during Founders' Week, a series of events on campus during \nthe first week of November.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this resolution to commend and \ncongratulate Middlebury College on the completion of its first two \nhundred years of educational excellence. I hope my colleagues will join \nSenator Jeffords and me in honoring the contributions of the school, \nits students and its alumni.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr President, I rise today to join my good friend and \ncolleague from Vermont in introducing a Resolution commending and \ncongratulating Middlebury College on 200 years of providing quality \nhigher education in Vermont. It gives me great pleasure in wishing this \nprestigious institution a very happy anniversary.\n  When Middlebury College first opened, seven students and one \nprofessor made up the entire faculty and student body.

The 1982 Treaty protects U.S. \ninvestment and assists Panama in its efforts to develop its economy by \ncreating conditions more favorable for U.S. private investment and \nthereby strengthening the development of its private sector.\n  As explained in the Department of State's report, the Protocol is \nneeded in order to ensure that investors continue to have access to \nbinding international arbitration following Panama's 1996 accession to \nthe Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States \nand Nationals of Other States, done at Washington, March 18, 1965 (the \n``ICSID Convention''). The Protocol provides each Party's consent to \ninternational arbitration of investment disputes under the 1982 Treaty \nbefore the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment \nDisputes, established under the ICSID Convention. The Protocol also \nprovides for arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of \nthe United Nations Commission on International Trade Law. The Protocol \nthus facilitates the use of such procedures by investors of the Parties \nto resolve investment disputes under the 1982 Treaty. The Protocol also \nsets forth each Party's consent to ICSID Additional Facility \narbitration, if Convention Arbitration is not available. Convention \nArbitration would not be available, for example, if either Party \nsubsequently ceased to be a party to the ICSID Convention.\n  I recommend that the Senate consider this Protocol as soon as \npossible, and give its advice and consent to ratification of the \nProtocol at an early date.\n                                                  William J. Clinton.  \nThe White House, September 12, 2000.\n                                  ____\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty Between the Government of \nthe United States of America and the Government of the Republic of \nAzerbaijan Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of \nInvestment, with Annex, signed at Washington on August 1, 1997, \ntogether with an amendment to the Treaty set forth in an exchange of \ndiplomatic notes dated August 8, 2000, and August 25, 2000. I transmit \nalso, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department \nof State with respect to this Treaty.\n  The Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) with Azerbaijan is the fourth \nsuch treaty signed between the United States and a Transcaucasian or \nCentral Asian country. The Treaty will protect U.S. investment and \nassist Azerbaijan in its efforts to develop its economy by creating \nconditions more favorable for U.S. private investment and thereby \nstrengthening the development of its private sector.\n  The Treaty furthers the objectives of U.S. policy toward \ninternational and domestic investment. A specific tenet of U.S. policy, \nreflected in this Treaty, is that U.S. investment abroad and foreign \ninvestment in the United States should receive national treatment. \nUnder this Treaty, the Parties also agree to customary international \nlaw standards for expropriation. The Treaty includes detailed \nprovisions regarding the computation and payment of prompt, adequate, \nand effective compensation for expropriation; free transfer of funds \nrelated to investments; freedom of investments from specified \nperformance requirements; fair, equitable, and most-favored-nation \ntreatment; and the investor's freedom to choose to resolve disputes \nwith the host government through international arbitration.\n  I recommend that the Senate consider this Treaty as soon as possible, \nand give its advice and consent to ratification of the Treaty at an \nearly date.\n                                                  William J. Clinton.  \nThe White House, September 12, 2000.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/12/senate-section/article/S8426-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
