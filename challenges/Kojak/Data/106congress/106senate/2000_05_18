Mr. President, it is my great privilege today to introduce \nto my colleagues in the Senate a very special person who is here with \nus, a long time friend of mine and a true leader, nationally as well as \nin Massachusetts, the Rev. Eugene Rivers.\n  Reverend Rivers is the pastor of the Azusa Christian Community in \nFour Corners, which is an inner-city community in Boston. He honored \nthe Senate today by delivering our opening prayer, asking particularly \nthat each and every one of us are bestowed with the wisdom to turn our \nfears into courage so that we will have the power to make good \ndecisions even in bad situations. I think those words are particularly \nimportant to us in the context of this debate in the last few days.\n  Not only should we be touched by Gene Rivers' words this morning, but \nI emphasize to my colleagues the degree to which the words of this \nperson of the cloth and the acts of life come from his heart. As \nsomeone who knows him and has worked with him and has been inspired by \nhim, I can tell my colleagues that he is the living embodiment of the \nwords he shared with us today. Those words reflect the important work \nthat he has made his life's work--walking often in places of danger, \nalways in places of difficulty, in order to try to bring the word of \nGod and the spirit to our fellow citizens--in fact, the citizens of the \nworld.\n  Gene Rivers comes from a place that understands some of the toughest \nfights in our country. He was born and raised in south Chicago and in \nnorthwest Philadelphia. He found himself in a bad situation as a gang \nmember. He was struggling to break free from the life that he knew was \neither going to take him to jail or to a cemetery.\n  After, from that difficult life of the streets, Reverend Rivers \npersevered and he attended Harvard University and then did studies at \nthe Divinity School. Ultimately, he has returned to the streets to live \nout his inner self in the spirit that commands his life. He has been \npart of what we call the Boston Miracle. As he puts it, he has let God \nuse him to fight the gangs. Most recently, through his tremendous \nefforts in Boston, with Operation 2006 and the Baker House, my staff \nand I have seen Gene Rivers go out into the community, knocking on \ndoors, standing on street corners to develop the services and \nassistance and the inspiration that so many young people need. He works \nvery closely with the law enforcement authorities in helping to defuse \nthe danger of the gangs.\n  As a consequence of his hands-on efforts, we went through, I think, \nalmost a 2-year period in which we had not one young person killed in \nthe city of Boston. He is consistently working to try to defuse those \nkinds of situations. Because of his direct hands-on action, Operation \n2006 reduces juvenile violence and it brings the community together in \nways that perhaps no one in public life could do without that special \nkind of connection.\n  I might add that, since then, Gene Rivers has tackled a much larger \ncall beyond Massachusetts. The Senate this year has become particularly \naware of the devastation taking place in Africa as a result of the AIDS \nepidemic. Gene Rivers has tackled that issue, challenging leaders in \nAfrica, as well as leaders here, to engage in a candid discussion that \ntries to bring us all together in a united effort to deal with this \nterrible scourge. He has helped to make us all aware of the \nresponsibility to do something about this, and he has had an impact.\n  Reverend Rivers was, in fact, the subject of a cover story in \nNewsweek magazine, I think a little over a year ago. They described him \nas an ``intellectual burst of firecrackers spinning off ideas and \nenergy.''\n  He has been called an ``impolitic preacher'' and a man of action. \nToday, I simply want to thank him for always answering the call of \nleadership, for battling, from every day for the souls and safety of \nour inner-city kids to standing up to halt the spread of AIDS \nthroughout Africa. I thank him for being a great voice of our \ngeneration, and he graces us with his wisdom and his prayers. I extend \nmy heartfelt thanks to Rev. Eugene Rivers for his guidance, his \nfriendship, and his leadership.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/18/senate-section/article/S4122-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4122]]\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The Honorable Lincoln Chafee led the Pledge of Allegiance, as \nfollows:\n\n       I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of \n     America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation \n     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/18/senate-section/article/S4122-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              APPOINTMENT OF ACTING PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask my good friend from Kansas whether or not the \nadditional 5 minutes will come out from the time that is allocated to \nhis side.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. The Senator is correct. Last night I asked, under a \nunanimous consent request, for 20 minutes. I discovered this morning it \nwas 15 minutes. I am merely asking for an additional 5 minutes. \nObviously, it will come out of our time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have no objection if it comes out of their time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator is recognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise to lend my support to the proposed \nlegislation by my colleagues, Senator Byrd and Senator Warner, in \nreference to U.S. obligations and involvement in Kosovo and, in a \nlarger sense, in NATO as well, and in opposition to the amendment to \nstrike that has been offered by the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan.\n  In this regard, I am a cosponsor of the language introduced several \nweeks ago by the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator Warner. I had the privilege of being in the \nPresiding Officer's chair when he introduced his legislation. Senator \nWarner, after many trips to Kosovo and firsthand experience, became \nconvinced that our united efforts in the Balkans would have no chance \nof success unless promises made by our allies were kept--obligations \nfor humanitarian assistance and reconstruction so crucial to any \npositive outcome.\n  Senator Warner, in effect, issued a strong warning to our valued \nallies, and I believe his legislation has become a catalyst for action. \nAlmost every contributing NATO ally and the officials within the \nadministration, has assured the chairman, that they have been, are, or \nwill step up to the plate and fulfill their financial obligations.\n  I feel with certainty that President Clinton can and will certify the \nWarner requirements have been met, so essential to achieving peace and \nstability in Kosovo. Regardless of how Members feel about this \nlegislation or U.S. involvement in Kosovo, we owe Senator Warner a debt \nof gratitude.\n  The second part of this legislation has been authored by Senator \nRobert Byrd. His knowledge of the U.S. Constitution has no equal in \nthis body and his tireless efforts in defending and protecting the \nconstitutional prerogatives of this institution will be among the many \nlegacies he will leave us.\n  Senator Byrd has a not-so-unique conviction. He believes, and I \nbelieve, that we should balance the need for Presidential flexibility \nin foreign affairs and our constitutional power of the purse.\n  His legislation signals the end to open-ended--and I emphasize the \nword ``open-ended''--U.S. peacekeeping operations in Kosovo and by \nperiodic reporting promote actual consultation with the Congress and \nenable us to abide by the Constitution's directives on the separation \nof powers.\n  I certainly identify with Senator Byrd's purpose, as I authored a \nsomewhat similar reporting requirement in 1998 during consideration of \nthe Defense appropriations bill, as did Senators Cleland and Snowe. \nThis is not new ground we are plowing. The reporting requirement was a \nlittle different. It was after the fact, and it was a foregone \nconclusion in terms of our involvement. We were trying to better \ndetermine the mission, the cost, the timing, et cetera. Again, this is \nnot new ground we are plowing.\n  Notwithstanding the actual content of the Byrd-Warner amendment, it \ncertainly has caused quite a fuss, so much of a fuss that the Senate of \nthe United States is actually in the midst of a foreign policy debate, \nsome $15 billion and 6 or 7 years into intervention in the Balkans.\n  We actually have Senators in both the Republican conference and the \nDemocratic caucus involved in some very spirited debate about the U.S. \npolicy in the Balkans, so emblematic of the so-called Clinton doctrine. \nImagine that, foreign policy actually getting\n\n[[Page S4123]]\n\nsome attention in the middle of an election year and a Presidential \ncampaign. That is good. That is not bad; that is good. We need this \ndebate.\n  In fact, I know of two Senators, the Senator from Georgia, Mr. \nCleland, and this Senator from Kansas who have braved the morning \nbusiness hours, always held in the late afternoons, to launch what we \ncall a foreign policy dialog and discuss at length our vital national \nsecurity interests, the direction of our foreign policy, and the use of \nforce and related topics.\n  A few Senators have joined us, particularly Senators Hutchinson, \nHagel, Lugar, and Levin. It was a good dialog. We will have more. But \nthis debate is about an actual amendment calling for the Senate to meet \nour obligations and responsibilities to be an equal partner with the \nexecutive in determining where and why our American men and women in \nuniform are put in harm's way, and for what purpose, and commensurate \nwith our commitments in regard to our allies.\n  This is almost beyond the hopes of Senator Cleland and myself, who \nhave been trying to attract attention to this topic for the better part \nof this session.\n  My colleagues, this legislation does us, our military, and the \nAmerican people a big favor, it seems to me. It places the Congress \ninto a process, a process where we already have a constitutional \nobligation. Simply put, if we, as a body, believe our continued \npresence in Kosovo is justified, then we do so by voting to stay.\n  Second, the provision asks the United States to provide a plan to \nreturn the peacekeeping responsibility--I emphasize that, the \npeacekeeping responsibility--to our allies in Europe by the first of \nOctober of next year--18 months away.\n  Last, it asks the President to certify that the E.U. and the European \nmembers of NATO meet the obligations for the humanitarian assistance \nand the reconstruction they have promised.\n  This legislation has created quite a fuss. Supporters have been \nlabeled--and I am quoting here--as ``isolationists,'' ``Cassandras,'' \nand ``blind to the facts.''\n  The critics of this legislation say, if this amendment is adopted, \nEurope will be plunged into darkness, NATO will resemble Humpty-Dumpty, \nand 50 years of U.S.-Europe cooperation will be in danger, not to \nmention the peace and stability in the Balkans. Really?\n  My colleagues, to suggest that if we ask to bring our combat troops \nhome after an orderly turnover to European peacekeepers, to ask the \nCongress to vote on their approval or their disapproval of continued \nU.S. participation in Kosovo, and to ask that the President certify \nthat the Europeans will meet their funding obligations they promised--\nif that represents a lessening of our commitment to Europe, this, to \nme, is histrionics of amazing proportions.\n  Let the critics, let all of my colleagues who oppose this \nlegislation, answer the following questions:\n  First: Are the Europeans capable of maintaining the peace in Kosovo? \nThat is a very important question.\n  Second: Are the Europeans solvent enough to meet their promised \nfiscal responsibility? I think we all know the answer to that.\n  Does the Congress have any responsibility for foreign policy?\n  Have we asked the President, time and time again, with numerous \nreporting requirements--as I have indicated, as Senator Cleland, \nSenator Snowe, and I have over 2 years ago--to better inform and \ninclude Congress in foreign policy decisions?\n  Would the United States respond militarily if a conflict erupted in \nEurope following the passage of this legislation?\n  Does an ill-defined, poorly executed, and ineffective policy in the \nBalkans have a direct negative effect on our military and our remaining \nmilitary obligations around the world?\n  I think the answers, my colleagues and critics, is yes to all of \nthose questions.\n  In fact, I think it is a bit condescending or paternalistic, if not \noutright arrogant, to suggest, as some have stated, that without direct \nU.S. participation--we are talking about ground troops now, not \nlogistics, not airlift, not intelligence--that the European military \nwould be unable to maintain the peace and war will spread to \nneighboring nations.\n  Those of us who are privileged to serve on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee have met repeatedly with our foreign counterparts to learn \nrepeatedly that the European Union members are developing a rapid \ndeployment force with defensive capability--they call it the ESDI--that \nthey say will be, or is right now, capable of maintaining the peace in \nthe Balkans. Are they wrong? We have 17 months to really try to figure \nthat out.\n  As an aside, would our peacekeepers assume a combat role? Do I recall \npress accounts where Americans are no longer permitted to come to the \nassistance of other peacekeepers in other sectors, in certain \nsituations, following a skirmish in the German sector?\n  So let me get this right. We are peacekeepers, but we cannot withdraw \nbecause of a possible problem that could break out; but we are not \nallowed to go to other sectors to assist if a problem breaks out? \nSomething is wrong here.\n  Do the opponents of this legislation actually think that because of \nthis provision, the United States will in fact become isolationists? Do \nopponents think by passing this provision, it signals an end to our \nparticipation in NATO or in Europe? That argument is absurd. I think \nthe opponents know it. That is not the issue.\n  Aside from fulfilling our constitutional obligations, the issue is \nthis: The U.S. military is being deployed all over the world by this \nadministration at rates far above that seen in regard to the cold war. \nWe must ensure that we have the forces to be able to respond to threats \nto our vital national security interests.\n  The point is not to debate whether we should have gone to war in \nKosovo--those 20-20 hindsight lessons learned are still in progress, \nand they should be--but rather to decide how long we will keep draining \nlimited U.S. resources when we still cannot define what our long-term \nobjectives in Kosovo are, or when the Europeans are fully capable of \nperforming the peacekeeping mission again, and they have committed to \nproviding the reconstruction resources and the resources for \nhumanitarian relief.\n  This legislation is, in fact, in concert with the new Combined Joint \nTask Force mechanism adopted by NATO during the Washington summit. That \nis the summit that was held last spring. In this regard, we all left \ntown and the NATO ambassadors stayed here. They adopted a new Strategic \nConcept. I doubt if many Senators have read the new Strategic Concept. \nI did.\n  I am a little concerned about our mission in that regard. I even had \nan amendment, that was adopted, that asked the President to certify \nwhether we had obligations and responsibilities on all these new \nmissions in regard to the Strategic Concept.\n\n  In that Strategic Concept, passed last fall, largely at the request \nof our European allies, the task force allows NATO members to utilize--\nlisten up, my colleagues--the task force allows NATO members to utilize \nnoncombat NATO resources in support of an operation that is conducted \nby a coalition of willing nations without requiring all alliance \nmembers to participate in it.\n  That is the concept. That is what this legislation does.\n  There is no reason this CJTF plan would not allow the United States \nto continue to provide--as the distinguished chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee said over and over again in this debate--airlift, \nlogistics, intelligence, and, yes, peacekeeping support.\n  What is the end game here? Not only are there no clear objectives \nthat would end our involvement in Kosovo, but there is no \nunderstanding, at least from this Senator's standpoint, of what \nconstitutes ``winning the peace.'' I would like somebody to tell me.\n  I would like somebody to tell me, after years of discussion and \nhearings, especially in the Intelligence Committee and Armed Services \nCommittee, the President, Secretary Albright or National Security \nAdviser Berger or Gen. Wesley Clark, who is back in Washington after a \nvery tough duty assignment that he conducted so well, or my colleagues \nwho are so critical of this amendment: What is it that winning the \npeace in Kosovo means?\n  Is it harmonious coexistence of the Serb and the Albanian population \nin\n\n[[Page S4124]]\n\nsome yet to be defined autonomous or semiautonomous region called \nKosovo? Is it when the level of violence, Serb on Albanian, Albanian on \nSerb, Albanian on Albanian or Serb on Serb or any combination of those, \nhas been reduced to a point that CNN no longer covers it? Or is it when \nthe western nations have kept the peace long enough for generations to \npass and the great grandchildren of the combatants no longer remember \nthe atrocities they inflicted on one another?\n  I am all for winning a peace. I don't know of anybody who is not. But \nI am concerned, and I am afraid the reality is that the U.S. cannot \nafford to wait. We are not talking about now. We are talking about \nOctober from October, 18 months. I say this not out of a lack of \ncompassion for the inflicted innocents of Kosovo--those who I met and \nwhose pleas I have heard and the memories of which I will carry \nforever--but because our U.S. military is stretched and strained and \ngrowing hollow once again, and our world commitments are too great to \nallow us to stay in Kosovo indefinitely.\n  Some time ago, June 19, 1998, Senator Cleland and Senator Snowe \npassed an amendment calling for a report from the Executive, what clear \nand distinct objectives guide the activities of the United States in \nthe Balkans, what the President has identified on the basis of those \nobjectives as the date or set of conditions that define the end point \nof the operation. That was 2 years ago.\n\n  There are findings here that pretty well underscore the concern and \nthe frustration we have had, all of us, in a bipartisan way. We have a \nMay 3, 1994, Presidential Decision Directive 25 declaring that American \nparticipation in the United Nations and other peace operations will \ndepend in part--this was before Kosovo; this is Bosnia--on whether the \nrole of the U.S. forces is tied to clear objectives and an end point \nfor U.S. participation can be identified.\n  I think the distinguished chairman's amendment and that of Senator \nByrd is commensurate with the Presidential directive. I had an \namendment, as I indicated, to the Defense appropriations bill, saying: \nNone of the funds appropriated on or otherwise made available, et \ncetera, could be obligated or expended for any additional deployment of \nforces--this is before Kosovo and the bombing, all of that--until the \nfollowing questions were answered: The reasons why the deployment is in \nthe national security interests of the United States; the number of \nU.S. military personnel; the mission and objectives, et cetera; the \nexit strategy.\n  About 6 months to a year later, we finally got a response. I can tell \nyou that the mission has changed dramatically. Then we all wanted to \nsafeguard the return of the refugees and provide a safe haven and end \nthe fighting. Today, I am not sure if we can define ``winning the \npeace.''\n  A GAO report that just came says: On the eve of the Senate vote to \nset a deadline for withdrawing American troops from Kosovo. A GAO \nreport released today said that prospects for lasting peace in Kosovo \nare bleak. It says it will take another 5 years. Maybe we should have \nan amendment by those opposed to this amendment simply stating that the \nGAO indicates there is going to be another 5 years and simply to go \nahead and say that, that we tell the truth in regards to how long it is \ngoing to take.\n  Last week in our foreign policy dialog, Senator Lugar asked the \nquestion: Are we committed to NATO, after the lessons hopefully learned \nfollowing the isolationist policies of World War I and all we have \nworked to achieve in the 50 years since World War II? Are we still \ncommitted to Europe in that their security involves our security? The \nanswer is yes. His point is well taken. That is not the issue.\n  I submit the conduct of foreign policy is just as important as the \nalleged or stated goal. And there is the rub for this Senator. Some day \nI hope to pull together all of the information and reports I have \nstacked up in my office and address the concern, the frustration, in \nregard to the planning, the intelligence, the conduct, the law of \nunintended effects of the Kosovo and Bosnia operations, but now is not \nthe appropriate time.\n  Upon returning from Kosovo and talking with one of the colonels in \ncharge, who was a member of the Airborne, I asked him what he did from \nthe time he got up in the morning until the end of the day, other than \nthe briefing we had. He indicated there was some progress being made.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be granted \nanother 2 minutes to close.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I assume that comes off their time?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I asked the colonel what he was proud of, what kind of \nprogress he had made. That was the trip that we had in February to \nKosovo. He indicated that finally they had found somebody who agreed to \nserve as a schoolbus driver for the Serb children. Unfortunately, there \nwere no Serb schoolchildren in Urisivic, and they would not have been \nallowed to attend the Kosovar school had they been there. In addition, \nthere would have had to have been a separate curriculum and separate \nteachers. But they found a schoolbus driver who was willing to drive \nthe schoolbus if, in fact, there was schoolchildren.\n  These troops were guarding six Serb families in what was called Serb \nAlley. They were escorted by armored vehicles to shop and get groceries \nonce a week. These families are staying with the hope that their \nyoungsters would return some day, if they are, in fact, still part of \nSerbia, and so they could continue their businesses.\n  I could go on with example after example. Basically, we asked him \nwhat he spent most of his time on. He said, Albanian violence on \nAlbanian. The basic question is, within the next 18 months that we \nfigure out if, in fact, Europe has the capability to conduct the \npeacekeeping operations. This is not a pullout. This is not an \nautomatic retreat. All this is, is for the Congress of the United \nStates to assume its constitutional responsibility at the end of 18 \nmonths, if the President requests it and says it is in our vital \nnational interests, that we vote to stay. I, for one, would vote to \nstay if, in fact, the President looked me in the eye and said that was \nthe case. I think under the circumstances I have made my point.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, under the standing order, the vote on this \nissue will occur at 2:30, give or take a few minutes on either side. \nSenator Levin has, under his control, 2 hours 45 minutes. The Senator \nfrom Virginia has roughly an hour and a half or less, of which 1 hour \nis reserved to our distinguished colleague, Mr. Byrd of West Virginia. \nThus far, the Senator from Virginia is desirous of trying to \naccommodate those who wish to speak in support of the amendment. I have \nthe names of Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Gregg, Mr. \nBurns, Mr. Inhofe, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Thomas, and Mrs. Hutchison of Texas. \nI am going to be right here to do the very best I can to accommodate \nall.\n  Time is going to move very swiftly, and I hope Senators will contact \nthe managers and indicate the times convenient for them to speak.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if my good friend will yield for a \nquestion as to whether we might be able to schedule----\n  Mr. WARNER. On your time because my clock is ticking.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It will be brief and on my time. Senator Lautenberg is \nscheduled to go next under the unanimous consent agreement. Can we \nschedule a speaker on your side, perhaps?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, Senator Inhofe will be seeking recognition, and \nperhaps 10 minutes would be agreeable. Would that be agreeable?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would like to have 12, if I could.\n  Mr. WARNER. We will give the Senator 12.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that Senator DeWine be recognized \nfor 10 minutes immediately after Senator Inhofe, and then does the \nSenator know who would be ready on his side?\n  Mr. WARNER. I reserve 8 minutes for a Senator in support of the \namendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. After that, Senator Kerry of Massachusetts could go on our \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S4125]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I add that following Senator Kerry, I will \nhave a speaker for about 7 minutes. I thank the Chair and my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized, \nunder the previous order, to speak for up to 20 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank Senator Levin for the courtesy \nof being able to speak at this time. I believe very strongly in the \nissue which is before us. I am in opposition to section 2410 in the \nmilitary construction appropriations bill, which in the view of most, I \nthink it is fair to say, effectively terminates the U.S. military role \nin Kosovo. I opposed this amendment when it was offered in committee, \nand I am proud to join with Senator Levin in offering an amendment to \nstrike it here in the full Senate.\n  Last year, the Armed Forces of the U.S., our NATO allies, and other \ncountries, valiantly fought to stop the killing in Kosovo. They ended \nSlobodan Milosevic's brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing against the \nAlbanians and prevented his genocidal warfare from being carried out to \nits full extent.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I have made many visits to the area. I \nwatched with admiration and awe when I saw our fliers flying out of \nAviano, Italy, to the front in Kosovo. That flight--in a fighter plane \nthere is not much room--typically would take up to 8 or 9 hours to \ncomplete. It also needed four to five refuelings in the air to keep \nthat pilot and that equipment going. It was an incredibly well-done \ncampaign. Our pilots' morale and commitment was second to nothing I \nhave ever seen. I served 3 years in World War II, so I have seen war \ndirectly before. I remember even then, when everybody was so committed, \nhow sometimes the morale would flag after a period of time. But these \npilots would get in those planes almost daily and exhaust themselves in \ncarrying out their missions. They were at high, high risk.\n  Fortunately, with good planning, skilled pilots, skilled crews and \nground personnel, we only had one plane go down, and the rescue of that \npilot is something that will live in the annals of military history--\nhow they scooped him up in the middle of the night in a carefully \nplanned evacuation. They got him and brought him home safely. When I \nmet him a couple of days later, he wanted to fly again and was ready to \ngo back and do his duty.\n\n  In Kosovo, we watched hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of \npeople being uprooted from their homes--men, women, and children. A few \nmen they would take away.\n  Even before the air campaign, I met a family in Albania where they \nlifted grandpa up to cross the mountains along with lots of little \nkids--about five of them--to cross the mountains to try to protect \nthemselves. It was a sad story they related. They got to Albania to \ntheir relatives and slept on the floor and thought they were in heaven.\n  This was a genocidal act, if we have ever seen one. It was a brutal \nmassacre involving the worst crimes that one could imagine--mutilation, \nrape. It was a terrible situation. We were compelled sometimes by our \nheartstrings more perhaps than our planning to intervene, and to say to \nthe world you can't do that kind of killing while civilized nations \nexist around the world. We violated that, if we look at Africa. But we \nhad a direct interest there.\n  When we think now of just pulling out--and I will say arbitrarily. I \nhate to disagree with two very distinguished and good friends in this \nSenate, the distinguished Senator from Virginia, chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee--I don't like to argue with him. He is too smart. He \nhas too much knowledge--and the Senator from West Virginia, not in a \ndifferent category. But I disagree with them on this very important \ndecision that is about to be made.\n  In my view, and in the view of the Senate in the past, the United \nStates and our allies were right to act last year in Operation Allied \nForce. And we were right to stay in Kosovo to accomplish our goals in \nOperation Joint Guardian.\n  We won the war. Now we have to ensure that victory by maintaining the \npeace.\n  Mr. President, the discussion and the debate on this provision since \nthe Appropriations Committee markup has shed considerable light on the \nByrd-Warner amendment and its consequences.\n  Most immediately, it ties our military presence in Kosovo to burden-\nsharing criteria for European reconstruction and humanitarian aid. They \nare doing it.\n  It has been my belief for a long time that our allies must do more \nburden-sharing. I talked about it with Japan; I talked about it with \nSaudi Arabia; I talked about it with South Korea--that there has to be \nburden sharing by our allies. I believe that the European countries \nshould fulfill their broad commitment to take the lead in the \nreconstruction of Kosovo, as well as their specific aid pledges.\n  But I don't think threatening to reduce our peacekeeping presence is \na constructive way to speed up European aid disbursement.\n  More importantly, I don't think anyone can predict with any certainty \nthat the President will be able to meet the burden-sharing \ncertification requirements by July 15 as this bill requires. July 15, \n2000, is not very far away. Administration people--top people at OMB--\nsay it is unlikely that it can be done. They are saying it certainly \ncannot be done now, and I know some of my colleagues who supported the \namendment in the committee had a different understanding about whether \nor not the certification of the allies meeting their obligation could \nbe done at this time. It can't be.\n  If the Europeans fail to meet even one of the yardsticks, U.S. funds \nfor military operations could only be used to withdraw U.S. forces.\n  This provision could force U.S. troops to withdraw from Kosovo this \nJuly, 2 months from now. I think even some of the sponsors of the \nmeasure would consider this highly undesirable.\n\n  But let us suppose the Europeans do indeed fulfill their aid pledges \nas is required, after the first phase, which is July of this year, \n2000. What happens then?\n  Section 2410 in this bill is quite clear on this point: Unless the \nPresident gets explicit congressional authorization in the form of a \njoint resolution, the next President will have to pull our troops out \nof the NATO-led peacekeeping mission in Kosovo by July of next year at \nthe latest.\n  Just a reminder: The Second World War ended in August of 1945. We had \ntroops stationed in Germany and Japan. We still have troops stationed \nin Europe and Japan as a result of that war. After more than 50 years, \nwe still have troops there. We still have troops in South Korea as a \nresult of that war. Why? Because we have determined we are better off \nkeeping the peace than fighting another war.\n  I believe that is the attitude that ought to dominate. We were never \nasked permission to keep those troops there. Two-hundred thousand \nAmericans have been stationed around the world--in Japan and Germany, \nin the Pacific and European theaters. We were never asked if it was OK \nto continue. It is automatically thrown into the budget. Why, I ask, \nisn't that question raised? Why doesn't someone say, hey, if the \nburden-sharing falls behind--mind you, there was a time when it was way \nbehind, and I fought very hard to get that up to date--why don't we \nwrite legislation that would say, should one of those countries--Japan, \nSouth Korea, or Germany--fall behind in fulfilling their share of the \nburden, pull our troops out arbitrarily? Just pull them out. One would \nnever dare think of that.\n  It has been 9 years since we concluded the war in the Persian Gulf. \nWe have 9,000 troops stationed there in harm's way. We have lost a \nbunch of our people during the last 2 years because of an attack on a \nbarracks. But we still have 9,000 people there monitoring the no-fly \nzones and making sure we have reserve troops to move in in case Iraq \ngets frisky and attacks again. I do not hear anybody saying, OK, look, \ndone with; let's get out of there. The reason we don't do it is common \nsense. It is military sense. It is foreign policy sense.\n  We are leaders because of the actions we take. That is the position \nAmerica is in. This debate, I think, is a real tough one because there \nare two very popular Senators who are offering this amendment. I know \nthey don't want to win this battle based on their popularity, I am \nsure, but the fact of the matter is this is a very important policy \ndecision. Proponents of this measure argue that they are upholding the\n\n[[Page S4126]]\n\nrole of the Congress in deciding when and where to send our troops into \nharm's way.\n  I just gave you a list of some places where we have troops. We all \nknow that South Korea is on the border with North Korea, and our troops \ncould very easily be in harm's way.\n  The President asked Congress to support his decision for U.S. Armed \nForces to participate in the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia. \nUnlike the House, the Senate, on March 23, 1999, on the eve of the \nfirst air strikes, adopted Senate Concurrent Resolution 21 authorizing \nU.S. participation in the NATO air campaign.\n  The issue now is not authorization for offensive military action but \ncontinued deployment of U.S. troops in a peacekeeping mission that is \ncarried out with our NATO allies and other nations.\n  Congress has in the past used the constitutional power of the purse \nto support or to end U.S. participation in peacekeeping missions. For \nexample, in 1993, the Senate adopted an amendment offered by the \nSenator from West Virginia to cut off funding for the U.S. \nparticipation in peacekeeping operations in Somalia after the tragic \ndeath of U.S. marines. The Congress has never passed a joint resolution \nauthorizing deployment of U.S. troops in a peacekeeping mission and has \nnever before required the President to seek one.\n\n  In fact, Congress has generally supported U.S. deployments abroad by \nproviding funding. In my view, that is what we should do right now for \nOperation Joint Guardian in Kosovo.\n  Historically, when our armed forces have prevailed in war, we have \ncounted on our armed forces to remain deployed to consolidate our \nvictory, to keep the hard won peace, to ensure that our values of \ndemocracy and human rights are respected.\n  The distinguished Senator from Virginia knows that. He was in the \nmilitary for some time. He headed one of our most important divisions \nof the military. He knows after a conflict is over, we don't just walk \naway, pack up our bags, fold the tent, and go home. That is impossible.\n  Remember, this whole military engagement started late because we \ncouldn't get agreement among our NATO allies. It was in March of last \nyear, just over a year ago. We are being asked to continue this \noperation. We ought not put strings on it that impair the ability of \nthe President to make decisions.\n  After more than half a century, in the war in which I was honored to \nserve, we still have the troops in Europe. I haven't heard my \ncolleagues demanding we withdraw from those situations unless \nexplicitly authorized by a joint resolution in the Congress. In fact, \nin all of my years in this body, I have never been asked to authorize \nthe deployment of United States forces in Germany, Japan, Korea, or \nmany other places, other than by authorizing and appropriating funds to \ncontinue those deployments.\n  The alternative in this bill would not really leave it to the next \nPresident to decide whether to continue the deployment of U.S. troops \nin Kosovo, as the sponsors have asserted. Rather, section 2410 requires \nthat the pullout by July 1, 2001, essentially be a done deal during \nPresident Clinton's term of office.\n  Do we want to do that? I have a short term remaining, and I share the \nsame schedule as the President. I am out of office in just a few \nmonths. To say that my successor ought to do exactly what I have done, \nHeaven forbid, we would never consider that. Do we want to tie the \nhands of the next President of the United States? We don't even know \nwhich party that President will come from.\n  Under section 2410, this President, President Clinton, must ``develop \na plan, in consultation with appropriate foreign governments, by which \nNATO member countries, with the exception of the United States, and \nappropriate non-NATO countries, will provide, not later than July 1, \n2001, any and all ground combat troops necessary to execute Operation \nJoint Guardian or any successor operation in Kosovo.''\n  This President, President Clinton, must submit ``an interim plan for \nthe achievement of the plan's objectives'' to Congress by September 30, \n2000. That means President Clinton has to plan for a pullout and \nprevail upon our allies to pick up the slack within the next few \nmonths.\n  I am not trying to protect President Clinton's initiatives. I am \ntrying to protect the President's initiative, whoever that President \nmay be. Whether it is Al Gore or George W. Bush, our next President \nwould have to reverse course to fulfill our small share of the burden \nto keep the peace in Kosovo, to keep the soldiers, the brutes from \nattacking the men and women. By the way, that could be from the \nAlbanians to the Serbs, or the Serbs to the Albanians.\n  Kosovo is a tinderbox. In my view, this part of the bill puts a fuse \non that tinderbox. If we pass it, we will light that fuse.\n  I hope my colleagues now understand the issue posed by section 2410 \nof this bill.\n  It is not about burden-sharing. We don't need to threaten to pull our \ntroops out to make a point that the Europeans need to fulfill their \ncommitments to take a lead in the reconstruction effort.\n\n  This is not about the prerogatives of Congress. We can exercise our \nrights by providing or denying funds to continue to deploy. We have \nevery right to do that.\n  This is not about presenting the next President with a decision on a \nnational security issue, since it would instead present the next \nPresident with a fait accompli, a done deal.\n  The issue now before the Senate is whether to force the President, \nthis President, to withdraw U.S. troops from Kosovo in this year, or at \nthe latest by July of 2001, hoping our allies will go on without us. If \nthey fail to, are we ready to bring those pilots back and assemble our \narmada, when we could avoid that? It is a mission that carries some \ndanger, there is no doubt about it. Our brave men and women are there \nto do that. They are well trained and ready to take on the obligation.\n  The issue we are deciding in the Senate is about policy and about \nmaking policy. What we do is immediately strap the hands of the \nPresident and the military leaders in our country, a pretty bright \ngroup. We strap their hands behind their backs and say: Sorry, we've \ndecided to subject this to a perhaps appropriate political or power \ndiscussion.\n  The policy now codified in this bill is against the national security \ninterests of the United States.\n  Why should we support the continued deployment of U.S. forces in the \npeacekeeping mission in Kosovo? Let me give you some reasons.\n  First, leadership. U.S. leadership in Europe and around the world \ndoes not just mean having modern and effective armed forces backed by a \nnuclear deterrent. U.S. leadership does not mean just defending our \nterritory, our citizens at home, or our supply of foreign oil. U.S. \nleadership means standing up for our interests and values and standing \nup for those who cannot themselves prevent genocide, as we have done \nand should continue to do in Kosovo.\n  The second reason is burden-sharing. United States aircraft, the best \ntechnology flown by the best pilots, flew most of the missions in the \nair campaign against Yugoslavia, but many of our allies were there with \nus providing aircraft, bases, and other critical resources.\n  The Europeans have agreed to bear most of the burden of peacekeeping \nand reconstruction in Kosovo, and while some assistance has been slow \nin coming they are unquestionably doing the lion's share of the tasks \nwe now face.\n  The United States contributes fewer than 6,000 of more than 45,000 \nNATO troops deployed in Kosovo for Operation Joint Guardian. This is \nmore than a token presence; we have accepted responsibility for \nsecurity in a sector of Kosovo and have the robust force necessary to \ndo the job right without unnecessary risk. But this limited role shows \nour allies that we understand the importance of doing our part to \nachieve a common interest.\n  The third reason is peace and stability in the Balkans and in Europe. \nMaintaining a significant U.S. presence in a robust, NATO-led force \nlets the Serbs and the Kosovar Albanians know that the future of Kosovo \nand its people will not be determined by renewed ethnic violence. Over \ntime, and with a strengthened civilian effort, this should open the way \nto development of civil society and self-government in Kosovo and a \nnegotiated solution on its international status.\n\n[[Page S4127]]\n\n  Maintaining peace in Kosovo helps prevent a wider war which could \notherwise draw in NATO allies as combatants. In contrast, withdrawal of \nU.S. forces would likely weaken Operation Joint Guardian. The Kosovar \nAlbanians and the Serbs would instead rearm and prepare to resume \nfighting for control of territory once our allies join us on the \nsidelines. The killing we intervened to stop would eventually resume, \nwith devastating consequences.\n\n  The fourth reason we should continue our limited role in Operation \nJoint Guardian is credibility.\n  If we show the world that we don't have the resources or the \npolitical will to stay on the ground in Kosovo, then all our potential \nenemies will believe they can prevail simply by waiting us out. We were \nfar too reluctant to use ground forces or even helicopters to stop the \nkilling in the first place. Do we really want to cut and run now?\n  Finally, we should maintain our forces in the peacekeeping mission in \nKosovo to maintain the NATO alliance which is vital to our national \nsecurity.\n  The nations of the European Union, in trying to deepen their unity, \nare developing a European Security and Defense Identity, or ESDI. We \nare at a critical juncture in the evolution of the NATO, as we work to \ngive the European Union a stronger identity and more autonomy within \nthe alliance rather than dividing it. Failing to stay on the ground to \naddress a threat to European security would reinforce calls for Europe \nto make unilateral decisions on the use of military force.\n  We must not undermine the unity of purpose and unity of action that \nhas been the strength of an alliance which has been a mainstay of our \nnational security for more than half a century.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will look at this in the context \nof other decisions we have made about our military presence and its \nnecessity. We will look at it in terms of whether or not in this \nChamber, in these offices, we are making decisions that should be \nreserved for the military. Let's hear from them. We heard from General \nClark, one of the brightest leaders we have had in the military in the \nhistory of this country. He said this could be disaster. Montenegro and \nother nearby countries could explode with Milosevic's ambition; he has \nbeen looking at Montenegro, salivating for the opportunity to get in \nthat small division of Yugoslavia and absorb it.\n  So to maintain the strength of NATO, to preserve our own credibility, \nto keep the peace in the Balkans and Europe, to uphold our commitment \nto burden-sharing, and to demonstrate United States leadership, the \nUnited States Senate should reject Section 2410 of the Military \nConstruction Appropriations bill. Instead we should support our Armed \nForces deployed in Kosovo by voting for the Levin amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 minutes on my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague. We \nhave been privileged to serve together for many years. The Senator \ndraws on personal experience, having served in World War II in the \nconcluding chapters of the war in Europe. The Senator's opinion, in my \njudgment, is to be respected. I regret we are on different sides.\n  As I listened very carefully to the speech, the theme time and time \nagain was, our allies, our allies. And that is important. Senator Byrd \nyesterday recounted the history from World War I and World War II. Time \nand time again, we have always been in partnership with the allies for \nthat portion of Europe. We will do so in the future.\n  We have 100,000 in NATO. Time and time again, I get the feeling that \npeople who are trying to strike this provision have no confidence in \nthe ability of the Congress of the United States, acting at the \ndirection and request of the next President, to make a proper decision \nfor national security.\n  Those who select a vote to take this out, think about your \nconstituency: $2 billion of taxpayers' money expended on Kosovo; yet \nthere is no conclusion as to how this is going to be spent over the \nyears, how long we will be there. What we are trying to do is put some \ndiscipline in the Congress of the United States to assume its \nresponsibilities and to involve itself in a coequal way with the \nPresident of the United States. That is not asking too much for \nhometown America which is supplying these dollars and supplying the men \nand women who proudly wear their uniform.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for \n12 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, as our chairman, Chairman Warner, I \nlistened to the distinguished Senator from New Jersey talk about this \nissue. While I do have the utmost respect for him, I would have to say \nthat one of the problems we had, getting into this mess to start with, \nwas the grossly exaggerated figures that were used. I believe the \nSenator used the number 100,000--100,000 has been batted around quite \noften. I am going to read into the Record at this point from Robin \nCook, the Foreign Secretary--this is October of 1999. He is under \npressure to answer claims that ministers misled the public on the scale \nof deaths of civilians in Kosovo:\n\n       At the height of the war, western officials spoke of a \n     death toll as high as 100,000. President Bill Clinton said \n     the NATO campaign had prevented ``deliberate, systematic \n     efforts at ethnic cleansing and genocide''.\n\n  Emilio Perez Pujol, a pathologist who led the Spanish team looking \nfor bodies in the aftermath of the fighting, said:\n\n       I calculate that the final figure of dead in Kosovo will be \n     2,500 at the most.\n\n  The U.N. report came out and said the figure is closer to 2,000. \nThere is a big difference between 2,000 dead and 100,000. I am involved \nin West Africa. I can assure you, as I said on the floor back during \nthis debate, for every one killed there through ethnic cleansing and \notherwise, 100 were killed in Sierra Leone. That seemed to be the \nexcuse that was used for our intervention into that area.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. INHOFE. No, I will not yield unless I yield on your time.\n  I would like to have a better solution than the solution that is in \nfront us. Frankly, I think we should have done this some time ago, but \nthis seems to be the only vehicle in town. There are reasons we should \nnot have been involved in Kosovo. It is not in our vital national \nsecurity interests. There is no clear mission objective or schedule to \naccomplish it. There is no exit strategy.\n  The thing that really concerns me more than anything else, as \nchairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness, is \nwhat this has done to our state of readiness. I have been saying since \nbefore we sent the cruise missiles into Kosovo that the United States \nis in the most threatened position we have been in as a nation in this \nNation's history. I have been saying that for a long time. It finally \nwas redeemed the other day--our chairman will remember this--when we \nhad George Tenet, Director of Central Intelligence, before our \ncommittee. I made that statement. I asked him to respond live on C-\nSPAN. He said, yes, we are in the most threatened position we have been \nin as a nation in the history of this country.\n  Why is that? It is because of three things. First of all, we are at \none-half the force strength that we were in 1991 during the Persian \nGulf war. Second, we do not have a national missile defense system. We \nwere to have one deployed by fiscal year 1998, and through the \nPresident's veto and his veto messages saying he is not going to put \nmore money into a national missile defense system, in spite of the fact \nthat in July of last year we passed a bill that he signed into law with \na veto-proof margin saying that is our No. 1 concern, we still do not \nhave one.\n  But the third reason is all these deployments that have nothing to do \nwith our national security interests. I can remember the first one that \ncame along. It was Bosnia. I went up to Bosnia. I knew the President \nwas bound and determined to send our troops into Bosnia. I knew we did \nnot have the spare troops to send in, that we could not respond to a \ncrisis in the Middle East or North Korea if we were to continue to make \nthese deployments, so I went up to the northeast sector. I remember \nthis so well because I was the\n\n[[Page S4128]]\n\nfirst American, civilian or military, up there. I went up there with a \nBritish General named Rupert Smith, a colorful guy. He and I really \nenjoyed that trip, going up, talking about what the President promised \nthe American people.\n\n  If you remember, we had a resolution of disapproval to stop the \nPresident from sending troops over there and getting involved. We lost \nit only by three votes. We lost it because the President said all the \ntroops they would send there, in December of 1995, would be home for \nChristmas 1996. This is not an approximation. This is the commitment \nthe President made to the American people.\n  We knew that was not going to happen. So we tried this same thing \nbefore. We tried at that time to say let's just draw a line in the sand \nat June of 1996; then June of 1997. We had the same debate at that \ntime. ``No, they are going to come back, but all in good time.''\n  There is no end in sight in Bosnia. They are still there. So here we \nhave our people involved in an area with the Croats and Serbs and \nMuslims. Then you have the various other groups such as the Arkan \nTigers and Black Swans. The only thing all these groups have in common \nis they all hate us, hate that we are over there. We lost our \nresolution of disapproval by three votes.\n  I have tried to determine how much we have spent in Bosnia alone. The \nmost conservative figure will be $13 billion. When you consider \neverything that has to go with it in terms of ground logistics support, \nit is considerably more than that.\n  Then along came Kosovo. I knew the same thing was going to happen. \nThis President has an obsession for sending our troops into places \nwhere we do not have any national security interests. So I went over to \nKosovo. It is not a hard place to go across; it is only 75 miles \nacross. I went by myself, one individual with me. As I went across \nKosovo, I only saw one dead person, and that was a Serb, a Serb soldier \nwho had been killed by an Albanian.\n  I rounded one corner and looked down the barrel of a rocket launcher, \nand it was held by an Albanian. Of some 92 mosques that are there, only \n1 was burning. CNN had pictures of it from every angle. When you got \nback to the United States, you thought every mosque in Kosovo was \nburning. It was a propaganda effort deliberately to make the American \npeople believe things were going on there that were not going on there.\n  What has happened since then, I might add, speaking of us, on this \nSenate floor I showed pictures and documented, since the Albanians are \nnow on top, they have burned to the ground a minimum of 52--and we have \npictures of all 52--Serb Christian Orthodox churches, most of them \nbuilt prior to the 15th century. If you do not have any sensitivity to \nthe religious aspect of this, look at the historic aspect. Nonetheless, \nthis is the propaganda effort that got us over there.\n  I can remember one of my many trips. I have to say, I believe I have \nbeen in the Balkans, both places, more than any other Member has. \nNormally I am by myself, to really try to determine what is going on \nthere. I remember being in Tirana. Tirana is where all the refugees \nshowed up. They were all pretty well dressed, but they were all upset \nwith us. They said to me, ``When are you going to do something about \nthis?'' I said, ``Why should we do it?'' They said, ``It's your fault \nwe had this ethnic cleansing.''\n\n  I will quote out of the Washington Post of March 31 of last year. \nThey wrote:\n\n       For weeks before the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia, \n     CIA Director Gen. Tenet had been forecasting that Serb-led \n     Yugoslavian forces might respond by accelerating ethnic \n     cleansing.\n\n  Then Bill Cohen said:\n\n       With respect to Director Tenet testifying that the bombing \n     could in fact accelerate Milosevic's plans, we also knew \n     that.\n\n  This was live on Tirana television. They said: When are you--and I \nwas the only American in the group--going to do something about our \nplight? Because it is your fault we had the ethnic cleansing.\n  Anyway, I think one of the bigger issues is the fact we are diluting \nour scarce resources. I will quote the comments by Henry Kissinger. He \nsaid at that time:\n\n       Each incremental deployment into the Balkans is bound to \n     weaken our ability to deal with Saddam Hussein and North \n     Korea.\n\n  He said:\n\n       The proposed deployment to Kosovo does not deal with any \n     threat to American security. . . .\n       Kosovo is no more a threat to America than Haiti was to \n     Europe.\n\n  So I know a lot of lies got us into this thing. I remember they \nrewrote history, saying if we do not go in there, we are going to have \nanother world war because that is the way World War I started and that \nis the way World War II started.\n  Again quoting from Kissinger's book:\n\n       The Second World War did not start in the Balkans, much \n     less as a result of its ethnic conflicts.\n\n  He wrote:\n\n       World War I started in the Balkans not as a result of \n     ethnic conflicts but for precisely the opposite reason: \n     because outside powers intervened in a local conflict. The \n     assassination of the Crown Prince of Austria--an imperial \n     power--by a Serbian nationalist led to a world war because \n     Russia backed Serbia and France backed Russia while Germany \n     supported Austria.\n\n  That is exactly what we are doing. We have rubbed Russia's nose in \nthis thing because we have gotten involved in this thing, creating \nanother serious problem facing our Nation. We are now down to where we \nhave diluted the forces. General Richard Hawley, who at that time, in \n1999, headed the Air Combat Command, said:\n\n       The Air Force . . . would be hard-pressed to handle a \n     second war in the Middle East or Korea.\n\n  Hawley said that 5 weeks of bombing Yugoslavia have left the United \nStates munitions stocks critically short, not just of air-launched \ncruise missiles as previously reported but also of another precision \nweapon, the Joint Direct Attack munition, that is JDAM, dropped by the \nB-2 bombers.\n  If my colleagues go to the 21st TACOM in Germany, right down the road \nfrom Ramstein, they will find--that is where they handle the ground \nlogistics--that even before we went into Kosovo, we were at 100-percent \ncapacity. I asked the question: What would happen if we had to respond \nto a serious problem in the Persian Gulf where we do have national \nsecurity interests?\n  The response was: We would be 100-percent dependent upon Guard and \nReserve.\n  What has happened to our Guard and Reserve as a result of all these \ndeployments? We have critical MOSs, military occupational specialities, \nbecause they cannot be deployed 180 and 270 days out of a year and keep \nthe jobs they have at home.\n  Finally, I want to read one paragraph of an article written by Henry \nKissinger which says:\n\n       President Clinton has justified American troop deployments \n     in Kosovo on the grounds that ethnic conflict in Yugoslavia \n     threatens ``Europe's stability and future.'' Other \n     administration spokesmen have compared the challenge to that \n     of Hitler's threat to European security. Neither statement \n     does justice to Balkan realities.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my remarks the \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I want to have a better solution, but this is the only \nsolution there is. I urge my colleagues to support this for the state \nof readiness of our Nation.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 22, 1999]\n\n                          (By Henry Kissinger)\n\nNo U.S. Ground Forces for Kosovo--Leadership Doesn't Mean That We Must \n                        Do Everything Ourselves.\n\n       President Clinton's announcement that some 4,000 American \n     troops will join a NATO force of 28,000 to help police a \n     Kosovo agreement faces all those concerned with long-range \n     American national security policy with a quandary.\n       Having at once time shared responsibility for national \n     security policy and the extrication from Vietnam, I am \n     profoundly uneasy about the proliferation of open-ended \n     American commitments involving the deployment of U.S. forces. \n     American forces are in harm's way in Kosovo, Bosnia and the \n     gulf. They lack both a definition of strategic purpose by \n     which success can be measured and an exit strategy. In the \n     case of Kosovo, the concern is that America's leadership \n     would be impaired by the refusal of Congress to approve \n     American participation in the\n\n[[Page S4129]]\n\n     NATO force that has come into being largely as a result of a \n     diplomacy conceived and spurred by Washington.\n       Thus, in the end, Congress may feel it has little choice \n     but to go along. In any event, its formal approval is not \n     required. But Congress needs to put the administration on \n     notice that it is uneasy about being repeatedly confronted \n     with ad hoc military missions. The development and \n     articulation of a comprehensive strategy is imperative if we \n     are to avoid being stretched too thin in the face of other \n     foreseeable and militarily more dangerous challenges.\n       Before any future deployments take place, we must be able \n     to answer these questions: What consequences are we seeking \n     to prevent? What goals are we seeking to achieve? In what way \n     do they serve the national interest?\n       President Clinton has justified American troop deployments \n     in Kosovo on the ground that ethnic conflict in Yugoslavia \n     threatens ``Europe's stability and future.'' Other \n     administration spokesmen have compared the challenge to that \n     of Hitler's threat to European security. Neither statement \n     does justice to Balkan realities.\n       The proposed deployment in Kosovo does not deal with any \n     threat to American security as traditionally conceived. The \n     threatening escalations sketched by the president--to \n     Macedonia or Greece and Turkey--are in the long run more \n     likely to result from the emergence of a Kosovo state.\n       Nor is the Kosovo problem new. Ethnic conflict has been \n     endemic in the Balkans for centuries. Waves of conquests have \n     congealed divisions between ethnic groups and religions, \n     between the Eastern Orthodox and Catholic faiths; between \n     Christianity and Islam; between the heirs of the Austrian and \n     Ottoman empires.\n       Through the centuries, these conflicts have been fought \n     with unparalleled ferocity because none of the populations \n     has any experience with--and essentially no belief in--\n     Western concepts of toleration. Majority rule and compromise \n     that underlie most of the proposals for a ``solution'' never \n     have found an echo in the Balkans.\n       Moreover, the projected Kosovo agreement is unlikely to \n     enjoy the support of the parties for a long period of time. \n     For Serbia, acquiescing under the threat of NATO bombardment, \n     it involves nearly unprecedented international intercession. \n     Yugoslavia, a sovereign state, is being asked to cede control \n     and in time sovereignty of a province containing its national \n     shrines to foreign military force.\n       Though President Slobodan Milosevic has much to answer for, \n     especially in Bosnia, he is less the cause of the conflict in \n     Kosovo than an expression of it. On the need to retain \n     Kosovo, Serbian leaders--including Milosevic's domestic \n     opponents--seem united. For Serbia, current NATO policy means \n     either dismemberment of the country or postponement of the \n     conflict to a future date when, according to the NATO \n     proposal, the future of the province will be decided.\n       The same attitude governs the Albanian side. The Kosovo \n     Liberation Army (KLA) is fighting for independence, not \n     autonomy. But under the projected agreement, Kosovo, now an \n     integral part of Serbia, is to be made an autonomous and \n     self-governing entity within Serbia, which, however, will \n     remain responsible for external security and even exercise \n     some unspecified internal police functions. A plebiscite at \n     the end of three years is to determine the region's future.\n       The KLA is certain to try to use the cease-fire to expel \n     the last Serbian influences from the province and drag its \n     feet on giving up its arms. And if NATO resists, it may come \n     under attack itself--perhaps from both sides. What is \n     described by the administration as a ``strong peace \n     agreement'' is likely to be at best the overture to another, \n     far more complicated set of conflicts.\n       Ironically, the projected peace agreement increases the \n     likelihood of the various possible escalations sketched by \n     the president as justification for a U.S. deployment. An \n     independent Albanian Kosovo surely would seek to incorporate \n     the neighboring Albanian minorities--mostly in Macedonia--and \n     perhaps even Albania itself. And a Macedonian conflict would \n     land us precisely back in the Balkan wars of earlier in this \n     century. Will Kosovo then become the premise for a NATO move \n     into Macedonia, just as the deployment in Bosnia is invoked \n     as justification for the move into Kosovo? Is NATO to be the \n     home for a whole series of Balkan NATO protectorates?\n       What confuses the situation even more is that the American \n     missions in Bosnia and Kosovo are justified by different, \n     perhaps incompatible, objectives. In Bosnia, American \n     deployment is being promoted as a means to unite Croats, \n     Muslims and Serbs into a single state. Serbs and Croats \n     prefer to practice self-determination but are being asked to \n     subordinate their preference to the geopolitical argument \n     that a small Muslim Bosnian state would be too precarious and \n     irredentist. But in Kosovo, national self-determination is \n     invoked to produce a tiny state nearly certain to be \n     irredentist.\n       Since neither traditional concepts of the national interest \n     nor U.S. security impel the deployment, the ultimate \n     justification is the laudable and very American goal of \n     easing human suffering. This is why, in the end, I went along \n     with the Dayton agreement in so far as it ended the war by \n     separating the contending forces. But I cannot bring myself \n     to endorse American ground forces in Kosovo.\n       In Bosnia, the exit strategy can be described. The existing \n     dividing lines can be made permanent. Failure to do so will \n     require their having to be manned indefinitely unless we \n     change our objective to self-determination and permit each \n     ethnic group to decide its own fate.\n       In Kosovo, that option does not exist. There are no ethnic \n     dividing lines, and both sides claim the entire territory. \n     America's attitude toward the Serb's attempts to insist on \n     their claim has been made plain enough; it is the threat of \n     bombing. But how do we and NATO react to Albanian \n     transgressions and irredentism? Are we prepared to fight both \n     sides and for how long? In the face of issues such as these, \n     the unity of the contact group of powers acting on behalf of \n     NATO is likely to dissolve. Russia surely will increasingly \n     emerge as the supporter of the Serbian point of view.\n       We must take care not to treat a humanitarian foreign \n     policy as a magic recipe for the basic problem of \n     establishing priorities in foreign policy. The president's \n     statements ``that we can make a difference'' and that \n     ``America symbolizes hope and resolve'' are exhortations, not \n     policy prescriptions. Do they mean that America's military \n     power is available to enable every ethnic or religious group \n     to achieve self-determination? Is NATO to become the \n     artillery for ethnic conflict? If Kosovo, why not East Africa \n     or Central Asia? And would a doctrine of universal \n     humanitarian intervention reduce or increase suffering by \n     intensifying ethnic and religious conflict? What are the \n     limits of such a policy and by what criteria is it \n     established?\n       In my view, that line should be drawn at American ground \n     forces for Kosovo. Europeans never tire of stressing the need \n     for greater European autonomy. Here is an occasion to \n     demonstrate it. If Kosovo presents a security problem, it is \n     to Europe, largely because of the refugees the conflict might \n     generate, as the president has pointed out. Kosovo is no more \n     a threat to America than Haiti was to Europe--and we never \n     asked for NATO support there. The nearly 300 million \n     Europeans should be able to generate the ground forces to \n     deal with 2.3 million Kosovars. To symbolize Allied unity on \n     larger issues, we should provide logistics, intelligence and \n     air support. But I see no need for U.S. ground forces; \n     leadership should not be interpreted to mean that we must do \n     everything ourselves.\n       Sooner or later, we must articulate the American capability \n     to sustain a global policy. The failure to do so landed us in \n     the Vietnam morass. Even if one stipulates an American \n     strategic interest in Kosovo (which I do not), we must take \n     care not to stretch ourselves too thin in the face of far \n     less ambiguous threats in the Middle East and Northeast Asia.\n       Each incremental deployment into the Balkans is bound to \n     weaken our ability to deal with Saddam Hussein and North \n     Korea. The psychological drain may be even more grave. Each \n     time we make a peripheral deployment, the administration is \n     constrained to insist that the danger to American forces is \n     minimal--the Kosovo deployment is officially described as a \n     ``peace implementation force.''\n       Such comments have two unfortunate consequences. They \n     increase the impression among Americans that military force \n     can be used casualty-free, and they send a signal of weakness \n     to potential enemies. For in the end, our forces will be \n     judged on how adequate they are for peace imposition, not \n     peace implementation.\n       I always am inclined to support the incumbent \n     administration in a forceful assertion of the national \n     interest. And as a passionate believer in the NATO alliance, \n     I make the distinctions between European and American \n     security interests in the Balkans with the utmost reluctance. \n     But support for a strong foreign policy and a strong NATO \n     surely will evaporate if we fail to anchor them in a clear \n     definition of the national interest and impart a sense of \n     direction to our foreign policy in a period of turbulent \n     change.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio, under a previous order, \nis recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I seek 50 seconds. I thank the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma. Underlying this is clearly the readiness issue. It is \nnot just the Kosovo operation, but it is how our troops are spread \nthroughout the world. We are speaking in this amendment to a discipline \nthat could well apply to the next mission, wherever it may be, or an \nexisting mission. It is simply the accountability of the Congress of \nthe United States in the expenditure of these funds to exercise a \nvoice. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized for 10 \nminutes under a previous order.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield 30 \nseconds to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I will.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Parliamentary inquiry: Is the time just used by my good \nfriend from Virginia taken from the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is taken from the time of the Senator from \nVirginia.\n\n[[Page S4130]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I advised the Chair when I arrived this morning that all \nmy comments will be charged to the Chair.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I say in response to the commentary of \nthe Senator from Oklahoma, I talked of hundreds of thousands. If the \nSenator listened carefully, I talked about displacement, and I talked \nabout movements. I did not talk about deaths. We can get the number of \ndeaths from the records. I want to make sure that is clearly \nunderstood.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the Levin amendment which would strike the Byrd-Warner provision \nregarding U.S. troop withdrawal from Kosovo. As my colleagues know, the \nByrd-Warner provision includes language designed to ensure our allies \nin NATO provide their fair share of the peacekeeping burden in Kosovo. \nThis certainly is an important goal, and I understand the Europeans \nright now are meeting the requirements outlined in the Byrd-Warner \nprovision.\n  Frankly, I believe a great deal of the credit for this great \naccomplishment goes to my friend and colleague from Virginia, Senator \nWarner. He has demonstrated unfailing dedication and commitment to this \nvery important burdensharing issue. Senator Warner traveled to Kosovo \nin January of this year and saw firsthand that the Europeans needed to \nshare a larger portion of the burden in the Balkans. Because of his \nefforts in the short time since his visit to Kosovo, the proportion of \nEuropean involvement has changed considerably. In fact, currently U.S. \ntroops now make up 5,900 of the 39,000-member NATO peacekeeping force. \nU.S. involvement accounts for 15 percent of the overall peacekeeping \neffort, and the Europeans are carrying the bulk of the effort on the \ncivilian side. This is a victory for Senator Warner. I believe we have \nto pause for a moment today to congratulate him on a job very well \ndone.\n  I also agree with the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, and the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, Senator \nByrd, that Congress needs to assert itself more in foreign affairs. \nCongress can and Congress should engage more in the kinds of debate \nover foreign policy issues such as the one we are having today and \nshould work harder to shape U.S. defense and foreign policy. The last 7 \nyears of drift in foreign affairs has demonstrated the need for \nCongress to reassert its constitutional role in shaping American \nforeign policy.\n\n  I also share the very legitimate concerns expressed by the \ndistinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator \nStevens, about the way the current administration funds our \npeacekeeping activities. We find ourselves repeatedly in a situation in \nwhich the administration draws funds and resources away from important \ndefense activities to pay for its peacekeeping operations.\n  For example, the administration knew before the end of last year when \nwe were negotiating the remaining appropriations bills that they were \nplanning to keep our forces in Kosovo for the duration of the fiscal \nyear. They knew it but did nothing in the budget about it, except to \nput a number of readiness and operational projects on hold at reduced \nfunding levels. That practice has become the standard practice in \nrecent years. That practice needs to change. We should debate the cost \nof operations before the operations. We should debate the cost before \nthe beginning of each fiscal year and not do this back-door funding.\n  I do understand the motives of the proponents of this provision. I \nunderstand what they are trying to accomplish. They have good reason to \nbe frustrated, but this is not a debate about motive but, rather, one \nabout method. It is the method that will be employed under this \nlanguage that deeply troubles me. What concerns me most about this \nprovision is that it sets an arbitrary deadline for the withdrawal of \nU.S. forces from Kosovo. The deadline is not based on any goals that \nwould make it possible for the reduction of forces in the region. This \narbitrary deadline signals to the Albanians the limits to our \ncommitment for providing for their protection. This, in turn, could \ngive them cause to rearm and prepare to protect themselves from what \nthey would view as an inevitable Serbian reentry. In essence, this \nprovision would undermine our current efforts to achieve stability in \nthe region and could give the despotic Milosevic the victory he could \nnot achieve on the battlefield.\n  The fact is, in the delicate and complex world of foreign affairs, \none thing should always be clear: As a nation, we should demonstrate to \nour allies the certainty of our resolve, and we must demonstrate that \nsame resolve to our enemies, while at the same time making our enemies \nuncertain as to how and when we will exercise that resolve.\n  Unfortunately, what this provision does is just the opposite. It \nmakes our allies uncertain and signals to our adversaries what we will \ndo and what we will not do.\n  The proponents of this provision have argued this is really all about \nprocess. Respectfully, I disagree. This debate is about whether \nCongress will use sound judgment in the exercise of power. I believe \nthe Byrd-Warner provision is not a wise use of congressional power. By \nvoting for this provision, we will be exercising our power arbitrarily \nand setting ourselves on a course toward the removal of U.S. troops in \nKosovo in 14 months.\n  The next President would be placed in the position of having to \nconvince Congress to change the policy, to act. We have sadly found \nmany times that to get this Congress to act is very difficult.\n  The current administration, for example, could not convince the House \nof Representatives to authorize airstrikes over Serbia. There simply \nare no guarantees that Congress will act in 14 months.\n  Congressional inaction over the next year could result in a dramatic \nchange in policy that would create uncertainty and undermine our \ncredibility with NATO and with our own troops. Fostering that kind of \nuncertainty about U.S. resolve is not what is intended but that, sadly, \ncould be the result. That result, that uncertainty, will, I believe, \ncreate a more dangerous situation for our troops for the next 14 \nmonths.\n  The fact is that our credibility as a leader in the international \ncommunity is predicated on a shared commitment to the stability and \ngrowth of democracy and free markets on the European continent.\n  We cannot reach these goals through arbitrary, unilateral deadlines. \nWe cannot reach these goals by placing the next administration in the \nposition of shaping foreign policy in response to a congressionally \nimposed deadline rather than on current and future world events. In \nessence, we cannot allow our foreign policy to run on autopilot.\n  I say to my colleagues, if they believe we should withdraw our \ntroops, there is ample opportunity to have an up-or-down vote on that \nat any time. We could do it today. We could do it in 14 months. We \ncould do it in July of the year 2001. That is the right way for us to \nexercise our power.\n  I believe this is the wrong action because what this does is, in \nessence, say that Congress may never directly vote on this issue. \nMembers can vote for this language which would provide that our troops \nwould automatically have to come out in July of the year 2001 if \nCongress took no action. Members could vote for this, and then Congress \ncould take absolutely no action and we would never have a direct vote \non the issue.\n  I believe that is the wrong way to approach this issue. I believe \nthat if Members believe our troops should be withdrawn, they have ample \nopportunity to have an up-or-down vote on this at any time they wish to \ndo it.\n  I believe the uncertainty that will be created over the next 14 \nmonths by the insertion of this language into law will create a very \ndifficult and untenable position for our troops and for our country in \nthe conduct of American foreign policy.\n  I thank my colleague for the time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  I, again, thank my distinguished colleague for his contribution to \nthis very important debate, and particularly to his thoughtful \nreferences to this humble Senator, but I must say that I respectfully \ndisagree.\n  The time has come when we have to speak to the people of the United\n\n[[Page S4131]]\n\nStates who are constantly giving us this money--to expend $2 billion in \nthis instance--to provide for the men and women in uniform, who march \noff in harm's way. This is simply a procedure by which to speak on \nbehalf of this constituency and not just always our allies abroad. But \nI thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I also yield myself 30 seconds to thank my \ngood friend from Ohio for a very thoughtful statement. He has put his \nfinger on the heart of the matter, which is that Congress, by acting \nnow, putting on automatic pilot a withdrawal of forces a year from now, \nunless action is taken later on, creates a very dangerous year of \nuncertainty which threatens the success of this mission as well as our \nalliance.\n  It was an extremely thoughtful statement, which I hope all of our \ncolleagues had an opportunity to hear. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I believe the distinguished Senator from \nNew Jersey is to be recognized for a period on my time of 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n8 minutes.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia for \nyielding the time. I commend the Senator from Virginia and my \ncolleague, Senator Byrd from West Virginia, in bringing this issue \nbefore the Senate.\n  Before discussing Kosovo, or the provisions of the NATO treaty, there \nis something more paramount that should come before the Senate. It is \nnot a treaty with a foreign nation or obligations in another land but \nour own Constitution and our own responsibilities in this country.\n  For too long, the foreign policy and military powers of the Congress \nhave been yielded to the executive. This Congress has not been a \njealous guardian of its own constitutional prerogatives.\n  Under our system of government and its Constitution, the military and \nforeign policy powers are shared between the executive and the \nlegislative branches. By necessity, the Commander in Chief must have \nthe ability to deploy troops and make command decisions in emergencies. \nOften there is not time to consult, certainly not time to receive \npermission. But the power remains shared because we have the \nresponsibility for the resources of the Government.\n  The unfolding events in Kosovo that threaten to go not a matter of \nmonths but many years--even more than a decade--does not require \nemergency powers. There is no shortage of time. There is an opportunity \nfor our Constitution to function and for the President to return to \nthis Chamber.\n\n  We are now having the debate in this Chamber. The Bundestag had \ntheirs in Berlin a year ago. The British Parliament gave its assent. \nThe National Assembly in Paris and the Italian Parliament have had \ntheir debate. This Congress, unlike the great democracies in Europe, \nhas remained silent. Is our Constitution less? Do our people exercise \nless powers through their elected representatives than those in Germany \nor Italy or France?\n  Many Members have risen to talk about Kosovo. I rise to talk about \nthe United States. There has been great concern for the NATO treaty. As \ndid my colleagues from Virginia and West Virginia, I rise because I am \nconcerned about our Constitution.\n  I believe there is a legitimate role for the United States in Kosovo. \nI strongly believe in the NATO treaty. The United States has met its \nresponsibilities under the NATO treaty.\n  Strictly defined, that treaty was for the defense of Western Europe \nfrom external threats. By necessity, it was properly expanded at the \nend of the cold war to include legitimate internal threats to European \norder.\n  The United States was not a participant in dealing with that threat. \nWe were a leader. Not a single European soldier would have been in \nKosovo or Bosnia but for the U.S. Air Force. None of it could have been \nsupported but for the U.S. Army. None of it would have been viable but \nfor the U.S. Government. Our responsibilities were met.\n  But expanding the NATO treaty to include internal threats to Europe \nwas one thing--legitimate, in my judgment--but expanding the NATO \ntreaty to deal with permanent control of order and peacekeeping is \nanother.\n  I believe we have met our responsibilities. I believe it is incumbent \nupon a new administration, next year, to return to this Congress and \nmake the case, if it is possible, that it is necessary on an ongoing \nbasis to have a near-permanent presence in Kosovo--no longer a crisis--\nnow maintaining order.\n  It is not too much to ask the administration to make that case or \nthis Congress to meet its responsibilities and act affirmatively upon \nthe judgment. It will, in truth, not be an easy case to make.\n  Kosovo is a nation of a mere 2 million people. This long after the \nwar in Kosovo, it must be made in a case to this Congress that 300 \nmillion Europeans, with a gross national product larger than the United \nStates, with combined government resources in excess of the United \nStates, are unable to maintain these modest numbers of troops to \nmaintain order within their own borders, on their own continent, for \ntheir own purposes. It is not a question of our unwillingness to \nrespond to crises or threats, but to learn to separate the crisis \nresponse from the near permanent presence to maintain order.\n\n  The final point made against this amendment is the most extraordinary \nof all, that our credibility is at issue. Who could rise to challenge \nthe credibility of the U.S. Government to international security or the \ndefense of freedom--which of our NATO allies? Fifty-five years after \nthe close of World War II, tens of millions of American young men and \nwomen have served in western Europe. Our presence remains, at an \nexpenditure of hundreds of billions of dollars. Who among our NATO \nallies could rise and say that our credibility is in question? But for \nthe United States, there would have been no operation in Bosnia or in \nKosovo. It was made possible by the U.S. Government.\n  This Government's credibility is not at issue. Fifty years after the \nwar in Korea, we and we alone remain on the line to defend freedom. A \ndecade after the war in the Persian Gulf, often we and we alone remain \nresolute in defiance of Saddam Hussein. Twelve years after the \ndestruction at Lockerbie, we alone have to convince our allies to \nremain strong against Libya. We alone often maintain vigilance against \nthose few remaining Communist states where freedom is eclipsed. The \ncredibility of the U.S. Government is not at issue.\n  What is at issue is the constitutional prerogatives of this \ninstitution. It remains a question of Europe meeting responsibilities \nnot for crisis response, which we share under NATO, but for maintaining \norder on a near permanent basis. It is not an issue of credibility.\n  There is a fourth issue. Kosovo is not the last crisis this \nGovernment is going to deal with in international order or maintaining \npeace and stability.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. May I have another 30 seconds?\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the Senator another minute.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. A future American President is going to have to \nfactor in, in responding to a crisis in Asia or North Africa or the \nMiddle East, that American ships and planes are on station supporting \noperations in Kosovo, not dealing with a crisis but on a police patrol. \nThe number of forces may not be great, but, indeed, our resources are \nvery strained. Is it fair to this country, the security of the United \nStates, that we will have to at some point forgo defending interests \nelsewhere because our forces are substituting what Europe should be \ndoing in Kosovo?\n  No, Mr. President, our credibility is not at issue, nor our resolve. \nWhether or not this generation of Senators and Members of the House \ndefend its prerogatives under the Constitution is at issue.\n  I commend the gentleman from Virginia for bringing this before the \nSenate.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from New Jersey. This clearly shows \nthis is a bipartisan issue. It is not a political issue. We are not \ndirecting anything at our President. We are directing it solely, as my \ndistinguished colleague said, at fulfilling our duties\n\n[[Page S4132]]\n\nunder the Constitution. I am grateful for his pointing out that the \nUnited States, in the Korean conflict, where we have had a large number \nof nations, stands alone today. In Iraq, we stand alone with Great \nBritain containing that situation, after a dozen allies in 1991 helped \nus with that conflict.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  In the 16 years I have been here, I have debated a number of these \nissues with my colleague from Virginia. We have debated a number of \ndifferent incursions in various countries, involvement of U.S. troops \nabroad. There are few people in the Senate I respect as much or have as \nmuch affection for as the Senator from Virginia, whose knowledge and \npatriotism are absolutely unquestionable on subjects such as this.\n  I, as a veteran of Vietnam and as somebody who came back from that \nwar to argue about Congress's capacity and prerogatives to make \njudgments about our involvement there, have nothing but respect for the \nposition he espouses today about congressional prerogative. It exists. \nWe should respect it. It is a critical component of the balance of \npower in this country. It is entirely appropriate that Senator Byrd and \nSenator Warner ask the Senate to make a judgment about our troops. We \nshould do no less. We owe the American people that judgment. That is \none of the great prerogatives of the Senate.\n  What they are asking the Senate to do is, in effect, to make the \njudgment today that we have reached our limit with respect to the \ncurrent involvement in Kosovo and we are going to set up a structure \nfor withdrawal. They argue: not at all; there is a vote down the road \nas to whether or not we will appropriate money. But in point of fact, \nthe way this amendment is structured, the message is clear: The vote is \nnow; the choice is whether or not we believe we should continue to be \ninvolved.\n  I do not question that there are aspects of this involvement that I \nthink are not necessarily well thought out even today. I think there \nare divisions between the ethnic parties in Kosovo that we have not \nproperly thought through as to how we resolve them in the long run. \nThere are aspects of the risks we are asking young American troops, \nmale and female, to bear with which I am uncomfortable.\n  I am not suggesting there aren't ways to strengthen our approach to \nthis, both our responsibilities and European responsibilities. But--\nhere is the ``but''--I ask my colleagues to look at the law as it is \nset forth in the language of S. 2521. It says: None of the funds \nappropriated or otherwise made available shall be available for the \ncontinued deployment of U.S. combat troops in Kosovo after July 1, \n2001, unless and until the President does something.\n  What does the President have to do? He has to submit a report to \nCongress asking for the money to be spent but, most importantly, \ndescribing the specific progress made in implementing a plan.\n  What is the plan the President has to describe to Congress on which \nhe is making progress? The plan refers to a subsection (b). If we turn \nto it, it says very specifically:\n\n       The President shall develop a plan, in consultation with \n     appropriate foreign governments, by which NATO member \n     countries, with the exception of the United States, and \n     appropriate non-NATO countries will provide, not later than \n     July 1, 2001, any and all ground combat troops necessary to \n     execute Operation Joint Guardian or any successor operation \n     in Kosovo.\n\n  That means, according to the plan he must now begin to put into \neffect, he must report to us how far along we are in getting out. There \nare quarterly target dates that that plan requires us to establish, \nwith 3-month intervals, achieving an orderly transition. There is an \ninterim plan for achieving the objectives not later than September 30, \n2000, and then there is the final plan.\n  We are, in effect, being asked to vote today on a plan for \nwithdrawal. We are stating our intention that, absent a future vote at \nsome later time, which has been met with a succession of interim stages \nof withdrawal, we will have a vote on appropriations.\n  I say to my colleagues, that is not the way to deal with foreign \npolicy generally. It is certainly not the way to deal with this \nspecific issue. Why is it not the way to deal with this specific issue? \nWell, effectively, we are being asked to vote today as to whether or \nnot we think the investment we made in the war itself is worthwhile.\n  On March 23, 1999, I joined with 57 of our colleagues to vote that we \nthought there was something worthwhile doing in Kosovo. And we voted to \nsupport a resolution that authorized the President to conduct military \noperations against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. I did so because \nI believed then, as I believe now, that the U.S. national interest and \nstability throughout Europe is unquestionable and that the oppression \nand thuggery of the Milosevic regime not only threatened that stability \nthroughout Europe, but it posed an unacceptable challenge to the \nhumanitarian values of the American people.\n\n  Mr. President, this Nation committed 50 years and trillions of \ndollars to protecting the security of Europe through the Marshall Plan. \nHalf a million American troops served in Europe to preserve the peace \nwon by our fathers and grandfathers in World War II. I respectfully \nsuggest that the Senate effectively decided, when we voted to do those \nmilitary operations, that we were not willing to walk away from the \nethnic cleansing in Kosovo because that would have been walking away \nfrom the very investment in peace and freedom for which we paid so \ndearly. It troubles me, then, to say that today some of the most \nstalwart supporters of our efforts in Kosovo only a year ago would now \nsay that we should effectively put into gear the process of walking \naway from whatever responsibilities may remain in terms of how we \nadequately finish the job.\n  I share the frustration of my colleagues that our European allies, \nwhose own stability is so closely tied to peace in the Balkans, have \nnot met their obligations to the Kosovo peacekeeping effort as swiftly \nand as deftly as we would like. I want to underscore that I think the \nefforts of Senator Byrd and Senator Warner have helped to place that \nresponsibility squarely in front of them.\n  Let me ask a simple question of my colleagues. If restoring the peace \nin Kosovo was in our interest 1 year ago, isn't preserving the peace in \nKosovo in our interest today? I don't believe you can separate those \nobligations. I think the answer is resoundingly yes, it is in our \ninterest today. Some people may rethink their vote, and that is \nperfectly legitimate. Some people may believe that they misinterpreted \nthat national interest, and they should explain it as such. But I don't \nunderstand how this country can clearly define its interest in Europe \nfor the 50 years since World War II and maintain hundreds of thousands \nof troops in Europe in order to make clear our determination to stay \nwith that peace effort and not be willing to keep 5,000-plus troops in \nKosovo, which we all deem to be a component of our European interests. \nI don't understand that.\n  Are we suggesting that we are not willing to bear any of those risks? \nNow, I understand as well as anybody the post-Vietnam syndrome and the \nsort of nervousness people have about putting troops in harm's way. But \nI am confident that most of my colleagues who have worn the uniform \nwill share with me the belief that that is what you put it on for, and \nthat being in the military is not a cakewalk to get your GI bill so \nthat you can ride on the benefits for the rest of your life; it is \nassuming certain risks. Sometimes in the national interest of our \ncountry--maybe not the vital security interest, but in a security \ninterest, or some level of interest--there are sometimes risks that we \nhave to be willing to bear to achieve our goals.\n  The price of leadership that we have spent so much of our treasure \nearning is not cheap. You can't fulfill the obligations that we have in \nthe world on the fly. You can't do it on the cheap. I know there are \ncertain questions of readiness and other questions, but there are many \nchoices we make with respect to the entire military budget, national \nmissile defense, and others\n\n[[Page S4133]]\n\nthat bear significantly on where we spend money and how we spend money. \nI believe that we won an enormously important victory in terms of the \nvalues that drive our foreign policy and on which this country is \nfounded. I think 5,000 troops, the lack of losses, and the \nextraordinary accomplishments we have gained in this region over the \nlast years say to us that even with the difficulties, this is a policy \nthat, measured against the risk to our troops, is worth pursuing.\n\n  I ask my colleagues to measure very carefully whether or not they are \nprepared today to send a message to Milosevic, as well as our allies, \nthat we are not willing to stand the test of time with respect to those \nobligations and responsibilities.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the next speaker will be the distinguished \nSenator from Montana, Mr. Burns, for 7 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for 30 seconds, I \nthank the Senator from Massachusetts for the contribution he just made, \npointing out with extreme accuracy that, No. 1, this is not an issue of \nthe prerogative of the Senate--we have the prerogative to do this if we \nchoose to exercise it--but raising the question: Is it wise this year \nto set a deadline for the withdrawal of troops next year and the \ndangers that will ensue in the interim both to the troops, the \nalliance, and to the cause for which they fought? His experience, both \nin war and in peace, has been invaluable and his contribution this \nmorning is very clear. I thank him for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, We are setting an all-time record for \nspending Senate time on the military construction bill this year. Never \nhas it taken this long to pass military construction. Since this bill \nis under my management, I am not real happy about the precedent that we \nare setting.\n  I do want to rise in support of the Byrd-Warner amendment. This \ndebate today is not about withdrawal, or even the continued deployment, \nof our troops in Kosovo. What it is about is more important: the role \nof Congress and its relationship with the executive branch of this \nGovernment under our Constitution.\n  Congress has a constitutional responsibility to vote on long-term \nmilitary commitments, especially when they are offensive and not \ndefensive in nature. Kosovo is not a defensive response to an armed \nattack against the United States or its allies. There is no pressing \nemergency requiring the President to act with dispatch. In such cases, \nit is very important for Congress to act on its role. It is easy to see \nthe need for the exercise of Congressional responsibility in the case \nat hand since the administration has already spent $21.2 billion since \n1992 in the Bosnia/Kosovo area.\n  Contrary to the rumors, and even as stated by my good friend from \nMassachusetts who has interpreted this as a step to withdraw, the Byrd-\nWarner amendment makes specific provisions for Congress to continue \nAmerican presence beyond July 1, 2001. The process outlined is orderly \nbut it will require planning by the administration and the type of \npublic debate expected in a democracy.\n  Without the Byrd-Warner amendment, the administration is taking \ncongressional appropriations as a tacit approval by the Congress for \nAmerican involvement in Kosovo. In these circumstances, by approving \nemergency supplemental funding to continue our presence in that area, \nCongress can be seen as avoiding its responsibilities under the \nConstitution.\n  In the first place, we are not properly exercising our Constitutional \nresponsibility for the power of the purse as vested in the Congress. \nUnited States presence in Kosovo, without congressional scrutiny and \naffirmative endorsement, does not meet our duties to the American \npeople that their voices be heard through congressional representation.\n  Administration officials have repeatedly spent defense funds for \nthese deployments. Afterwards, they come back to the Congress and ask \nus to pay bills that are improperly--and some would say illegally--\nincurred. This process must stop.\n  Our effort to uphold the Constitution will not undermine the troops \nin the field. There is ample time under the amendment for rational \nimplementation while still imposing the accountability required by our \nlaws.\n  Some opposed to the Byrd-Warner amendment say we should not even have \nthis debate, and that the timing is wrong. But when is it a good time \nto intercede? The Congress has been patient with the administration in \nKosovo. But we, too, have responsibilities under the Constitution, \nespecially when it comes to spending money. Today is the day we step up \nto the plate to face those responsibilities.\n  The amendment shifts the responsibility for determining our future \ninvolvement in Kosovo to the next administration.\n  I think the American people should also understand one other thing. \nWe are not just talking about cents or dollars. I repeat that we are \ntalking about $21.2 billion spent in this area since 1992. In addition, \nwe currently have over 5,000 troops there participating in peacekeeping \noperations in Kosovo.\n  The primary responsibility of the peacekeeping force is to act as \nescorts for Serbs and Albanians. That is not what our troops were \ntrained for. And administration officials wonder why our recruitment \nand retention in our military services is lagging.\n  Senator Torricelli of New Jersey had it right when he called upon our \nNATO allies to provide their share of resources in this operation. That \nis what this amendment does. It is not because the Europeans don't have \nthe resources or cannot get the resources. This debate has gone on, and \nthey have been willing to let the United States of America shoulder the \nmajority of the costs of the operation. As long as somebody in the \nadministration stands up and says we will always do it, then we will \nalways have to do it. But, we cannot be the police force for the world \ncommunity.\n  It is time to give our good friends, the European allies, the \nopportunity to demonstrate to the world their support for true \ndemocracy in the face of a dictator that was overstepping his bounds in \nthe region of the Balkans.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It is well thought \nout, and needs our full support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are alternating between those who wish \nto strike the provision and those who wish to retain it.\n  I see Senator Levin is prepared to accept a speaker from his side.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we would be happy for their side to go \nforward. We have many other speakers, but they are still on their way.\n  Mr. WARNER. We are trying to conduct this in an orderly debate. I \nhope some from their side will begin to appear.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are going to have too many on our side to speak with \nlittle time to do it.\n  Mr. WARNER. We have the same situation. Senators Feingold, Thomas, \nand Cleland are on the floor waiting to speak in support of the Byrd-\nWarner amendment.\n  I yield the floor. I yield to Senator Feingold 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Levin \namendment and in support of the Warner-Byrd amendment to the military \nconstruction appropriations bill.\n  The Warner-Byrd amendment to the Military Construction Appropriations \nbill. The Warner-Byrd amendment, which was accepted in committee, would \nrequire Congressional authorization for the continued presence of U.S. \ntroops in Kosovo beyond July 1, 2001. In other words, it would require \nthis Congress, finally, to debate and to decide on the issue of U.S. \ntroops in Kosovo, as I believe that we are required to do under the War \nPowers Resolution.\n  I am sure that some opponents of this measure will paint a picture of \na power-hungry Congress, eager to wrest authorities away from the \nexecutive in an attempt to gain leverage over the White House.\n  But this is about more than power, Mr. President. It is about \nresponsibility. Approximately 5,900 U.S. troops are currently serving \nin an apparently open-ended operation in Kosovo. Fifty-\n\n[[Page S4134]]\n\nnine hundred Americans are operating in often dangerous conditions in \nthe pursuit of a policy that this Congress has not authorized. Fifty-\nnine hundred families are sacrificing. We cannot continue to suggest to \nthe American people, to our constituents, that this is none of our \nbusiness. Congressional approval is essential to the commitment of U.S. \ntroops in dangerous situations abroad.\n  Still other opponents of this measure paint a grim picture of the \nconsequences that will follow should Congress insist on authorizing a \nlarge-scale deployment like that in Kosovo. Because they believe that \nCongress would act irresponsibly, they prefer that Congress not act at \nall.\n  Again, this is a simply unacceptable abdication of responsibility. \nWhat does it say about the state of the this body that we do not trust \nourselves to make tough decisions? What kind of leadership do we \nexercise when we dodge accountability for a policy of such critical \nimportance to this country?\n  The decision that this legislation would force upon the Congress--a \ndecision to either remain in or withdraw from Kosovo--is exactly the \nkind of choice that we are here to make. It, Mr. President, is our \nresponsibility. I urge my colleagues to shoulder it with care, as \nfifty-nine hundred dedicated men and women are counting on us to do our \nduty.\n  The Warner-Byrd amendment would also mandate the burden-sharing that \nwas supposed to be at the heart of the U.S. approach to Kosovo. The \nU.S. bore the lion's share of the burden in NATO's military campaign of \nlast year. I did not agree with that policy; I believed then and I \nbelieve now that the leading role was Europe's to fill. But I was \nheartened by the promise that Europe would take the lead when it came \nto securing the peace, and that Europe, and not America, would provide \nthe vast majority of the resources required to meet Kosovo's enormous \nneeds.\n  There have been a lot of suggestions that this legislation does a lot \nmore than it actually does.\n  All this legislation does, Mr. President, is hold our valued friends \nand allies to their word. Kosovo's reconstruction and return to civil \nauthority cannot be allowed to become a U.S.-led project. Certainly, \nMr. President, while the U.S. fails to intervene in equally compelling \ncrises around the globe, we make the case--and it is, in my view, a \nvery strong case--for regional leadership in regional conflicts. \nAfrican solutions to African problems--that is often our prescription \nfor the conflicts and challenges of that troubled continent. In East \nTimor, we stood back, allowed a regional force led by Australia to take \nthe lead, and then played a supporting role in that effort. This, Mr. \nPresident, is the most promising recipe for U.S. engagement in the \nworld today. And it should be followed when it comes to Kosovo.\n  But there have been problems, Mr. President, with the timely delivery \nof Europe's pledges. This amendment makes the U.S. position crystal \nclear--our allies must fulfill their responsibilities if they are to \ncontinue to count on U.S. support. This is the right message and the \nright thing to do, and Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will \nremember how right this is the next time the tables are turned and it \nis our country that is failing to honor our international commitments, \nbe it at the U.N. or elsewhere.\n  So I urge my colleagues to face up to our shared responsibility when \nit comes to the U.S. involvement in Kosovo, and to insist that our \nallies do the same. The fifty-nine hundred American men and women in \nKosovo cannot dodge reality or duck responsibility. Neither should our \nEuropean allies, and neither should we.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Levin \namendment on the military construction appropriations bill. Of course, \nthe Levin amendment is designed to strike the Byrd-Warner provision, \nwhich I support.\n  I suspect that most of the things that could be said have been said. \nWe find ourselves saying them again, perhaps in other ways, or simply \ncommitting ourselves to our views with regard to this issue.\n  Clearly, it seems to me, there are two issues involved.\n  One is the role of Congress. What is the responsibility? What is the \nobligation? What is the authority of the Congress in terms of \ncommitting troops for long terms in places around the world?\n  The other, of course, is a policy question of an exit strategy for \nKosovo. That has been a question in a number of places where we have \nbeen recently.\n  It comes, I suppose, as no surprise to my colleagues that I view the \nKosovo foreign policy as sort of an oxymoron--that it actually has not \nbeen a policy. We went in. Indeed, that was one of the things that \nconcerned me the most in the beginning. There was not a strategy. We \ndid not have a plan for where we would go. Indeed, that has proven to \nbe the case. We didn't articulate the goals as to where we were, nor \nwhat the responsibilities would be among our allies, and, of course, \nthe length of time to be there complicates that.\n  We have seen an unbridled passion for involving the United States in \npeacekeeping operations around the world. I believe that has begun to \novertax our military capacity. We have military people deployed in many \nplaces.\n  There is no better or worse example of that than Bosnia and Kosovo. \nThere we have not had a strategy as to when we complete our job and \nwho, in fact, takes the leadership role. I agree with the Senator from \nWisconsin. We had an example in East Timor where we shared the \nresponsibility with others in the region. Indeed, in that case, \nAustralia took the lead. We were very supportive, as we should be.\n  The idea we need to have a major role both in the activity as well as \nthe financing in each of these areas is one that needs some specific \nexamination. Certainly the European Community has done some work there. \nThey are very capable. It is not as if we are talking about Third World \ncountries. We are talking about two of the world's most vibrant \neconomies.\n  Another reason I question the involvement, again, as a member of the \nForeign Relations Committee, we asked questions when this first came up \nand we were told certainly we would not be in Bosnia more than 18 \nmonths. How many years have we been there? We were told we were not \ngoing to be in Kosovo.\n  We have to come to some decision. The question arises, What is the \nrole of the Senate? I believe the Senate is responsible in terms of \nspending the money, in terms of authorizing long-term commitments. We \nshould step up to the post and express our views. We now have the \nopportunity to do that. We could also question, as I mentioned, the \nwhole idea of our level of involvement in places where we are with \nallies. We would certainly have the capacity to do much.\n  I am concerned about the constitutional implications of the \nPresident's actions. Clearly, the President should have, and does have, \nthe authority to move when there is a case of an emergency. That is as \nit should be. But the fact is, in both Bosnia and Kosovo, we didn't \nhave the opportunity. Did we vote? Yes, we voted after the troops were \nthere. Certainly no one is going to vote against the support for troops \nwho are already committed. I remember meetings held in Ohio and the \noriginal talk about Bosnia and Kosovo. We asked: What will we do? They \nsaid: We can't tell you yet; we have to go to Europe and have a meeting \nthere. We asked: What is our commitment? Well, we can't tell you yet. \nBefore the Congress had an opportunity to do anything, the troops were \nthere. We were committed. Clearly, we were going to support them.\n  This idea of an exit strategy, and certainly the idea that we have a \nrole as Congress, as a responsibility to the people of the United \nStates, to do that, is the question. I am not concerned that we are \nmaking a judgment ahead. That is not the case at all. We are setting \nguidelines. We say if those guidelines are not appropriate in that \ntime, then the President can come--whomever the President might be--to \nthe Congress and say there have been changes; here is what I am \nsupporting, and with the support of Congress can go forward with \nsomething different.\n  Byrd-Warner gives a clear plan to work with the European Community \nand, in fact, turn some of the full responsibility over to the European \nCommunity whenever it is appropriate. Byrd-Warner gives us that. We \nneed to ensure that the community is not reneging on its promises \nregarding its\n\n[[Page S4135]]\n\nshare of reconstruction funds. That is important. That should be done.\n\n  Finally, it puts us on a track, a flexible track, for exit and moving \nour troops out of that situation. That is what we ought to do. \nCertainly, it was mentioned on the floor that preserving peace in \nKosovo is important. That is not the issue. The issue is how do we do \nthat. Everyone knows it is important to have peace there. I think we \ncan do that through this system. It will solve both the constitutional \nquestion and the question of direction.\n  I urge my colleagues oppose the Levin amendment and support the Byrd-\nWarner amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, it is my understanding Senator \nCleland is taking time off the other side.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. I say with some dismay, we have been \ntrying to alternate. If the tactic here is to hold those in opposition \nuntil the end, I think an element of fairness in this debate may be \nslipping away.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Virginia, there is no reason to be \nsuspect of anything. We had a speaker lined up who you persuaded not to \nspeak. It threw us out of queue. We have Senator Cleland ready to \nspeak.\n  Mr. WARNER. I had to make that case.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Regarding that change, we are happy to have two or three \nof our speakers in a row when the Senator from Georgia is finished.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I echo the marvelous remarks of the \ndistinguished Senator from Wyoming, and my seatmate, the great \ndistinguished Senator from Wisconsin, and others who support the Byrd-\nWarner amendment.\n  The question is, simply put: Will the Congress of the United States \nstep forward and help this Government articulate an exit strategy of \nour military might out of Kosovo and out of the Balkans ultimately or \nwill we not?\n  I just got back from a trip to Western Europe, particularly to \nKosovo. I visited Brussels. I talked to NATO leaders. I visited the \nAviano Air Base in Italy where I met with some who flew the incredible \nair missions in the war. I went to Macedonia and saw the areas where \nmore than 100,000 refugees were, and into Kosovo itself and up on the \nSerbian border. We then exited through London. I came back with a \ndefinite impression that unless this country articulates its own exit \nstrategy, particularly for our military forces, there will be no exit \nstrategy. Our allies are quite willing for us to stay there forever and \never and ever.\n  I met with the distinguished Deputy Secretary General of NATO in \nBrussels. He looked at me and said: I can't count on one hand the \nnumber of years NATO will have to be in Kosovo. People in the United \nStates have to accept that you are a European power whether you like it \nor not, both in Europe and the Balkans.\n  I believe very strongly that we have borne the brunt of war. Seventy \npercent of the air missions in that war in Kosovo were ours. It was \nAmerican airpower and American mobility and technology that actually \nwon that war. I supported that. I voted on the floor of this great body \nfor air and missile strikes against Milosevic. I have also voted for \nthe accession of the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary to come into \nNATO. I, by no means, want to abdicate the role of the United States in \nfilling the power vacuum in Eastern Europe left by the fall of the \nSoviet Union. By the same token, I came back with a couple of clear \nsenses that I carry in my mind of what our American role should be. \nFirst, before we went in a helicopter into Kosovo, an Army colonel \nsaid: Look out the windows. There is a Roman aqueduct. I thought: I'm \nflying over terrain where Alexander the Great and his father, Philip \nII, made wars in Macedonia and that part of the world in 300 B.C. Then \nthe Romans were there. Later the Turks were there. And now we are \nthere.\n  I respectfully submit, what thousands of years of foreign occupation \nhave failed to do to that area, we will fail to do. So I specifically \nsupport the Byrd-Warner language which allows 75 percent of the more \nthan $2 billion contained in the supplemental appropriations title for \nKosovo operations to be released immediately and unconditionally for \nsuch operations.\n  I do support these operations now. But the remaining 25 percent would \nbe withheld pending a certification by the President, due by July 15 of \nthis year, that our European allies are making significant progress in \nmeeting their overall commitments for economic reconstruction, \nhumanitarian assistance, administrative expenses, and police forces for \nKosovo.\n  I understand our European allies did not have the capability, in \nterms of technology or maneuverability or mobility, to mass in an \noffensive attack against the forces of Milosevic. But I also understand \nthey do have the ability to provide economic reconstruction aid. As a \nmatter of fact, the European Union is stepping forward with $2.3 \nbillion. I applaud that. They have the capability for humanitarian \nassistance, and that is forthcoming. They do have the ability to \nprovide police forces for Kosovo. These are things our European allies \ncan do and should do.\n  Furthermore, the amendment requires the President to develop and \nreport to the Congress a plan to turn over all peacekeeping operations \nin Kosovo to those allies by July 1, 2001. This is the plan that is due \nby July 1, 2001, not the withdrawal of American forces. But at least \nthis is a plan; it is an exit strategy.\n  How do we get to this point? The U.S. Constitution says the Congress \ndeclares war. The Congress raises money for our Army and our Navy. It \nis the Congress that is the ultimate, final authority on whether young \nmen and women are committed in harm's way.\n  Finally, by that day, July 1, 2001, the Byrd-Warner language requires \nthe termination of funding for the continued deployment of U.S. ground \ncombat troops in Kosovo unless the President seeks and obtains specific \ncongressional authorization for a continuation of such deployment.\n  I am open to reasoned argument by any President on our role there, \nbut I think the Congress ought to make that decision.\n  As Senator Warner said in explaining the authors' intent, the Byrd-\nWarner language reflects two concerns:\n\n       the indefinite commitment of our troops into the Kosovo \n     situation and that indefinite commitment not being backed up \n     by the affirmative action of the Congress of the United \n     States which has a clear responsibility to act when we send \n     young men and women in harm's way.\n\n  I have just returned from a trip to Brussels and Kosovo where I met \nwith key military leaders from the U.S., European nations and NATO. On \nthat trip, I was discussing the role of the United States in Europe \nwith the Deputy Secretary of NATO, Sergio Balanzio, when he told me \nthat the United States is, ``a European power whether you like it or \nnot--not only in Europe but in the Balkans too.'' I responded that it \nis one thing to be on the point of the spear and to bear the heavy load \nin certain cases, as the U.S. did in Bosnia and Kosovo, but quite \nanother to always be called upon to ride to the rescue, even in Europe \nitself.\n  A large portion of the military operation in Kosovo was supplied by \nthe United States, and I believe it is now time to ``Europeanize'' the \npeace in Bosnia and Kosovo. While the soldiers I spoke with at Camp \nBondsteel certainly displayed high morale, reflected in the excellent \njob they have done, if we stay in the Balkans indefinitely, with no \nclear way out, I believe we run an increasing risk of further \noverextending our military thus exacerbating our recruitment and \nretention problems and lessening our capability to respond to more \nserious challenges to our vital national interests. The Byrd-Warner \namendment will help Europeanize the peace, unless and until a \ncompelling and vital American interest can be identified which would \njustify our continued deployment of ground forces, and I will be \npleased to support it.\n  However, I must add that, while this amendment does indeed address \nour military problem in Kosovo and does indeed reassert the \nconstitutional responsibilities of Congress with respect to that \nproblem, it does not address the underlying situation in Kosovo and is \nsilent on the similar problem right across the border in Bosnia. From \nmy perspective, the basic problem in the Balkans today is political, \nnot military, and requires a political rather than military solution. \nAnd, in the\n\n[[Page S4136]]\n\nsame way as the United States took the lead in military operations, it \nis now time for the U.S. to lead in finding a political solution. \nEssentially, at this point in time, the various communities wish to \nlive apart and exercise self-determination along ethnic lines. I would \nagree that such a development is unfortunate and not in keeping with \nour American view of the way the world should be. However, for any \nsolution to the current situation to be acceptable to the parties \ndirectly involved--and thus durable--this inescapable fact must be \ntaken into account.\n  On June 30 of last year, the Senate accepted by voice vote my \namendment to the foreign operations appropriations bill which expressed \n``the sense of the Senate that the United States should call \nimmediately for the convening of an international conference on the \nBalkans'' to develop a final political settlement of both the Kosovo \nand Bosnia conflicts.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my amendment be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Amendment No. 1163 to S. 1234, Fiscal Year 2000 Foreign Operations \n                             Appropriations\n\n      (Adopted by the Senate by unanimous consent, June 30, 1999)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING AN INTERNATIONAL \n                   CONFERENCE ON THE BALKANS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States and its allies in the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization (NATO) conducted large-scale military \n     operations against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n       (2) At the conclusion of 78 days of these hostilities, the \n     United States and its NATO allies suspended military \n     operations against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia based \n     upon credible assurances by the latter that it would fulfill \n     the following conditions as laid down by the so called Group \n     of Eight (G-8):\n       (A) An immediate and verifiable end of violence and \n     repression in Kosovo.\n       (B) Staged withdrawal of all Yugoslav military, police, and \n     paramilitary forces from Kosovo.\n       (C) Deployment in Kosovo of effective international and \n     security presences, endorsed and adopted by the United \n     Nations Security Council, and capable of guaranteeing the \n     achievement of the agreed objectives.\n       (D) Establishment of an interim administration for Kosovo, \n     to be decided by the United Nations Security Council which \n     will seek to ensure conditions for a peaceful and normal life \n     for all inhabitants in Kosovo.\n       (E) Provision for the safe and free return of all refugees \n     and displaced persons from Kosovo and an unimpeded access to \n     Kosovo by humanitarian aid organizations.\n       (3) These objectives appear to have been fulfilled, or to \n     be in the process of being fulfilled, which has led the \n     United States and its NATO allies to terminate military \n     operations against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n       (4) The G-8 also called for a comprehensive approach to the \n     economic development and stabilization of the crisis region, \n     and the European Union has announced plans for $1,500,000,000 \n     over the next 3 years for the reconstruction of Kosovo, for \n     the convening in July of an international donors' conference \n     for Kosovo aid, and for subsequent provision of \n     reconstruction aid to the other countries in the region \n     affected by the recent hostilities followed by reconstruction \n     aid directed at the Balkans region as a whole.\n       (5) The United States and some of its NATO allies oppose \n     the provision of any aid, other than limited humanitarian \n     assistance, to Serbia until Yugoslav President Slobodan \n     Milosevic is out of office.\n       (6) The policy of providing reconstruction aid to Kosovo \n     and other countries in the region affected by the recent \n     hostilities while withholding such aid for Serbia presents a \n     number of practical problems, including the absence in Kosovo \n     of financial and other institutions independent of \n     Yugoslavia, the difficulty in drawing clear and enforceable \n     distinctions between humanitarian and reconstruction \n     assistance, and the difficulty in reconstructing Montenegro \n     in the absence of similar efforts in Serbia.\n       (7) In any case, the achievement of effective and durable \n     economic reconstruction and revitalization in the countries \n     of the Balkans is unlikely until a political settlement is \n     reached as to the final status of Kosovo and Yugoslavia.\n       (8) The G-8 proposed a political process towards the \n     establishment of an interim political framework agreement for \n     a substantial self-government for Kosovo, taking into full \n     account the final Interim Agreement for Peace and Self-\n     Government in Kosovo, also known as the Rambouillet Accords, \n     and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity \n     of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the other countries \n     of the region, and the demilitarization of the UCK (Kosovo \n     Liberation Army).\n       (9) The G-8 proposal contains no guidance as to a final \n     political settlement for Kosovo and Yugoslavia, while the \n     original position of the United States and the other \n     participants in the so-called Contact Group on this matter, \n     as reflected in the Rambouillet Accords, called for the \n     convening of an international conference, after 3 years, to \n     determine a mechanism for a final settlement of Kosovo status \n     based on the will of the people, opinions of relevant \n     authorities, each Party's efforts regarding the \n     implementation of the agreement and the provisions of the \n     Helsinki Final Act.\n       (10) The current position of the United States and its NATO \n     allies as to the final status of Kosovo and Yugoslavia calls \n     for an autonomous, multiethnic, democratic Kosovo which would \n     remain as part of Serbia, and such an outcome is not \n     supported by any of the Parties directly involved, including \n     the governments of Yugoslavia and Serbia, representatives of \n     the Kosovar Albanians, and the people of Yugoslavia, Serbia \n     and Kosovo.\n       (11) There has been no final political settlement in \n     Bosnia-Herzegovina, where the Armed Forces of the United \n     States, its NATO allies, and other non-Balkan nations have \n     been enforcing an uneasy peace since 1996, at a cost to the \n     United States alone of over $10,000,000,000, with no clear \n     end in sight to such enforcement.\n       (12) The trend throughout the Balkans since 1990 has been \n     in the direction of ethnically based particularism, as \n     exemplified by the 1991 declarations of independence from \n     Yugoslavia by Slovenia and Croatia, and the country in the \n     Balkans which currently comes the closest to the goal of a \n     democratic government which respects the human rights of its \n     citizens is the nation of Slovenia, which was the first \n     portion of the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to \n     secede and is also the nation in the region with the greatest \n     ethnic homogeneity, with a population which is 91 percent \n     Slovene.\n       (13) The boundaries of the various national and sub-\n     national divisions in the Balkans have been altered \n     repeatedly throughout history, and international conferences \n     have frequently played the decisive role in fixing such \n     boundaries in the modern era, including the Berlin Congress \n     of 1878, the London Conference of 1913, and the Paris Peace \n     Conference of 1919.\n       (14) The development of an effective exit strategy for the \n     withdrawal from the Balkans of foreign military forces, \n     including the armed forces of the United States, its NATO \n     allies, Russia, and any other nation from outside the Balkans \n     which has such forces in the Balkans is in the best interests \n     of all such nations.\n       (15) The ultimate withdrawal of foreign military forces, \n     accompanied by the establishment of durable and peaceful \n     relations among all of the nations and peoples of the Balkans \n     is in the best interests of those nations and peoples.\n       (16) An effective exit strategy for the withdrawal from the \n     Balkans of foreign military forces is contingent upon the \n     achievement of a lasting political settlement for the region, \n     and that only such a settlement, acceptable to all parties \n     involved, can ensure the fundamental goals of the United \n     States of peace, stability, and human rights in the Balkans;\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) The United States should call immediately for the \n     convening of an international conference on the Balkans, \n     under the auspices of the United Nations, and based upon the \n     principles of the Rambouillet Accords for a final settlement \n     of Kosovo status, namely that such a settlement should be \n     based on the will of the people, opinions of relevant \n     authorities, each Party's efforts regarding the \n     implementation of the agreement and the provisions of the \n     Helsinki Final Act;\n       (2) The international conference on the Balkans should also \n     be empowered to seek a final settlement for Bosnia-\n     Herzegovina based on the same principles as specified for \n     Kosovo in the Rambouillet Accords; and\n       (3) In order to produce a lasting political settlement in \n     the Balkans acceptable to all parties, which can lead to the \n     departure from the Balkans in timely fashion of all foreign \n     military forces, including those of the United States, the \n     international conference should have the authority to \n     consider any and all of the following: political boundaries; \n     humanitarian and reconstruction assistance for all nations in \n     the Balkans; stationing of United Nations peacekeeping forces \n     along international boundaries; security arrangements and \n     guarantees for all of the nations of the Balkans; and \n     tangible, enforceable and verifiable human rights guarantees \n     for the individuals and peoples of the Balkans.\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I truly believe that such an approach is \nbest, if not the only, way to resolve the difficulties in Bosnia and \nKosovo--allowing our troops eventually to come home but avoiding an \nunacceptable security vacuum in southeast Europe--and is definitely in \nthe best interest of the United States and Europe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nGeorgia. He is on the Senate Armed Services Committee. He just \nexemplifies duty, honor, and country in every respect. I hope our \ncolleagues take to\n\n[[Page S4137]]\n\nheart the message from this distinguished Senator and soldier-citizen \nof America.\n  I will yield the floor after one procedural matter. As I understand \nit, the distinguished Senator from Oregon, Mr. Smith, will next address \nthe Senate--if, after that, we could have our colleague from Texas for \n6 minutes?\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. As we indicated before, we had a number of Senators on the \nway. If we could have, now, two of ours, since my colleague had two or \nthree of his in a row, it would be, I think, better order.\n  Mr. WARNER. We were trying to rotate. Our colleague from Texas has \nbeen here about an hour.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I make an inquiry of the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan how long the next two would be, so I can determine if I could \nstay that long.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I do appreciate that. Senator Smith would be 10 minutes \nand Senator Hagel 12 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. How does that convenience or inconvenience our colleague \nfrom Texas?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. After 22 minutes? If we could put that in stone?\n  Mr. WARNER. We will just have that understood. I put the unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, if it is a convenience to the distinguished \nSenator from Texas, I would be very happy to go after the Senator from \nTexas, if that helps her schedule.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We don't have to etch the stone, then.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am happy to wait beyond the Senator from Oregon for \n10 minutes and the Senator from Nebraska for 12 minutes. Then if we \ncould get a unanimous consent, I would go next?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent we go in that \norder: Senator Smith for 10, Senator Hagel for 12, and then the Senator \nfrom Texas.\n  Before the Senator from Georgia leaves, if I could just take 30 of my \nseconds to thank him for his constant contribution to the debates and \nto this body. While we disagree on this particular issue, it is not \nvery easy for me; he always makes a major contribution, and we are \ngrateful for it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Chair act on the unanimous consent request, and \nnow with 7 minutes for the Senator from Texas?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair, without objection, enters the \nunanimous consent. There will be 10 minutes for the Senator from \nOregon----\n  Mr. WARNER. If I could take 20 seconds of my time just to advise \nSenators that the time remaining under the control of those proponents \nof keeping the amendment, namely Senators Byrd and Warner, has now \ndiminished to the point where the time Senator Byrd and I have \nallocated between ourselves--that is, the time of the Senator from \nVirginia has all but expired, and the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia has, under a previous order, 1 hour remaining under his \ncontrol. I just wish to advise the Senate of that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will observe there is a unanimous \nconsent order that gives the opportunity to the Senator from Oregon to \nspeak for 10 minutes, to be followed by the Senator from Nebraska for \n12 minutes. Is someone propounding another consent to change that \nconsent?\n  Mr. WARNER. I did not hear that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding part of the unanimous \nconsent request is the Senator from Texas would follow Senator Hagel \nfor 7 minutes. So there would be some order here, the Senator from \nVirginia could follow the Senator from Texas?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will make a revised unanimous consent \nrequest, after talking with Senator Robb who just came in, and with \ngratitude to Senator Hagel. I ask unanimous consent for this order of \nspeakers: Senator Smith of Oregon, then Senator Robb for 6 minutes, \nthen Senator Hutchison, and then Senator Hagel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, frankly, I am pleased, as we alternate back and forth, \nthere are Republicans and Democrats not crossing on party lines but \narguing a very important issue of what they feel, what they think, and \nhow they perceive America's interests to be best served.\n  I realize that many of my colleagues have spoken eloquently about the \nconsequences that will result if the United States Senate supports the \nByrd-Warner amendment. And though I may repeat some of their arguments \nthis morning, I think it is critical that those of us who oppose this \nlanguage state loudly and clearly that this is the wrong way to go.\n  I spoke last week on this matter Mr. President. I said then that \nthere may come a time when it is appropriate for the U.S. to withdraw \nfrom Kosovo--but that time is not now. We face enormous worldwide \nresponsibilities, and I agree with those that feel the burden sometimes \nseems rather heavy. But that is not a reason for us to seriously \njeopardize the most important and most successful Alliance in history.\n  We are a European power. It is in our interests to maintain American \nleadership in Europe. And we have seen what happens when the U.S. \nchooses to come home after a bitter conflict has ended. I am confident \nthat if the U.S. pulls out of Kosovo, as this legislation requires if \nthe Congress does not authorize continued participation, we will be \nforced to return--under circumstances that will certainly not be as \nfavorable as we face today. We have managed to create a situation where \nour troops certainly face threats in Kosovo, but the risks are \nrelatively limited.\n  By our action, by setting up the conditions under which American \ntroops would withdraw from Kosovo next summer, we could trigger the \nvery instability in Kosovo that we have managed to forestall thus far. \nI am not going to whitewash what is happening in Kosovo today. We have \nour work cut out for us in establishing a functioning administration \nthere that respects the rights of minorities. But the situation is \nrelatively stable, after over 10 years of disorder. We can only \nspeculate, of course, as to what would transpire if we were to pull \nout. But there is a real possibility--one can almost say a \nprobability--that the Kosovar Albanians would feel compelled to prepare \nfor another assault by Serbian henchman directed by Slobodan Milosevic. \nCould our European allies adequately protect the Kosovar Albanians from \nthis assault? I can not answer that definitively, but I will tell you \nthat the Kosovars think that the answer is no. So we withdraw, the \nKosovars rearm, Milosevic feels emboldened, and we are back where we \nstarted before the NATO air campaign began. Is that why we fought this \nwar?\n  Why do we want to jeopardize the peace? The 5,900 American soldiers \nthat are participating in KFOR are making a critical contribution to \nmaintaining peace in Kosovo. Our troops comprise approximately 15% of \nthe total of KFOR. That seems to me to be a reasonable percentage for \nthe U.S. to contribute. The European forces are making a difference in \nKosovo--they are doing their job. But we should be willing to do ours \nas well.\n  Mr. President, let me return to my principal concern with this \namendment--the threat that it poses to U.S. leadership in Europe. I \nhave met with five different Foreign Ministers from Europe over the \npast several weeks, and in these meetings I have emphasized the \nimportance of maintaining the trans-Atlantic link. Our security is \ndirectly related to European security, whether we like that or not, and \nfor us to signal to our Allies that we are unwilling to participate in \nsecuring the peace in Kosovo--when they are contributing 85% of the \ntroops--inherently divides us from our Allies. I have criticized them \nfor seeking to establish a separate defense structure that is not tied \nin with NATO at every step of the way.\n  We should not encourage them in these efforts by indicating that we \nare an unreliable ally that cannot be counted on to stay the course. I \ndo not think this should be an endless commitment, however, there \nshould certainly be a drawdown in our forces as circumstances warrant \nand as Europeans do more in Kosovo. But we\n\n[[Page S4138]]\n\nshould not make the determination now as to what our troops should do \nnext year.\n\n  I realize that the supporters of this amendment say that they are not \ncalling for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Kosovo--that they are \nsimply asking for an authorization. But Mr. President, with all due \nrespect for my colleagues, their amendment forces the withdrawal of our \nforces unless positive action is taken by the Congress. I do not \nquibble with their complaints that the President did not ask for \nCongressional authorization for this mission. I agree with them: he \nshould have done so. But is it in our interests to tie the hands of the \nnext President? To force him to adopt a course of action because of a \nlack of Presidential leadership today? I think not.\n  I am reminded of the early, tragic days of the war in Bosnia. As you \nrecall, Mr. President, European troops were on the ground in Bosnia as \npart of the UN mission, but no American troops were there. As a result \nof the dramatically different risks we faced at that time, the U.S. and \nour Allies supported different approaches to deal with that conflict. \nWe lost valuable time trying to coordinate our strategy--time when \nBosnians of all ethnic groups were slaughtered. A strong Alliance is \none where benefits and risks are shared, and that is the direction that \nwe should be going now.\n  Let me say, that I agree with my colleagues who have complained about \nunequal burdensharing. The Europeans were incredibly slow in approving \ntheir contributions to the Kosovo Consolidated Budget, their \nhumanitarian and reconstruction assistance, and getting their police \nforces on the ground. I commend Senator Warner for his successful \nefforts at ensuring they get the picture. We have the right to expect \nthat our European allies do their fair share consolidating the peace in \nKosovo, particularly given the unequal burden borne by the U.S. during \nthe war. And I believe that thanks to the distinguished Chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, the Europeans now understand this and are \ntaking steps to correct the problem.\n  Mr. President, we must maintain American leadership in Europe. We \nshould do our part in solidifying the progress we have seen in Kosovo. \nI urge my colleagues to support Senator Levin's motion to strike the \nByrd-Warner language.\n  Mr. President, I admire Senator Warner, the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee. He is a great American and a great man. While I am \nnot with him on this issue, it is a privilege to be with him on most \nissues.\n  Also, I believe Senator Byrd, the other author of this amendment, is \na man who stands uniquely among us as a defender of the prerogatives of \nthe Senate. I appreciate that, I admire him for that, and I thank him \nfor that.\n  I believe it is Senator Warner's desire to protect our armed \nservices, as is his charge, and I believe it is Senator Byrd's desire \nto protect the prerogatives of the Senate that has motivated this. I \nrespect that. I say to them that they have already achieved much of \nwhat they hoped to do with this amendment, so this debate, this effort, \nis not in vain. I tell them respectfully now why I am not with them on \nthis issue.\n  I know that many Americans are weary of our involvement abroad, and I \nknow that many would like to just go home. I actually believe the right \npolitical vote in this case would be to vote for a date certain with my \ncolleagues on the other side to get out of Kosovo. I say to every \nAmerican who cares about foreign policy or our standing in the world, \nthis is not the right way; this is not the right instrument; this is \nnot the right time for this branch of Government to interject itself \nwith this kind of an amendment.\n  I happen to have traveled to the Balkans at the height of the Kosovo \nconflict. I was privileged to travel with Senator Hutchison of Texas in \nher codel where we visited many of the surrounding countries of Kosovo. \nI remember when we went to Hungary, we were standing on the balcony of \nthe Foreign Ministry of Hungary, and the Foreign Minister came up to \nme--this is a beautiful setting, overlooking the Danube--and he said: \nSenator Smith, I did not realize when we were admitted to the NATO \nalliance that we would be at war a few days later, but we are thrilled \nto be a member of NATO, and we are proud to stand with the United \nStates of America.\n\n  I drew him out and said: Why do you say that, Mr. Foreign Minister?\n  He said: We are proud to stand with the United States because the \nUnited States is a nation uniquely positioned in world history; that we \nare unique in that we have the capacity to fight for values and not \njust to fight for somebody's treasure or somebody's territory.\n  I was proud of my country when he said that.\n  I found myself a few days later in Macedonia. When we were there, we \nwere at the point where, coming out of Kosovo through a pass in the \nmountains, literally tens of thousands of refugees were pouring into \ntwo camps. We went to the second camp. There were 50,000 people there. \nIt was arranged that each of the Senators would have an hour there with \ninterpreters.\n  We went through the camp talking to the refugees, examining the \nconditions of the people, and hearing their concerns. I became aware \nabout halfway through my visit that there were three little girls \nfollowing me around as though I was from Mars. They looked at me with \nsome degree of awe and wonder.\n  Before we boarded the buses, I decided to try and engage them in a \nconversation. I was delighted to find that one of the little girls who \nwas 10 years old could speak reasonably good English. I said to her: \nWould you like to go home?\n  She said: I'd love to go home, but I can't; there are very scary \npeople there.\n  Then I said to her: Well, if you can't go home, would you like to go \nto America? And her eyes lit up with sparkles.\n  She put her hands to her face and said: Oh, to be a little girl in \nAmerica.\n  I will never forget that expression. I thought of my own little girl \nall the way home. I wonder what has happened to that little girl. She \ndid not come to America, but she was able to go home because the United \nStates was there.\n  The United States is in Europe. The world is better because after the \nSecond World War, the United States learned from a mistake and did not \nrepeat the mistake of the First World War. We did not go home. We \nstayed there as a beacon of stability that Europe has needed and I \nbelieve still needs.\n  The Europeans are beginning to feel a need for more security of their \nown. I have cautioned them: Be careful as you set up these European \ndefense identities that you do it within the context of NATO or you \nwill begin to decouple the United States from NATO. Be careful about \nthis.\n  My concern is heightened because as they talk of setting up these new \nstructures, they are all cutting their defense budgets. It appears to \nme they are setting up a paper lion.\n  We made a commitment to go into Yugoslavia. If anything should be \ncriticized, it may be we should not have gone into Bosnia. We have \nelections for a reason. We elected a President of the United States, \nnot of my party, but a President who decided it was in the America's \ninterest as the leader of the NATO alliance to go into Bosnia, and we \nwent. That job was complicated because Mr. Milosevic continued his \nmischievous ways, his murderous ways in a fashion that was unthinkable \nto the Western World that we should do nothing. In view of our own \ntroops, we were watching people being exterminated.\n  In the end, I decided to support President Clinton at this next level \nbecause I did not want to have to answer why, in the face of mass \nmurder, I did not do anything.\n  Lest Americans think it is all in vain, it is not. Things are not \ngreat in Kosovo, but they are much better than when we found them.\n  The benefit of Senator Warner's work is in this: The Europeans were \nslow off the mark in meeting their commitments financially and in \ntroops, but they are now. They are putting in the resources, and they \nare manning 85 percent of the burden there. We have 15 percent, a \nlittle over 5,000 troops, there. Is that in vain? Is it appropriate for \nus now to set an arbitrary cutoff time and, with the blunt instrument \nof the budget, to say we have had enough, we are going home? I say with \nall respect, if we do that, we will somewhat be saying to the Europeans \nwhat they are saying to us; that\n\n[[Page S4139]]\n\nwe are ready to delink the United States and NATO.\n  I do not want to do that yet. The day may come when we can say it is \ntime to go home, and the Europeans will be in a position where they can \nhandle it on their own. I do not believe that day has yet arrived.\n  I tell my colleagues and I plead with all Americans to understand \nthat while we can take for granted the peace, the security, and the \nprosperity of this land, most of the world looks to us as an example \nand with some envy and some hope that they may someday have what we now \nenjoy. If America says we are going home, I believe that vacuum will be \nso enormous, it will be filled not with an ideology but with a whole \nbunch of tyrants.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. If I may have but a few more minutes, I will \nconclude.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I do not want to see that vacuum filled by \npeople who do not share the values of Western Civilization as we know \nit in Western Europe and in the United States of America. I believe the \nEuropeans are beginning to do their duty and we ought to continue to do \nours.\n  I also would like to conclude with an anecdote from campaigning with \nGovernor Bush on Tuesday in Oregon, in which he assured me his \nopposition to this was not about getting America's withdrawal from \nYugoslavia but to do it in a reasoned way, in a bipartisan way, and in \na way that does not compromise the long-term security interests of the \nUnited States, which is now inseparably linked to Europe.\n  So I plead with my colleagues to vote for the McCain-Levin amendment \nto strike. I believe this is in the country's interests, in the world's \ninterests, and certainly in the interests of Kosovo.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ROBB. Of course.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will take 30 seconds, on my time, to thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Robb from Virginia, I believe, \naccording to the unanimous consent agreement, has 6 minutes at this \ntime.\n  Mr. ROBB. I yield to the distinguished Senator from Michigan on his \ntime, as requested.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I take 30 seconds, on my time, to thank the Senator from \nOregon for his very thoughtful and very heartfelt statement, based on a \ntremendous amount of study of Europe.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that Senator Voinovich be recognized \nafter the conclusion of Senator Hagel's remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given 1 \nminute prior to Senator Robb.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his kind remarks. \nBut I want to draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that we--the \nU.S. taxpayers--have already spent $4.5 billion on this Kosovo \noperation. The President did not ask for any money for the year 2000. \nThat is why we are faced with this supplemental of another $2 billion. \nSo $4.5 billion plus $2 billion is $6.5 billion. Then the authorization \nbill, which we are now working on, and the appropriations for the next \nfiscal year, has another $1.6 to $1.7 billion.\n  Wake up, colleagues. We are shoveling money out of here as fast as we \ncan swing our arms, without giving, I think, due consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I join my distinguished colleague from \nMichigan in recognizing the eloquence of the statement just made, very \nmuch from the heart, by the Senator from Oregon. I concur in his \nremarks.\n  Once again we are on the floor of the Senate debating the strength of \nthe U.S. commitment to peace and stability in the Balkans, and once \nagain we are being asked to weigh the benefits and costs of our current \ncommitments.\n  I do not like to find myself at odds, especially on national security \nmatters, with my friend and senior colleague from Virginia. We share so \nmany of the values that shape our view of the world and the critical \nrole of the United States in that world. We also share an unshakeable \nconviction in the importance of the moral and physical leadership of \nthe United States in a dangerous world and the belief that a strong \nUnited States is the best guarantor of peace.\n  Likewise, I have enormous respect for the other coauthor of the \namendment which is currently incorporated in the military construction \nappropriations bill we are now considering. There is no other Member of \nthis body who is more knowledgeable, when it comes to the history of \nour Constitution, or who has fought harder to uphold the constitutional \nrole of the Congress and of this body in relation to the executive \nbranch than the senior Senator from West Virginia.\n  I understand and share our colleagues' frustration with the costs of \nour commitments in the Balkans, not just in terms of dollars but also \nthe wear and tear on our armed forces around the world.\n  I understand and share our colleagues' frustration with the glacial \npace of progress toward reconstruction in Kosovo and the establishment \nof a capable civil police force. But we knew the risks going into this \neffort to stop the killing and give peace a chance to take hold in this \ntroubled land. We know from experience that these types of efforts defy \ndeadlines. We know from experience the consequences of setting \nconditions that let other countries control our destiny.\n  Each time we have debated deadlines, I have argued against them. Each \ntime we have proposed statutorily binding deadlines, I have voted \nagainst them. I believe the provisions in this bill establishing a \ndeadline for the withdrawal of ground troops from Kosovo undermine U.S. \nleadership around the world and raise understandable anxiety about our \ncommitment to peace and stability in the Balkans. They play directly \ninto the hands of those in the region who depend on conflict and chaos \nto achieve their ends.\n  The situation in Kosovo defies a simple calculus for withdrawal of \nU.S. forces. The situation in Kosovo defies a simple calculus for those \nwhose burdens are greater or smaller, fair or unfair.\n  We know from experience that the requirement of our physical presence \nand our relative share of the burden will shift with changing \nconditions on the ground--either through reduced threats or improved \nstability.\n  Setting statutory deadlines now, in my judgment, will only undermine \nthe confidence of our allies. Setting statutory deadlines now will only \nshake the world's confidence in our leadership. Setting statutory \ndeadlines now will only encourage those who oppose peace and stability \nin the region.\n  The deadline framework established by this provision in the military \nconstruction bill tells our adversary what combination of actions or \nmanipulation of conditions by which he can ``control'' U.S. and NATO \npolicy.\n  Although the authors argue that this provision has no automatic \ntriggers and that there are escape clauses allowing the Congress to \nundo what this provision would do, the advantage of knowing the limit \nof our commitment transfers the advantage and the leverage to our \nadversary.\n  Under this provision, July 1 becomes a magic date--either this year \nor next; or some other date, if it happens to be switched in \nconference--against which he can plan, organize, and execute efforts to \npursue regional destabilization.\n  Under this provision, in the mind of our adversary, we trade the \ncertainty of our commitment to stability, and our military capability \nto enforce it, for the certain knowledge of our limited determination \nand the eventual unhinging of the political and military cohesion of \nour coalition.\n  I am concerned that regardless of when the deadlines may be set in \nthis provision, our perceived lack of will could put at risk militarily \nour coalition troops on the ground in Kosovo.\n\n[[Page S4140]]\n\n  I have been proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with my friend and \nsenior colleague on many issues involving our Nation's national \nsecurity interests. But I cannot do so on this issue because I believe \nit would undermine our position of world leadership and place us in an \nuntenable position regarding the Balkans.\n  In support of our men and women in uniform in the field, and of \nAmerica's enduring open-ended commitment to peace and stability, I \nmust, therefore, oppose the provision currently included in the bill \nand urge our colleagues to support the motion to strike offered by the \nranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  With that, Mr. President, I believe my time has expired. If not, I \nreserve any remaining time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield myself 60 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague for his kind personal references. \nIndeed, we have worked together as a team. On this one, we divide.\n  Regarding his concluding remarks on world leadership, in this debate \nwe are constantly talking about our allies. I am concerned about the \nhometowns in Virginia that are shoveling out taxpayer funds, billions \nand billions of dollars. I have already added it up--well over $6 \nbillion.\n  There has really been no debate or action in this Senate. We have an \nobligation in the Congress to speak before we shovel these funds out in \nincredible sums. It is from the towns and villages in our State and \nother States from whence we get these brave young men and women, who \nput on these uniforms, as the Senator and I have in the past, and march \nforth from the shores of our country into harm's way. I think Congress \nhas to stand up and be accountable in those decisions and support the \nPresident. I have no fear that this institution will support the next \nPresident of the United States in his request, if he comes forward and \nsays: It is my intention not to just leave this indefinitely but here \nis my plan to keep our troops over there.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 15 seconds to \nrespond to my colleague.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am happy to yield 15 seconds to the \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished senior colleague. \nWe agree on so many things. Sometimes we have to consider the cost of \ndoing nothing as opposed to the cost of doing what we are doing. It is \nin that context that I view this particular dilemma we face. I \ncertainly share my distinguished senior colleague's commitment to \nfinding a way to maintain our commitments to peace in the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have been on the floor for a long \ntime this morning. I will address two major points I keep hearing \nbecause it is important that we refute those points.\n  First, we are not setting a deadline. We are not withdrawing troops. \nThe Byrd-Warner amendment says we are voting to make the decision, \nafter plenty of time for the President and our allies, consulting with \nCongress, to make a plan. We are setting a timetable in which we would \nhave the opportunity to set a plan, and that timetable will probably be \nOctober or December of next year. Then after we have a plan from the \nPresident, we will have a vote on that plan and on the long-term \nstrategy.\n  Every time Congress exercises its responsibility to do what it is \nrequired to do under the Constitution, which is declare war and support \nthe Army and the Navy, the administration and many on the other side \nsay: What kind of signal does that send? What kind of signal does that \nsend to our allies? What kind of signal does that send to that terrible \ntyrant Milosevic?\n  No. 2, they say setting a deadline is irresponsible. I will answer \nboth of those questions.\n  We are sending a message. We are sending a message to our allies and \nto President Milosevic. It is a clear message, and it says, America is \ngoing to lead. America is going to come in and bring all the parties to \nthe table, and we are going to formulate a policy. We are going to \nlead.\n  It says, our goal is a lasting peace in the Balkans, not an unending \nmorass of indecision that wears out our troops, debilitates our own \nnational security, and does not help our allies or the Serb people at \nall. It says to Milosevic, we are serious and we are going to formulate \na plan. The President of the United States should take the lead and \nconsult with our allies and consult with Congress, as is required in \nthe Constitution.\n  Our policy in the Balkans has been drifting. Ever since I came to \nCongress 7 years ago, it has been drifting because the administration \nhas never come to Congress and said: This is my plan; will you approve \nit? Instead, he spends money from the Defense budget with no \nauthorization and then comes in and asks for emergency funds to \nreplenish the Department of Defense. Of course, we are going to vote \nyes. Of course, we are going to replenish the funds that have already \nbeen spent so our troops will be paid and our equipment will be \nupdated. Is this Senate going to allow our troops to be deployed on a \nmission that has never been laid out? Is that a responsible action of \nthe Senate? The answer is no. The Byrd-Warner amendment is taking the \nresponsible action for the Senate.\n  I will answer question No. 2: Setting a deadline is irresponsible. \nThis is the bait and switch. This is what they say every time. If you \nset a deadline, you are irresponsible. How could you do that and cut \nand run from our allies? But if you say, OK, we are not setting a \ndeadline, we are going to say, 1 year from now, we have a timetable \nthat begins the process for a plan and then, once you have the plan on \nthe table, you have an orderly process to implement that plan.\n  This is not a vote to withdraw troops. It is not a vote to cut and \nrun. It is not a vote to even have a deadline. It is a vote to take the \nresponsibility to approve a plan for a lasting peace in the Balkans. \nThis is a vote to be a responsible and strong ally and a formidable \nenemy. It is a vote that asks the same of our allies in return, that \nthey be strong and reliable allies.\n\n  It is a vote to take the responsibility in the Senate for our own \nnational defense. I ask the question of my colleagues: If we do not \ntake the responsibility for our national security, if we do not take \nthe responsibility when we see that we cannot recruit and retain \nmembers of our armed services today, if we don't take the \nresponsibility for addressing that problem, who will? Which of our \nallies will step up to the line and say, we are worried about your \nnational security deteriorating? Which of our allies is going to step \nup to the line and say, I am concerned that you are not providing the \nnuclear umbrella that we must have and that only you can provide?\n  The buck stops here. The Byrd-Warner amendment says we are up to the \ntask. We will defend our own troops in the field, to give them a \nmission and a timetable and a responsible plan under which they can \noperate. We will be a strong, reliable, and stable ally for all of our \nfriends. We will formulate a plan that is responsible as a superpower \nshould. We will no longer have emergency funds that refill coffers of \nmoney that have already been spent on a mission that is not spelled \nout. We will no longer be irresponsible. We will take the \nresponsibility that has been put on our shoulders by the people of our \nStates.\n  A vote for the Byrd-Warner amendment will do exactly what we were \nelected to do; that is, take the responsibility for our country and our \nallies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized for 12 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield myself 20 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I compliment my distinguished colleague from Texas. It is \nvery important that we get the type of message she has delivered today \nin the debate. I thank her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized for 12 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Chair.\n\n[[Page S4141]]\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to support the McCain-Levin amendment. \nKosovo is complicated. It is frustrating, dangerous, and fragile.\n  But I believe Kosovo and the Balkans are very clearly in the \nlegitimate sphere of American security. As I listened to the debate \nlast night and this morning--good, committed, informed debate--I \nbelieve we are not debating the congressional constitutional \nresponsibility or authority in foreign policy. I don't think that is \nthe issue. It seems to me that the issue which, in my opinion, comes \ndown two ways, is: Is this action a wise and correct action at this \ntime? Two, what are the consequences of this action?\n  Make no mistake, there will be consequences. We are always confronted \nwith imperfect choices. Conflict, peacekeeping, war, how you deal with \nthese problems always represents an imprecise business. We don't know \nthe answers. We don't know the outcomes. We don't know all the dangers \nand complications. These don't come in tidy little boxes, or wrapped up \nin easy-to-figure-out little equations. There are many unknowns. That \nis one of the reasons why it is very unwise and very dangerous to set \narbitrary deadlines. They never work.\n  Now, we have heard a lot this morning and last night about what our \nEuropean allies have not done. Well, in the fairness of this debate, I \nthink we should again remind those listening that, currently, America's \nground troops in Kosovo represent less than 15 percent. Less than 15 \npercent of all ground troops in Kosovo are American. That means 85 \npercent of the ground troops are European--including, by the way, the \nRussians.\n  I think something else that is relevant to this debate is the fact \nthat we have been there in Kosovo in this capacity, a peacekeeping \nresponsibility, for less than 1 year. If we want to take this to the \nlogical conclusion of lack of congressional authority as to when, \nwhere, how, and how long we are going to commit our peacekeeping \nforces, then I suggest that we go back and have a good debate on Korea, \nand on Japan, and on Europe.\n  We did have a debate on Kosovo last year, and we had a rather \nsignificant vote on moving forward in supporting the President's \nmilitary action. Now, it stands to some reason that if we made that \ninvestment and we had that vote and the American public was tuned in, \ninformed, educated, and their representatives were representing them in \nthis body, they had some sense of where we were going with this. Are we \ngoing to walk away from what we achieved and have been achieving? It is \nmessy, yes; uncertain, yes; fragile, yes; complicated, yes; but that is \na very relevant point to this debate. Then what is connected to that \nquestion is, what happens next?\n  Does anybody in this Chamber believe that the Byrd-Warner amendment, \nplanning to plan to withdraw, is a policy? Withdrawal is not a policy. \nWhy are we doing it now--less than 6 months before America elects a new \nPresident? We all of a sudden are quite agitated and excited about \nKosovo. We have had some time to deal with this. So we will ask our new \nPresident to take office in a matter of months, at the same time \nforming a new national policy team, new security, foreign policy, \nworking with new leaders, the Congress, the nuances and relationships \nthat are all part of that, and imposed upon him, encumbering him, is \nthis arbitrary deadline and this plan to withdraw. I don't think that \nis responsible. We leave this new President little latitude, little \nflexibility.\n  What about the magnitude and seriousness of this debate? If this is \nso important, why has it not been brought before the Foreign Relations \nCommittee? Certainly, the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate \nshould have some responsibility in this debate. We have not had 1 \nminute of debate on this. This came up in an Appropriations Committee \nmeeting, with no formal notice, and boom. This is responsible \npolicymaking? I don't think so. This is not a thoughtful approach to \nsomething this serious.\n\n  We need to listen to those who have responsibility for our troops on \nthe ground. General Clark and others have had the interest of our young \nmen and women as their main responsibility. What do they say about \nthis? They have said it is irresponsible, with dangerous consequences. \nA heavy, dark cloud of dangerous uncertainty hangs over this debate. \nWhat are the other consequences? Yes, there will be a vacuum. But there \nare connecting rods as well here. Does anybody doubt, if we would pass \nthis, that this would not have an effect on Milosevic and others like \nhim, and their interpretation, and their waiting game, and all that \nthey would do to wait us out? Of course not.\n  Let's get real. Let's get real in this body. This isn't theory. Does \nanybody doubt that this would not have a responsible consequence to our \nrelationship with our NATO allies, at the very time we are trying to \nconvince our NATO allies to go with us on a national missile defense \nsystem--and we will need that concurrence and cooperation with our NATO \nallies if we are going to, in fact, go forward with a ground-based \nnational missile defense system because we will need some radar sites. \nDoes this have an effect on that? Of course. Does it have an effect on \nour new relationship with the President of Russia? Of course it does. \nDoes it have an effect on how the Chinese and the Taiwanese see \nAmerica's commitment to its allies? Of course it does. These are big \nissues out here, Mr. President. We better understand the bigger \npicture. There will certainly be consequences in the Balkans. Do we \nthink if we do leave, we plan to leave the Balkans better than we found \nit? I don't think so.\n  America's word means something. America's commitment means something. \nI believe stability in Europe, stability in the Balkans is in the \ninterest of America. There is legitimate debate on the other side, \nmaybe, but I think it is in our interest. America has always \nrepresented hope, a better life, a better world. We have made the world \nbetter. Yes, we can debate all of our military conflicts, involvements, \nand engagements since World War II--Vietnam, Korea, Kuwait. Have we \nmade mistakes? Yes, we have. But, generally, is the world better off, \nmore peaceful, more prosperous, with more hope today because of \nAmerica? Of course it is.\n  There is one other thing we tend to forget: As the leader of the \nworld, we will always be asked and be required to carry a heavier \nburden than any other nation. We may not like that; it may be unfair, \nbut it is a fact. One of the reasons America is the greatest Nation on \nearth, in the history of man, is because we have had the unique ability \nto control our own destiny. How have we done that? We have done it \nbecause we were engaged; we were vigilant; we were strong. We anchored \nour country and our beliefs on principles, trusts, and values. Others \nhave responded to that.\n  These are all part of the dynamics of this debate.\n  I do not want my 9-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son to inherit a \nworld where America does not lead, if for no other reason, the next \ngreat power in the world may not be as benevolent or judicious as \nAmerica has been with its power over the last 200 years. All of these \ndynamics are part of this equation. This body must be very serious in \nunderstanding that.\n  Let Americans speak in November. Let our people speak. Elect a new \nPresident. That new President will begin a new, productive, positive \nrelationship with the Congress. We can together work on a foreign \npolicy that makes sense in a timely, effective way. That is the answer. \nThat is a wiser course of action. That is a more responsible course of \naction than voting for the Byrd-Warner amendment.\n  I might say before I end that it is because of Chairman Warner's \nefforts and leadership. That has been recounted last night and today. \nThe Europeans have in fact stepped up each day, each month, to more and \nmore responsibility to their obligations. And I thank the chairman for \nthat. Rarely do I disagree with him, but in this case I do.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to support the Levin amendment.\n  I yield the floor. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nOhio is to be recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for 60 seconds on my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague for his \nvery important contribution to the debate.\n\n[[Page S4142]]\n\nIt has been one of the best debates on foreign policy we have had in \nthe Senate I think this year. I appreciate his references to the \nSenator from Virginia.\n  We have accomplished much of what we set out to do in this amendment. \nI bring to the Senator's attention that yesterday there were 263 votes \nin the House of Representatives in support of the principles that are \nembodied in the Byrd-Warner amendment. The other body spoke just \nyesterday. But I say to my dear friend that I am willing to calculate \nwe have spent close to $20 billion in Bosnia and Kosovo. I will place \nit in the Record.\n  This is, in a sense, handing out another blank check for $1.8 billion \nin this supplemental for Kosovo with no clear, decisive action for the \nCongress requiring a strategy as to when our troops can hopefully be \nconsidered along with others to be withdrawn.\n  I say to my good friend, how many of my colleagues are calling back \nhome today to get the sentiments of hometown America and put them \nagainst----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has consumed 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. WARNER. The sentiments expressed so fervently by those wanting to \nstrike on behalf of our allies? There are 350-plus years of history, \ngoing back before World War II, of our steadfast alliance to our \nallies, and they can anticipate another 50 years. But on this, it is \ntime for Congress to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to speak for 1 minute \non my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first I thank Senator Hagel for a statement \nwhich is very meaningful because of the broad picture he drew, and also \nthe interrelationship between what we are voting on and the whole host \nof other issues that are connected to it and impacted by it, as well as \nfor the life experience and the life study he has brought to these \nquestions.\n  In response to the good Senator from Virginia, I can only say what \nwas voted on in the House yesterday is dramatically different from what \nwe will be voting on. In addition to the funds that he made reference \nto that we have spent to avoid a wider war, even greater expenditures \nof funds have been well spent, in my judgment. And, indeed, the good \nchairman of our committee has been very supportive of those efforts.\n  We should not pull back from the success which has been achieved \nbecause the American people have made a commitment to stability in the \nBalkans to avoid a much broader problem in Europe and around the world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, we are approaching the one year \nanniversary of the end of the NATO air campaign in Kosovo. But just \nlike a year ago, we find ourselves debating U.S. military involvement \nin Kosovo and what the U.S. mission in southeastern Europe should be.\n  With respect to southeastern Europe, I believe the Byrd-Warner \nlanguage that has been included in this Military Construction \nAppropriations bill is the wrong approach at the wrong time. In \naddition to our direct national security interests in Europe that would \nbe threatened by this provision, our efforts to encourage the \nestablishment of the rule of law, universal respect for minority rights \nand market economies throughout southeastern Europe would be devastated \nby the Byrd-Warner language.\n  In the aftermath of the air war over Kosovo, we have an opportunity \nto work with the international community to integrate the nations of \nthe region into the broader European community; an action I believe \nwill help avoid the continuation of the bloodshed and destruction we've \nseen over the last decade. To effectively threaten a troop pull-out--\nwhich the Byrd-Warner language does--jeopardizes our efforts to take \nadvantage of the worldwide interest in the region, and our ability to \nmake an historic positive change for the future in southeastern Europe.\n  Mr. President, we have American military resources on the ground and \nin the skies in southeastern Europe with the specific intent of \nbringing peace and stability to the region.\n  Unfortunately, the Byrd-Warner amendment will be viewed by friend and \nfoe alike in the region as a unilateral troop pull-out of Kosovo and an \nend to the commitment the United States of America has made to our \nEuropean allies to help bring peace to the war-torn Balkans.\n  The Byrd-Warner language requires the next president to make a \ndifficult determination on American presence in Kosovo soon after his \nelection--a time when he should be working to establish and implement \nhis foreign policy agenda for our nation with his senior management \nteam including his National Security Advisor, Secretary of State, \nSecretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  It will be a period when he will need to measure his allies and \nbecome intimately familiar with a myriad of foreign policy challenges. \nHis decisions will have a wide national security impact and must not be \nmade hastily, but that is what the Byrd-Warner language does.\n  Mr. President, if we are to succeed in opposing aggression around the \nglobe, we need to work with our allies. However, what the Byrd-Warner \nlanguage would do is show our NATO allies that as far as peace and \nsecurity in Europe is concerned, particularly in southeastern Europe, \nit is Congress' intention to extricate ourselves. I don't believe that \nis the message that the U.S. wants to convey.\n  For those of my colleagues who are interested in seeing Europe take \non more responsibility in southeastern Europe, the issue is, does the \nByrd-Warner language help or hurt?\n  I believe it would hurt, because I know that the Europeans have made \nthe commitment, and are continuing to make the commitment, to their \nsoutheastern European neighbors.\n\n  This past February, I was in Brussels to make my feelings known on \nthe subject of fair-share burdensharing to the leadership of the \nEuropean Union. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that the Europeans \nbasically understand that unless the Balkan region is fully integrated \ninto the broader European community, the region will ``Balkanize \nEurope.'' I was further pleased to see the Europeans taking the \nnecessary steps that will eventually include the nations of the region \nin the EU and NATO.\n  Of the total financial support committed to Kosovo by the \ninternational community, including humanitarian, development, economic \nrecovery and reconstruction assistance, the U.S. has pledged 15 \npercent, while the rest of the world has pledged 85 percent.\n  Of the total amount pledged for the operations of the UN Mission in \nKosovo, UNMIK, the EU and its member countries have pledged 74 percent, \nand the U.S. 13.2 percent.\n  In addition, at the Stability Pact conference in Brussels this past \nMarch, four dozen countries and three dozen organizations pledged $2.3 \nbillion--well above the $1.7 billion goal to fund regional economic \ndevelopment and infrastructure projects in southeast Europe over the \nnext twelve months. I believe this commitment represents one of the \nfirst positive steps that has been taken since the end of the air war \ntowards restoring peace and stability to the region.\n  What I am saying is: on the whole, the Europeans are meeting the \nchallenge. They are supplying the funds and they understand the \nimportance of involvement in the region. They are surpassing the \nthresholds established in the Byrd-Warner language.\n  What the U.S. needs to do is encourage them. For those nations that \nare responding to the challenge, pat them on the back. And for those \nthat aren't, coax them into contributing. We should be working with our \nallies in a cooperative fashion and not a confrontational one.\n  We need to understand that while the Europeans are handling the bulk \nof the spending in the region, we must also be willing to come to the \ntable to provide leadership and a little bit of a financial commitment. \nWhen I was in Brussels, the importance of the United States to provide \nleadership was underscored by members of NATO and the EU alike.\n  In addition, our leadership is absolutely desired and sought by the \nbenefactors of the Stability Pact. Just last week, I received a letter \nfrom the Bulgarian Minister of Foreign Affairs,\n\n[[Page S4143]]\n\nNadezhda Mihailova, who reiterated the need for the United States to \nstay at the table. She said:\n\n       . . . the importance of U.S. leadership in southeastern \n     Europe during reconstruction and beyond cannot be \n     overestimated--it is critical to the future success of the \n     region.\n\n  It is imperative that we stay focused and interested in what happens \nin this region of the world.\n  We should try to imagine what actions Slobodan Milosevic will take if \nhe knows that the United States has given up its commitment to \nrestoring peace in Kosovo. Imagine the last U.S. plane, the last \narmored personnel carrier, the last U.S. soldier leaving Kosovo. How \nconfident can we be that Milosevic will not renew his reign of terror \nagainst the people of Kosovo in an effort to solidify his power. What \nif he moves aggressively into Montenegro to quell the Djukanovic threat \nin the vacuum created by the American withdrawal. What will the United \nStates do then?\n\n  We are also trying to get the Kosovo Albanian community, especially \nformer members of the KLA, to support the rule of law and help \nestablish a governmental framework to make it work. Can any of my \ncolleagues imagine the psychological blow to this cause if they believe \nthat the U.S. is pulling the plug and leaving? There is no way they \nwill disarm. And, as a matter of fact, without U.S. support, the \nmoderate factions could be swept-up into the arms of the zealots.\n  Can you also imagine what the prospect a U.S. pull-out will have on \nthe Kosovo Serbs who have not fled; who chose to stay and try to live \nin peace with the Kosovo Albanians? What about those we encouraged to \nstay to help be a part of the interim government? With Milosevic's \ncampaign of ethnic cleansing still fresh in the minds of many Kosovo \nAlbanians, what will become of the Kosovo Serbs without the protection \nof the United States? What will become of the fragile peace and the \nfledgling government that we are trying to establish? It is my belief \nthat even the possibility of departure will destroy any chance for \nstability in Kosovo, as well as end the prospect of reconciliation in \nKosovo.\n  And what about extremist factions throughout the region, in Bosnia, \nMacedonia, Croatia, etc.--factions that have remained relatively \ndormant due to the U.S. presence? I think about Mr. Arber Xhaferi in \nMacedonia, one of the key leaders of the Albanian community there, \nwho's working with President Boris Trajkovski to create a truly multi-\nethnic Macedonia. President Trajkovski's democratically elected \ngovernment has made it clear that the ethnic Albanian community, which \nmakes up roughly 25 percent to 30 percent of the population, is an \nintegral and respected component of society.\n  However, there is evidence of an extremist element within the ethnic \nAlbanian community. These individuals are willing to resort to violence \nin order to destabilize the government of Macedonia, and put in its \nplace a government run by Albanians, for Albanians. There is genuine \nconcern in Macedonia, as well as other nations, that if the United \nStates leaves southeastern Europe, the deterrent factor on the \nextremist elements will have been removed, allowing for further \nregional instability.\n  Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senators Warner and Byrd, but their amendment to this bill \nputs us on a course that will unravel the prospect of a peaceful \nintegration of southeastern Europe into the whole of Europe.\n  We have the ability to help keep the peace in southeastern Europe, \nand I believe we should continue to provide our leadership and our fair \nshare of the costs during the next several years as we deal with the \ntransition in Kosovo and the fall from power of Slobodan Milosevic. We \nshould ensure the countries of the region that we do care about their \nfuture, and that we understand how fragile the political situation is \nin countries like Bulgaria, Macedonia, Romania and Croatia. We need to \nlet them know that we understand how important it is to support their \nnew democratic leadership as they transition to multi-ethnic societies \nthat respect human rights, the rule of law and which embrace market \neconomies.\n  A commitment on the part of the United States to the Balkans on all \nof these items will help ensure stability for generations to come. I \nbelieve by working together--Congress and the White House--we can come \nup with a solution that will allow for the United States to continue to \nlive up to such a commitment in southeastern Europe.\n  Our allies are willing to stay the course; they have made a \ncommitment to southeastern Europe and have put their money where their \nmouth is. It's no time for us to leave them high and dry. It is not in \nthe interest of our national security, our economic interests or the \ncause of peace in the world.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Levin amendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will speak for a minute awaiting Senator \nLevin's appearance on the floor.\n  As we approach the desk for this historic vote, and it will be a \nhistoric vote, I point out to my colleagues we have in the past \ncontributed, in fiscal year 1999, $4.5 billion for this action in \nKosovo. We are about to vote on, in a sense, another blank check, for \n$1.85 billion. In the bill I am working on and will bring to the floor \nhopefully next week and pass on to the appropriators, there is \nauthorization for another $1.65 billion for a total of up to $8 billion \nfor Kosovo.\n  I think we have an obligation to the people of our Nation in hometown \nAmerica who are paying this through their taxes, who are sending forth \nthe young men and women into harm's way beyond our shores. We have an \nobligation to them. If we are going to vote to strike the Byrd-Warner \namendment, in essence we are saying Congress is out of it. It is \nanother blank check. Add up Bosnia; it is about $11 billion to $12 \nbillion. We are approaching $20 billion for U.S. participation in this \ncritical part of the world.\n  I certainly agree it is in our security interests to have been with \nNATO in Bosnia, then with NATO in Kosovo. We did the bulk of the \nfighting in the 78-day war. How proud we are of the men and women of \nthe Armed Forces. Now we have an obligation to those serving today. For \nan indefinite commitment, there is no one who can come forth in this \nChamber--and I ask anyone to come forth in this Chamber--and give any \ntime expectation as to when this commitment terminates.\n  The Byrd-Warner amendment, within the confines of the constitutional \nresponsibility of the Congress, is trying to lay down a strategy and \nsome information for the American people who are paying the bills and \nsending forth the troops. To strike this language is back to business \nas usual, blank checks which will total, just in Kosovo alone, $8 \nbillion.\n  Then the section about our allies. They fought bravely with us to the \nextent they had the air assets, the lift assets, the highly technical \nguided ammunitions. They fought bravely. This is no disrespect to any \nsoldier, sailor, airman, or marine of any nation that fought in that \nthe 78-day war.\n  In a sense, we are fighting for their own interest in knowing how \nlong they are going to be there. No one can come to this floor and \ncontrovert the Senator from Virginia saying in January and February and \nMarch of this year they were falling behind in their commitments they \nmade following that war to provide economic assistance, humanitarian \nassistance, police.\n  We got their attention. I thank Senator Stevens, Senator Inouye. It \nwas a bipartisan effort. Many Members came to the floor and laid in the \nRecord the intention to bring this issue on the first legislative \nvehicle we could. That is before the Senate today, the requirement for \nour allies to fulfill their commitments. They are doing that. I am \nconfident that the President can make the certification as required in \na section of this amendment and certify that the allies have at long \nlast met their commitments.\n  This is a historic vote. It affects not only our commitments in this \nworldwide and important place in the Balkan region but all the other \ncommitments. It will set a standard by which the Congress will have \nsaid that we are going to enter our decision power under the \nConstitution as we send forth men and women of the Armed Forces into \nharm's way and expend the taxpayers' money in such enormous sums.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n\n[[Page S4144]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Michigan has \n69 minutes and there is a total of 63 minutes for Senators Byrd and \nWarner.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield myself 1 minute.\n  I happen to agree with the Senator and fought very hard with him to \nget the Europeans to do more. We have succeeded. They are not up to 85 \npercent of the combat forces, which is exactly what we wanted them to \ndo. They are coming across with more police because of the pressure we \nput on them. Senator Warner, I, and others put pressure on the \nEuropeans to do more to carry through with their commitments. I think \nthat pressure is useful.\n  The language before the Senate has two parts. The first part says if \nthey don't meet specified targets in a certain date, we are out of \nthere--unless, of course, Congress decides to change its mind. What we \nare putting in place on automatic pilot, we are out of there unless \ncertain, specific, commitments can be kept.\n  The head of the Office of Management and Budget, by the way, has gone \nthrough the items and has said those specific items at this moment \ncan't be certified, at least three out of four, for some very technical \nreason. But there is a second part to this. Even if the Europeans do \nall that is required by this amendment in the first half of it --or in \nhalf of it--we are pulling out anyway. The second part of the amendment \nsays unless Congress changes its mind by next July, we are pulling our \nforces out of there.\n\n  This is a totally inconsistent message in the language before us. \nHalf the message is: You have to do certain things by certain dates, \nEuropeans. The second half of the message is: Even if you do that, we \nare out of there. We need a plan, and unless the President requests and \nCongress authorizes, our troops are out of there. Those are \ninconsistent directions. It seems to me wrong for many reasons which \nhave been outlined.\n  I notice the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from West \nVirginia are on the floor. I do not know if the Senator from \nConnecticut is ready, and I do not know if the Senator from West \nVirginia is ready. But I inquire, perhaps of both of them, if I could, \nwhether or not they both wish to proceed at this time. Could I ask the \nSenator from West Virginia?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I hope the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nLieberman, will proceed.\n  I have a question, if I might ask the Senator.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would this be on the Senator's time?\n  Mr. BYRD. No, it will be on the time of the Senator from Michigan. It \nis a very brief question. I am alluding to something the Senator said.\n  Is the Senator under an impression that there has been no previous \noccasion when Congress has laid down a certain date and said after that \ndate there would be no further moneys unless the President comes back \nand requests them and Congress authorizes?\n  Mr. LEVIN. My guess is, and I could be wrong on this, that happened \non two recent occasions at least. We properly, in my judgment, said \ntroops must be out of Somalia by a certain date; troops must be out of \nHaiti by a certain date, period. We approved that and I supported that. \nThis language is very different from that.\n  Mr. BYRD. In what respect?\n  Mr. LEVIN. This language says that we are deciding now that next year \nthe troops must leave, unless--unless--later on Congress changes its \nmind. It is on automatic pilot. If the President does not request in a \nyear, and unless the Congress authorizes in a year--in other words if \nthe Congress does nothing, if the Congress does not change its mind--we \nare saying now that the troops are out of there in a year. That creates \na year of very dangerous uncertainty, according to our recent \ncommander, according to the head of NATO, according to the Secretary of \nDefense. It is that year of dangerous uncertainty which is being \ncreated here.\n  This is not a question, if I may say on my time, of the power of \nCongress. I could not agree with the Senator from West Virginia more. \nWe have the power to do what is being proposed. There is no doubt about \nit. We can set deadlines. We can set conditional deadlines. We can set \ndeadlines which are going to take place unless something else happens.\n  The question here is the wisdom--the wisdom of doing what is being \nproposed here, of deciding now that troops are going to come out of \nKosovo, that they must be withdrawn unless, a year from now, the \nCongress changes its mind and decides to authorize it following a \nrequest from the President. What that precipitates is a year of very \ndangerous uncertainty, of wavering commitment to an alliance, and this \nis what both General Clark, the head of NATO, and our Secretary of \nDefense have outlined for us.\n\n  Again, the question is not the power of the Congress to do what is \nbeing suggested by my good friend from West Virginia. That is \nindisputable. If that were the issue--does Congress have the power to \ndo this--this vote I hope would be 100-0, that we have the power to do \nthis. The question is its wisdom. What is the impact of the \nuncertainty, the trumpet that is unclear and uncertain, when we have \njust been successful in Kosovo with NATO allies? We are now asking NATO \nallies to do more--and they are doing more; now up to 85 percent of the \nground forces. The question is the wisdom then to put into place \nlanguage which says unless Congress changes its mind a year from now we \nare out of this?\n  And if I can quote, since I am on my time, this is the main objective \nof the language. According to the sponsors' Dear Colleague letter, the \nprovision has three main objectives. First, it terminates funding for \nthe continued deployment of U.S. ground combat troops in Kosovo after \nJuly 1, 2001, unless the President seeks and receives congressional \nauthorization to keep troops in Kosovo. In other words, a year from now \nsomething happens automatically unless we reverse ourselves.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we said the same thing on October 14, 1993, \nwith reference to Somalia. Let me read what the language said:\n\n       . . . Provided further, That funds appropriated, or \n     otherwise made available, in this or any other Act to the \n     Department of Defense may be obligated for expenses incurred \n     only through March 31, 1994--\n\n  Remember, we are talking on October 14, 1993--\n\n       . . . That funds appropriated, or otherwise made available, \n     in this or any other Act to the Department of Defense may be \n     obligated for expenses incurred only through March 31, \n     1994,--\n\n  Several months away--\n\n       for the operations of United States Armed Forces in \n     Somalia: Provided further, That such date may be extended if \n     so requested by the President and authorized by the Congress. \n     . . .\n\n  That is what we are doing here exactly, precisely. So what is so new \nabout it?\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The question is whether it is wise to do this when we have \njust been successful in Kosovo. In Somalia, we had determined to \nwithdraw. The sponsors of this language suggest we are not exactly \ndetermining to withdraw; we are sort of planning to withdraw and we can \nchange our mind. That was not the case in Somalia. In Somalia, we had \ndecided--and I very strongly supported the decision--to withdraw. It \nwas time to withdraw and we made that decision. It was the right one. \nIt was wise in the circumstances. We decided to pull our forces out.\n  Here it seems to me that is the question: Do we want to pull our \nforces out now? To say now that a year from now our forces are out of \nthere? It seems to me that is the question, not the power of Congress.\n  The constitutional question, if put to this body, I hope would have a \n100-0 vote that we have the power to do what is being proposed. But on \nwhether it is wise when we have just been successful--part of a \ncoalition fighting together for the first time, putting pressure on our \nallies to do more; succeeding in that pressure, they responded with now \nup to 85 percent of the ground forces--in that same language to say we \nare planning now on getting out a year from now, that is the question. \nIt is the wisdom of this language, not the power of Congress to pass \nit.\n  I thank my good friend from West Virginia and yield up to 20 minutes \nto the Senator from Connecticut.\n\n[[Page S4145]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and my friend from Michigan and my \nfriend from West Virginia for his courtesy allowing me to go forward.\n  Mr. President, I rise to support the motion to strike, and in doing \nso I join colleagues before me who have expressed what is clearly our \nvery sincere respect for the two cosponsors of the part of the \nunderlying bill which we seek to strike with our motion. There honestly \nare two no more distinguished Members of this body. May I say there are \nno more patriotic citizens that I have ever met than the Senator from \nWest Virginia and the Senator from Virginia. So I go forward with a \ncertain sense of awkwardness but certainly with a profound sense of \nrespect for the two of them, even as I disagree with the provision \nregarding Kosovo that they have added to this appropriations bill \nbefore us.\n  Much has been said on both sides. I will try to either say it quickly \nor add a few new thoughts. It seems to me we have to begin here by \nlooking backwards; in some senses, way backwards. By coincidence, last \nnight I was reading a new biography of President Woodrow Wilson.\n  One of the chapters begins with a description of the election of \n1912. The opening line says that as people were going to vote in the \nUnited States in 1912--and the great choices were Wilson, Teddy \nRoosevelt, and Taft--no one had in mind or could have imagined that 2 \nyears later an event would occur in the Balkans that would eventually \ndraw almost 2 million people into combat in that far away quarter--\nWorld War I.\n  We have struggled with, been affected by, lost lives as a result of \nconflict in the Balkans which spread throughout Europe and which has \nalways eventually engaged us because of our intimate relationship with \nEurope. We are a nation that, at the outset, was formed by children of \nEurope, by people who left Europe to come to these shores. We, of \ncourse, are much broader and more multicultural than that now, but that \nwas our origin.\n  Today our military and economic ties, our security and cultural ties \nwith Europe are deep and they are broad. We may in the push and pull of \nthe moment be drawn to other parts of the world. We are a global power \ntoday. But the base of our strength and the most comprehensive economic \nrelationships we have and the heart of our international security \nposture has always been in Europe and is today. What happens in Europe \nmatters to us today as it did in the second decade of this century, \nbloody as it was, which began with conflict in the Balkans.\n  Again, as the ``third world war'' of the last century concluded--and \nI say that referring to the cold war--and new alliances began the \nmovement of people, conflict broke out in the Balkans and threatened to \ngo further and engage our European allies and threatened the stability \nof that region so important to us.\n  I begin this way because what I want to suggest, and I hope I can \nconvince people, is that what happened in Kosovo--the outbreak, again, \nof barbarism, aggression against the people by force and what became \ncosmetically described as ethnic cleansing--was a singling out of \npeople because of their ethnicity, coincidentally their religion, and \nthey were subjected to mass forced movement, exile from their country, \nmurder, rape, and torture.\n  The fires were burning again in the Balkans, and this time, having \nmore recently confronted a similar threat in Bosnia, we waited, in my \nopinion, too long to get involved. We and our NATO allies acted on an \nimmensely successful air campaign a little more than a year ago which \nstopped the barbarism, stopped the aggression, stopped the killing, and \nallowed more than a million refugees to return to the homes from which \nthey had been brutally forced.\n  All of this is by way of saying that what happened in Kosovo that led \nto the peacekeeping in which we are involved--and which is threatened \nby the underlying amendment offered by the Senators from West Virginia \nand Virginia--was a great victory. It was a great victory.\n  General Clark recently returned from his position as SACEUR, our \nSupreme Allied Commander in Europe, a historic position, a position of \ngreat importance. He has been quoted frequently on the floor. In \nconversation with him, one of the things he said to me a week ago was \nthat the reaction to what happened in Kosovo from the European public \nand the American public, including particularly the American political \nelite, was so remarkably different. In Europe, there was a sense of \nextraordinary pride about the course of events as they concluded last \nyear in Kosovo, that stability, that freedom, that human rights had won \na victory in Kosovo. Here General Clark worried the reaction was not so \nclear, that there was not the sense of pride that should have been felt \nbecause of a pivotal leadership role the United States of America \nplayed in ending the barbarism and aggression in Kosovo.\n  I mention this today because it is perhaps that differing attitude \nthat leads us in the Senate to consider the Byrd-Warner amendment to \nthis Appropriations Committee bill, and also now we have witnessed the \nHouse take similar action on the question of whether our European \nallies are doing enough. Maybe we in this country never appreciated the \nsignificance of what we did.\n\n  I believe history will show, when historians look back at the 1990s \nand judge what occurred, the United States and NATO interventions in \nBosnia and Kosovo was a turning point, as an example that we and our \nallies had learned the lessons of the 20th century, the most bloody in \nhistory, unfortunately. One of the lessons is, if you turn your back on \naggression and genocide, in the end it will find you; it will force you \nto turn your face to it; and you will face carnage and will be drawn \ninto it at a cost that is ultimately so much greater.\n  We achieved a great victory. I support this amendment to strike \nbecause the language in the underlying bill that it would strike I \nfear, I say respectfully, will snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. \nIt will shake our alliance. It will send a message to Mr. Milosevic, as \nhas been said over and over: Just wait it out; the United States is not \na resolute power; it doesn't understand what it did in Europe.\n  It would encourage, unfortunately, those in Kosovo, particularly the \nAlbanians I fear, to a certain extent the Serbs, to worry we are about \nto leave and to begin to take up arms again, the very arms, as part of \nthis peace we are helping to enforce, they gave up. The Kosovo \nLiberation Army turned over its arms to the peacekeeping authorities.\n  I know those who have sponsored the underlying amendment have said it \nis not their intention to cut and run, to undercut NATO, to encourage \nMilosevic, but I fear that will be the effect of this proposal, \nnotwithstanding the intentions of its distinguished sponsors.\n  If, as has been said by proponents of the underlying provision, this \nis just a message to our allies in Europe to meet their commitments, if \nit is just giving an opportunity to the incoming President next year, \nwhomever it may be, whichever candidate it may be, to offer a plan to \nmake a decision, then let's do that. Let's not put America on a course \nto withdraw, which is what this underlying proposal does, to literally \ncut and run. Let's leave it to the next President to make those \ndecisions.\n  I was quite struck and appreciative of the statement Governor Bush \nhas made on this. It is a statement that is made in the national \ninterest. I hope all of us will heed it because it means the two major \nparty candidates, Vice President Gore and Governor Bush, both have said \nthey feel the underlying amendment would not only be bad for America's \nnational security interests but is something they do not want because \nit will hamstring whomever is privileged to occupy the White House in \nJanuary of next year.\n  Much has been said about the effects of this amendment. I want to \njust add this in addition to the way in which it will encourage \nMilosevic. Europe is stable now and yet not fully stable. A new \nGovernment has come to power in Russia. It is a Government that we are \nhopeful about and yet uncertain.\n  The people of Central and Eastern Europe, who lived under Soviet \ndomination for, oh, those four and more decades, in some cases, are now \nbeginning to stretch, to be free, to develop market-based economies, \nself-government,\n\n[[Page S4146]]\n\nnational independence. Some of them--three--now have joined NATO; a \nwhole other group--I believe it is nine--have been put in line. This is \na historic development and the most extraordinary and enormous victory \nfor the forces of victory and freedom that won the cold war.\n  I want to suggest to my colleagues that putting us on a course to \nwithdraw our forces from Kosovo, from the peacekeeping effort, to \nwithdraw our financial support for the economic and humanitarian \nreconstruction, will send a message of faithlessness, if I can say \nthat, of irresoluteness, of lack of concern by the world's superpower--\nthe beacon of hope for those who yearn for freedom and now have \nachieved it post-cold war in Central and Eastern Europe--that perhaps \nour commitment there is not firm, and that as they begin to enjoy the \nsunlight of liberty, we may be pulling back and not worried if the \nclouds begin to come over them again.\n  Our presence in Kosovo, important as it is to keeping the peace in \nKosovo, is clearly more broadly important to the ongoing march of \nfreedom for which we fought and won the cold war. In that sense, too, \nwe would begin to be snatching defeat from the jaws of the great \nvictory we won in the cold war.\n  The same is true for places of conflict throughout the world where \nthis kind of American irresoluteness--what will appear to be, whether \nit is intended or not, a cut-and-run approach--will encourage the \nenemies of freedom, the enemies of the United States, to take action, \nwith the hope that the United States does not care anymore, that we \nhave grown either so comfortable or so isolationist that we have taken \na shorter range of view and are not prepared to exercise the political, \nstrategic, and moral leadership on which I continue to believe the \nworld depends.\n  Much has been said here about the question of what our European \nallies have done or not done. I was at the annual security conference \nin Munich in February. We were battling with our European allies about \nwhether they kept this $35 million commitment they made. They had not \nkept it then. They have done it now.\n  But as has been said over and over again--I will not belabor it--the \nEuropeans are paying more than their fair share, which is to say they \nare paying the overwhelming majority of the costs of the military and \nthe humanitarian operation.\n  Although the numbers are very difficult to be totally comfortable \nabout as to who has given what--and I have tried very hard, working \nwith the Congressional Research Service, the World Bank, the European \nCommission, and the Department of Defense, to pin these down--it does \nseem to me that, overall, an argument could be made not just that the \nEuropeans are paying 80 or 85 percent of the costs of these operations \nin Kosovo but that they have met the terms thereby of the Warner part \nof the Byrd-Warner amendment. But the accounting can be difficult.\n  I think the amendment, if it is put in place, becomes meddlesome and \ntroublesome because it sends a message of doubt about our support and, \non a technical accounting basis, actually could put us in a position \nwhere the President could find it difficult, on the technicalities, to \ncertify that the Europeans have done what this amendment requires them \nto do. Therefore, we would be on the road to withdrawal, with all the \nconsequences I have described.\n  Surely there are better ways for us to express to our allies in \nEurope that we believe they are not meeting their commitments than this \nblunt instrument, putting this amendment on this appropriations bill. \nIt is for that reason I support so strongly this motion to strike.\n  I will just add two general points. The first is from a very \ninteresting column from the Washington Times by Mr. Tod Lindberg on \nTuesday, May 16, in which he, quite correctly, points to the \nambivalence Congress has expressed regarding Kosovo, an ambivalence \nwhich is so inconsistent; it reminds us that although Congress has the \npower of the purse, that is why we elect Presidents and we call them \nCommanders in Chief and why we expect them to make the foreign and \nmilitary policy of our country, because with 535 of us, it would be \nhard for us to get together and do what we need to do to protect our \nnational interests with the kind of authority a Commander in Chief can \nhave.\n  Of course, we have the power of the purse, and we can exercise it. \nBut we have tended, too often, to go in different directions. As Mr. \nLindberg points out:\n\n       Kosovo, more or less from the moment the issues there \n     became critical in the fall of 1998, has not exactly been \n     Congress' finest hour. The nadir, perhaps, came a year ago \n     during NATO's air campaign itself, [while our pilots' flying \n     actions endangered themselves over the Balkans] when the \n     House of Representatives voted within a short span not to \n     support the campaign and to double funding for it.\n\n  Remember the words from the Bible: If the sound of the trumpet is not \nclear, who will follow into battle? And 535 voices often find it hard \nnot to sound a clear trumpet. I think that has been the case here. It \nwill be the case if we do not strike this provision from this bill.\n  Mr. Lindbergh finally, at the end of the column, makes a few points \nwhich I also would like to quote. He thinks what is expressed in this \nunderlying amendment that we now seek to strike is not just concern \nabout whether the Europeans are keeping their financial commitments, \nbut I believe a strong argument could be made that they are; clearly, \nwe are paying only a minority of the costs of this operation. That is \nundeniable.\n  What is at work here, Mr. Lindberg says--I think, correctly--is not \njust the constitutional question that we have an obligation to exercise \nour judgment and decide whether we should stay or not--and, again, I \nsay the way to do that is not to put us on a march to withdrawal when \nwe are succeeding--but, he says, this amendment ``also serves for some \nas a false flag flying over isolationist sentiment--an opportunity to \nvent discontent with a whole range of American commitments without \nopenly stating the general case. For some, setting a deadline for the \nwithdrawal of U.S. troops from Kosovo has nothing whatsoever to do with \nKosovo; it's just the opportune application of a general principle of \ndisengagement to a particular case.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 20 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask unanimous consent to have 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I do think we have to ask ourselves--I \ndo not make any accusations here, of course, with respect to all my \ncolleagues. Lingering behind some sentiments is not just specific \nconcern about Kosovo but what Mr. Lindberg calls, in the Washington \nTimes, ``the opportune application of a general principle of \ndisengagement. . . .''\n  If it is that, it is extremely consequential. We have been tempted \nover our history and have fought the impulse of isolationism and \ndisengagement from the world, and every time we have succumbed it has \ncome back to cost us dearly.\n  I sat with our colleague from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey, a week or two \nago, discussing this very issue. Perhaps he has told this story on the \nfloor. But he reminded me, on the 25th anniversary of the end of the \nVietnam war, a newspaper asked him, because he is a distinguished and \nhonored veteran of that conflict, whether he would write his thoughts \nabout it. He said one of the thoughts that came to his mind is that 25 \nyears after the end of the first war--which I referred to at the \nopening of my remarks--in 1943, the sons and some of the daughters of \nthose who fought in the First World War, which ended in 1918, in 1943, \nwere training for and beginning to go to war in Europe.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's additional 2 minutes have \nexpired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask the Chair for up to 5 more \nminutes. I hope not to use them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan controls the time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask the Chair how much time remains on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-seven minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 3 additional minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The powerful point of the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. \nKerrey, our distinguished colleague, was that, because the world and \nAmerica did not learn the lesson of engagement after World War I, 25 \nyears later\n\n[[Page S4147]]\n\nthe sons and daughters of those who fought in World War I were again \nentering an even bloodier conflict, World War II. Twenty-five years \nafter the end of Vietnam, because America had learned the lesson, had \nnot turned isolationist, had been engaged, the sons and daughters of \nthose who fought in Vietnam were not heading in massive numbers into a \nbloody world conflict. The price of that difference is involvement in \npotential conflicts which can grow into conflagrations, such as those \nin Kosovo.\n  Mr. Lindberg closes his op-ed piece by saying:\n\n       The deadline in the Byrd-Warner amendment seems clear \n     enough. But a deadline for withdrawal is not a policy. It's \n     an anti-policy. It says that as of the date specified, we \n     don't care what happens. If that sentiment is ever powerful \n     enough to override a presidential veto, we are going to have \n     a world of trouble on our hands.\n\n  With all respect, this is a momentous vote the Senate will cast \ntoday. I urge my colleagues to vote for the motion to strike. I thank \nthe Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 61 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. I ask unanimous consent that the last 15 \nminutes of my remarks be reserved until just prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, I wonder if the Senator \nfrom West Virginia would allow the proponents to conclude, since we \nhave to carry the burden here. Senator Daschle also wants to speak. If \nthe Senator could speak his last 15 minutes, say, from 2 to 2:15, \nallowing the proponents to wind up, I think that would be the fair way \nto break this down.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, I don't know. I think as good an argument could be \nmade for those who have established an amendment here and who want to \ndefend it at the end. I would like 10 minutes. I certainly understand \nMr. Daschle's situation. He has time of his own. He has leader time he \ncan use.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator from West Virginia might then \nreserve the last 10 minutes of his remarks from 2:10 to 2:20, allowing \nSenator Daschle to conclude by 2:30, so we could have the vote at 2:30.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, that is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Michigan says \nthis vote is not about power. He says it is about the wisdom of taking \na vote on this matter. I hope I am not mischaracterizing his statement.\n  I say to him that this matter is about power. It is about the \narrogance of power and a White House that insists on putting our men \nand women in harm's way and spending their tax dollars without the \nconsent of their elected representatives. Where is the wisdom in that \ncourse? Where is the wisdom in allowing a policy of indefinite drift in \nthe Balkans with no end strategy and no clearly defined goal?\n  We have heard a great deal of impassioned, occasionally inflammatory, \ndebate over Kosovo in recent hours, the first such debate we have had \nsince U.S. ground troops entered Kosovo 11 months ago as part of a NATO \npeacekeeping operation.\n  I welcome this debate. It's about time. And I am glad that so many \nSenators are engaged in this debate. But before we bring this \ndiscussion to a head, I think that we need to address some of the more \noutrageous claims that have been made about the Byrd-Warner provision. \nTo hear some speak, this amendment will mean the end of civilization as \nwe know it. Hardly. Hardly. I appreciate the usefulness of hyperbole in \nspeech making as much as anyone, but it is time to bring this debate \nback to the realm of reality.\n  I have also heard, over and over again, that this provision is a slap \nin the face of our allies; that they are already shouldering the lion's \nshare of the peacekeeping and reconstruction burden in Kosovo, and that \nwhat we are doing is tantamount to abandoning NATO. I simply don't buy \nthat. I believe that Congress has every right to demand an accounting \nfrom the President on the level of effort that all the participants are \nexpending in Kosovo. That to me is not a slap in the face of the \nallies; that is basic bookkeeping.\n  I read carefully the letter that General Wesley Clark, former Supreme \nAllied Commander of NATO forces in Europe, sent to Senator Levin. I was \nfrankly shocked at his conclusions. Gen. Clark wrote: ``In fact, these \nmeasures''--referring to the Byrd-Warner provision--``would invalidate \nthe policies, commitments and trust of our Allies in NATO, undercut \nU.S. leadership worldwide''--how ridiculous--``and encourage renewed \nethnic tension, fighting and instability in the Balkans. Furthermore, \nthey would, if enacted, invalidate the dedication and commitment of our \nSoldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines, disregarding the sacrifices \nthey and their families have made to help bring peace to the Balkans.''\n  The Byrd-Warner provision is directed squarely at the institutional \nand constitutional responsibilities of Congress. Contrary to so much of \nthe rhetoric that we have been hearing, the Byrd-Warner provision does \nnot establish, as General Clark suggested, ``a de facto deadline for a \nU.S. pullout'' from Kosovo.\n\n  Those are strong words. Unfortunately, they wrongly characterize the \nByrd-Warner provision. Our language does not establish a ``de facto \ndeadline for U.S. pullout'' from Kosovo. The only deadlines our \namendment establishes are directed at the President.--who may be Mr. \nBush or Mr. Gore--and require him to seek congressional authorization \nto continue the deployment of U.S. ground combat troops in Kosovo.\n  Yes, I believe that U.S. ground combat troops should be withdrawn \nfrom Kosovo, in a safe, orderly, and phased withdrawal.\n  Our provision gives the administration a year to come up with an exit \nstrategy. We don't have one. Is it too much to ask that we have one? It \nrequires that two plans outlining a withdrawal be submitted to \nCongress--an interim plan to be submitted by the current President, Mr. \nClinton, and a final plan to be submitted by the next President, be it \nMr. Bush or Mr. Gore.\n  Moreover, our provision explicitly directs this President and the \nnext President to develop their plans in consultation with our NATO \nallies, and to ensure that the plans provide for an orderly transition \nto an all-European ground troop element in Kosovo. We are not pulling \nthe rug out from under our NATO allies. We are not discouraging them \nfrom seeing the job through. We are encouraging them to take full \nresponsibility, in terms of ground combat troops, for the security of \nthe Balkans. We are encouraging our allies to meet their commitments in \nKosovo. We are encouraging them to demonstrate that the United States \ndoes not always have to be the lead dog in a NATO operation.\n  I have heard it said that the Byrd-Warner provision could deal a \ndeath blow to NATO; that the alliance will crumble if the United States \nbrings a few thousand men and women home from Kosovo. That kind of talk \nis reckless; it is demoralizing to our allies. The NATO alliance will \nnot collapse if the United States does not have ground combat troops in \nKosovo. And if by some chance the allies are so shaky that the Byrd-\nWarner Kosovo provision would cause it to disintegrate, then I think we \nneed to give some thought as to why we are lending such a major amount \nof support to such a paper tiger. I believe the United States is the \nstrongest member of NATO, but I do not believe for a moment the United \nStates has to prop up NATO at every step of the way.\n  Let me return for a moment to the notion that the Byrd-Warner \nprovision sets a de facto deadline for a pullout of troops from Kosovo. \nLet me assure you that if Senator Warner and I wanted to set a deadline \nfor a pullout of forces from Kosovo, we would set it, and we would set \nit in stone. We do not do that. The Byrd-Warner provision does not \nmandate a troop withdrawal from Kosovo. Yes, it anticipates such a \npossible outcome, but it does not mandate it. If, in the wisdom of the \nnext President, it is necessary to continue the deployment of U.S. \nground combat troops in Kosovo, or if events in that troubled region of \nthe world so dictate, our provision provides explicit direction for\n\n[[Page S4148]]\n\nthe consideration, under expedited procedures, of a joint resolution \nauthorizing the continued deployment of U.S. ground combat troops in \nKosovo.\n  The intent of our provision is not to micromanage the Pentagon or the \nState Department. The intent of the provision is to restore \ncongressional oversight--restore congressional oversight--to the Kosovo \npeacekeeping operation. By its inaction, Congress has allowed the \nexecutive branch to usurp Congress' constitutional authority in this \nmatter. That is our fault, but it need not be our fault. We need not \ncontinue to let that happen.\n  The Founding Fathers vested in Congress alone the power of the purse. \nThe Constitution is very clear on this matter. Article I, section 9 of \nthe Constitution states:\n\n       No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in \n     Consequence of Appropriations made by Law. . . .\n\n  Yet what are we seeing? We are seeing in Kosovo, as we have seen in \nso many other peacekeeping operations, a bastardization of that \nprocess. Instead of Congress appropriating funds for expenditure by the \nexecutive branch, the executive branch has adopted the practice--\narrogant practice--of spending the money first. That is what they have \ndone here--spending the money first and then asking Congress after the \nfact to pay the bills.\n\n  I wonder if my colleagues can see the pattern here: Buy now, pay \nlater. Spend the money first, borrow from the military readiness \naccounts, and then give Congress no alternative but to reimburse the \nmoney. That is what has happened here. Trust me, this is not what the \nFounding Fathers had in mind when they created the Constitution of this \nNation.\n  As heir to that wisdom, every Senator has a duty to guard vigilantly \nthe rights bestowed on Congress by the Constitution, and no such right \nis more central to the separation of powers on which our system of \nGovernment is built than the vesting in Congress alone the power of the \npurse.\n  The issue is not only what policy the United States should be \nfollowing in Kosovo; the issue is also whether the Congress is \nupholding its authority, its powers, its rights and responsibilities \nunder the Constitution. I submit that by allowing the executive branch \nto de facto determine the expenditure of appropriated funds, we are \nnot.\n  It was reported some months ago that the United States is building--\nhear this--semipermanent military buildings at Camp Bondsteel in \nKosovo. These so-called C-huts are designed to last 5 years before \nmajor repairs are required. According to a report in the Washington \nTimes on March 1, the Army is putting up 300 of these structures at a \ncost of about $175,000 each. Well, you can do the math yourself. It \nadds up to a $52.5 million investment in military construction in \nKosovo. This sounds to me like the U.S. military is putting down \nserious roots, long-time roots, deep roots, in Kosovo.\n  The fiscal year 2001 military construction appropriations bill is the \nmatter pending before the Senate today. Scores of needed infrastructure \nprojects that must be funded by this bill have gone begging because \nthere is not enough military construction funding to go around. The \n$52.5 million being spent to construct those C-huts in Kosovo would go \na long way toward funding some of the backlog of projects that we have \nin this country. Mind you, I believe that if the United States chooses \nto send its men and women in uniform on missions to far-flung parts of \nthe world, they deserve a decent standard of living.\n  My question is: Why is the administration planning for a 5-year or \nmore stay in Kosovo without bringing the matter to Congress? That is my \nquestion. Why are you, down there at the White House, and at the \nPentagon--why are you, in the executive branch, planning for a 5-year \nstay or more in Kosovo without bringing the matter to Congress and \ngetting Congress to authorize this? Should Congress not have a voice in \nthe expenditure of the people's money? Should Congress not have a say \nin such deployments? Should the American people not have a voice in \nwhether they support such a deployment, such a long-term deployment? I \nhave read where some generals in NATO say it will be 5 years or it will \nbe 10 years. Others have said it will be a generation. I believe \nCongress and the American people should--no, not should, but must--have \na say in how the United States is deploying its increasingly scarce \nmilitary resources.\n  We hear they have recruitment problems in the services, in all of the \nservices, except perhaps for the Marines. They are having recruitment \nproblems, we are spreading our forces thin all over the globe.\n  Time after weary time, we have had the same gambit from \nAdministrations, both Democratic and Republican. Send the troops in, \nand Congress will not have the fortitude to pull the plug. Once we get \nthe men in harms way, so the argument always goes, it is dangerous to \ntalk about pulling them out. It is especially dangerous to set a date \ncertain for them to leave. Heaven help us. Never do that. Don't set a \ndate certain. How many times have we heard that same old tune? It turns \nlogic on its head. Just as we went into Bosnia, they said we will just \nbe there about a year. Now we are in the fifth year. That is the \nadministration leading us in and then believing that Congress won't \nhave the fortitude to pull the men and the women out. That kind of \nlogic asks us to believe that pulling troops out of harm's way is \npotentially more dangerous than leaving them in harm's way.\n  The Executive Branch is much more inclined to use our military might \nto accomplish various policy objectives, such as nation building--\npolicy objectives which may not be supported by the American people or \ntheir elected Representatives in the Congress. We have lately seen the \nuse of American boys and girls to enforce objectives authorized only by \nU.N. Resolution, which raises a serious question of national \nsovereignty in the mind of this Senator. I have perused the \nConstitution very carefully over the years, and I see no reference to \nconflict by U.N. Resolution or NATO Resolution. It is the Congress and \nthe Congress alone which the Framers entrusted with the awesome \ndecisions to send America's sons, and now her daughters as well, into \nsituations which might mean their death.\n  No armed conflict can succeed without the support of the American \npeople. It didn't succeed in Vietnam because it didn't have the support \nof the American people. It is their sons and daughters which we send to \nfight and to possibly die. It is their tax dollars which pay for the \nmissiles and the tanks and the bullets. We enter into armed conflict at \nour peril if there is no consensus among the people to take that \ncourse. And the best way that this Senator knows to achieve such a \nconsensus is for such matters to be debated and debated thoroughly on \nthe Floors of the Senate and the House of Representatives, and then for \na vote to be taken that reflects the people's will. The most solemn \nduty which we have as legislators and as sworn representatives of the \npeople who sent us here is to decide whether to ask young Americans to \nput their lives at risk. To abdicate that duty to a President--to any \nPresident, a Democrat President or a Republican--to abdicate that duty \nto any chief executive is wrong. It circumvents the Constitution, it \nbypasses the people, and it short changes the nation because the \npeople's will is never even known, never even known much less \nconsidered until the body bags start coming home. There are those who \nwill say that this Kosovo provision sets up a process which is too \ncumbersome. Some will say that Congress cannot be asked to declare war \nevery time there is a skirmish in the world. Well, of course, Congress \nshould not have to frame an official declaration of war for each and \nevery conflict. But, it should have to authorize in some way the \nconflict, and agree or disagree with its objectives.\n\n  Of course, the Administration will not like it. They never like it. \nThey do not want to see the Congress exercise its constitutional duty \nin matters of this kind. They don't want Congress to lift a hand. They \ndo not want Congress to say a word. Congress needs to be quiet. They \nwant a free hand. The administration wants a free hand to participate \nin military adventurism whenever and wherever they please. And they do \nnot brook interference by the Congress, the elected representatives of \nthe people, the directly elected representatives of people, unlike the \nPresident who is indirectly elected by the people. Presidents are \nelected by the electors who are elected by the people. If they can \navoid it, they don't\n\n[[Page S4149]]\n\nwant the Congress to even whimper--just do not hear a peep, not a peep, \nout of Congress. But this is not the way it ought to be.\n  The military is not a plaything or toy, subject to the whim and \ncaprice of a chief executive. The title ``Commander in Chief'' does not \nmake any President a king, free to send America's men and women in \nuniform wherever he may bid them to go, free to commit America's \nresources to battle or to police actions or to peacekeeping without \nbrooking any interference by Congress. Congress is not just the place \nthat pays the bills although the executive branch would like that. They \nwould like the Congress to be only the place to pay the bills. That is \nall. But Congress is not just a place to pay the bills. The legislative \ndepartment is an equal and coordinate department with the executive, \neven though it is sometimes hard for the executive branch to fully \nunderstand that.\n\n  As to the war powers, these are meant to be shared between the \nPresident and the people's elected Representatives in Congress. Let \nthere be no doubt: The Framers intended for the Congress, in the final \nanalysis, to hold the upper hand and have the final say.\n  That is why the framers vested the power over the purse in Congress. \nLet us take a look at the Constitution. I hold it in my hand.\n  These are the powers of Congress. Congress shall have the power ``To \ndeclare War.'' Congress shall have the power to ``grant Letters of \nMarque and Reprisal.'' Congress shall have the power to ``make Rules \nconcerning Captures on Land and Water.''\n  Hear me. This is the Constitution speaking.\n  Congress also has the general power ``To raise and support Armies.''\n  Congress shall have the power ``To provide and maintain a Navy.''\n  Congress has the power ``To make Rules for the Government and \nRegulation of the land and naval Forces.''\n  Congress shall have the power ``To provide for calling forth the \nMilitia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and \nrepeal Invasions.''\n  Congress shall have the power ``To provide for organizing, arming, \nand disciplining the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as \nmay be employed in the Service of the United States.'' Add to these \npowers contained in this Constitution the power ``to exercise exclusive \nlegislation . . . over all places . . . for the erection of forts, \nmagazines, arsenals, dock-yards, and other needful buildings . . .''.\n  Congress has the power ``To lay and collect Taxes'' to defend this \ncountry.\n  Congress shall have the power to ``provide for the common Defense.''\n  That is what this Constitution says.\n  Congress shall have the power ``To borrow money on the credit of the \nUnited States.''\n  That is what the Constitution says.\n  Congress shall have the power ``To make all Laws which shall be \nnecessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing \nPowers.''\n  And finally, this Constitution says, Congress has the greatest power \nof all. Congress is given the power in section 9, article I: ``No money \nshall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations \nmade by law.'' Thus, the scope of the warpower granted to Congress is, \nindeed, remarkable. The intent of the framers is clear.\n  Now let us examine the war powers that flow from the Constitution to \nthe President of the United States. In section 2, article II, the \nConstitution states: ``The President shall be Commander in Chief of the \nArmy and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several \nStates, when called into the actual Service of the United States.''\n  That is it. That is it, lock, stock, and barrel, except the \nConstitution says that the President ``shall Commission all the \nOfficers of the United States.'' But that is it.\n\n  So compare what the Constitution says with respect to the powers of \nthe Congress when it comes to warmaking, when it comes to the military, \nwith the powers the Constitution gives to the President:\n  The title, Commander in Chief, was given by the Framers to the \nPresident for a number of reasons. As Hamilton said in Federalist #74, \nthe direction of war ``most peculiarly demands those qualities which \ndistinguish the exercise of power by a single head.'' The power of \ndirecting war and emphasizing the common strength ``forms a usual and \nessential part in the definition of the executive authority.'' That has \nto be by a single head. This clause of the Constitution also protects \nthe principle of civilian supremacy.\n  It says that the person who leads the Armed Forces will be a civilian \npresident, not a military officer.\n  Consider the language in the Constitution: ``The President shall be \nCommander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of \nthe militia of the several states, when called into the actual service \nof the United States.'' With respect to the Army, the Congress, not the \nPresident, does the raising and the supporting; with respect to the \nNavy the Congress, not the President, does the providing and \nmaintaining; with respect to the militia, when called into the actual \nservice of the United States, Congress, not the President, does the \ncalling.\n  So, the President is Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, but \nwithout the power of Congress, there can be no Army and Navy to \ncommand, and the President's title would be but an empty title.\n  Thus, we should clearly see that the Constitutional Framers took \nBlackstone's royal prerogatives and gave them either to Congress \nexclusively or assigned them on a shared basis to Congress and \nPresident. This Administration and most of the recent Administrations \nthat have immediately preceded it seem never to have understood this \nsalient fact that the President's warmaking powers are not omnipotent \nas were those of the King of Great Britain. The Framers gave the \npolitical compass a 180 degree turn. The delegates at the Philadelphia \nConvention repeatedly emphasized that the power of peace and war \nassociated with the monarchy would not be given to a President of the \nUnited States. Charles Pinckney, one of the delegates to the convention \nfrom South Carolina, supported a vigorous executive. Pinckney was \nafraid Executive powers of [the existing] might extend to peace and war \n which will Render the Executive and Monarchy, of the worst kind, to \nwit an elective one.' John Rutledge endorsed a single executive, `tho' \nhe was not for giving him the power of war and peace.' Roger Sherman \nlooked upon the President as an agent of Congress, and considered `the \nExecutive majesty as nothing more than an institution for carrying the \nwill of the Legislature into effect, that the person or persons ought \nto be appointed by and accountable to the Legislature only, which was \nthe depositary of the supreme will of the Society.'\n\n  What about James Wilson of Pennsylvania?\n\n       James Wilson endorsed a single executive, but did not \n     consider `the Prerogatives of the British Monarch as a proper \n     guide in defining the Executive powers. Some of these \n     prerogatives were of a Legislative nature. Among others that \n     of war & peace '\n\n  How about Alexander Hamilton from the great State of New York?\n  Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist #69, differentiated between the \npower of the monarchy and the power of the American President. Hamilton \nstated that the President, under the Constitution, has ``concurrent \npower with a branch of the legislature in the formation of treaties,'' \nwhereas the British King ``is the sole possessor of the power of making \ntreaties.''\n  Control over the deployment of military forces was vested in \nCongress, as we can see from reading the Constitution. Madison \nemphasized that the Constitution ``supposes, what the History of all \ngovernments demonstrates, that the Executive is the branch of power \nmost interested in war, and most prone to it.'' We have seen that to be \nthe case. ``It has accordingly with studied care, vested the question \nof war in the legislature.''\n  On the power of declaring war, from Madison's notes, an incisive \ncolloquy occurred at the Constitutional Convention on August 17, 1787. \nI now read from Madison's notes: ``Mr. Madison and Mr. Gerry moved to \ninsert `declare,' striking out `make' war; leaving to the Executive the \npower to repel sudden attacks.\n  ``Mr. Sherman thought it stood very well. The Executive should be \nable to repel and not to commence war. `Make' better than `declare' the \nlatter narrowing the power too much.\n\n[[Page S4150]]\n\n  ``Mr. Gerry never expected to hear in a Republic a motion to empower \nthe Executive alone to declare war.\n  ``Mr. Ellsworth. There is a material difference between the cases of \nmaking war and making peace. It should be more easy to get out of war, \nthan into it. War also is a simple and overt declaration. Peace \nattended with intricate and secret negotiations.''\n  What about George Mason?\n  ``Mr. Mason was against giving the power of war to the Executive, \nbecause not safely to be trusted with it; or to the Senate, because not \nso constructed as to be entitled to it. He was for clogging rather than \nfacilitating war; but for facilitating peace. He preferred `declare' to \n`make.'\n  ``On the motion to insert declare - - in place of make, it was agreed \nto.''\n  Louis Fisher comments on the reaction taken at the Philadelphia \nConvention: ``The Framers empowered the President to repel sudden \nattacks in an emergency when Congress was not in session. That power \ncovered attacks against the mainland of the United States and on the \nseas. The President never received a general power to deploy troops \nwhenever and wherever he thought best. When Congress came back in \nsession, it could reassert whatever control on military activity it \nconsidered necessary.\n  James Wilson expressed the prevailing sentiment that the system of \nchecks and balances ``will not hurry us into war; it is calculated to \nguard against it. It will not be in the power of a single man, or a \nsingle body of men, to involve us in such distress; for the important \npower of declaring war is vested in the legislature at large.''\n  Madison insisted that the Constitutional liberties could be preserved \nonly by reserving the power of war to Congress. Madison stated: ``Those \nwho are to conduct a war cannot in the nature of things, be proper or \nsafe judges, whether a war ought to be commenced, continued, or \nconcluded. They are barred from the latter functions by a great \nprinciple in free government, analogous to that which separate the \nsword from the purse, or the power of executing from the power of \nenacting laws.''\n\n  When Jefferson saw the draft Constitution, he praised the decision to \ntransfer the war power ``from the executive to the Legislative body, \nfrom those who are to spend to those who are to pay.'' The \nAdministration, and all Senators who may be prone to advocate an all-\npowerful executive, should take note.\n  I have already referred to General Clark's letter, to which our \nattention was called by Senator Levin last week. That letter brings to \nmind another letter to which I shall refer. Presidents, of course, are \nin a position to deploy forces in military environments before Congress \nhas a chance to deliberate and decide what policies should be followed, \nand Presidents often do that. The potential for engaging the country in \nwar was demonstrated by President Polk's actions in 1846, when he \nordered General Zachary Taylor to occupy disputed territory on the \nTexas-Mexico border. His initiative provoked a clash between American \nand Mexican soldiers, allowing Polk to tell Congress a few weeks later \nthat ``war exists.'' Although Congress formally declared war on Mexico, \nPolk's actions were censured in 1848 by the House of Representatives \nbecause the war had been ``unnecessarily and unconstitutionally begun \nby the President of the United States.'' One of the members of the \nHouse of Representatives who voted against Polk was Representative \nAbraham Lincoln, who later wrote to William H. Herndon:\n  Much ado has been made of General Clark's letter to Senator Levin. \nLet's read Abraham Lincoln's letter to William H. Herndon:\n\n       Allow the President to invade a neighboring nation, \n     whenever he shall deem it necessary to repel an invasion, and \n     you allow him to do so, whenever he may choose to say he \n     deems it necessary for such purpose--and you allow him to \n     make war at pleasure. Study to see if you can fix any limit \n     to his power in this respect, after you have given him so \n     much as you propose. If, today, he should choose to say he \n     thinks it necessary to invade Canada, to prevent the British \n     from invading us, how could you stop him? You may say to him, \n     ``I see no probability of the British invading us'' but he \n     will say to you ``be silent; I see it, if you don't.'' The \n     provision of the Constitution giving the war-making power to \n     Congress, was dictated, as I understand it, by the following \n     reasons. Kings had always been involving and impoverishing \n     their people in wars, pretending generally, if not always, \n     that the good of the people was the object. This, our \n     Convention understood to be the most oppressive of all \n     Kingly oppressions; and they resolved to so frame the \n     Constitution that no one man should hold the power of \n     bringing this oppression upon us.\n\n  I wonder what Lincoln's advice would be to us today as we reflect \nupon the Administration's actions in Kosovo? Now that Congress has \nspent many months of complacent quietude before mounting a challenge to \nthe Administration's continued usurpation of Congress' share in the war \npowers, we learn that the Administration fiercely opposes the Byrd-\nWarner Amendment. Why so? Is it too much to ask of the Administration \nthat it come up with an exit strategy over the next year? Is it too \nmuch to ask of the Administration that it develop plans, in \nconsultation with our NATO allies, for an orderly transition to an all-\nEuropean ground troop element in Kosovo? Is it too much to ask that, if \nthere is a necessity for the continued deployment of U.S. ground troops \nin Kosovo after July 1, 2001--or October 1, 2001 which we hope to make \nthe date and will make it in conference--the President must request \nspecific authorization for such continued deployment of U.S. ground \ncombat troops in Kosovo, and that Congress must enact a joint \nresolution specifically authorizing the continued deployment of United \nStates ground combat troops in Kosovo?\n  Is it too much to ask that the peoples Representative--people out \nthere, their Representatives--be allowed to speak? What is wrong with \nthat? Why is the Administration so suddenly very hysterical about this \namendment? Very hysterical? They are panic stricken. They sent their \nbig guns to Congress. They have even sent General Clark up to address \nthe Democratic conference. What business does he have in the Democratic \nconference? Here we have in this Constitution, we have civilian control \nover the military, but here we find General Clark in the Democratic \nconference, trying to tell Senators what the intent of the Byrd-Warner \namendment is, trying to tell Members of Congress what their \nconstitutional duty in this institution is.\n  Does the Administration believe that the possible justification for \nthe continued deployment of U.S. ground combat troops in Kosovo after \nJuly 1 of next year would be so weak that the Administration dare not \nface the risk of a vote by Congress in this regard?\n  I say to my colleagues in the Senate: Each of us has taken an oath to \nsupport and defend the Constitution of the United States and we take \nthat oath because this Constitution requires Senators and Members of \nthe House of Representatives to take that oath. Now is the time to live \nup to that oath. We must insist that the war powers that devolve upon \nCongress, under the Constitution, be preserved and protected against \nusurpation by this or any other administration. Nobody is talking about \na declaration of war in references made to the powers and \nresponsibilities of Congress in this situation. Nonetheless, any \ncareful reading of the Constitution should make it as clear as the \nnoonday sun in a cloudless sky that when American combat troops are \ndeployed in a foreign country under circumstances where the lives of \nthose troops are put in jeopardy by possible combat in a potential \nbattlefield situation, the Congress is not required to remain silent. \nRemaining silent can become a habit. Congress can sleep on its rights \nuntil it can no longer claim those rights. And let us remember that it \nis also the people's rights on which we sleep.\n  As the late Justice of the Supreme Court, George Sutherland said in \nAssociated Press vs. NRIB:\n\n       For the saddest epitaph which can be carved in memory of a \n     vanished liberty is that it was lost because its possessors \n     failed to stretch forth a saving hand while yet there was \n     time.\n\n  The supporters of the Byrd-Warner amendment are stretching forth a \nsaving hand while yet there is time. I hope that all Senators will take \nthis occasion to assert the rights and powers of the legislative branch \nto which you belong, to which I belong, in respect to the conduct and \nuse of the American military while there is yet time. If we allow the \ncontinued encroachment of these powers, which were meant by the Framers \nto be shared by the legislative\n\n[[Page S4151]]\n\nbranch, future generations of Americans will not rise up and call us \nblessed.\n  Whether the next President comes up with a strategy to turn the \nground troop element of the Kosovo peacekeeping operation entirely over \nto the Europeans, or whether Congress authorizes the continued \ndeployment of U.S. ground troops in Kosovo, we will have taken \naffirmative action. We will have protected the people's rights--the \npeople's rights--and exercised our responsibilities under the \nConstitution. We will have done our duty, as we have all solemnly sworn \nbefore God and man to do.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes remaining, plus the \n10 minutes that has been reserved at 2:10.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator has no more time under his \ncontrol. The Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, has control. If there is \nnot another speaker, I see no other recourse but to put in a quorum \ncall.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thought we agreed on a schedule--perhaps \nI am mistaken--that Senator Byrd would be going from 2:10 p.m. to 2:20 \np.m.; that then Senator Daschle would go from 2:20 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. Am \nI correct there are 22 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We would precede Senator Byrd with our 22 minutes. That \nmeans Senator Byrd has 8 minutes left. I thought that was going to be \nused at this time. If Senator Byrd does not use that time now--at least \nmy understanding was we either go to Senator Warner or Senator Byrd \nbefore Senator McCain and I use our 22 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we have had an orderly debate. We started \nlast night at 5 o'clock. We have moved along. This will be the first \nquorum call in the 10 hours scheduled for this debate. We have tried to \nbe as cooperative as we could all the way along. I have no more control \nof the time. I suggest there be a quorum call placed, since no one \nseeks recognition, and it be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have 8 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 2 minutes of my 8 minutes to Mr. Warner, I yield 4 \nminutes of my 8 minutes to Mr. Levin, and that leaves me 2 minutes of \nthe 8 to add to the 8 that I will have later.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it had been my hope as cosponsor of the \nbill to have the opportunity to make some rebuttal arguments to those \nwho are about to speak. Since that will not be possible, I will take my \n2 minutes to sum up the manner in which I view this entire debate of \nthose who have come to strike the Byrd-Warner inclusion in this \nappropriations bill.\n  I am reminded of the immortal words of a great President, Franklin \nRoosevelt, when he said: The only thing this Nation has to fear is fear \nitself. Underlying the debate of those who are considering striking \nthis language is the fear that the next President will be unable to \nconvince the Congress to do what is right for America. That is what it \nis--fear.\n  I say to those who have fear, if there is not a simple majority, but \n51 votes, to support the next President, then logic says to me that the \ncontinuation of those deployments in Kosovo are not in the public \ninterest or the national security interest of this country. It is as \nsimple as that. If there are not 51 votes for it, we should not be \nthere, and we may as well stand up and face the world and say that this \nbody, with coequal responsibility, has exercised its voice.\n  I committed earlier in this debate and I commit now that if the next \nPresident makes a strong case, he will have the Senator of Virginia \nvoting and supporting him. I have confidence in this institution to \nmake the right decision, and in this Senator's heart, he has no fear. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Michigan, \nSenator Levin, for his leadership on this issue. This has been an \nexcellent debate, probably what we should have a lot more of in this \nbody on a variety of issues that confront the Nation and, therefore, \ncall us to our duties as the Senate and the Congress.\n  I agree with Senator Byrd when he quoted Congress should not remain \nsilent. Unfortunately, we passed a law some years ago called the War \nPowers Act. That act--and I believe Senator Byrd was here at the time \nof its passage--has been largely ignored, both by the executive branch \nand by the legislative branch.\n  On numerous occasions, I have approached leaders on both sides and \nsaid we are violating the law called the War Powers Act, and we \nblithely ignore that law. Yet when we pass laws that affect our fellow \ncitizens, we do not allow them to ignore the laws we pass.\n  It is a bit disgraceful, really, that we have a law on the books \nwhich we fail to address, particularly since this law is concerning an \nissue of no small importance; in fact one can argue, I think \npersuasively, of the most importance, and that is when and under what \ncircumstances we send young men and women into harm's way.\n  Since we ignore the War Powers Act, the power that the Congress has, \nwhich I respect, revere, and believe is entirely appropriate under our \nconstitutional responsibilities, is the ability to cut off funding for \nany military enterprise in which this Nation enters. I think that is \nclear. I do not think there is any argument about that.\n\n  If the Byrd-Warner amendment was about cutting off funds for further \ndeployment of U.S. military forces in Kosovo, I would be much more \ncomfortable about this debate and what it is all about, but what we are \ndoing is very unusual. I have not been here as long as some of the \nother Members of this body, but I have never seen an issue of this \nimport placed on a military construction appropriations bill which \ngenerally is a routine piece of legislation, except for a few of us who \ncome over and complain about the pork-laden aspects of it. But it is a \nroutine piece of legislation.\n  Now it is a vehicle for debate and decision over an issue of grave \nimportance, in the view of certainly General Clark, certainly Secretary \nCohen, certainly the Secretary General of the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization. We are talking about an issue that can impact the issue \nof war or peace in the center of Europe. And what have we done in the \nSenate? We have placed it on the military construction appropriations \nbill. This legislation should have been the subject of hearings in the \nForeign Relations Committee and the Armed Services Committee. It should \nhave had a legislative vehicle that proceeded through both committees \nand then came to the floor of the Senate. In an incredibly bizarre \nfashion, both committee chairmen and ranking members, in my view, have \nabrogated their responsibilities as committee chairmen and the \noversight of issues of this grave importance.\n  What is more bothersome is the fact that we are conditioning this \nvote on another vote that will take place sometime--which may be \nchanged by the sponsors of the bill. On what are we voting? We are \nvoting to propose a situation which would then require another vote.\n  As I have said, I have not been here a long time, but I have not seen \nanything quite like this. Our responsibility is not to have a vote on \nan issue that at a time certain requires another vote which, if \naffirmative, would allow the President of the United States to carry\n\n[[Page S4152]]\n\nout his duties as President of the United States. What this vote should \nbe about is funding, yes or no. Do we want to fund further operations \nin Kosovo or do we not? We have enough information to make that \ndecision. Members of this body have been informed.\n\n  When the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, for whom I have \nthe greatest respect and admiration, says Congress should not remain \nsilent, my answer is, Congress should not speak in this fashion. \nCongress should not be speaking in this fashion. Congress should be \nspeaking, as is its constitutional responsibility, to fund this \noperation or not to fund it.\n  I am concerned about burden sharing. I have been concerned about it \nall my days here in the Senate and before that in the other body. I am \nconcerned about what are the rules of engagement. I am concerned about \nthe role of our European allies. All of those things should be taken \ninto a context in which Members should make a decision as to whether we \nstay or go.\n  With all due respect, we are taking a vote to put off a vote which \nwould have profound consequences. The Congress, in my view, is not \nfulfilling its responsibilities when it addresses this issue in this \nfashion.\n  In the 1980s, I was in the minority and my party held the Presidency \nof the United States. All through the 1980s, there were attempts at \nmicromanagement of U.S. foreign policy, particularly in Central \nAmerica. Some of the bitterest debates I ever observed in the House of \nRepresentatives and here in the Senate concerned our involvement, our \nsupport for certain elements, our support for freedom and democracy in \nCentral America.\n  I, as did many of my colleagues on this side of the aisle--who I \nunderstand are now supporting this resolution--opposed that very same \nkind of micromanagement on the part of Congress when the other party \nwas in control of the White House.\n  I am very pleased to see the nominee of my party, Gov. George Bush, \nwith whom I had a very spirited contest over the previous year, step \nforward forthrightly and say this is an ``overreach of congressional \nauthority.''\n  Governor Bush has it right. President Clinton has it right. Secretary \nCohen has it right. And every objective observer that I know has it \nright.\n  The Washington Post of May 11, 2000, states:\n\n       But the Senate measure is the wrong answer to these \n     legitimate concerns.\n\n  We did not have to get into Kosovo. It was through the ineptitude of \nthis administration where they tried to impose an agreement, called the \nRambouillet agreement, which Mr. Milosevic could not accept. Then we \ncarried out, in my view, one of the more immoral military actions in \nthe history of this country. I say that because of the tactical way we \nconducted it: Flying our airplanes around at such high altitudes that \nour planes would not be shot down but we needlessly inflicted civilian \ncasualties. That is a shameful kind of operation on the part of the \nU.S. military.\n  The Washington Post says:\n\n       But the Senate measure is the wrong answer to these \n     legitimate concerns. By establishing a de facto deadline for \n     a U.S. pullout, it would actually discourage U.S. allies--who \n     are, after all, providing the lion's share of the ground \n     forces already--from seeing the job through as Sen. Warner \n     and others wish. It tells the enemies of a democratic, \n     multiethnic state in Kosovo--Serb and Albanian--that they can \n     wait out the Americans.\n\n  That is really what the message, if we adopt this resolution over a \nclear Presidential veto, would be: We can wait you out. We can wait you \nout, Americans, because we know you're going home.\n  The Secretary General of NATO, a man who is respected by all of us, \nsent us a letter.\n  I quote from that letter:\n\n       In my view, while ensuring proper burden-sharing is \n     important, we should not let that issue distract us from our \n     larger policy objectives. The NATO presence in Kosovo needs \n     to be decided on the merits of our being there--the job that \n     we are doing and that we need to finish.\n\n  That is the key. As critical as the burdensharing issue is, we should \nbe deciding this issue solely on the basis of whether or not it is in \nthe U.S. national security interests to have a military presence in the \nmiddle of Europe in Kosovo.\n  Burden sharing is an important issue. We now hear, even from the \ncosponsor of the legislation, Senator Warner, that he is pleased with \nthe increase in the burdensharing responsibility that has been taken up \nby our European allies. But this issue should not be based on burden \nsharing; it should be based on where our national security interests \nlie.\n  The Secretary General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization goes \non to say:\n\n       I believe that we owe it to ourselves, if not the people of \n     that region, to finish the job we began. As Secretary General \n     of NATO, I will pursue that goal with the utmost vigour. I \n     hope I can count on continued U.S. support, even recognizing \n     that the European Allies must continue carrying the largest \n     share of the load at this stage.\n\n  The Secretary General of NATO does not just speak for himself, and \neven the NATO alliance, but I think he speaks for all of Europe when he \nsays: ``I hope I can count on continued U.S. support.''\n  Since 1945, the United States has had a military presence in Europe. \nAny objective observer will tell you, our victory in the cold war was \ndue to our steadfast presence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield an additional minute to the Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is an important debate. It is an important issue. Will \nthe forces of isolationism and withdrawal prevail or will the United \nStates continue to hold its rightful position as the military and \neconomic leader of the world?\n  The language currently in the bill represents not just bad policy, \nbut bad law. Its inclusion in the Military Construction Appropriations \nBill is highly inappropriate. The Congressional committees that oversee \nthe Armed Forces and our nation's foreign relations should have the \nopportunity to review and debate national security matters of such \nconsequence. The Kosovo withdrawal language in the Military \nConstruction Appropriations bill is unprecedented and will certainly \nprompt a veto by the President. For these reasons, it is imperative \nthat we move to strike Section 2410 by voting in favor of the Levin-\nMcCain amendment.\n  The requirement in the bill for a withdrawal of ground forces unless \nCongress passes a joint resolution authorizing their continued \ndeployment is precisely the kind of provision that Congress should \nnever impose upon any Chief Executive. Congress has within its \nconstitutional authorities the power of the purse--the legislative \nmeans to terminate funding for an ongoing military operation. It is \nhistorically reluctant to exercising that authority, even when the \nmajority oppose the operation in question. But we should never impose \nthe kind of statutory burden on any President that this bill seeks to \nimpose.\n  Clearly, this Administration could have--and most definitely should \nhave--dealt more forthrightly with Congress and the American public \nfrom the beginning. Had it done so, it likely could have avoided this \nkind of exercise. As with Bosnia, however, its arrogance and ineptitude \nleft many in Congress with a sense of having to act lest its rightful \nplace in the debate over the U.S. role abroad would be completely \nignored. The result is the damaging language currently in the bill.\n  Congress has been down this road many times before. The propensity of \nthe Administration to deploy American military forces with seemingly \nwanton abandon on ill-defined missions of indeterminate duration is \nrepeatedly met with efforts by Members of Congress to legislate the \nterms of those deployments. We can, and most assuredly will, revisit \nthe question of separation of powers on national security again and \nagain. The Founding Fathers built into our system of constitutional \ngovernment certain tensions designed to prevent a potentially dangerous \nshift in the balance of power between branches of government.\n  We last debated the issue of war powers and the U.S. role in Kosovo \nin March 1999. The War Powers Resolution, which many view as \nunconstitutional, ironically proved to be the vehicle by which both \nHouses of Congress finally consented to debate the issue in its \ntotality, including my failed effort to authorize the use of ground \nforces in\n\n[[Page S4153]]\n\nKosovo during Operation Allied Force. That debate was illuminating for \nthe degree to which it illustrated the depth of opposition on the part \nof many senators to the military operation. That opposition, of course, \nis what lies behind the language on Kosovo in the bill before us today.\n  I am fully supportive of measures designed to improve the burden-\nsharing arrangements under which we operate alongside other nations, \nespecially in contingencies that should never have required U.S. \nmilitary involvement in the beginning. For this reason, I am not \nopposed to the burden-sharing language in the bill, although the \nfrequency of the reporting requirements are somewhat excessive. I take \nissue, however, with the draconian measures the bill mandates should \nthe answers we receive from the President not meet our expectations.\n  And make no mistake. When I refer here to the President, I refer to \nthe Office of the Presidency, for the language in this bill will have \nfar-reaching and damaging consequences for all future occupants of the \nOval Office. Funding cutoffs and mandatory troop withdrawals that must \noccur based on future circumstances absent congressional action, such \nas are reflected in this legislation, represent Congress at its worst. \nBy requiring enactment of a congressional joint resolution authorizing \nthe continuation of our current role in Kosovo, we are establishing a \nvery dangerous precedent that will seriously weaken this nation's \nability to conduct foreign policy long after many of us have left this \nmost august of bodies.\n\n  I would ask supporters of Section 2410 what they believe would be \naccomplished by the provisions limiting funding pending presidential \ncertification with regard to allied burden-sharing. Burden-sharing is a \nlegitimate issue for discussion. To threaten funding cut-offs for \ntroops in the field in the middle of an ongoing operation over the \nissues of equitable distribution of workload and financial commitment, \nhowever, is irresponsible in the extreme.\n  The strategic ramifications of Section 2410 should not be \nunderestimated. The United States has important national security and \neconomic interests around the world that are affected by what we do \nhere in Congress. By mandating a troop withdrawal from an ongoing \noperation, we threaten those interests by emboldening our adversaries. \nSlobodan Milosevic is a calculating and ruthless individual with a \nrecord of responding to outside pressures and inducements, retreating \nwhen necessary; conducting brutal campaigns when the opportunity avails \nitself. A precipitious withdrawal of U.S. ground forces while Kosovo \nremains unstable and the potential threat to Montenegro looms over the \nhorizon will undermine our interests in Europe and around the world. \nThat is a path down which we do not want to go.\n  Additionally, the implications for NATO must be considered. The \nUnited States has a very definite stake in the evolution of a European \nSecurity and Defense Identity, as manifested in the efforts by our \nallies to establish the so-called Eurocorps. It is not in our interests \nfor such a unit, should it take shape and mature into a viable force, \nto act independent of U.S. influence--influence that would be severely \nundermined by a unilateral action of the kind contemplated in this \nbill.\n  Clearly, the failure of our European allies to deploy the numbers of \npolice officers necessary to accomplish the mission of pacifying the \nregion without the continued use of military personnel untrained in \nsuch activities has been very troubling. And I would be hard-pressed to \ndefend the conduct of the operation in light of internal U.S. military \ndisagreements regarding the deployability of U.S. troops from their \nsector to areas like Mitrovica where tensions and the propensity for \nviolence remain high. This has not been a well-conceived mission. But \nthere are worse alternatives, and the approach represented in this bill \nis one such example.\n  A far better approach, I would suggest, would dispense with the \nautomatic funding cut-offs currently in the bill. Rather than automatic \ncut-offs in the event presidential certifications fall short, Congress \nwould still be free to offer legislation terminating the U.S. role in \nthis operation. A vote by Congress to act affirmatively to cut off \nfunding, while I would oppose it, is less damaging to U.S. foreign \npolicy than is a triggering mechanism written into law--the object of \nthe authors of the current language. And we would avoid establishing a \nvery dangerous precedent that I would like to think few among us \nactually wish to see materialize.\n  Mr. President, you do not have to be a supporter of the manner in \nwhich the operation in Kosovo has been conducted in order to have \nserious problems with this language. It is a peacekeeping operation in \na region where the commitment to peace remains tenuous.\n  Many in Congress and the public we represent want out of Kosovo. We \nshould never have had to go there to begin with, but for the \nunwillingness of our European friends and allies to act swiftly and \ndecisively to prevent a brushfire from becoming a raging inferno. But \nwe should not willingly commit untold damage to our future ability to \nconduct foreign policy when alternatives may exist. And we should never \nundercut our forces in the field out of pique that other countries are \nfailing to shoulder their share of the load--especially when the \nburden-sharing issue has devolved primarily to one centering around the \ndeployment of police officers.\n  We had every right to be angered by what Generals Clark and Reinhardt \nreferred to as the hollowing-out of allied force contingents. The \nquiet, almost surreptitious withdrawal of soldiers by key allies was \nnot their finest hour. But forceful diplomacy, not congressionally-\nmandated troop withdrawals, is the answer to such problems. The \nlanguage in this bill is counterproductive and damaging to U.S. foreign \npolicy. We should not compliment a questionable policy with even worse \nlegislation. I urge my colleagues to support the removal of Section \n2410 from the bill and vote yes on the Levin-McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wonder if I might ask Senator Byrd for \n50 seconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield the Senator 2 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my good friend from Arizona, we respect his \njudgment, his long association with the U.S. military, and indeed his \ndepth of knowledge as it relates to security and foreign affairs. While \nI respectfully differ, I nevertheless think it has been a constructive \nand important part of this debate.\n  May I also, at this time, congratulate the Senator on 20 years of a \ngreat marriage, which he celebrated last night.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my good friend from Arizona for his statement and \nfor the clarity and passion he brings to this issue, as he does on so \nmany important issues confronting this Nation, including our security, \nand thank him for his longstanding involvement and contribution to this \nNation's well-being. His voice in this debate is an exceedingly \nimportant one. I hope all Members have had a chance to listen to his \nremarks today.\n  Mr. President, I wonder if I could ask what the time situation is. \nHow many minutes do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has until 2:10.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have gone back and forth on this \nquestion. Let me start by making a couple of quick points.\n  First of all, I would be more than pleased to test this question \nabout whether or not we should have a peacekeeping force in Kosovo. I \nwould be more than pleased to have an up-or-down vote on the Kosovo \npeacekeeping operation today or this week. Frankly, I think that is the \nway we should do it. That would be a true test of accountability.\n  I have a high doctrine of War Powers and have always insisted on \nappropriate congressional authorization of the use of troops in \nsituations where they might face hostilities or imminent hostilities. I \nthink that is required by our Constitution and by our system of checks \nand balances.\n  But I think there is a subtle difference here between that kind of \nsituation and this peacekeeping operation\n\n[[Page S4154]]\n\nin Kosovo. Kosovo is a peacekeeping and peace enforcement effort. Our \ntroops are playing a security role there, but they are not now, nor do \nI expect them to be, involved in combat with organized hostile Serb or \nother forces in Kosovo. If that changes, of course, we in Congress \nwould likely reconsider the role of these peacekeepers in light of the \nrisks, what is at stake, and make a judgment then.\n  But in the current situation, these peacekeepers deserve a chance to \nstay and to do their jobs as they have been asked to do, without the \nprospect of their funding from the United States getting cut off if our \nEuropean allies do not meet the somewhat arbitrary standards set out in \nthis bill, some of which many in the administration say may not be able \nto be met in terms of the current timetable.\n  Mr. President, it is with some regret that I oppose this provision to \neffectively impose a deadline for Kosovo peacekeeping efforts, and to \nsupport efforts by Senator Levin to strike it from the bill. While I \nsupport many of the foreign policy goals which Senators Byrd and Warner \nhave identified in this debate, I believe the amendment itself would \nlikely put at serious practical risk the peacekeeping operation in \nKosovo which, while not without its flaws, is one which I support.\n  I regret that I am not able to support this effort not only because \nof the respect and admiration I have for these two men, but also \nbecause I do share some of their concerns, most especially about \nensuring our appropriate and constitutionally-mandated congressional \nrole in decisions regarding war and peace. But while it is clear that \nwe need to intensify the dialogue between the Administration and \nCongress on the larger questions about the circumstances under which we \nenter into peacekeeping commitments, and the criteria by which we \ndecide that issue, this set of complex foreign policy questions should \nnot be decided in this way, on this bill, in a way which potentially \nundercuts our peacekeeping efforts on the ground in Kosovo.\n  I support what I believe are the key underlying goals of the \namendment: prompting a comprehensive debate on the Kosovo peacekeeping \noperation, its successes and failures; ensuring fair burden-sharing by \nour European allies, including on civilian police; and intensifying \nexecutive-congressional consultation on future decisions made regarding \npeacekeeping and peace enforcement operations in the region.\n  Of course we in Congress must continue to keep a close watch on the \nsituation there, and intervene--forcefully and directly, if necessary, \nthrough the power of the purse or otherwise--if we believe the \nadministration is going in the wrong direction. And I know that both \nSenator Warner and Senator Byrd have pressed the administration on the \nburdensharing issue for many months, and have had some real success in \nhelping to ensure a fairer proportion of U.S. to European assistance.\n  The fact is that we have about 5,900 of the approximately 39,000 \ntroops in the region now; overall we are providing, according to the \nAdministration, only about 15 percent of the troops and reconstruction \naid for this effort. While it is important to continue to press to make \nsure the Europeans follow through on their commitments of resources and \npolice personnel, I do not think fifteen percent is too much for us to \nbear to help our allies keep the peace in this troubled region. \nInternational peacekeeping must be a joint effort, with shared burdens, \nshared responsibilities and shared risks.\n  That is why I think it would be in a way more honest, more \nresponsible, for those who wish to test the question, to simply prompt \na debate by calling for a vote up or down on the Kosovo peacekeeping \noperation. If there are those who want to press that question, that \nwould be a test of true accountability. We could vote on that this \nweek. But I think most of us suspect that if the question were posed \nthat starkly, many who might end up supporting this resolution, with \nits elaborate formula and framework for a potential withdrawal, would \nnot vote to pull out our troops. They would not want to so grossly and \nsuddenly undercut our troops, our allies, and those in Kosovo, Albania, \nand elsewhere in the region whom we have labored so mightily to protect \nin the past two years.\n  On the whole, our peacekeepers, and those of our allies, have done a \nremarkable job of enforcing, in a difficult and tense environment, an \nuncertain peace. Their presence has clearly helped to avoid a return to \nthe horrendous violence that we all witnessed in Kosovo, and that NATO \nfought so hard to stem. Let's not forget that the ethnic cleansing that \nprompted our presence in the first place has been stopped, and that a \nreturn to the fighting has been prevented by the peacekeeping forces on \nthe ground. Given the fragility of the current peace, it seems to me a \nlikely result of our withdrawal would be a withdrawal by our allies, \nfollowed by a return to such fighting.\n  I share some of the frustration expressed about the Kosovo operation. \nWhile it is clear that some functions of this force could have been \nhandled better, and that all parties involved could strengthen \nefforts--by the administration, by civilian police on the ground, by \nthe UN bureaucracy, by those nations who have sent sometimes inadequate \naid, or who have failed to live up completely and a timely way to their \ncommitments--the peacekeeping forces have done a good job, under \nharrowing circumstances, and we should not undercut them, directly or \nindirectly, by passing this amendment. The fact that there has been \nless long-term progress than had been hoped for toward the development \nof a multi-ethnic state in Kosovo is not the fault of these \npeacekeepers.\n\n  I have a high doctrine of War Powers, and have always insisted on \nappropriate congressional authorization of the use of troops in \nsituations where they might face hostilities or imminent hostilities. I \nthink that's required by our Constitution, by our system of checks and \nbalances.\n  But I think there is a subtle difference here between that kind of \nsituation of imminent or real hostilities and the current peacekeeping \noperation in Kosovo. Kosovo is a peacekeeping and peace enforcement \neffort; our troops are playing a security role there, but they are not \nnow, nor do I expect them to be, involved in combat with organized \nhostile Serb or other forces in Kosovo. If that changes, of course we \nin Congress would likely reconsider the role of these peacekeepers in \nlight of the risks, what's at stake, and make a judgment then.\n  But in the current situation, these peacekeepers deserve a chance to \nstay, and to do their jobs as they've been asked to do, without the \nprospect of their funding from the U.S. getting cut if our European \nallies don't meet the somewhat arbitrary standards set out in this \nbill, some of which the Administration says aren't likely to be met \nunder this particular timetable.\n  Some oppose the Kosovo peacekeeping operation outright, and would \nsimply turn it over completely to the Europeans. That's a legitimate \nview, but not one I share. We cannot send a signal to our allies that \nwe will help out in difficult and complex situations like this, but \nonly if they bear all the risks of peacekeeping.\n  Others have raised the issue of the U.S. looking irresolute to our \nallies within NATO, and to Milosevic. Or the concern that Milosevic \nmight, if he knows there's an almost certain date set for our \nwithdrawal, he'll likely instruct his troops to simply wait us out--or \nworse, instruct his radical Serb allies to foment violence to influence \nWestern opinion, and even future votes in Congress, on whether to keep \nthe peacekeepers there. These are legitimate concerns, but I think a \nmore fundamental question is posed.\n  Will we shoulder our responsibilities, along with our NATO allies, to \ncontinue to help bolster and build a stable peace in Kosovo, to give \nthem a chance at reconstruction, or will we start to scale back our \neffort now, and then pull out down the road, even after all the blood \nand treasure that's been spent to secure that peace, signaling to our \nallies and adversaries in the region alike that we're not firmly \ncommitted to seeing through the job that we started? I hope not. And I \nhope that we'll not start down that road by voting for a year of \nquestions and uncertainty about our commitment in Kosovo.\n  That is not to say the administration must not push harder our \nEuropean allies to accelerate their assistance to the reconstruction \neffort. It is not to say the President should not intensify his \nconsultations with Congress on his plans and intentions regarding the \npeacekeeping force. He absolutely must\n\n[[Page S4155]]\n\ndo those things. But I do not think that this amendment is the way to \nensure those results. And so I will vote for Senator Levin's amendment \nto strike this language from the bill, and I hope my colleagues will \njoin me in voting to support our peacekeeping efforts in Kosovo, and \nagainst this provision which, in its current form, could do that effort \nreal harm.\n  Mr. President, again, I have great respect for my colleagues on the \nother side of this question. I would be pleased to have an up-or-down \nvote on the peacekeeping operation. I would be pleased to be held \naccountable. I would love for the Senate to deal with this question \nright now and vote up or down on the peacekeeping operation. To me, \nthat is checks and balances. I would vote for the peacekeeping \noperation, and that is why I will support Senator Levin's initiative.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, a little over a year ago, I rose in this \nChamber to address the crisis in Kosovo. At that time, I had just \nrecently returned from a trip to the refugee camps of Macedonia, where \nI witnessed firsthand the pain and suffering of displaced people in the \ntroubled Balkan peninsula. During that visit, I was struck by the sight \nof 45,000 people living in tents in an area half the size of The Mall. \nFamilies were lined up for food and medicine and used ditches as \nlatrines. Some individuals told me stories of being brutalized by the \nSerbian military and police in Kosovo and others of being evicted from \ntheir homes and separated from their families. Mr. President, I have \nseen a lot of hardship in my time, but nothing I have ever seen comes \nclose to what I saw in the Balkans.\n  I returned from that trip determined to convince my colleagues that \nthe United States had an integral role to play in the alleviation of \nsuffering that the people of Kosovo had been subjected to by Serbian \nPresident Milosevic. At that time many in this body agreed that the \nUnited States had a moral obligation to join with our European allies \nin stopping Serbian aggression and creating the conditions to allow \nKosovars to return to their homes.\n  Now it is a year later. Some things have changed. The international \ncommunity stood up to the bully--Milosevic, and like most bullies he \nbacked down and withdrew his forces from Kosovo. However, he left the \nprovince in total devastation--both physically and psychologically. \nMany of those displaced by the conflict returned to find their homes \nand livelihoods in ashes. Rebuilding from the rubble has been \ndifficult. Particularly as just across the provincial border, President \nMilosevic still rules, a million people are still displaced from their \nhomes and families, and lasting peace has not been achieved.\n  The United States, in partnership with our friends and allies, has \nattempted to assist Kosovars in picking up the pieces and restoring \nsome semblance of law and order to the province. There has been some \nprogress in that direction, but much remains to be done. Yet, despite \nthe unfinished business that remains the legislation before us today, \nif it becomes law, would establish a date certain--next July--for \nending United States participation in restoring democracy in Kosovo.\n  I remember well, that prior to the commencement of NATO bombing in \nMarch of last year many in this body criticized the President for \nsitting on his hands while ethnic Albanian Kosovars were being \nsubjected to gross human rights violations under the direction of \nPresident Milosevic and Serbian security forces. I hope that those \nindividuals are not now going to turn around and support an effort to \nmandate the full and complete withdrawal of U.S. ground troops from \nKosovo.\n  Even if the United States were to decide to withdraw from the region, \nwhich, let me state, is not what I believe we should do, it is \nincredibly foolhardy to announce the exact date to the enemy. Knowing \nof imminent United States withdrawal from the Balkans, President \nMilosevic will have no incentive to step down or improve his human \nrights record at all, and the timing of the withdrawal, July 2001, \nfollows far too quickly the inauguration of a new President here in the \nUnited States.\n  If there is any doubt in anyone's mind about whether U.S. presence is \nwarranted in Kosovo, I promise my colleagues that had they been with me \nin Kosovo last year and seen what I saw, there would be absolutely no \ndebate in this Chamber about whether or not we are taking the right \ncourse of action. Our efforts to restore people to their homes, bring \nan end to conflict, and save the lives of thousands are assuredly the \nright things to do.\n  Rather than send out more mixed signals, I hope that Slobodan \nMilosevic will hear from this Chamber--That we are not going to second \nguess the President or Secretary of Defense in deciding when the \nappropriate time has come for the United States to withdraw its forces \nfrom the Balkans--That the United States is determined to remain in \nKosovo until the wounds have healed and civil society is strong enough \nto support democratic governance of all the people of Kosovo, including \nits Serbian minority--And that we are proud of the American service men \nand women who are deployed in Kosovo and who are committed to getting \nthe job done. They know why they are there and understand the \nseriousness and importance of their mission. We do them a disservice by \nsuggesting otherwise.\n  Mr. President, the Senate will be acting irresponsibly if it approves \nlegislation mandating an end to our participation in Kosovo. I would \nurge my colleagues to support an amendment to strike this provision \nfrom the bill and renew our commitment to assist the people of Kosovo \nin the months ahead as they try to rebuild their lives and those of \ntheir loved ones.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am going to vote for the Levin amendment \nto the military construction appropriations bill, which would strike \nthe Byrd-Warner amendment concerning Kosovo.\n  As a strong supporter of NATO, I have long advocated efforts to \nstrengthen the European pillar of the alliance. The air war in Kosovo \nhighlighted a great technical disparity in U.S. and European \ncapabilities, and reopened long-standing debates of burden sharing \nwithin the Alliance.\n  I fully understand and support the motivation behind the authors and \nsupporters of this provision. While it is true the Europeans are \ncontributing over 80 percent of the peacekeeping forces that make up K-\nFor, they have yet to fully live up to their commitments to NATO \nPeacekeeping, UNMIK, and the funds that make up the civilian and \nmilitary dimensions of the peace effort.\n  However, this provision undercuts our incentives to the Europeans to \nmeet those goals because it contains a ``de facto'' withdrawal date of \nJuly 1, 2001. It signals to our allies that the United States will \nwithdraw regardless of any improved European efforts to meet their \ncommitments.\n  This bill will effectively constitute a decision to withdraw forces \nat a given date. That is not the authors' stated intent, but that is \nhow this amendment will be viewed. That is a message that will embolden \nMilosevic. That is a message that we will communicate an absence of \ncommitment to our NATO allies.\n  American General Wes Clark, the former Supreme Allied Commander \nEurope and the former highest ranking military officer in NATO, has \nwarned,\n\n       These measures, if adopted, would be seen as a de facto \n     pull-out decision by the United States. They are unlikely to \n     encourage European allies to do more. In fact, these measures \n     would invalidate the policies, commitments and trust of our \n     Allies in NATO, undercut US leadership worldwide, and \n     encourage renewed ethnic tension, fighting and instability in \n     the Balkans. Furthermore, they would, if enacted, invalidate \n     the dedication and commitment of our Soldiers, Sailors, \n     Airmen, and Marines, disregarding the sacrifices they and \n     their families have made to help bring peace to the Balkans. \n     In fact, these measures would invalidate the policies, \n     commitments and trust of our allies in NATO, undercut US \n     leadership worldwide, and encourage renewed ethnic tension, \n     fighting and instability in the Balkans.\n\n  While I, and many others, have had concerns about how the Kosovo \noperation has been conducted by the current administration, the \nsolution to these concerns are not a withdrawal, or another debate on \nwhether or not to withdraw. The solution is to establish a definition \nof goals we hoe to achieve with regard to Kosovo, how we intend to \naccomplish our goals, and work more effectively with our European \nallies in achieving those goals. When our next President takes office \nin January,\n\n[[Page S4156]]\n\nunder the Byrd-Warner provision he would be burdened not only with \naddressing the current administration's shortcomings in establishing a \nKosovo policy, but also with a congressionally-imposed fixed date for \nUnited States withdrawal from Kosovo.\n  So for these reasons, while I support the goals of this provision, I \ncannot support the means used to achieve that goal and I will vote for \nthe Levin amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to address the Levin \namendment to the military construction appropriations bill, which \nstrikes the provisions of the Byrd-Warner amendment on Kosovo which was \nattached to the bill in committee.\n  Unfortunately, for an issue of such importance, this amendment came \nup very quickly in committee without, I think, due consideration and \nstudy.\n  Since the committee markup last week I have had a chance to further \nconsider and study this issue and I have had the opportunity to discuss \nthis issue, at length, with senior members of the Administration, with \nSecretary Cohen, with Jack Lew, Director of the OMB, and with General \nWesley Clark, the former supreme NATO commander. As a result of these \ndiscussions, I have some serious concerns about the potential impact of \nthe Byrd-Warner amendment\n  During the committee markup, proponents of this amendment asserted \nthat the certifications called for by the amendment could be made \n``tomorrow'' without delay. According to Mr. Lew, however, the \ncertifications can not be met by July 15 of this year. The reason why \nthese certifications can not be made, he has stated, is not because our \nEuropean allies are not making efforts to meet their commitments--they \nare and in many cases they have--but for technical reasons.\n  So we could very well find ourselves in a position whereby we have \naccomplished the policy goals of the Byrd-Warner amendment but, because \ntechnical reasons prevent Presidential certifications, we are forced to \nwithdraw U.S. forces from Kosovo.\n  Both Senator Byrd and Senator Warner have given assurances that these \nshortcomings will be fixed in conference. I very much appreciate these \nassurances. But I have reason to believe that it is not a simple fix, \nbut that a number of issues needs to be addressed, and this may well \nprove difficult to accomplish.\n  In addition, as General Clark has made clear, by setting in motion an \nautomatic mechanism for complete withdrawal by 2001 that will telegraph \nour troop deployments and our policy, and which ties the hand of the \nnext President, the Byrd-Warner amendment has an impact far beyond that \noriginally anticipated in that it complicates and makes more difficult \nthe U.S. role in Kosovo. I cannot ignore the conviction of General \nClark that passage of this amendment would run the risk of destroying \nthe NATO mission in Kosovo.\n  As General Clark stated in his May 11 letter to Senator Levin, ``This \naction will also undermine specific plans and commitments made within \nthe Alliance. At the time that U.S. military and diplomatic personnel \nare pressing other nations to fulfill and expand their commitment of \nforces, capabilities and resources, an apparent congressionally \nmandated pullout would undercut their leadership and parallel \ndiplomatic efforts.''\n  Or, as Secretary Cohen said in a discussion I had with him just a \nshort time ago, ``if the Senate passes this, it will weaken the allies' \nresolve rather than strengthen it.''\n  As General Clark concludes in his May 11 letter, ``A U.S. withdrawal \ncould give Mr. Milosevic the victory he could not achieve on the \nbattlefield.''\n  Because of these concerns, I find that I must vote in favor of the \nLevin motion to strike the Byrd amendment, and urge my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Byrd-Warner provision would make the \ndecision that U.S. ground troops must pull out of Kosovo starting in \nAugust of this year if the Europeans don't meet certain specified \npercentages of their financial and civilian police commitment, unless \nthe Congress changes its mind and decides otherwise.\n  It did decide, in any event, that even if the Europeans do meet their \ncommitments, even if they do meet the commitments we have been urging \nthem to meet--and they have been making progress--even if they meet \nthose commitments, next year, in any event, our troops are coming out \nof Kosovo, unless Congress changes its mind. It is all self-executing. \nIf Congress does nothing from this point on, if we adopt the Byrd-\nWarner language, next year, in the middle of the year, our troops must \ncome out of Kosovo.\n  Now, the issue here isn't whether we have the power to set a \nwithdrawal date and to enforce it with the power of the purse. That is \nnot the issue. I think all of us would support the right of this Senate \nand this Congress to set a withdrawal date for our forces from \nanywhere. We have exercised that power. We exercised it in Somalia and \nin Haiti. The issue before us is the wisdom of setting a withdrawal \ndate today, putting it on automatic pilot, and saying that a year from \nnow, unless Congress reverses its position, those troops must come out. \nThat creates a dangerous period of uncertainty, a destabilizing period \nof uncertainty, which we have been urged not to set in motion by our \nSecretary of Defense, by the Secretary General of NATO, and by the \nrecent commander of our forces in Kosovo.\n  First, Secretary Cohen, on May 11, said:\n\n       I strongly believe the Kosovo language in the supplemental \n     is counterproductive to peace in Kosovo and will seriously \n     jeopardize the relationship between the U.S. and our NATO \n     allies.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that Secretary Cohen's letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 11, 2000.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, United States Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ted: I appreciate your efforts to secure as quickly as \n     possible the Supplemental appropriations for our peace-\n     keeping operations in Kosovo. As you know, however, I am \n     deeply troubled by the Kosovo provision in the bill. While I \n     appreciated the opportunity to discuss this provision with \n     Senator Byrd and Senator Warner prior to the mark up, I feel \n     compelled to express in writing my concerns with this \n     amendment.\n       I have worked hard to reinforce the message to our European \n     allies that they must carry the lion's share in winning the \n     peace in Kosovo. While certainly more could be done, we \n     should not lose sight of the fact that the Europeans are in \n     fact carrying this burden. The U.S. accounts for only about \n     15 percent of peacekeeping forces in Kosovo. The Europeans \n     are also carrying the bulk of the effort on the civilian \n     side, as appropriate.\n       While strong messages from Congress on the importance of \n     burden-sharing can be helpful, I strongly believe the Kosovo \n     language in the Supplemental is counterproductive to peace in \n     Kosovo and will seriously jeopardize the relationship between \n     the U.S. and our NATO allies. For instance, unilateral \n     actions by the U.S. regarding Kosovo will seriously undermine \n     our efforts to discourage unilateral action by our NATO \n     allies with regard to the European Strategic Defense \n     Initiative (ESDI).\n       I believe that the Kosovo provision, as presently written, \n     will force me to recommend that the President veto this \n     legislation. Such an outcome will only further delay a badly \n     needed infusion of funds for the DoD budget and most \n     particularly the Army.\n       Finally, I once again urge you to fully fund the \n     supplemental appropriations request for International Affairs \n     (Function 150) Kosovo. The requested funds support essential \n     civilian infrastructure that would facilitate a prudent exit \n     strategy for Kosovo and achievement of long-term stability in \n     the Balkans.\n       I look forward to discussing this critical matter with you \n     further.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Bill Cohen.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Secretary General of NATO, on May 16, in a letter that \nhas been referred to by Senator McCain, said the following in a \ndifferent paragraph--one that he didn't read, but which I think is also \nsignificant:\n\n       If this language is adopted, it would point toward a single \n     policy outcome to the withdrawal of U.S. forces.\n\n  Then he went on to say:\n\n       As Secretary General, the prospect of any NATO ally \n     deciding unilaterally not to take part in a NATO operation \n     causes me deep concern. It risks sending a dangerous signal \n     to the Yugoslav dictator Milosevic that NATO is divided and \n     that its biggest and most important ally is pulling up \n     stakes.\n\n  This is the Secretary General of the greatest alliance in world \nhistory--one that we have been a leader of--who is\n\n[[Page S4157]]\n\nsaying the adoption of this language risks sending a dangerous signal \nto Milosevic that NATO is divided and that its biggest and most \nimportant ally is pulling up stakes.\n  General Clark, recently the commander of our forces in Kosovo, wrote \nthe following:\n\n       These measures, if adopted, would be seen as a de facto \n     pullout decision by the United States. They are unlikely to \n     encourage European allies to do more. In fact, these measures \n     would invalidate the policies, commitments, and trust of our \n     allies in NATO, undercut U.S. leadership worldwide, and \n     encourage renewed ethnic tension, fighting, and instability \n     in the Balkans.\n\n  So the issue here isn't our power. We have it. Everyone in this body \nwill protect it--I hope. As long as I am here, I will be fighting for \nthe same power Senator Byrd so eloquently talks about that the Congress \nmust have--the power of the purse, the power to set a deadline, should \nwe choose, such as the power we exercised in Somalia to set a deadline \nand to force our troops out.\n  We have, at times, exercised that power. At times, we have shown, in \nmy judgment, the wisdom not to exercise that power. We have not \nexercised it in Iraq. We are not exercising it in Korea. We are not \nexercising it in Bosnia at this point. We have not authorized those \nengagements to continue. We have not determined that we are going to \nput an end to them. So we have exercised judgment both ways, in our \nwisdom. We have the power to put an end to our presence in Iraq, or in \nBosnia, or in South Korea. We have the power, but we have decided, in \nour wisdom, not to exercise that power.\n  I hope that today, in our wisdom, for the reasons set forth by Mr. \nCohen, General Clark, and the Secretary General of NATO, we will not \ncreate this period of dangerous uncertainty if we today decide that a \nyear from now we are going to withdraw troops unless Congress changes \nits mind. It is the wrong message for our troops, for the reasons \nGeneral Clark gives. It is a terrible message to our European allies \nbecause in one part of this amendment it says we want you to meet \ncertain standards, but in the other part of the Byrd-Warner language it \nsays even if the Europeans meet their standards and their commitments, \nnonetheless, unless Congress changes its mind in the next year, our \ntroops are going to be withdrawn. It is on automatic pilot. It is self-\neffectuating. If no action is taken further by the Congress, our troops \nmust be withdrawn.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on March 23, 1999, I voted against the \ninitial Senate resolution to authorize air attacks in Yugoslavia. More \nthan 420 days have passed since I cast that vote, and I could not be \nmore confident in my initial decision.\n  I argued in 1999 that the United States was foolishly injecting and \nengaging the brave men and women of our Armed Forces into a civil war \nthat I dare say may never be resolved. Furthermore, the Administration \nhad then not proposed, and to date has not yet recommended an exit \nstrategy for the occupation of Kosovo. In reaching my decision, I \nquestioned the mission's objectives, the implication of a long-term \nU.S. commitment in Yugoslavia, and most importantly I argued that our \nvital national interests did not warrant a full scale war in the \nBalkans.\n  In less than two months after the Administration was authorized to \nenter the war in the Balkans, Congress faced an $11 billion taxpayer \ncommitment to the endeavor. Once again I voted against the U.S. \ncommitment to the civil war in Kosovo, citing the same concerns.\n  And what has resulted from the U.S. and NATO engagement in Kosovo? \nNATO's thrust into the Balkans has fostered the creation of an entirely \nnew class of refugees; the U.S. military has been required to police \nthe region for an undetermined and unspecified amount of time; our own \nNATO allies' financial and military obligation to the endeavor remains \nquestionable; ethnic related violent incidents in the region have \nincreased; commitment by the region's leaders to embrace reconciliation \nefforts are conspicuous by their absence; and now Americans and \nCongress are being asked to provide nearly $2 billion in additional \nfunding for contingency operations in Kosovo.\n  Just this week, the Government Accounting Office (GAO) released its \nreport on the U.S. involvement in the Balkans. The report is critical \nof not only the U.S. and NATO participation in the region, but provides \nfurther doubt about the long-term prospect for peace in Kosovo. The \nreport points out that the security situation remains highly volatile, \nthat political and social reconciliation efforts are unsuccessful, that \nthe wartime goals of the factions remain intact, and that NATO has \nfailed to prepare for the transition of security responsibilities to \nthe United Nations.\n  In addition, the GAO reports that between 1992 and 2000, U.S. \nmilitary and civilian costs for operations in Bosnia and Kosovo have \ncost the American taxpayer more than $18 billion. This figure includes \ncommitments by the State Department, DoD, the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development, U.S. participation in UN peacekeeping \nmissions, the Department of Transportation, and the U.S. Treasury.\n  GAO also concluded that between 1991 and 1999, more than 4.4 million \npeople have been displaced as a result of the wars in Kosovo, Bosnia, \nand Croatia. A large share of these people remain in refugee camps. \nThese displaced, war torn individuals have lost their homes, and have \nfew prospects to regain them.\n  In spite of such a massive financial and political commitment, the \nreport also concludes that should NATO withdraw, unrest is inevitable. \nPolitical leaders have not embraced change, people who have tried to \nreturn to their homes have been attacked, the peace process has been \ncontinuously obstructed by ethnic groups, the economy remains flat, and \nefforts to advance the formulation of a multiethnic society have \nfailed.\n  Our asserted goals are a multiethnic Kosovo as a part of Yugoslavia; \nthe Kosovars want independence and the expulsion of all Serbs.\n  With all of these negative forces at play against the peace process, \nhow long does the United States intend to police the region? How many \nmore taxpayer dollars will be spent on security issues in Kosovo that \nappear to have little or no possibility of reformation? What is the \nprice for peace, if peace is even attainable?\n  One of the reasons that I opposed the war in Kosovo from the \nbeginning was not the risk that we were going to lose the war but the \nconsequences of winning. We now have ``won'', we have won most of what \nwe asked for in the beginning, but the consequences of winning is that \nwe are putting thousands of our troops into Kosovo without any thought \nof when they will return.\n  I am convinced that a U.S. presence may continue in Kosovo for a \ngeneration or so. We have, and most likely will expend billions of \ndollars in an out of the way place that has never been important to our \nnational security, and we are doing it in a way in which most of the \ndestruction that we are going to pay for in the future was caused by \nus. Most Americans are going to find that Kosovo was much easier to get \ninto than it was to get out of.\n  I intend to vote against the Fiscal Year 2001 Military Construction \nAppropriations bill because of my deep concern over the U.S. commitment \nand participation in the Balkan conflict. It is time to leave it to the \nEuropeans. Even though the State of Washington, home to the most \nefficient, strategically positioned, and significant Army, Navy and Air \nForce bases stand to inherit valuable military construction funds by \nthe passage of this legislation, I cannot in good conscience support \nanother financial commitment to an unresolvable conflict in the \nBalkans.\n  Those brave and courageous men and women of the U.S. military who \nhave been tasked with implementing this Kosovo intervention, and those \nserving in the Armed Forces in the State of Washington, have my \nadmiration and support. But in the goal of attaining peace in the \nBalkans, of the Administration's questionable leadership in this \nendeavor, and the long-term commitment that is expected of the American \ntaxpayer, I have no confidence at all.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nFiscal Year 2001 military construction appropriations bill and to \ncommend my colleagues Senator Stevens, Senator Byrd, Senator Burns, and \nSenator Murray for their leadership in bringing this most important \nspending bill\n\n[[Page S4158]]\n\nbefore the Senate. This bill provides critical funding for military \nconstruction projects as well as Department of Defense related \nemergency supplemental funding for fiscal year 2000.\n  Other colleagues have already spoken on the merits of the military \nconstruction aspect of this bill and the importance of those projects \nto the men and women of our armed forces and their families. So today, \nI am going to focus my remarks on the critical provisions contained in \nthe Byrd-Warner amendment and why I believe those provisions are as \nimportant to these same men and women and their families.\n  By including emergency supplemental funding in this bill, and fast \ntracking its passage, the Congress will be supporting the loyal men and \nwomen of our armed forces who are participating in contingency \noperations overseas. But, Mr. President, support of our troops is not \nalways ``sending money,'' sometimes we support them best by ensuring \nthat they are not overextended in missions that appear to have no end. \nAnd that is why I commend Senator Byrd and Senator Warner for their \nleadership by including these provisions that will force the debate \nabout open-ended obligations.\n  For example, on May 1, 2000, the top U.S. commander in Kosovo, \nBrigadier General Ricardo Sanchez told reporters that he predicts that \nNATO peacekeepers will have to remain in the Balkans for ``at least a \ngeneration.''\n  In testimony before the Senate just this last April, Secretary of \nDefense Bill Cohen acknowledged that U.S. troops may not be pulled out \nduring his final months in his cabinet position, and possibly not \nduring the time of his predecessor. Our airmen performed superbly \nduring the 78-day air war. Now, a year has passed and we have more than \n5,500 troops on the ground in Kosovo, having spent more than $2 billion \non the air campaign, and by September of this year estimates are that \nthe U.S. will spend upwards of $5.9 billion in support of stabilizing \nthe peace in Kosovo. And, as the policy currently stands, there is no \nend in sight.\n  We have learned through our experience in Bosnia that rhetoric alone \nwill not expedite mission accomplishment and bring our troops home. In \n1996, the U.S. sent 22,500 soldiers to the Balkans, in support of the \nDayton Accords for an operation that was to last until December 16th of \nthat year. We have made great progress there, but, four years later, \nthe U.S. still has a significant force there and no deadline for \nwithdrawal. So here we are Mr. President, four and one half years since \nthe signing of the Dayton Accords in Bosnia, we have more than 4,300 \ntroops in Bosnia and another 3,000 support personnel committed in the \nregion and no deadline for withdrawal, no end in sight.\n  In Kosovo we won the peace in June 1999 with our air campaign and a \nyear later we are providing more then 5,500 troops to support an \noperation that is becoming increasingly more threatening.\n\n  In this bill, Mr. President, with the leadership of Senator Byrd and \nSenator Warner, the Senate is taking action to establish some way of \ngetting to an end in Kosovo. Provisions in this bill provide a \nlimitation of funds for U.S. ground combat troops in Kosovo. Section \n2410 of this bill terminates funding for the U.S. presence in Kosovo \nafter July 1, 2001, unless and until the President submits a report to \nCongress containing a request to specifically authorize continued U.S. \nground troop deployment and Congress enacts a joint resolution \nspecifically authorizing such continued deployment. I must note, that \nthis provision does continue the support of non-combat troops in Kosovo \nwho can provide limited support to the continued NATO peacekeeping \noperation.\n  The provision further requires the President to develop a plan, in \nconsultation with appropriate foreign governments, by which NATO member \ncountries, with the exception of the U.S., and other non-NATO countries \nwill provide all ground combat troops necessary to execute peacekeeping \noperations in Kosovo. Again, we are looking for a plan--something that \nthis Administration has not been able to do. The plan is to establish a \nschedule or target dates, at three month intervals, for achieving an \norderly transition to a non-U.S. force in Kosovo.\n  Mr. President, it is also in this spirit that I must express my \ndisappointment in the lack of support for operations in Kosovo by the \nEuropean Commission, the European Union, and the European member \nnations of NATO and why I strongly support the provisions of the Byrd-\nWarner amendment.\n  In Kosovo, the U.S. has taken the lead toward ending the ethnic \nviolence and establishing civil law with the intention of turning the \nresponsibility for long term development and revitalization over to the \nEuropean community. However, the European community has not stepped \nforward as a unified body to assume this responsibility, and appears \nunwilling to take a leadership role.\n  In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on February \n29th, General Clark, then Commander-In-Chief of the U.S. European \nCommand stated that ``despite our progress in missions assigned to the \nmilitary, civil implementation has been slow and in Kosovo today, civil \ngovernment structures are lacking.'' He further stated that ``the pace \nof contributions to the manning and resources of UNMIK [United Nations \nMission in Kosovo] have resulted in sporadic and uneven progress toward \ncivil implementation goals'' and concluded his testimony by saying \n``the hardest part of securing peace in Kosovo lies ahead.''\n  A well-publicized area where the lack of European support for civil \nimplementation is readily apparent is the European's lack of support \nfor the Kosovo Police Force. The United Nations has stated the \nrequirement for 4,718 police and at this point the United States has \nprovided 97% of the 550 police we have pledged, yet our European \npartners have only mustered 63% of the 1288 police they had pledged. \nMr. President, I call on the leadership of our allies to meet their \ncommitments!\n  Let me remind my colleagues that in the last decade we anticipated \nreaping the benefits of the peace dividend. Many touted that the end of \nthe Cold War would allow us to draw down our military forces and spend \nless money on defense. Well we have drawn our forces down, and they are \ndeployed more now than ever anticipated in the post-cold-war era, and \nwe are paying for it. In the period 1999 through 1999, U.S. taxpayers \nwill have spent more than $23.6 billion for contingency operations. Mr. \nPresident, we just cannot afford to unilaterally deploy troops and \nprovide monetary support to each global hot spot for an indefinite \nperiod of time, with tepid and inconsistent support from the UN, NATO, \nand our other allies.\n\n  In the four years of the Bosnia Operation, more Army reservists have \nbeen activated than in the entire Vietnam War, and I am concerned that \nour involvement in Kosovo will mirror our involvement in Bosnia. I tell \nyou this first hand, because these reservists include men and women of \nthe 112th Medical Company from the Army National Guard and members of \nthe 101st Air Refueling Wing from my home state of Maine who were \ncalled up or volunteered to serve in Bosnia.\n  And we are paying for these extended deployments in more than just \ndollars. At a time when the Department of Defense is meeting only 92 \npercent of its active duty recruiting goal, 88 percent of its Reserve \nrecruiting goal and is struggling to retain the highly trained people \nthat are currently serving, we in Congress and in the Administration \nneed to be mindful of the message that we are sending to the American \npeople. They need to know that we are aware that we are closely \nwatching, and that we are ready to step in to protect the best \ninterests of the U.S. and our men and women in uniform.\n  Although military members reference the high operational tempo as a \nconsideration for leaving the military, it is difficult to quantify the \nexact effect those contingency operations have had on the recruiting \nand retention of personnel. It is, however, easy to determine the \nmonetary effect. As we marked-up the Fiscal Year 2001 Defense \nAuthorization Act, we were forced to look for ways to find money to \nfund new equipment to modernize our forces, money to improve housing \nand the quality of life, and money to improve healthcare for our men \nand women in uniform, as well as their families and our often forgotten \nretirees. We continue to uphold our commitments, just as we are \nupholding our commitment to this operation in Kosovo--to the detriment \nof our readiness to fight and win if there was a\n\n[[Page S4159]]\n\nmajor theater war--while our European allies remain in the shadows.\n  Now this Senate is considering the addition of $1.85 billion in \nsupplemental appropriations to support overseas contingency operations. \nBut this bill is different in that the Byrd-Warner amendment limits the \namount that can be obligated to 75 percent of the total Kosovo \nappropriation until the President certifies that four specific \nconditions have been met; at which time the remaining 25 percent would \nbe released. These conditions stipulate that the European Commission, \nthe European Union and the European member nations of NATO must provide \na third of the assistance for reconstruction that they pledged, 75 \npercent of the funds promised for humanitarian assistance, 75 percent \nof the amount pledged for the Kosovo consolidated budget, and 75 \npercent of the personnel pledged for the Kosovo Police Force.\n  These provisions provide specific, tangible steps toward the \nfulfillment of the commitment promised by these countries. This does \nnot require these countries to provide something that they do not have \nor something that they are not capable of supporting. It is merely a \nmeans of holding them accountable for that to which they have already \ncommitted.\n  If, however, our allies continue to go back on their pledged \ncommitment, and the President cannot certify that those four conditions \nhave been met by July 15th of this year, then the remaining funds must \nbe used for the planned, phased, and safe withdrawal of U.S. troops \nfrom Kosovo. The details and time line for this withdrawal will be left \nto the President and his advisers, with these plans to be fully \ndeveloped by the 30th of September.\n  So, as our troops in Kosovo valiantly conduct 1,321 security patrols \neach week and provide around the clock security at 48 checkpoints and \n62 key facilities, we must support them in every way, beginning with \nholding our allies in Europe to the fiscal and personnel support they \npledged to provide when the U.S. decided to support the air offensive \nin Kosovo.\n  I know, that as a result of the leadership of Senators Stevens, Byrd, \nBurns, and Murray, the FY2001 military construction appropriations bill \nis good legislation that provides our men and women in the armed forces \nthe support they need as they go about their business of protecting our \nlong-term national interests.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, new revelations from \n``Newsweek'' and ``Inside the Pentagon'' show that the air war against \nSerbia was inaccurately portrayed. These reports allege hyper-inflating \nof reports of damage done by allied bombing.\n  Now we are awakening to the realization that we expended a small \nfortune in precision munitions with very little effect--but the \nadministration felt it necessary to exaggerate grossly the results of \nthe air campaign in an attempt to buy public support for the war.\n  This is shameful--and the individuals involved in this deceit ought \nto be reprimanded.\n  The bombing triggered a refugee crisis--that was its main result. \nThere was never any threat to NATO from the conflict in the Balkans.\n  In fact, the real threat to NATO is that it has abandoned its \ntraditional role of being a defensive alliance, and under this \nadministration has blundered and contorted into a post-cold war crisis \nmanagement agency with a lost sense of mission.\n  NATO's bombing killed innocent civilians and raised regional \ntensions.\n  Like Haiti and Somalia before, the war in Kosovo has cost the \ntaxpayers billions, exhausted and demoralized our men and women in the \narmed forces, and accomplished nothing, yet damaged our image in the \nregion as a nation that believes in democracy and justice.\n  As a result of demonizing Milosevic in Serbia, we have become tacit \nallies with the Kosovo Liberation Army, a group in the recent past \nacknowledged to be an organization which commits terrorist acts and \nwhich appears to be supported by the Albanian mafia, which is said to \nbe a major supplier of heroin in the European market.\n  In our zeal to ``stop the killing'' in the Balkans, we, as a result, \naligned ourselves with a terrorist mob with links to drug traffickers \nand killed a lot of innocent people. This is peacekeeping run amok, and \nit has to be brought to an end as quickly as possible.\n  I support the Byrd-Warner amendment, not that it goes far enough. It \ndoes not. We should have never gotten involved in the Balkans, and we \nshould have gotten out long ago recognizing that our intervention was \ndamaging, and like too many other missions from which we have failed to \nlearn any lessons, open-ended, and lacking any clear objectives.\n  We are using our young men and women in uniform as police officers, \nsomething which they are not trained to be and which they \nunderstandably resent.\n  They are not policemen, they are soldiers. If they had wanted to be \npolice, they could have signed up in their local towns and at least \nhave been home with their families at night.\n  I want to make one thing perfectly clear. I am tired of hearing those \nwho support the Balkan blunder say that we are ``undercutting'' our \ntroops by seeking authorization for the mission's continuation.\n  I believe that sending our armed forces into harm's way into a \nconflict in which we have no identifiable national security objectives \nundercuts our troops.\n  I believe that wasting our precious military resources in a futile \npeacekeeping mission undercuts the troops.\n  I believe that we undercut the troops when we plunge into a conflict \nwithout Congress making a declaration of war. Did we learn anything \nfrom Vietnam?\n  Finally, I warn my colleagues that rather than admitting to a \ncolossal mistake in Kosovo, which this administration would never be \nwilling to do, it is likely that it will blunder more deeply, possibly \ninto Montenegro, even if the Byrd-Warner amendment were to pass the \nCongress.\n  General Wesley Clark's latest comments, as well as a reading of \nAgence France Press and some of the other foreign news sources, \nincluding comments by some of Europe's war hawks, reveal that \nMontenegro and the Presovo Valley might be the next jumping off point.\n  In fact, the KLA can read between the lines. If they create yet \nanother provocation, and force the Serbs to respond, creating an \natmosphere charged with allegations of atrocities or another \nhumanitarian crisis, it will give NATO the excuse it needs to blunder \nmore deeply into the Balkan quagmire.\n  We need to start pulling down our forces in Kosovo and winding down \nthis operation. We need to be able to admit to a mistake when we make \nit.\n  Our military forces are stretched as thin as they have ever been. \nThis year, the services' unfunded requirements list was in the realm of \n$15 billion.\n  We cannot afford to squander our limited military dollars in Kosovo.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 2:10 has arrived, and Senator Byrd \nis to be recognized. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Michigan says this vote is not about \npower.\n  I say to the distinguished Senator that this matter is about power. \nIt is about the arrogance of power in a White House that insists on \nputting our men and our women in harm's way, and spending their tax \ndollars without the consent of their elected representatives.\n  Where is the wisdom in that course? Where is the wisdom in allowing a \npolicy of indefinite drift in the Balkans with no end strategy, no exit \nstrategy, and no clearly defined goals?\n  We keep hearing it said that we are endangering our men and women. I \nsay we are endangering the lives of our men and women in the military \nby failing to make the case up front for putting them in harm's way. We \nare endangering the lives of our men and women in the military when we \nneglect to be sure that the American people support taking those risks \nbefore we put those men and women in harm's way. We are endangering the \nlives of our men and women in the military when we budget for dangerous \nmissions in emergency bills after the fact that cannot provide for a \nlong-term investment in those missions. We are endangering the lives of \nour men and women in the military when we have no clear-cut achievable \ngoals and when we have no exit strategy. No ground has been\n\n[[Page S4160]]\n\nplowed for this mission, with no explanation of our goals and \nobjectives, except some vague nebulous shibboleths.\n  Let me say this in closing. We are hearing from everybody but the \npeople who pay the bills; the people who send their sons and daughters \noff to foreign lands to shed their blood. We hear from General Clark. \nWe hear from the Secretary General of the United Nations. We hear from \nSecretary Cohen. We hear from everybody but the people.\n  I know what it is. I have been in Congress 48 years. I have seen a \nlot of these things happen before.\n  When we come here we have our picture taken with the Commander in \nChief. My first picture that was taken after I came to Congress 48 \nyears ago was with General Eisenhower, President Eisenhower. We go down \nto the White House. We get wined and dined. We have pictures taken with \nthe brass over at the Pentagon. And we hear the people who live in the \nwhite towers, the political pundits, the media, and we forget about the \npeople who send us here. We get all swollen up by virtue of these \ncontacts that we have, and the people who are telling us what they \nthink, the so-called commanders in chief, Presidents of the United \nStates, and so on. We forget about the people, and we forget about the \nConstitution.\n  They may say this Constitution was all right for yesterday. They may \nsay it is old, that it was all right 200 years ago, or that it was all \nright 100 years ago.\n  I say to you, my colleagues, if it were not for this Constitution, \nyou wouldn't be here. There wouldn't be a Senate of the United States. \nThere wouldn't be a Senate in which the small States of the Union have \nthe same voice that the largest States have in this Union if it were \nnot for this Constitution. If it were not for this Constitution, we \nwouldn't have the United States of America. We would probably have a \n``Balkanized States of America.''\n  So let's remember this Constitution. We take an oath to support and \ndefend this Constitution.\n  That is what Senator Warner and I and the supporters of this \namendment are trying to do. We believe that the main warpowers are \nconcentrated in the Congress, and that the main absolute top warpower, \nthe power of appropriating the money, is vested here.\n\n  Let's stop listening to these dreamings of distempered fancies--by \nthe great generals, the Secretaries General, Defense Secretaries, and \nPresidents of the United States. Let's listen to the people of the \nUnited States. What do they think? They send their men and women to \nforeign fields to shed their blood. The people of the United States, \nthe people who are listening in through that electronic eye up there, \nare the people we should be talking about. They are the people whom we \nshould be listening to--not some far away Secretary General, not some \nSecretary of Defense, not some Commander in Chief. They are only here \nfor a day, or for a term, or 4 years. But the people are out there \nyesterday, today, and forever. And we are their elected \nrepresentatives.\n  Let's regain our voices and no longer be standing in awe of someone \nwho wears the title of Commander in Chief. He is here only temporarily. \nHe will be gone in a short time. There will be a new Commander in \nChief. What does he think? We want to give the new Commander in Chief a \nvoice.\n  Oh, they say: Why not vote today? That would be highly irresponsible. \nVote today to take them out is not what Senator Warner and I are \nsaying. We are not saying take them out. We are not saying take them \nout today. We are not saying take them out tomorrow. We are saying, lay \ndown a plan in consultation with the allies, whereby in due time the \nallies will take over the ground troop responsibility. We will leave \nour air support. We will leave our intelligence support.\n  But let's regain our senses here. Let's just try to remind ourselves \nthat we are not here to represent the Commander in Chief. I am not. I \nam not here to represent a Commander in Chief. I am here to represent \nthe people of West Virginia. I am not here to represent the Secretary \nGeneral of NATO. I am not here to represent the Secretary of Defense. I \nrespect these people. I respect them. But they cannot tell me what this \nConstitution means. They cannot tell me what the intent of the \nConstitution is. I have my own eyes. I have my own ears. I have my own \nconscience, and I will be driven by my conscience and by this \nConstitution as long as I stay here.\n  May God continue to bless this country--one nation, one Constitution, \none destiny.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am proud to come to the floor once again \nto defend and explain the Kosovo amendment which I have sponsored with \nthe distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, and \nother, well-respected, conscientious colleagues--despite the \naccusations of some to the contrary. That amendment is now part of the \nbill before the Senate.\n  Several weeks ago, Senator Byrd and I joined forces to draft a plan \nof action that would lead to a vote or votes on the continued \ndeployment of U.S. troops in Kosovo. For almost a year now, thousands \nof U.S. troops have been patrolling the streets of Kosovo as part of a \nNATO-led peacekeeping operation--with no end in sight. The Congress has \nbeen silent; that must end. Congress is about to appropriate, pursuant \nto a request by our President, almost 2 billion U.S. taxpayer dollars \nfor military operations in Kosovo without any knowledge of when our \ntroops will come home.\n  The purpose of our legislation is twofold. First, it requires the \nCongress to fulfill its co-equal constitutional responsibility, with \nthe President, to make decisions--by vote--that are in the best \ninterest of the nation, and particularly the men and women of the Armed \nForces deployed in the Kosovo operation. This is a responsibility that \nthe Congress has consistently failed to exercise for many years with \nrespect to other military operations. Second, the legislation sends the \nmessage that other nations and organizations must follow through on \ntheir commitments of assistance for Kosovo if U.S. troops are to remain \na part of the military force in Kosovo.\n  The legislation that is before the Senate today has three main \nobjectives. First, it terminates funding for the continued deployment \nof U.S. ground combat troops in Kosovo after July 1, 2001, unless the \nPresident seeks and receives Congressional authorization to keep troops \nin Kosovo. Second, the legislation requires the President to develop a \nplan, in consultation with our allies, to turn the ground combat troop \nelement of the Kosovo peacekeeping operation entirely over to other \nnations by July 1, 2001. Third, related to today's operations in \nKosovo, and to signal to the Europeans the need for them to fulfill \ntheir commitments for implementing peace and stability in Kosovo, the \nlegislation withholds 25 percent of the emergency supplemental funding \nfor military operations in Kosovo until the President certifies that \nour allies are making adequate progress in meeting the commitments they \nmade to the Kosovo peacekeeping process. If the President does not make \nthat certification by July 15 of this year, the funding held in reserve \ncan only be used for the safe, orderly and phased withdrawal of U.S. \ntroops from Kosovo, unless Congress votes otherwise.\n  While I expected opposition to this legislation, I am, quite frankly, \nsurprised by the misleading statements which are being used to describe \nour effort. Those of us who support this legislation are being accused \nof endangering the lives of U.S. troops, providing aid and comfort to \nthe enemy--Milosevic, and sounding the ``death knell'' of NATO. \nAccording to General Clark, the measures contained in this legislation, \n``are unlikely to encourage our European allies to do more. In fact, \nthese measures would invalidate the policies, commitments and trust of \nour Allies in NATO, undercut U.S. leadership worldwide, and encourage \nrenewed ethnic tension, fighting and instability in the Balkans.'' \nThere is simply no basis in fact for making such statements. Why is the \nAdministration so afraid of letting the Congress have a voice, by vote, \non our continued military presence in Kosovo? We are elected by the \npeople of our nation to speak and vote in their best interests.\n\n  Have the opponents really looked at this legislation? It is not a \n``cut and run'' from Kosovo. We are not deserting our allies. Nowhere \nin this legislation is there an automatic, mandated withdrawal of U.S. \ntroops from Kosovo\n\n[[Page S4161]]\n\non a date certain. In every case, what we have done is make the \ncontinued U.S. ground combat troop presence in Kosovo subject to a vote \nby the Congress. We are requiring a Congressional affirmation of a \nPresidential decision that affects the security of our nation and the \nwelfare of the men and women of the Armed Forces deployed overseas and \ntheir families here at home. That was the intention of the Framers of \nthe Constitution in giving the Congress co-equal power for such \ndecisions.\n  I point out to our critics that this legislation was carefully \ncrafted to impact only the ground combat element of our presence in \nKosovo. Even if the Congress decides, over a year hence, not to support \nour continued military presence in Kosovo, the U.S. would still be able \nto provide support elements to the NATO-led mission in Kosovo, and \nwould be able to respond to an emergency situation with combat units.\n  General Clark has pointed out that other nations--primarily our NATO \nallies--contribute 85 percent of the troops that make up the Kosovo \noperation. To now say that the possible elimination of only part of the \nremaining 15 percent U.S. forces would mean that ``the sky is falling'' \ncalls into question the importance of the allied contribution to this \neffort. Is General Clark really saying that the 85 percent of the \ntroops in Kosovo are of such little consequence, little effectiveness, \nin the effort to achieve peace and stability in that troubled region? I \nwould hope that is not his message to our allies.\n  One of the main reasons we are proceeding with this legislation is \nout of a deep sense of concern for the safety and security of our men \nand women in uniform in Kosovo. They are making sacrifices, they are \nfacing daily risk to their personal safety. We, as their elected \nrepresentatives, with co-equal responsibility under the Constitution \nfor deploying troops into harm's way, must fully examine and debate \nthis issue and--ultimately--vote on whether or not U.S. troops should \nremain in Kosovo. That is our responsibility, and we owe our brave \nservicemembers no less. We cannot--we must not--allow the situation in \nKosovo to drift on endlessly, as we stand idly by, unwilling to act.\n  Over the past decade, as our military has been reduced by a third, \nU.S. troops have been involved in overseas deployments at an \nunprecedented rate. According to General Hugh Shelton, the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs, ``Two factors that erode military readiness are the \npace of operations and funding shortfalls. There is no doubt that the \nforce is much smaller than it was a decade ago, but also much busier.'' \nThe increasing frequency of these contingency operations--which involve \nextensive, repeated separation from family and home--is one of the \nmajor causes for the problems the military is having in recruiting and \nretaining quality personnel. The United States has far too many \ncommitments around the world, our military is stretched too thin; we \ncannot have an open-ended, decades-long military deployment to the \nBalkans. It is time for Congress to act.\n  I was very troubled by what I discovered during my January trip to \nKosovo. I was a supporter of our military involvement in Kosovo; in \nfact, I was a principal sponsor of the resolution for authorization by \nthe Congress of the air war. But I was disturbed by what I saw in \nJanuary.\n  I found U.S. troops running towns and villages--acting as mayors, \npolice, and jailers; I found U.S. troops--in groups of 2 or 3--guarding \nindividual houses and churches, escorting Serb families to market; I \nfound U.S. troops concerned with the slow pace of the UN's effort to \nrebuild the region, and frustrated by the seemingly endless and \nmindless cycle of ethnic violence in Kosovo--Albanian on Serb, Serb on \nAlbanian, and Albanian on Albanian.\n\n  When I visited Bernard Kouchner, the UN Administrator in Kosovo, I \nfound a man frustrated with the level of progress he had been able to \nachieve; I found a man pleading for help from the international \ncommunity. ``I have no money'' was a phrase I heard over and over as we \nsat in KFOR Headquarters in Pristina, in one of the few buildings in \nthe city with power--but no running water--as most of Kosovo was cold \nand dark during the winter. He told me that many pledges and \ncommitments of assistance had been made at international conferences, \nbut he could not pay the government workers or fix the power supply \nwith pledges. He needed money.\n  Until he, and others, are able to make progress, our troops will \ncontinue to be policemen and mayors and mediators--targets of the \nfrustration of the people of Kosovo, and increasingly at risk. We saw \nsome of the danger that our troops face during the violence in \nMitrovica. That will only increase if an adequate economic and security \ninfrastructure does not quickly materialize in Kosovo.\n  I returned from that trip in January determined to do something to \nchange the situation I found in that troubled region. I could not turn \na blind eye to what I had seen. The legislation before the Senate is \nthe result. Some may not agree with the approach, but I strongly \nbelieve that it is the proper course of action.\n  Let me address some of the charges that have been leveled against the \nproponents of this legislation. The one that most troubles me is the \ncharge that we are putting U.S. troops at risk because of this \nlegislation. Who among us really believes that Senator Robert Byrd, \nSenator Ted Stevens, Senator Daniel Inouye, and the many others who \nhave either cosponsored or voted for this amendment--15 of whom are \nveterans--would do anything to put U.S. troops at risk? We have devoted \nour careers to fighting for the well-being or our troops. I say to \nthose who make this charge, we are trying to take action to address the \nrisks our troops in Kosovo face everyday--which we must no longer \nignore.\n  My office recently received a communication from a soldier in Kosovo \ndescribing a recent confrontation with local citizens. I would like to \nquote parts of this e-mail so that my colleagues can understand the \nday-to-day reality of our troops in Kosovo:\n\n       The entire village went out into the street, erected a \n     barricade and as the squad (of my soldiers) came out they \n     were pelted with rocks and other debris . . . As we moved in \n     people were hitting us with sticks and actually hitting us \n     with their fists . . . By the time of the linkup I was \n     punched in the face, hit with a stick and got in a wrestling \n     match. . . . Several hundred moved up the hill and started \n     throwing rocks, tree limbs, fire wood, and everything else \n     they could get their hands on. After getting hit in the head \n     by a large rock and getting smashed across the back with a \n     tree limb I gave the order for the soldiers to open fire with \n     nonlethal munitions.\n\n  How long will it take until one of these incidents turns deadly? \nThose who vote against this amendment vote to leave our troops in these \nsituations indefinitely.\n  I would like to address a particular issue raised in the letter which \nGeneral Clark sent to Senator Levin concerning this legislation; that \nis, General Clark's contention that this legislation ``is unlikely to \nencourage European allies to do more.'' On this, General Clark, there \nis already evidence to the contrary. In the several months since I \nfirst began discussing my original amendment--which is now incorporated \nin the Byrd-Warner amendment--there has been progress. I quote from a \nMarch 18, 2000, letter from Dr. Kouchner, in which he details results: \n``I very much appreciate the efforts that you have made so far which \nhave been instrumental in improving our budget situation. Existing \ndonor pledges have now been honored. The next challenge will be to get \nnew donor pledges and to ensure that the pledges for the reconstruction \nbudget of 17 November 1999 do materialize.'' Dr. Kouchner, we are \ncontinuing our efforts to help.\n\n  I would like to address one other issue, one that was raised in a \nrecent editorial by the Ranking Member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee--an editorial in which he accused the supporters of this \nlegislation of being isolationists, a new charge for most of us. In \nthis editorial, Senator Biden states, ``Some would even condition U.S. \nassistance on actions of the European Union, an abdication of our \nprerogatives in decision-making that ought to horrify conservatives.'' \nSince that is directly aimed at the certification requirement which I \ncontributed to this legislation, I will respond. I point out to my \ncolleagues that our President has already conditioned ``U.S. \nassistance''--that is, U.S. troops--on the actions of others. I remind \nmy good friend from Delaware that the exit\n\n[[Page S4162]]\n\nstrategy for our troops in Kosovo--as it is for our troops in Bosnia--\nis directly linked to the actions of the UN, the EU, the OSCE, and \nothers in achieving civil implementation goals. As Secretary Cohen \nstated in an October 15, 1999 letter to the Congress, ``The duration of \nthe requirement for U.S. military presence (in Kosovo) will depend on \nthe course of events . . . The military force will be progressively \nreduced based on an assessment of progress in civil implementation and \nthe security situation.'' This legislation uses the same link--the same \ntie to the actions of others--already adopted by the Administration. If \nthis logic is good for one side in this debate, I say to my good \nfriend, then it is good for the other side as well.\n  I encourage my colleagues to read this legislation carefully; examine \nit for what it does, and especially for what it does not do. Consider \nthe well-respected, conscientious group of supporters. And judge for \nyourself what is the best course of action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I make a parliamentary inquiry: As I \nunderstand it, Senator Daschle will be recognized at 2:20. Is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. The time between now and 2:20 \nis under the control of the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, would the distinguished majority leader like \nto go ahead? I have 3 minutes. Do I?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, was it the intention of the distinguished \nsenior Senator from West Virginia to yield back his time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have no desire to take any more time. I am \nvery happy to listen to the distinguished minority leader. I have said \nall I intended to say. I am ready to vote.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia for \nhis graciousness, as is so often the case.\n  I begin by commenting on our two colleagues, Senators Warner and \nByrd. Some of the finest security thinkers this Senate has ever \nproduced have chaired the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  I think of the names Russell, Stennis, Nunn, Strom Thurmond. They \nhave all made significant contributions to this Nation's debate on \nnational security. Although he has chaired the Armed Services Committee \nfor less than 2 years, Senator Warner has demonstrated many of the \ntraits that made his predecessors so successful. I have great respect \nfor him.\n  What can one say about Senator Robert C. Byrd? This is a rare and \nunique occasion for me. I can't remember the last time I was on the \nopposite side of an issue with Senator Byrd. I admire him immensely.\n  No Member, past or present, has ever displayed a greater love or \nrespect for this institution than has Robert C. Byrd. No Member enjoys \ngreater respect and admiration from his colleagues. No Member is more \nreluctant than this Member to come to the floor and disagree with \nRobert C. Byrd.\n  There is another reason this is difficult, besides the high regard I \nhold for him. The other reason I find this difficult is that I share \nmany of the concerns that led Senators Warner and Byrd to draft this \nresolution in the first place.\n  As we close this debate, I compliment our extraordinary member, the \nranking member of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Levin, for the \noutstanding job he has done in presenting the arguments over the course \nof this debate and providing us his leadership. We owe him a major debt \nof gratitude.\n  I think he shares my view that this debate is not about a number of \nthings. It is not about whether the U.S. military commitment to Kosovo \nor any region of the world should be open-ended. Supporters of this \namendment agree with the supporters of the Byrd-Warner amendment. Every \nU.S. commitment should be examined regularly by Congress and the \nPresident to ensure that it remains in our national interest. This \ndebate is not about whether the U.S. commitment to Kosovo or any other \nregion of the world should be open ended.\n  This debate is not about whether our NATO allies should pay a fair \nshare of any joint operation. We all agree. We have great difficulty \nreaching unanimity in many areas these days, but we are not in \ndisagreement over that fact. Our allies should be sharing the burden, \nand, in fact, they are.\n  As my colleagues have already noted in several of their excellent \npresentations to this body, they are supplying 85 percent of the \npeacekeeping forces in Kosovo today. They are shouldering the vast \nmajority of the effort on the civilian side. That is not the debate \neither.\n  We agree that they should pay more than we are paying, and they are. \nEighty-seven percent of their pledge to Kosovo's budget has been made \nby our NATO allies; 63 percent of the pledge to the civilian police \nforce has now been fulfilled by our NATO allies; 75 percent of their \npledge on humanitarian assistance has been fulfilled by our NATO \nallies. They have begun to step up their commitment on reconstruction \nassistance.\n  Third, this debate is not about whether Congress has a responsibility \nto exercise its constitutional duties over the power of the purse. I \nheard the eloquence once more of Robert C. Byrd. We all understand the \nimportance of this responsibility. No one is more adamant and eloquent \nin pointing out that responsibility than is he. Anyone who does not \nunderstand the significance of this responsibility should simply spend \na moment or two, an hour or two, a day or two, with Senator Byrd to \ndiscuss our founders' deliberations over the importance of vesting the \npower of the purse in the people's representatives, and all doubts will \ndisappear.\n  This debate is not about whether the Byrd-Warner amendment is \nconstitutionally permissible. This debate is about whether the course \nof action it espouses is in our Nation's best interest. As much as I \nrespect the two authors of the provisions incorporated in this bill, I \njoin Senator Levin, our Secretary of Defense, our senior military \nleaders, this administration, and many others who have concluded that \nit is not.\n  I am deeply concerned about the effect this amendment would have. \nFirst and foremost, it would increase the risk to U.S. forces. There is \na fragile peace in Kosovo today and no one has spoken more powerfully, \neloquently, or compellingly about the ramifications of setting a date \ncertain for a withdrawal of U.S. forces from Kosovo than Wesley Clark. \nGeneral Clark has said that setting a date certain for withdrawal would \ntrigger instability throughout the region and increase violence in the \narea.\n  I hope everyone will listen, regardless of whether or not he is a \nconstituent of ours; he is the expert. If we do anything as we make \nthese decisions, I think we need to listen to those who are expert in \ntheir fields. Triggering instability throughout the region and \nincreasing violence in the area is something about which all Members \nought to be concerned.\n  Second, this action rewards Slobodan Milosevic for his ethnic \ncleansing campaigns and would greatly strengthen him and his supporters \nin the region. Again, according to General Clark:\n\n       A U.S. withdrawal would give Mr. Milosevic the victory he \n     could not achieve on the battlefield.\n\n  What a remarkable statement, that a U.S. withdrawal would give Mr. \nMilosevic a victory he could not achieve on the battlefield.\n  Third, this would rupture NATO. Passing this amendment would \njeopardize the strength and the cohesion of our NATO alliance by \ncasting doubt about the reliability of the United States as a partner. \nAgain, according to General Clark:\n\n       Our allies would see this as a universal, adverse move that \n     splits 50 years of shared burdens, shared risks, and shared \n     benefits in NATO.\n\n  Don't just listen to General Clark. NATO Secretary General Lord \nRobertson put it more directly:\n\n       The prospect of any NATO ally deciding unilaterally not to \n     take part in a NATO operation causes me great concern. It \n     risks sending a dangerous signal to the Yugoslavian dictator \n     --Milosevic--that NATO is divided and that its biggest and \n     most important ally is pulling up stake.\n\n  Finally, this action would undermine the U.S. position as a global \nleader. Unilaterally withdrawing our troops\n\n[[Page S4163]]\n\nfrom Kosovo would call into question our relations with Europe and the \nworld. Many will question the willingness of the United States to play \na role in bringing democracy and prosperity to troubled regions of the \nworld.\n  I know Senator Byrd and Senator Warner share some of these concerns \nbecause they tried to modify their language yesterday. Under other \nconditions, these concerns would not be insurmountable. Unfortunately, \nthis amendment comes to the Senate in such a way that they are just \nthat. Why? Because Members, under the rules now established by the \nmajority, are prohibited from trying to offer any amendments, \nalternatives, or substitutes. All we can do is accept this amendment in \nwhole, or reject it in whole. This is not the proper way for the Senate \nto deal with such an important issue.\n  Supporters of this amendment say it will not force withdrawal of U.S. \ntroops from Kosovo. They argue that the President can prevent a \nwithdrawal by simply certifying by July 15--roughly 8 weeks from now--\nthat our allies have met a series of rigid, numeric burden-sharing \ntests.\n  Unfortunately, the Director of the OMB disagrees. Yesterday, in a \nletter to me he said:\n\n       Despite progress, the targets are not yet met, nor can I \n     provide assurances that they will be met by July 15th . . . \n     Certification required by the amendment . . . is currently \n     not possible.\n\n  Listen to the Director of the OMB. He has indicated certification \ntoday, tomorrow, or for the foreseeable future is not possible.\n  And even if the burden-sharing requirement of this amendment does not \nforce immediate withdrawal of troops, it sets the stage for withdrawal.\n  Make no mistake, if we pass this amendment, we are lighting a fuse. \nWe may be able to extinguish it in time, but no one in this Senate can \nguarantee that. Why would we create such a crisis at this point? \nHistory shows that lighting a fuse in this region can produce an \nexplosion that engulfs the entire world. That is not ancient history; \nthat is recent history.\n  Even if we are somehow able to extinguish the fuse, in the meantime \nour troops and our allies are left with the uncertainty about whether \nwe are going to keep our commitment. History also shows that winning \nthe peace can often take some time.\n  Peace is a fragile plant whose roots need time to take hold. Mr. \nPresident, 55 years after the end of World War II, 100,000 troops \nremain in Europe. Never once in 55 years has Congress felt it necessary \nto ratify that decision. What would have happened had we pulled our \ntroops out of Europe less than 1 year after that war--as this amendment \nwould have us do today in Kosovo? We know Europe would look \nsignificantly different today. The probability is the second half of \nthe 20th century would have looked like the first half--in which we \nfought two World Wars.\n\n  NATO, the most successful military alliance in the history of the \nworld, would not exist. The emerging new democracies of Eastern Europe \nwould still be behind the Iron Curtain. Congress did not even approve \nthe Marshall Plan until 1947. Why should we be so impatient now? Why \nshould we be so unwilling to give peace and democracy time to take firm \nroot in Kosovo.\n  For 50 years we fought a cold war to bring peace, stability, and \ndemocracy in all of Europe. We have finally won that peace. It seems to \nme that 5,900 troops in Kosovo is a small price to pay to keep it.\n  Just over 1 year ago, leaders from 18 countries came to Washington to \ncelebrate the 50th anniversary of NATO. On that occasion, Senator \nWarner eloquently said:\n\n       [NATO] must remain. It must be strong, and U.S. leadership \n     in NATO is absolutely essential.\n\n  Senator Warner's words were right then and they are right now. If we \nare to achieve these worthy ends we must strike the Byrd-Warner \nlanguage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield myself time under my leader time.\n  Mr. President, I know Senators expect to vote at 2:30. I know there \nare meetings that are going to be occurring momentarily. I will not \ndelay that, but I do just want to make three or four points.\n  No. 1, I want to say what an instructive and constructive debate I \nthink this has been. I listened to a good bit of it last night. Some of \nit I came and sat on the floor and listened to; I engaged in some of \nthat discussion; I watched some more of it later on on television; and \nI listened to various parts of it this morning. I think it has been a \nvery healthy debate. I congratulate all who have been involved on both \nsides of the issue on both sides of the aisle.\n  I also want to pay a particular tribute to Senator Byrd--it is always \nan education when he speaks about the Constitution, about why he \nbelieves that Congress should step in to deal with an issue such as \nthis--and, of course, Senator Warner. They have both done an \noutstanding job. They have been convincing to me.\n  Also, I think it should be noted that as sponsors of the language \nthat is in the bill, they have indicated a willingness to compromise in \nthe conference, to make some changes if Members think that is \nnecessary, on dates, or to see if the administration could work with \nthem on language that could be acceptable. I think that is the way to \napproach it.\n  Those things have really made the difference for me. We have no long-\nterm plan for Kosovo. We do not know how long we are going to be there. \nWe do not know how much it is going to cost. We do know our allies have \nnot been meeting their commitments. Progress is being made in that \nregard, but I give credit to Senator Warner and Senator Stevens and \nothers, talking about this amendment and pointing out that those \ncommitments were not being fulfilled in terms of people, troops, \npolice--or in terms of money. That is unacceptable. But I think there \nis a little bit of an attitude: If we don't do it, the United States, \nthe sole remaining world power, will take care of it. That is not right \nfor the American people. It is not right for the taxpayers of America. \nSo I think we need to have a better understanding about fulfillment of \ncommitments and what is the long-term plan. How long are we going to be \nthere? Under what conditions would we ever get out?\n  It should be noted, even with these amendments, the Byrd-Warner \npackage being adopted, we would still be able to provide logistics \nsupport, intelligence--a number of other facets. We are dealing with \nwar troops on the ground who would be affected by this.\n  Here is the most important point of all. For years we have been \nthrough this debate about constitutional requirements--what the \nCongresses do, the President's prerogatives. Clearly we have been \nabdicating ours. The language under the Warner provision says to our \nNATO allies No. 1: Fulfill your commitments. And, No. 2, we in the \nCongress should vote to authorize this action.\n  For those who say Congress would not authorize this involvement next \nyear, the presence of combat troops in Kosovo, I do not believe that. I \ndo not think we know yet. I certainly would listen to the debate. I \nvoted to use U.S. combat troops in various parts around the world, in \nRepublican administrations and in Democrat administrations, and, quite \nfrankly, against it sometimes in both of them. I do not think this is \nrisky. I think there has been a lot of exaggeration as to the result. I \nam prepared to vote for keeping the language in the bill, and I think \nwe can go forward from there. But whatever happens, Congress needs to \nfulfill its responsibility.\n\n  I ask for the yeas and nays, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment (No. 3154).\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT.

Mr. President, the Navy's ship maintenance problem is \nlarge--and growing larger. Scheduled heavy maintenance for fifteen \nships has already been canceled this fiscal year. Without the funds \nprovided by this amendment, the Navy will either cancel or drastically \nreduce work scheduled for eighteen more. The individual cases are \nstriking:\n  The amphibious assault ship Bataan should be undergoing $17 million \nof work at Norfolk Naval Shipyard. Instead she is deployed to Puerto \nRico.\n  The amphibious transport dock ship Shreveport ran aground recently \nand was repaired overseas for $1.5 million\n\n[[Page S4165]]\n\njust to get her home. Her subsequent $6 million shipyard availability \nhas been canceled.\n  The backlog of work for the fast combat support ship Detroit--\ndeclared ``unsafe for underway operations'' by Navy inspectors last \nAugust--climbed to $68 million, nearly twice previous estimates.\n  All of this unprogrammed funding must come out of this fiscal year's \nbudget.\n  The Pacific Fleet canceled $20.6 million of work on the amphibious \nassault ship Bonhomme Richard and $13 million on the amphibious \ntransport dock ship Denver. They may have to skip availabilities for \nthree aircraft carriers--two of which, the Kitty Hawk and the \nConstellation, are nearly 40 years old.\n  Mr. President, we should not be surprised. Since the end of the Cold \nWar we have reduced the size of the fleet, yet we are running our Navy \nat unprecedented levels in support of worldwide national security \nrequirements--over eighty contingencies just since 1990.\n  Ship maintenance challenges have a direct and adverse impact on Navy \nretention rates. Admiral Vernon Clark, Commander of the Atlantic Fleet \nand nominee for next Chief of Naval Operations, routinely points out \nthat retention is all about our sailors' quality of life and quality of \nwork. Sailors spend valuable time chipping paint; time that should be \nspent training, going to school or enjoying their families.\n  Consider this example, just to provide a sense of this retention \nrelationship. The anchor and chains of the destroyer USS Briscoe were \nrefurbished in 1995 and supposed to last twelve years. Within three \nyears, rust was bleeding through. A ten sailor detail was mustered from \nthe ship's crew to redo the job. The chains were lowered to the pier \none link at a time, dragged to a barge, then scraped by sailors with \nvibrating wire needle guns--a total of 1,530 feet of chain. The job \ntook ten sailors working six weeks to finish, a job that should not \nhave been needed until 2007. Clearly, time-consuming and spirit-sapping \nwork. Clearly, the Navy is not getting all the tools, time and parts to \ndo the job right.\n  Mr. President, there is no question, we are at a crisis point in \nkeeping our magnificent fleet safe and ready. The $220 million in this \namendment will provide some immediate relief for the Navy and our \nsailors around the fleet. The Senate Armed Services Committee, under \nthe capable leadership of Senator Warner, and the Seapower Subcommittee \nunder Senator Snowe's leadership, have committed to fully fund all of \nthe Navy's fiscal year 2001 projected maintenance requirements.\n  It is important to recognize, however, that additional funds are only \na part of controlling our ship maintenance problems.\n  The Administration, the Navy and the Congress must address the larger \nissues that will continue to erode our fleet's readiness. Aging ships, \nmore deployments, chronic underfunding of maintenance accounts, \ninefficiencies in the maintenance management system, reductions at our \npublic and private shipyards, and lower retention rates for sailors \nwith maintenance ratings--all compound this situation.\n  Mr. President, we have a lot of work ahead of us if we are to set the \nconditions that will ensure the capability and readiness of our Navy \ntoday and in the years ahead.\n  Our shipbuilding rates are too low to sustain the size of the fleet \nnecessary to meet our security requirements.\n  We need to accelerate the insertion of new and improved ship \ntechnologies that will reduce maintenance requirements.\n  The Navy's maintenance management system needs modernization, \narguably a new way of thinking of why, how and when ship maintenance is \nscheduled.\n  Modern sailors work too hard and are too valuable to waste time \nchipping paint--we need to protect them from mind-numbing heavy \nmaintenance that should be done right the first time in the nation's \nshipyards.\n  This amendment is only part of what should become a comprehensive \napproach to the challenges of Navy ship maintenance--but it is a \ncritical part. We cannot afford to allow the backlog to grow.\n  With this amendment and the resources we provide for fiscal year \n2001, we make a national commitment to fully fund our ship maintenance \nrequirements, and to keeping our fleet safe and ready.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3156\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of describing the \nnature of this very important amendment to provide $85 million on an \nemergency basis to begin the process of reopening and restarting the \nLos Alamos National Laboratory in the aftermath of the worst wildfire \nin the history of New Mexico.\n  The cost of restoring the laboratory to full operations will \nundoubtably grow as the Lab discovers further conditions upon reopening \nand restarting facilities and buildings. But this amendment is designed \nto provide the first installment of resources to assist the laboratory \non its road to recovery. The funds will be used for:\n  Restart of laboratory operations (including replacement of lost \nscientific equipment, computers, and government vehicles)\n  Fire protection (including the replacement of broken or worn fire \nfighting equipment, replacement of destroyed or malfunctioning fire \nalarms, and the expansion of fire alarm coverage)\n  Environmental protection (including extension erosion control efforts \nto prevent mud slides; expanded air monitoring and equipment \nreplacement; expanded water monitoring of run-off and groundwater)\n  Cean-up and infrastructure repair (including clean-up of smoke and \nfire damage, replacement of electrical power lines and transformers, \nrepair of water and gas infrastructure, and repair of communications \nsystems)\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3157\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to thank Chairman Burns and the \nranking member, Senator Murray, for their support of my amendment \ncombating the illicit trade in diamonds. I also want to acknowledge the \nassistance of the staff of the Treasury-General Government Subcommittee \nand the U.S. Customs Service.\n  As the op-ed in today's Washington Post, ``Diamonds Are For \nKillers,'' by Sebastian Mallaby, correctly points out, diamonds are \nfueling the violence in Sierra Leone. The Revolutionary United Front \n(RUF), responsible for so many horrors, is not fighting for a belief, a \ncause, or an idea. They are a criminal gang brutalizing the people of \nSierra Leone simply to maintain their grip on diamond rich lands. \nDiamonds from Sierra Leone are unusually large and clear, much prized \nby a jewelry industry prepared to pay top dollar with no questions \nasked. The diamonds buy weapons and narcotics, RUF staples. The \ndiamonds are transshipped through Liberia and the Ivory Coast, the \nleaders of each taking their cut of the profits. From Africa, the \ndiamonds are transported to Amsterdam or London before, in many cases, \nbeing shipped here.\n  My amendment is a simple one. It bans the use of funds for the \nprocessing of paperwork associated with the importation of diamonds \nfrom Sierra Leone, Liberia, the Ivory Coast, the Democratic Republic of \nthe Congo, or Angola. I have chosen to include the Congo and Angola \nbecause so-called ``conflict diamonds'' have fueled the bloody civil \nwars in those countries as well.\n  Having choked off the RUF's source of revenue, it is my hope that \nforces loyal to the legitimate government of Sierra Leone, fighting \neven now in the outskirts of Freetown, can begin to gain the upper hand \non the battlefield. Ultimately, it will take more, far more, than \ncutting off the diamond trade to crush the RUF, but the road to victory \nhas to begin somewhere. Let it begin here.\n  Fellow Senators may not realize that my amendment is based on \nlegislation championed by Representatives Hall and Wolf. Clearly, there \nis bipartisan, bicameral support for banning this bloody trade. Few \nwould treasure a diamond torn at such terrible cost from the blood-\nsoaked soil of Sierra Leone. I look forward to working with colleagues \nin both houses to bring the trade in ``conflict diamonds'' to an end.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Mallaby's op-ed piece be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S4166]]\n\n                        Diamonds Are for Killers\n\n                         (By Sebastian Mallaby)\n\n       The agony of Sierra Leone demonstrates not only that the \n     West has failed to decide when military intervention is \n     justified. It shows its failure to come to grips with the \n     role of natural resources in provoking conflict. Clausewitz \n     called war ``the pursuit of politics by other means.'' But \n     war is just as often a device for the pursuit of business.\n       In Sierra Leone, war is caused by diamonds. The limb-\n     chopping rebels of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) \n     started out in 1991 as a small band. Then they captured the \n     diamond region, got rich and became a very big band. They \n     send the gems to Liberia and other obliging neighbors in \n     exchange for cash and guns. They fight not to win but to keep \n     hold of the diamond trade. They are like the drug warlords \n     who terrorize Colombia.\n       The latest outbreak of fighting has shown this yet again: \n     It was provoked when U.N. peacekeepers moved to disarm rebels \n     who control the diamond region. The RUF, which had been \n     content to play its role as part of the government since last \n     year's peace deal, was suddenly content no more. It killed \n     four U.N. soldiers, took a few hundred hostage, and the civil \n     war began again. If Sierra Leone had no diamonds, there might \n     well be no rebels, and certainly not such lethal ones. This \n     goes for Angola too, where Jonas Savimbi's election-flouting \n     guerrillas smuggle diamonds to pay for weapons. In Congo, a \n     shifting cast of armies has overrun bits of the country in \n     hope of gold and diamond loot. In Mozambique, by contrast, \n     there are no gem or other resources to speak of. As a result, \n     the civil war that had been fostered by white South Africa's \n     regime fizzled out when apartheid ended.\n       Mozambique is especially telling, because the country has \n     done well out of a peace deal that resembles last year's \n     arrangement in Sierra Leone--an arrangement widely called \n     unworkable. As in Sierra Leone, Mozambique's rebels were \n     notoriously brutal. But after years of serving apartheid's \n     goals, they were brought into the government and proceeded to \n     behave responsibly. Because it has no diamonds, Mozambique \n     became what Sierra Leone can only hope to be: an apparently \n     failed state that confounds the pessimists by attaining a \n     measure of stability.\n       This is worth noting in itself, because people tend to pair \n     the term ``failed states'' with a desperate throwing up of \n     hands, as if failure were an inevitable feature of the modern \n     order. But states fail for a reason: gems in Sierra Leone and \n     Angola, cocaine in Colombia.\n       It makes no sense trying to broker peace in resource-cursed \n     countries unless the resources are brought under control. The \n     U.N. force in Sierra Leone was given no mandate to halt \n     mining or even gather information about it. Its first step \n     should have been to take over the diamond fields. Instead, it \n     waited nearly a year and then sent a force that was not up to \n     the challenge.\n       The international diamond trade needs to be better \n     regulated. Yes, easier said than done. Cocaine traffickers \n     face the ultimate sanction--their product is illegal--and yet \n     they carry on in business. But two peculiar features of the \n     diamond business make regulation seem workable. First, around \n     two-thirds of the market for freshly mined uncut diamonds is \n     controlled by one company, De Beers, which therefore has \n     enormous power to reform the conduct of the industry. Second, \n     diamonds have no intrinsic value; they are all advertising \n     and image.\n       These two peculiarities could be mutually reinforcing. The \n     diamond firms know what happened to the fur industry when \n     consumers started worrying about cruelty to animals. Their \n     nightmares feature pictures of girls with stumps instead of \n     arms, captioned with the suggestion that diamonds are not a \n     girl's best friend in certain circumstances. Lovers won't buy \n     gifts that profit psychopaths, and De Beers knows that. So it \n     is desperate to clean up its image.\n       Sure enough, De Beers recently promised to buy no more \n     diamonds from conflict regions. Antwerp's powerful diamond \n     exchanges, which are said to buy most of Sierra Leone's gems, \n     have also made reformist noises. The American diamond \n     industry is trying to sound polite about a bill introduced by \n     Rep. Tony Hall this week, which would require diamonds to \n     come with certificates stating their country of origin.\n       There is movement, in other words; but not yet enough of \n     it. De Beers has not opened itself to outside inspectors who \n     could vouch for its sincerity. Antwerp has yet to promise to \n     stop buying from Sierra Leone and the countries like Liberia \n     that act as its agents. The industry resists what ought to be \n     the ultimate goal of its reforms: an auditable trail from the \n     mine to the consumer.\n       Better accountability is not too much to ask of an industry \n     with annual retail sales worth $56 billion. Western \n     governments can't carry on financing peacekeeping missions \n     while their consumers finance mayhem.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3164\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenator Roberts to include an amendment to the foreign operations \nappropriations bill which will benefit both the United States and \nChina.\n  In particular, Mr. President, our amendment allows United States \nbusiness to include China in the United States-Asia Environmental \nPartnership. The time is ripe for such action, particularly as China \nprepares to enter the rules-based trading system we know as the World \nTrade Organization. China's participation is good news for China and \nbetter news for United States business.\n  Mr. President, the Senate has already shown its support for including \nChina in the Asian Environmental Partnership through passage of an \nidentical amendment in the 105th Congress. However, such efforts were \nstifled in conference. Now is the opportune time to take up and pass \nthis amendment and I urge my colleagues to join Senator Roberts and me \nin this endeavor.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3160\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to make some brief remarks \nabout an amendment I offered along with Senator Stevens and Senator \nWarner to the Military Construction Appropriations Bill. This amendment \ntemporarily suspends enforcement of a Department of Defense regulation \nprohibiting State and local election officials from operating polling \nplaces at Department of Defense facilities.\n  A few weeks ago, my staff at the Rules Committee began receiving \ncalls from elections officials in several states complaining that the \nDepartment of Defense had directed them to stop using polling places on \nmilitary facilities that had, in some instances, been used for decades. \nSenator Grams, Senator Warner and Senator Stevens also received letters \nand calls from their State election officials expressing concern about \nthe impact of the Department of Defense regulation on upcoming \nelections.\n  Mr. President, let me spell out some of the real hardships that would \noccur in the absence of our amendment. The Clerk of Franklin County, \nKentucky, Guy R. Zeigler, wrote saying that the DOD directive \nprohibited voting at an Army Reserve facility that the county had used \nas a polling place for ``15 years.'' He went on to explain: \n``[c]hanging the polling sites for these precincts creates confusion \nfor voters trying to locate the new polling place.'' The Franklin \nCounty Clerk concluded that the ``timing of this directive could not be \nworse . . . a Presidential Election Year.''\n  I would also like to share a letter from Minnesota Secretary of State \nMary Kiffmeyer. Ms. Kiffmeyer wrote that the DOD directive prevented \nvoting at military and reserve bases that Minnesota precincts have used \nas polling places ``for several decades.'' She concluded that if these \ntraditional polling places were changed this late in an election year, \nthen ``many voters, including military personnel, will be \ninconvenienced at best, and deterred from voting at worst, due to the \nloss of these accessible traditional polling places.''\n  The impact of the DOD regulation on the State of Alaska was so great \nthat the State legislature passed a resolution declaring ``Alaska has a \ntradition since statehood of public voting on military installations \nand proposed changes will cause confusion and extra financial costs.''\n  Working with Senator Warner's personal and committee staff, my staff \nwas able to elicit a memorandum dated April 19, 2000 from Douglas A. \nDworkin, Acting General Counsel for the Department of Defense, \nclarifying that DOD's regulation ``does not apply to National Guard \ninstallations.'' I ask that a copy of this memorandum be printed in the \nRecord after my statement.\n  Despite this clarification, it is still clear that the McConnell-\nStevens-Warner amendment is necessary to prevent the disenfranchisement \nof men and women in the armed forces as well as citizens residing in \ncommunities with facilities under DOD's control. The purpose of this \namendment is to stay enforcement of the Department of Defense \nregulation until after this November's election so that State and local \nelection officials who have already designated DOD facilities as \npolling places or have used DOD facilities as polling places since \nJanuary 1, 1996 may do so for this year's primary and general elections \nand not be forced to scramble for alternative sites at this late date. \nThe purpose of this amendment is not to allow election officials who \nhave not yet designated or recently utilized Department of Defense \nfacilities as polling places to suddenly do so now.\n\n[[Page S4167]]\n\n  After this year's elections are over, elections officials and the \nDepartment of Defense can discuss how to address DOD's concerns about \noperating polling places on military facilities in a manner and at a \ntime that does not risk the disenfranchisement of voters through the \nconfusion entailed in altering traditional polling places shortly \nbefore local, State and Federal elections. I would again like to thank \nSenator Stevens, Senator Warner, Senator Grams and their staffs for \ntheir assistance on this issue, and I am pleased that the Senate is \nprotecting the franchise of our men and women in the military and in \ncommunities near military facilities by delaying enforcement of DOD's \ndirective until after this year's election.\n  I ask that the letters from Mr. Zeigler and Ms. Kiffmeyer and the \nResolution passed by the Alaska Legislature be included in the Record.\n  There being no objections the letters and the Resolution were ordered \nto be printed in the Record as follows:\n\n                                        Franklin County Clerk,\n\n                                    Frankfort, KY, March 24, 2000.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     Chairman, Armed Services Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: I'm writing to seek your help in a \n     matter pertaining to the use of military facilities as \n     polling sites.\n       As the Chairman of the Franklin County Board of Elections, \n     I recently received notification that I would be unable to \n     use the local Army Reserve building as a polling place due to \n     a recent Department of Defense directive. Specifically, \n     DTG171731Z DEC 99 from SECDEF Washington DC//OASD-PA/DPL// \n     Subsection E1. This directive causes a serious disruption of \n     our election process as two precincts vote in this facility.\n       Locations as suitable as the Reserve building are hard to \n     find. We have used this facility for over 15 years and voters \n     are accustomed to voting there. Changing the polling sites \n     for these precincts creates confusion for voters trying to \n     locate the new polling place.\n       Finally, the timing of this directive could not be worse. \n     As you know, this is a Presidential Election year. Turnout is \n     expected to be high and voters all over the United States \n     will be affected.\n       Any help that you can give in this matter would be greatly \n     appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n     Guy R. Zeigler.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Minnesota Secretary of State,\n\n                                                   March 14, 2000.\n     Senator Rod Grams,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grams: I am writing to alert you to a recent \n     action by the Department of Defense that will prevent the use \n     of military base and reserve facilities as polling sites for \n     elections. I ask for your assistance in urging Secretary of \n     Defense William Cohen to rescind this directive.\n       A DOD directive captioned ``DTG 171731Z'', issued by \n     Secretary Cohen's office in December 1999 contains a \n     provision that prohibits the use of bases and reserve \n     facilities as polling sites or voting places (Subdivision \n     E(1)). This action appears to have been taken to prevent the \n     use of such sites for partisan campaigning, a concern that I \n     understand and share. However, those issuing this directive \n     were apparently unaware that for several decades local \n     jurisdictions have been using military bases and reserve \n     facilities as polling places. As a result, many voters, \n     including military personnel, will be inconvenienced at best, \n     and deterred from voting at worst, due to the loss of these \n     accessible traditional polling places.\n       I therefore urge you to contact Secretary Cohen to urge \n     that subdivision E(1) of this directive be rescinded \n     immediately, so that this long-standing use of military \n     facilities as sites for nonpartisan official Election Day \n     activity can continue. I feel certain that when Secretary \n     Cohen is fully informed regarding this matter, this well-\n     intentioned, but misguided policy will be overturned. Please \n     advise me of Secretary Cohen's response.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Mary Kiffmeyer,\n     Secretary of State.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        The Department of Defense,\n\n\n                                        1600 Defense Pentagon,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 19, 2000.\n     MEMORANDUM FOR ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE (PUBLIC \n       AFFAIRS) PRINCIPAL DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE \n       (RESERVE AFFAIRS)\n     SUBJECT: Political Activities Guidance\n       This memorandum is in response to questions that have been \n     raised regarding the scope of the Department's policy on \n     political activities on military installations. That policy, \n     reissued each election year, provides among other things that \n     ``installation commanders are advised not to allow their \n     installation facilities to be used for polling or voting \n     sites.''\n       The ``installations'' to which this policy refers are all \n     active duty and reserve installations under the jurisdiction \n     of the Department of Defense, including the Military \n     Departments. The policy does not apply to national guard \n     installations that are subject to the jurisdiction and \n     oversight of the governors of the states and territories and \n     the adjutants general in those states and territories, so \n     long as the guard forces remain in state status. Regulation \n     of political activities on guard installations, including the \n     question whether such installations may be used as polling or \n     voting sites, is within the province of the cognizant \n     authorities in each state or territory.\n                                               Douglas A.

PIERRE, SOUTH \n                                 DAKOTA\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, up and down the Missouri River in South \nDakota, silt is building up on the river bottom as a result of the \noperation of federal dams on the river. Water levels are rising as a \nresult, flooding hundreds of homes in the cities of Pierre and Ft. \nPierre and causing considerable anguish for these families. Two years \nago, Congress enacted legislation authorizing the Corps to conduct a \n$35 million buyout of affected property to provide much-needed relief \nto these homeowners.\n  Today, that project is at a standstill. We could start buying homes \ntomorrow, but the Corps of Engineers is contending that the price of \nmoving forward is releasing more water through the Oahe dam, thereby \ngenerating electricity and revenue that will provide an economic \njustification for the project. City officials in Pierre and Fort Pierre \nhave rejected this idea because raising water levels will cause new \nflooding in their towns.\n  This problem has been caused because the relocation legislation \nrequires that this project be economically justified. I support that \nprovision. Some might question why a project intended to provide relief \nto homeowners for damages caused by the federal government must earn \nmore than it pays out. Nonetheless, I believe it is important that all \nCorps projects should be justified, and I agreed to language requiring \nan economic justification for this relief project.\n  Nonetheless, I am deeply concerned with the way this language has \nbeen interpreted. The only option considered by the Corps for providing \nan economic justification is raising hydropower revenues. It has \nignored a far more appropriate way to justify the project: by relieving \nthe government of potential liability it faces for damage to these\n\n[[Page S4168]]\n\nhomes. In Pierre and Ft. Pierre, groundwater elevations track closely \nwith the elevation of the Missouri River. City officials and homeowners \ntell me that sometimes just minutes after the Corps begins releasing \nwater from the dam, raising water levels in the river, water begins \nseeping into basements. For that reason, I am offering an amendment \ndirecting the Corps to take into account its responsibility for this \ndamage as part of its economic analysis.\n  It flies in the face of common sense to provide an economic \njustification for a flood relief project by flooding new parts of these \ncommunities. My amendment will put an end to the Corps' insistence that \nit raise water levels, and allow the project to move forward. I am \ncontinuing to work with the Corps on the language for this amendment, \nand hope that we can reach an agreement that is acceptable to all.\n  Time is running short. In April, I hosted a meeting of over 150 \nhomeowners in Ft. Pierre to discuss this project. They were angry and \nfrustrated. One young mother stood before me in tears, at her wit's end \nbecause she must stay with her home in Pierre while her children grow \nup in another city. She's depending on this buyout to allow her to join \nher children.\n  Other families have already placed downpayments on new property based \nupon the Corps' word that this project would begin in April. They now \nrisk losing that money unless the project moves forward. And all \nresidents are watching the construction season slowly slip away, \nraising the specter that they will be forced to live another year in \ntheir flood-damaged homes.\n  The facts make it clear why we need to start this project \nimmediately. My amendment will allow it to move forward. I hope my \ncolleagues will give it their support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that three letters describing \nthe link between the Missouri River and groundwater flooding be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          City of Fort Pierre,\n\n                                     Fort Pierre, SD, May 5, 2000.\n     Re: Water Table Levels.\n     Peter Hanson,\n\n     509 Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Peter: I have compiled the enclosed information about \n     the water table levels in the Fort Pierre area. The \n     information clearly shows the direct relationship of the \n     water table and the water surface profiles in the river. \n     There a couple of other observations that I made during my \n     own investigation.\n       First, the time lag between a rise in the river and a rise \n     in the water table varied along the river. It varied with \n     distance from the river and with geographic area. Some \n     locations received an immediate increase, while others took \n     nearly 12 hours to see a change.\n       Secondly, the time required to reduce the level of the \n     water table was much longer than the time it took to increase \n     it. This results in a perched water table. This does make \n     sense when looking at the forces that drive the changes. The \n     photos of the Dunes Golf Course show this.\n       I sincerely hope this information is useful and produces a \n     quick conclusion to the quagmire we currently are in. If you \n     have any questions please do not hesitate to call me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Brad Lawrence,\n     Director of Public Works.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                Dunes Golf Course,\n\n\n                                          City of Fort Pierre,\n\n                                                  Fort Pierre, SD.\n       Dear Sirs: This letter is in regards to the water table \n     elevations and its effects on our property.\n       I live at 1271 Hamilton Court in Fort Pierre, South Dakota. \n     My home is located approximately 750 feet from the west bank \n     of the Missouri River. I have lived here since the Fall of \n     1995.\n       I have two small ponds located on my property that extends \n     below the level of the Missouri River during normal \n     discharges. We irrigate our golf course from a pond located \n     approximately 1500 feet from the river bank. We draw \n     approximately 1200 gallons per minute from the half acre \n     lake. With normal river flow, I cannot drain this pond below \n     the intake. The water in the pond completely recharges in \n     about six hours. The second pond is approximately 2,300 feet \n     from the river. I have noticed that the levels in both ponds \n     vary due to the changing levels in the river. The level \n     changes occur approximately two hours after a corresponding \n     change in river elevation. I can pretty much tell what kind \n     of discharge there is just by looking at the water level of \n     the ponds\n       In my opinion, the level of the water table is directly \n     related to the level of the water in the river. There is some \n     lag time before the levels are equal, but they do correspond.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Cullan Deis.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          City of Fort Pierre,\n\n                                                  Fort Pierre, SD.\n     Re: Water Table Elevations.\n       To whom it may concern: I live at 123 E 5th Ave in Fort \n     Pierre, SD. My property is located approximately 350 feet \n     from the west bank of the Missouri River. I have lived there \n     since 1995.\n       In 1995 I had only one sump pump in the basement of my \n     home. In 1996 I had to put another sump pump in the west end \n     of my basement due to flooding and had water damage to the \n     carpet and walls of the basement. After several periods of \n     flooding I had to add an additional sump pump in the east end \n     of my basement in an attempt to stop the damage to the \n     basement.\n       In 1997 the Corps of Engineers erroneously allowed the \n     reservoir to get too full, putting both Pierre and Fort \n     Pierre in danger of flooding. At this time it became \n     necessary for the Corps of Engineers to sand bag Pierre and \n     Fort Pierre. By running high levels of water, once again my \n     basement was flooded. At that time my sump pumps were running \n     every 60 seconds and water was still coming in the cracks of \n     my basement.\n       Today when the Missouri River water level is low my sump \n     holes are empty. When the Corps of Engineers raise the water \n     level my sump pumps run. I can tell you when there is more \n     discharge on the Missouri River by the pumps running more \n     often.\n       In my opinion, the level of the water table is directly \n     related to the level of the water in the river. There is some \n     time lag before the levels are equal, but they do correspond.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      James Hurst.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendments.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is on agreeing to the amendments, en \nbloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3146, 3156 through 3163), en bloc, were agreed \nto.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member, Senator Murray \nof Washington State, and her staff, and, of course, my staff for \nputting this bill together. It has been a longer than usual military \nconstruction bill. It goes a long way towards supporting the \ninfrastructure of our Armed Forces.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BURNS. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Judiciary Committee will meet \nimmediately after this vote right behind us.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I yield to my friend from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Burns and all of our \nstaff for doing an excellent job on this bill. I urge its passage. I \nthank you all for your support.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask for the third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 4425, Calendar No. 554.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4425) making appropriations for military \n     construction, family housing, and base realignment and \n     closure for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2001, and for other purposes.\n\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Without objection, the Senate will proceed \nimmediately to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I move to strike all after the enacting \nclause of H.R. 4425 and to substitute therefor the text of S. 2521, as \nreported and as amended.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is on agreeing to the motion of the \nSenator from Montana.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendment and the third reading of the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read the \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the pending Military Construction \nAppropriations bill provides $8.6 billion in new budget authority and \n$5.1 billion in outlays for Military Construction and Family Housing \nprograms and other purposes for the Department of Defense for fiscal \nyear 2001.\n  A major aspect of this bill is that it is the vehicle for emergency \nsupplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2000 for U.S. military \noperations in Kosovo, East Timor, and Mozambique\n\n[[Page S4169]]\n\nand for other purposes. Those other purposes include the repeal of \n``pay shifts'' and obligation delays enacted last year, based on \nagreements with the Office of Management and the Budget.\n  Because these obligations, amounting to $3.6 billion, will be moved \nfrom fiscal year 2001 to 2000, there is a resulting negative impact on \n2001 outlays in this bill. The net outlay impact of the bill is reduced \nfrom $8.6 billion to $5.1 billion.\n  This legislation provides for construction by the Department of \nDefense for U.S. military facilities throughout the world, and it \nprovides for family housing for the active forces of each of the U.S. \nmilitary services. Accordingly, it provides for important readiness and \nquality of life programs for our service men and women.\n  The fiscal year 2000 supplemental provisions of this bill support \nongoing peacekeeping operations of U.S. Armed Forces, permit the \npayment of past due health care obligations of active duty military \npersonnel and their dependents, and provide compensation to the \nDepartment of Defense for unforeseen increases in fuel costs.\n  The bill is within the revised section 302(b) allocation for the \nMilitary Construction Subcommittee. I commend the distinguished \nsubcommittee Chairman, the Senator from Montana, and the Chairman of \nthe full committee, the Senator from Alaska, for bringing this bill to \nthe floor within the subcommittee's allocation.\n  The bill provides an important and necessary increase in budget \nauthority above the President's request for military construction in \n2001. Most of the $601 million increase in budget authority funds high \npriority projects that the President's request failed to address. The \nbill also reimburses the military services for the costs already \nincurred for their peacekeeping operations, and it permits these \noperations to continue to the end of the fiscal year. It also fully \nfunds healthcare needs and fuel costs that have been left unaddressed \nby the President but must be funded. Because the bill makes important \nadditions to the President's requests, supports appropriate full \nfunding budgeting practices, and funds highly important programs for \nour armed services, I urge the adoption of the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table showing the \nrelationship of the bill to the subcommittee's section 302(b) \nallocation be printed in the Record.\n\n   S. 2521, MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS SPENDING COMPARISONS\n                 [Fiscal Year 2001, dollars in millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                          General\n                Category                  purpose   Mandatory    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n    Budget authority...................      8,634  .........      8,634\n    Outlays............................      5,063  .........      5,063\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget authority...................      8,634  .........      8,634\n    Outlays............................      5,067  .........      5,067\n2000 level:\n    Budget authority...................      8,352  .........      8,352\n    Outlays............................      8,595  .........      8,595\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority...................      8,033  .........      8,033\n    Outlays............................      8,588  .........      8,588\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget authority...................  .........  .........  .........\n    Outlays............................  .........  .........  .........\nSenate-reported bill compared to:\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget authority...................  .........  .........  .........\n    Outlays............................         -4  .........         -4\n2000 level:\n    Budget authority...................        282  .........        282\n    Outlays............................     -3,532  .........     -3,532\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority...................        601  .........        601\n    Outlays............................     -3,525  .........     -3,525\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget authority...................      8,634  .........      8,634\n    Outlays............................      5,063  .........      5,063\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

While I am pleased that this \nbill contains a significant amount of funding for projects in North \nCarolina, I continue to be concerned that despite repeated assurances, \nemergency relief for victims of Hurricane Floyd is still in a holding \npattern.\n  Before we began the appropriations process, we were assured that \nmuch-needed emergency money for Hurricane Floyd victims would be \nattached to the first--and fastest--moving appropriation bill. \nObviously, Hurricane Floyd relief is not in this bill, and now, \nthousands of hurricane victims are still waiting on the Federal \nGovernment to do what's right.\n  These people are hurting like they have never hurt before. And I \nguarantee you that the Hurricane Floyd victims spread across the 13 \naffected states don't care about the politics that go along with the \nappropriations process. The victims of Hurricane Floyd did nothing \nwrong. They paid their taxes for years, voted in the elections and \nbelieved us when we told them that this is a government for the people. \nThe victims aren't looking for a handout. Most of these people have \nnever asked for the government's help, and now that they need it \ndesperately, they are caught in a frustrating waiting game.\n  I sincerely hope that we can work through the Agriculture \nappropriations request as quickly and fairly as we did with the \nmilitary construction appropriations bill.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I am pleased that two important Minnesota \nprojects are being funded in this bill, Phase II of Camp Ripley's \nCombined Support Maintenance Shop (CSMS) and a new Army National Guard \nTraining and Community Center (TACC) in Mankato, Both of these projects \nwere included in the Department of Defense Future Years Defense \nProgram. They are recognized as being good for the Nation, as well as \ngood for Minnesota.\n  First, in regard to Camp Ripley, the existing CSMS was constructed in \n1949 and has been expanded to three additional warehouse-type \nfacilities. All four facilities are undersized and fail to comply with \nmodern construction criteria. The configuration and site restrictions \nof the current facilities make it difficult for the personnel to \nproduce the quality and volume of work expected at Camp Ripley.\n  Due to budget pressures, Congress divided the new CSMS project into \ntwo phases. Phase I received 1993 authorization and appropriation of \n$7,100,000 and includes administration, storage and allied trade shops. \nPhase II will provide general maintenance workbays, specialty workbays, \nmilitary vehicle parking, service and access areas, and flammable \nmaterials storage. Without the completion of Phase II, the Minnesota \nArmy National Guard's equipment readiness will be degraded and the \ncosts of operating multiple facilities will overwhelm Camp Ripley's \noperating budget. Funding Phase II of the CSMA at a level of \n$10,368,000 will allow this project to be completed. I have championed \nthis project from the outset, and I am pleased it is coming to \nfruition.\n  Second, a new Army National Guard Training and Community Center \n(TACC) in Makato, MN is certainly needed. The 2/135th Infantry's \ncurrent facility was originally built in 1914, although it was torn \ndown and rebuilt in 1922. Since that time, the only major modifications \nhave been the replacement of the windows and the roof. The condition of \nthe facility has deteriorated to such an extent there is approximately \n$246,200 in backlogged maintenance and another $80,000 in construction \nwould have been needed just to bring the building up to code. Due to \nhealth and safety concerns, the Guard currently cannot park its \nmilitary vehicles on location; most are parked at the nearest National \nGuard facility 60 miles away. The current facility's limitations are so \ngreat the only practical course of action is to build a new TACC. The \n$4,681,000 for the Mankato Training and Community Center (TACC) will \nenable this to happen, and I have no doubt it will increase the \nrecruiting and retention abilities of the local Guard unit. Congressman \nGil Butknecht has shown leadership on this project, and did a stellar \njob sheparding it through the House.\n  Mr. President, once again, I am proud to have worked to gain the \nsupport necessary to fund these projects. I have no doubt the funding \nthe Camp Ripley and the Mankato TACC will be good for the readiness of \nthe National Guard, and that means it will be good for the people of \nMinnesota and our Nation as a whole.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the $8.6 billion that \nthis bill provides for military construction accounts. This much needed \nfunding will ensure that our armed forces have adequate facilities to \nsupport them in their missions, from training reservists\n\n[[Page S4170]]\n\nstateside to deploying active duty personnel overseas. Additionally, \nthis bill finances the construction, improvement, and maintenance of \nmilitary family housing in the United States and abroad. In a time when \nit is becoming increasingly difficult for the armed services to recruit \nand retain qualified personnel, the importance of providing for proper \nhousing cannot be overstated.\n  Thousands of men and women in uniform report for duty each morning in \nmy home state of Connecticut, and this bill will fund improvements \nwhere they work as well as where they live. First, this bill will fund \nthe building of a pier at the New London Submarine Base that will \ngreatly contribute to safe and efficient operations at the base's \ndrydock. The single pier that presently serves the drydock is \noverburdened and cluttered to such a degree that it unnecessarily \ncomplicates maintenance work and extends the time required to conduct \nship repairs. Once the new pier is built, the Navy estimates that it \nwill pay for itself in under six years.\n  Additionally, this bill provides for the reconstruction of the Air \nNational Guard Complex in Orange, CT. The current structure, in which \nthe soldiers of the 103rd Air Control Squadron train to control \naircraft, was built in the 1950s and suffers from several shortcomings \nin terms of fire, health, and safety guidelines. Last year, many of the \nsoldiers in this squadron were deployed to Bosnia for 120 days, and \nthey did an outstanding job. Today, they continue to train in order to \nbe ready to deploy to the corners of the earth in defense of this \nnation's interests. They deserve to work and train in a safe, modern \nfacility.\n  Also, this bill funds badly needed improvements to 295 homes at the \nNew London Submarine Base. The improvements to these nearly forty-year-\nold homes include electrical and plumbing upgrades, installation of \nnatural gas heating systems, and replacing roofs, windows, and exterior \nsiding. The time has come to accomplish these projects, and they help \nfulfill our responsibility to ensure that our armed services personnel \nand their families live in well-maintained homes. I can think of few \nbetter ways to show our men and women in uniform that we appreciate \ntheir service and sacrifice on behalf of this nation.\n  Finally, I thank the chairman and ranking member of the Military \nConstruction Subcommittee, Senators Burns and Murray. They have \naccomplished the important work of prioritizing the military \nconstruction projects and bringing this bill to the floor. I encourage \nmy colleagues to join me in support of these priorities.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall it pass?\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT.

Mr. President, we have been discussing with our colleagues \nthe procedure for the remainder of the day.\n  At this time, I am going to ask unanimous consent to go to the \nforeign ops appropriations bill. I understand there will be objection \nto that. If there is objection, then I would move to proceed to it. \nThat, of course, would be debatable. I understand there is at least a \ncouple of Senators who would want to be heard on this matter.\n  While that is being debated, we will be working to see if we can get \na time agreement and the ability to complete action on legislation by \nSenator Brownback, Senator Wellstone, and others dealing with sex \ntrafficking. We also will be working to see what kind of agreement we \nmight work out on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act while we \nare doing the sex trafficking bill, if we can get agreement on that.\n  After this series of three different things are worked through, then \nwe will see if there is a possibility under that arrangement or even a \nlikelihood that we could have a vote later on this afternoon. At this \ntime, I couldn't say what time, but I presume 5:30 or 6:00. At that \npoint, we could announce what would occur next.\n  With regard to next week, I might go ahead and say that we are still \ndiscussing the possibility of clearing some nominations and having some \ndebate time on those on Monday, and going to Agriculture appropriations \non Tuesday with an understanding that there is a need for the House to \nact on that before we complete it. The Senate doesn't want to give up \nany of its rights. It has emergency funds in it, in addition to the \nregular appropriations bill.\n  If we don't get started on the Agriculture appropriations bill early \nin the week on Tuesday, it is going to be very hard to finish that bill \nnext week. But it would be our intent to stay on it until we complete \nit. That could be Thursday night, it could be Friday, or it could be \nSaturday. But it is emergency Agriculture as well as regular \nAgriculture appropriations items.\n  I think it is essential that we find a way to commit ourselves to get \nthat legislation through before we leave.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/18/senate-section/article/S4170-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 2522\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, under that debate time, I would say again \nthat I believe Senator Gorton wishes to make a statement at this time. \nI see Senator McConnell is here, and I presume Senator Leahy, who is \nalso here,\n\n[[Page S4171]]\n\nmay want to talk about the content of this legislation and discuss how \nwe are going to find a way to get it completed.\n  I know we have a problem in that the House has not acted on this \nlegislation. But we also need to go ahead and move forward on it. It \nhas emergency funding in it for the counternarcotics program in \nColombia. It has the Israeli peace process funds in it and debt relief \ndealing with Iraqi opposition, and a lot of other very important items.\n  I think we need to discuss that and decide how we are going to be \nable to proceed in an emergency way on this legislation.\n  Having said that, while that debate is taking place, we will be \nworking to see if we can work out an agreement on the next bill that \nwill be called up relatively shortly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrat leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I objected, as I noted I would do \nyesterday, to taking up a bill that has yet to be acted upon in the \nHouse. The regular order is the bill must be approved in the House \nprior to the time we finish our work on the legislation. I see no need \nto deal with the same bill twice, to deal with it now and to deal with \nit again later once the bill is acted upon in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  The distinguished majority leader had noted that there is emergency \nfunding incorporated in this bill. I am sympathetic to that. I won't \nask him at this point, but I note I could ask unanimous consent--which \nI will not do--to take up H.R. 3908, the emergency supplemental bill \nfor the year 2000. The House passed it and urged the Senate to take it \nup and pass it. The Appropriations Committee had hoped they could take \nit up and pass it. It was the majority leader's determination not to \ntake it up, not to pass it, but to leave it in committee. I am not as \nsympathetic as I wish I could be about his desire to deal with these \nemergency matters when we could easily and quickly and very efficiently \ndeal with emergency funding by simply taking up the bill that is right \nnow on the calendar. Again, that is H.R. 3908.\n  That is, of course, the right of the majority and the right of the \nmajority leader, especially, to make that decision. I am disappointed. \nUntil that House bill comes before the Senate, it is not my intention \nto have to require the Senate to go through a debate on the same issue \ntwice. That was the reason the rules were written as they were. \nConstitutionally, appropriations bills must begin in the House of \nRepresentatives. We are, in a sense, circumventing the rules of the \nCongress by allowing these bills to be debated and considered prior to \nthe time the bill comes before the Senate.\n  We will certainly object. We will look forward to the House acting, \nas we hope they will soon, and not only on this bill but on others. \nSenator Lott is absolutely right. This legislation should have been \nreported out it should have been passed in the House by now. It hasn't \nbeen. It is disappointing that it hasn't been. That is the only reason \nwe are not taking it up this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to \nspeak as in morning business for not to exceed 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/18/senate-section/article/S4171-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4171-S4172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE DISCRIMINATION\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, all of us have read accounts of Americans \ncrossing our borders in order to buy vital prescription drugs at deeply \ndiscounted prices. Every day seniors and other Americans can save 50 \npercent, 60 percent, or even 70 percent on their drug bill simply by \ngoing to Canada or Mexico. A busload of seniors from Seattle recently \nsaved $12,000 just by driving two hours north to buy their medications \nat a Canadian pharmacy.\n  The reason drugs are so much less expensive in Canada, Mexico, and \nother countries? American manufacturers sell products that were \ndiscovered, developed and manufactured in the United States for far \nlower prices in virtually every other country in the world than the \nprices they charge American customers.\n  Why? Every other country imposes some form of a price control on \nprescription drugs. As long as we let our drug companies impose all of \ntheir research and development costs on American consumers, our drug \nmanufacturers agree to this arrangement because they can recoup their \nmanufacturing costs and still make some profit. But the price other \ncountries pay in no way compensates for the expensive research and \ndevelopment costs for new drugs. American consumers end up subsidizing \nthe research and development for the rest of the world.\n  When Americans pay higher prices at the drug store cash register, \nthat is not the first time they subsidize the research and development \nof new drugs. Taxpayer dollars are used to fund the research conducted \nby the National Institutes of Health; much of the basic science \nconducted with NIH grants is then transferred to the private sector. \nTaxpayer money is also the major source of funds for training \nscientific personnel, scientists hired by the drug industry in large \nnumbers.\n  According to a 1993 report by the Office of Technology, in addition \nto general research and training support, there are 13 programs \nspecifically targeted to fund pharmaceutical research and development. \nThat same report noted: ``Of all U.S. industries, innovation within the \npharmaceutical industry is the most dependent on academic research and \nthe Federal funds that support it.''\n  Finally there are the tax breaks: for research and development, for \norphan drug development; and possession tax credits for manufacturing \ndrugs in Puerto Rico.\n  Let me be clear. I understand and support the need to invest in \nresearch and development. I have supported all of the programs I just \nspoke about including the National Institutes of Health and the \nResearch and Development tax credit. I also agree that drug companies \nshould be able to recoup costs associated with research and \ndevelopment. But I do not think that American consumers should be the \nonly ones to foot that bill. American consumers who already strongly \nsupport R efforts through their tax dollars should not have to pay \nfor R costs again in the form of higher prices at the drug store. All \nusers, domestic and foreign, should pay a fair share of those costs.\n  But drug companies are satisfied with the status quo. They know that \nthey can simply raise prices in the U.S., if other countries negotiate \nor regulate to win lower prices. American consumers should not be \nsubject to this kind of price discrimination--especially for products \nthat are vitally important to preserving our health.\n  My idea is to borrow from a law that has applied to interstate \ncommerce within the United States for the last 60 years--the Robinson-\nPatman Anti-discrimination Act. It simply says that manufacturers may \nnot use price to discriminate among like buyers. My bill, the \nPrescription Drug Fairness Act, takes these same principles and applies \nthem to prescription drug sales overseas. Drug manufacturers would not \nbe able to offer lower prices at the wholesale level in Canada, Mexico \nor any other country than they charge inside the United States.\n  Since 1936, the Robinson-Patman Act has established as a legal norm \nthe concept of fair dealing in pricing by prohibiting unjustified price \ndiscrimination. The same principle of fair dealing should be applied to \nprescription drug sales to wholesale buyers in different countries.\n  The drug companies have demonized my idea by labeling it ``price \ncontrol.'' If this is a price control then we have had price controls \non every product sold in the United States for the last 60 years. My \nbill in no way tells drug companies what they can or can not charge for \na prescription drug. It simply says that they cannot discriminate \nagainst Americans.\n\n  I asked the pharmaceutical companies for their ideas to ensure that \nAmericans are treated fairly and have access to affordable prescription \ndrugs. Their response? They simply want to expand Medicare by adding \ndrug coverage for its recipients. While I do think coverage is one \nimportant part of the solution for seniors--it is only a partial \nanswer.\n  It does nothing to address the cost for the uninsured American and \ndoes\n\n[[Page S4172]]\n\nnothing to address the growing concerns of employers, health plans, and \nhospitals about rising costs associated with prescription drugs. As \nmore and more people use prescription drugs, drug costs take up more of \noverall health care spending. But drugs are also costing Americans \nmore. Last week, Families USA released a study that showed the average \ncost of the 50 drugs most commonly used by seniors rose by 3.9 percent, \noutpacing the inflation rate of 2.2 percent. A study from the \nUniversity of Maryland's Center on Drugs and Public Policy projects \nprescription drug expenditures will rise 15-18 percent annually. Total \nprescription drug expenditures could double between 1999 and 2004 from \n$105 billion to $121 billion.\n  I do think the Medicare program should be modernized to include a \nprescription drug benefit. If we expand the program, however, it must \nbe done responsibly and must not jeopardize the benefits seniors \ncurrently have. CBO estimates that the program will be insolvent by \n2023. While there are a number of ideas for how to structure a benefit, \nthe sticking point always seems to be how to pay for it. CBO recently \nrevised its estimate of the President's proposal. It is expected to \ncost $160 billion between 2003 and 2010. And that is for minimal \ncoverage up to $1,000 (with seniors paying a second $1,000 out-of-\npocket), relatively high premiums, and no protection for those seniors \nwith exceptionally high drug bills.\n  My skepticism about the industry's support for simply expanding \nMedicare is increased by reports in the Wall Street Journal last week \nthat Medicare and Medicaid have overpaid the drug industry by as much \nas $1 billion a year for the few drugs these programs do cover. My idea \nwould save Medicare beneficiaries money on their drug bills and would \nin no way jeopardize the solvency of the fiscally ailing Medicare \nprogram.\n  I am convinced that we need to address the issue of price \ndiscrimination this year, not only for Medicare patients but for the \nhealth system overall. I am pleased to note that Senator Jeffords will \nhold a hearing on the issue of drug pricing and safety in the next few \nweeks and I hope that the Senate Judiciary Committee, to which my bill \nhas been referred, will also take a look at this issue.\n  In the meantime, while seniors and health plans, employers, hospitals \nand others struggle with the growing cost of prescription drugs, the \npharmaceutical industry has been among the most profitable U.S. \nIndustries in the last five years, with year to year earnings growing \nby more than 10 percent and for some companies 20 percent. So far, they \nhave refused to engage in this debate.\n  I hope they will change their minds. Right now the current system \nleaves the drug companies' best customers feeling like they've been \nripped off. Bob Elmer from University Place, Washington recently wrote:\n\n       I am a recently retired pharmacist . . . and have always \n     been proud of the American pharmaceutical manufacturers and \n     the role that they play in . . . the search for new and \n     innovative entities that help us live not only longer, but \n     better. As a matter of fact, I worked for a major \n     manufacturer for some time.\n       I, like you, am outraged at the manufacturers' practices of \n     charging the American public more than the Mexican public or \n     the Canadian public. What is their rationale for the price \n     differences?\n       This overcharging is a black mark on this industry.\n\n  Mr. President, I couldn't agree more. Drug companies should no longer \nbe allowed to discriminate against Americans by charging higher prices \nhere than they do elsewhere in the world. My bill will end that \ndiscrimination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/18/senate-section/article/S4172-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4172-S4177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING AND RELATED PROGRAMS \n         APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to speak with regard to the \nMOTION TO PROCEED and share my concerns that we should not be moving to \nan ``S'' numbered appropriations bill at this time. In fact, it is a \npractice simply we should not be involved in at all. For this reason I \nrise to speak for a bit about care for the Senate in general.\n  The Senate is a special place. It is a place steeped in history. \nAround this chamber stand the desks of Daniel Webster and Robert \nLaFollette, of Robert Taft and Richard Russell, of Everett Dirksen and \nHubert Humphrey. The drawers of these desks still bear their names, \netched in the wood. The polished mahogany still reflects their memory. \nTheir voices still echo from these marble walls.\n  I am honored to have been able to serve with some of the Senate's \nliving legends. It is with pride that I will tell my grandchildren that \nI worked with the likes of Ted Kennedy, Bob Dole, and Robert Byrd. No \nhonest history of the Senate will omit their names.\n  It is in a modest attempt to follow in the tradition of remarks by \nSenator Byrd that I rise today. All Senators are aware of Senator \nByrd's encyclopedic four-volume treatise on the Senate. And none can \nforget the series of addresses that Senator Byrd gave on the history of \nthe Roman Senate, which have been reprinted in another volume. His \ndiscussions of the special nature of the Senate inspire us all to hold \nthis institution more dearly.\n  The Senate is an almost sacred place, consecrated by the will of the \npeople, hallowed by the expression of the people in free elections. In \nthis room, our 50 separate States each find expression. Every region of \nour vast continental nation here finds voice.\n  In a country as large and as diverse as ours, disputes will naturally \narise. The Senate, almost like a court of law, provides a means for our \nsociety to resolve those disputes in peace. Courts allow private \nparties to resolve their disputes without resort to fist fights. And \nthe Senate allows significant sections of our society to resolve their \ndisputes without resort to the battlefield or the street.\n  For the Senate, as for a court of law, to work this magic, it must do \njustice. As with a court, as Gordon Hewart, the Lord Chief Justice of \nGreat Britain, wrote, it is:\n\n       Of fundamental importance that justice should not only be \n     done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be \n     done.\n\n  For the Senate, as for a court of law, to advance the perception of \njustice and the fair resolution of disputes, it must air disagreements \nfully. It must give opposing parties their day. It must allow all to \napproach on an equal footing and make their case.\n  Justice is not cursory. Justice is not offhand. Doing justice can \ntake time. That is how the Founders wanted this great system to work.\n  In the debates of the Constitutional Convention, James Madison said \nof the Senate:\n\n       In order to judge of the form to be given to this \n     institution, it will be proper to take a view of the ends to \n     be served by it. These were first to protect the people \n     against their rulers: secondly to protect the people against \n     the transient impressions into which they themselves might be \n     led.\n\n  Madison warned that the people's representatives might be ``liable to \nerr also, from fickleness and passion.'' Madison's answer was that \nSenators, because of their ``limited number, and firmness[,] might \nseasonably interpose against impetuous counsels.'' He thus called the \nSenate: ``A necessary fence against this danger.''\n  Time and again, in the history of our country, the Senate has served \nas that ``necessary fence.'' And the firm pillars and posts supporting \nthat fence have been the Senate Rules. The Senate Rules have helped the \nSenate to do justice. It is because of the Senate Rules that the \nBritish Prime Minister William Gladstone is said to have called the \nSenate:\n\n       That remarkable body, the most remarkable of all the \n     inventions of modern politics.\n\n  The Senate Rules make it one of the few places in government where \ndisagreements can be fully aired. The Senate Rules give opposing \nparties their day. And the Senate Rules allow every Senator to make his \nor her case.\n  As Senator Dole said in his speech in the Leader's Lecture Series \nMarch 28:\n\n       We all continue to learn that this institution can only \n     survive if it operates by rules.\n\n  The two fundamental pillars of those rules are the right to debate \nand the right to amend. It is these rights that distinguish the Senate \nfrom the House of Representatives and from other parliaments. It is \nthese rights of Senators that allow the Senate as a body to preserve \nthe rights of minorities.\n  Rule XIX of the Standing Rules of the Senate provides that ``the \nPresiding Officer shall recognize the Senator who shall first address \nhim.''\n\n[[Page S4173]]\n\nPrecedent, of course, gives priority of recognition to the Leaders. \nOnce the Presiding Officer has recognized a Senator, Senate rule XXII \nallows that Senator to speak for as long as humanly possible, unless 60 \nSenators vote to cut off debate. As my Colleagues well know, the mere \nthreat of extended debate--called a ``hold''--can detain legislation.\n  As well, the Senate Rules give Senators the right to offer \namendments. The Senate Rules do not require Senators to go hat-in-hand \nto a leadership-dominated Rules Committee to ask permission to offer an \namendment, as Members of Congress must do in the House of \nRepresentatives. This ability to bring up a subject with which the \nmajority does not want to deal provides a check and balance on the \nagenda-setting power that is vested in the majority leader.\n  These powers to debate and amend make every single Senator a force to \nbe reckoned with. Every Senator--whether a member of the majority or \nthe minority--can be a player. And Leadership cannot neglect or exclude \nany single Senator without substantial risk. As a result, Senators do \nwell never to burn bridges with any other Senator. Because any one \nSenator can disrupt the Senate, every Senator has good reason to show \ncomity for every other Senator.\n  These rules honor the sentiments of committed minorities. They give \ndedicated groups of Senators substantial power. And they give any group \nof 41 Senators the absolute right to kill a bill.\n  The Senate Rules thereby force consensus. When these rules are \nhonored, no major change in our government's laws may come about \nwithout the concurrence of a three-fifths majority. When these rules \nare honored, policy changes are likely to be more moderate and more \nincremental.\n  As Nobel Prize-winning economist James Buchanan has argued, societal \nefficiency may be served by a Congress that has a hard time enacting \nlaws. Under such circumstances, laws change less often--less frequently \ndisrupting peoples' lives, less often intruding into them. If you agree \nwith Thoreau that the best government is that which governs least, then \nthe most efficient government for society is the one with the most \nchecks and balances.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate is not honoring its rules. The Senate is \nbreaching its longstanding traditions of comity and respect for the \nminority. Too often, in the name of expediency, today's Senate is \ncutting corners on the Senate rules. When we give in to expediency it \ncan be disappointing. When we indulge in expediency in this, the place \nwhere deliberation is most sacred, it can be deplorable.\n  Although some of the trends of which I speak have, of course, their \nroots in past Senates and other majorities, the Senate's current \nmajority has brought the level of honor for the Senate's unique ideals \nto a new low.\n  The current majority has diminished the Senate by abusing and \noverusing cloture. The application of the rules of cloture have changed \ndramatically since President Woodrow Wilson, infuriated by an 11-\nSenator filibuster that blocked the rearming of merchant ships during \nWorld War I, complained of ``[a] little group of willful men, \nrepresenting no opinion but their own,'' who he said ``have rendered \nthe great government of the United States helpless and contemptible.''\n  Cloture used to be a rarity. The Senate conducted only 45 rollcall \nvotes on cloture in the entire half century from 1919 to 1969.\n  In 1975, the Senate changed the filibuster rule, reducing the two-\nthirds vote requirement to a vote of 60 Senators, although one still \nneeds two-thirds to cut off debate on changes to Senate rules. With \nthat change in the rules, the leadership began invoking cloture more \nfrequently.\n  As the chart behind me shows, the process of invoking cloture has now \nreached what I call a fevered pitch. The Senate conducted 99 rollcall \nvotes on cloture in the 1970s. It conducted 138 in the entire decade of \nthe 1980s, and it conducted fully 234 in the 1990s.\n  As this next chart shows, the number of cloture votes has increased \nin every year of the current majority, nearly doubling, from roughly 20 \nin 1995 to nearly 40 in 1999.\n  Even by 1984, a select committee on procedure chaired by then-Senator \nDan Quayle concluded: ``Cloture is not only invoked too often, it is \ninvoked too soon.'' Senator Quayle's criticism is all the more true \ntoday. In the Congress when Senator Quayle made his remark, the 98th \nCongress, there had by this time been 10 rollcall votes on cloture \nmotions. In the comparable time period in this 106th Congress, we have \nheld more than four times as many--43 rollcall votes on cloture. Add to \nthat another 11 cloture motions that were withdrawn, vitiated, or \notherwise disposed of without a vote.\n  As Senator Quayle noted, the problem with cloture is not just how \noften, but when. The form of a motion to invoke cloture reads: ``We the \nundersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of \nthe Standing Rules of the Senate, hereby move to bring to a close the \ndebate'' upon the bill.\n  But on bill after bill, from tax cuts to trade bills to \nconstitutional amendments, the majority no longer tolerates even a \nday's worth of debate before moving ``to bring to a close the debate'' \nupon the bill. Indeed, filing cloture without any debate has now become \nthe norm. We proceed to the bill and the cloture motion is filed in the \ntime that it takes the majority leader to draw one breath and make the \nrequest.\n  As an example, I have a chart that shows the entire verbatim \ntranscript of the debate on the motion to proceed to S. 2285, the gas \ntax bill, prior to the filing of cloture. The ``debate''--if you would \ncall it that--was the 11 words the majority leader uttered to make the \nmotion to proceed. In the same breath, the cloture motion was upon us.\n  The practice of filing cloture without any debate at all has made a \nmockery of the motion.\n  Beyond limiting debate, the majority is also using the blunt \ninstrument of cloture to bludgeon the minority into forgoing its right \nto offer amendments. All too often, the majority leader now makes a \ntake-it-or-leave-it offer to the minority leader: Either muzzle your \nright to amendment or we will paint you as obstructionist. Either clear \nyour amendments with us in advance, or have no amendments at all.\n  I am afraid too often, the minority's leadership can get caught up in \nthe business of helping the majority make the trains run on time, in a \nsense, playing the role of Alec Guinness's Colonel Nicholson in ``The \nBridge on the River Kwai,'' building bridges that should not be built.\n  This is not how the Senate was meant to act.\n  Recall that the Senate has often addressed a number of amendments on \na single piece of legislation. The Senate conducted 121 rollcall votes \non amendments to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It conducted 127 \nrollcall votes on the Natural Gas Policy Act in 1977. Now the idea that \na bill might elicit more than ten amendments appears to be anathema to \nthe majority.\n  The current majority has also diminished the Senate by changing the \nrule that limits what can be incorporated into a conference report. \nLate in 1996, to secure last-minute passage of a version of the Federal \nAviation Authorization Act that included a special provision for the \nFederal Express Corporation, the Senate voted 56-39 to overturn the \nChair and nullify the rule. At the time, Senator Specter called the \nchange ``a very, very serious perversion of Senate procedures.''\n  As conference reports are privileged, Senators cannot engage in \nextended debate to block getting to them. As well, conference reports \nare not open to amendment. And after the 1996 precedent, Senators have \nno recourse if a conference committee exceeds the scope of what the \nSenate committed to it.\n  The majority in a conference committee need not work with the \nminority, and the majority often does not. Conference committees \nusually work in secret. Senate rules require no open meetings. House \npractice has generally required one such meeting, but that tends to be \na photo opportunity. Thereafter, Senators' signatures on the conference \nreport constitute their votes, and nothing further need be done in \npublic.\n  Last July, the Democratic leader offered an amendment to restore the \nrule with regard to conference reports, but the majority would not \nallow it. The\n\n[[Page S4174]]\n\nmajority voted it down 51-47 in a nearly party-line vote.\n  The current majority has also diminished the Senate by extending and \ncontorting the congressional budget process far beyond any expectations \nthat its drafters may have had.\n  Once again, of course, the roots of the current abuse of the budget \nprocess lie in earlier Congresses. Participants in the Federal budget \nprocess initially underestimated the power of the budget process. They \nfailed completely, however, to foresee the power of reconciliation \nbills.\n  The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 originally provided for two \nbudget resolutions: The first would advise, and the second, passed \ncloser to the start of the fiscal year, would bind. The Budget Act \nprovided that the second budget resolution could instruct committees of \nCongress to reconcile substantive laws passed within their jurisdiction \nover the summer to the new priorities of the second budget resolution.\n\n  Of course, the reconciliation process has not turned out that \nmodestly. Rather, in 1981, in an effort to expedite President Reagan's \nfirst budget, the budget resolution included instructions for years \nbeyond the first fiscal year covered by the resolution, extending the \nreach of reconciliation bills to more permanent changes in law.\n  Since then, reconciliation has become a regular feature of most \nbudget resolutions. Since then, Congress has accomplished most \nsignificant deficit reduction through the reconciliation process.\n  Because reconciliation bills limit debate, Senators cannot filibuster \nthem. A simple majority can pass their policies. Because reconciliation \nlimits amendments, Senators must stick to only the narrow subjects \nchosen by the majority in the committee process.\n  The reconciliation process is so powerful that the Senate chose in \nthe mid-1980s to adopt the Byrd Rule, named after Senator Robert Byrd, \nto limit reconciliation solely to deficit reduction.\n  But the current majority dramatically extended reconciliation in \n1996. The new Republican Congress sought to move three reconciliation \nbills--on welfare, Medicare, and tax cuts. And in a marked departure \nfrom past practice, the budget that year devoted one of the three \nreconciliation bills--the one to cut taxes--solely to worsening the \ndeficit, not cutting the deficit but making it worse.\n  The Democratic leader formally challenged the procedure, but to no \navail. Through a series of exchanges with the Presiding Officer, the \nDemocratic leader demonstrated that the new reconciliation procedure \nhas few limits. After the Democratic leader appealed the ruling of the \nChair, the Senate sustained the procedure on a straight party-line \nvote.\n  In the wake of that precedent, the majority party has repeatedly \ncreated reconciliation bills to worsen the deficit or spend the surplus \nby cutting taxes, and the same logic would allow fast-track \nreconciliation bills to increase spending. The majority has taken to \nusing the reconciliation process to move its fiscal legislative agenda \nthrough the Senate with simple majority votes and few distractions. The \nresult is plain to see: Congress passes extravagant tax bills that do \nnot command a national consensus and that cannot become law.\n  As well, in this most recently-adopted budget resolution, the \nmajority has even chosen by majority vote to require 60 votes to offer \nsense-of-the-Senate amendments to future budget resolutions. Though by \nno means an earth-shaking change in and of itself, it shows yet another \ninstance of how the majority abuses majority-vote vehicles to create \nyet another variance from the Standing Rules of the Senate. Once again, \nthe current majority seeks to muzzle debate.\n  The current majority has also diminished the Senate by bringing S.-\nnumbered appropriations bills to the floor.\n  That is what is happening right now. That is what prompted, in part, \nthese remarks. The majority wants to go to these S.-numbered \nappropriations bills. They want to do it on the foreign ops bill.\n  The Senate just considered the military construction appropriations \nbill as a Senate-numbered bill, not--as is usually the case with \nappropriations bills--a House bill with Senate Committee-reported \namendments. And what does this do? It has a purpose. This posture \ndeprives Senators of the ability to offer legislative amendments. It is \nyet another way to deny the duly elected Members of this body a chance \nto offer amendments--an absolutely basic right of every Senator.\n  Not infrequently, the House chooses to attach legislation to an \nappropriations measure. In that case, if as is usually done, the Senate \nconsiders the House bill with Senate amendments, a Senator can also \noffer amendments with legislative language. If another Senator raises a \npoint of order under rule XVI against legislating on the appropriation \nbill, the amendment's proponent can raise the defense of germaneness. \nThe idea is that the House opened the door to legislation on this \nappropriations bill, and the Senate must be able to respond with \ngermane amendments.\n\n  If, on the other hand, as is being attempted here, the Senate takes \nup a Senate-numbered appropriations bill, as it did with the military \nconstruction bill, then there is no House bill to provide a basis for \nthe defense of germaneness. Under this circumstance, if a Senator \noffers a legislative amendment and another Senator raises a point of \norder against legislating on an appropriation bill, then the Chair \nsimply rules the amendment out of order and the amendment falls. The \nSenator does not have a chance, again, to offer an amendment.\n  Through this device, the majority once again deprives the minority of \nopportunities to legislate. As well, the majority deprives the full \nSenate of its ability to respond to riders that the House attaches to \nappropriations bills. Once again, the majority has diminished the \ndeliberation of the Senate.\n  And now, we see the spectacle of the majority standing ready to shut \ndown the Senate for over 4 hours, as they did, on Tuesday, just to \nprevent a sense-of-the-Senate vote on gun safety.\n  And now, we see the majority leader appealing the ruling of the \nChair, and by a majority vote, changing the Standing Rules of the \nSenate, so as to have the Presiding Officer rule out of order \nnongermane amendments to appropriations bills.\n  This in itself was a remarkable thing. Rule XVI, which creates the \nprohibition against nongermane amendments, states in part:\n\n       [A]ll questions of relevancy of amendments under this rule, \n     when raised, shall be submitted to the Senate and be decided \n     without debate.\n\n  And as my colleagues know, it takes a two-thirds vote to invoke \ncloture on a change to the Senate rules. But by a party-line, majority \nvote Wednesday, the Senate just erased those words from the Standing \nRules of the Senate. And why? For the same reason all these other \nthings were done--all to make it more difficult for Senators to offer \namendments on appropriations bills.\n  What has become of our right to debate? What has become of our right \nto amend?\n  The traditional Senate, I am afraid, is becoming a thing of the past. \nI have seen this change just from the time I got here in 1993 to now. \nSome may say, ``Good riddance.'' After all, as a Democratic Member of \nCongress once said, ``In the Senate, you can't go to the bathroom \nwithout 60 votes.''\n  But the character of this Senate, I am afraid, has been unmistakably \naltered. The majority's actions are transforming the Senate into a much \nmore majoritarian institution. And that is not how the founders wanted \nit.\n  Recall that the Constitution itself manifests a belief in \nsupermajorities. Supermajority requirements are evident in the veto \npower, in the ratification of treaties, in the constitutional amendment \nprocess, and in a number of other places.\n  Recall, as well, that the founders who created this Senate also \nexpressed a healthy distrust of simple majority rule.\n  James Madison said that:\n\n       [i]n Republics, the great danger is, that the majority may \n     not sufficiently respect the rights of the minority.\n\n  In a letter to James Monroe, Madison also wrote:\n\n       There is no maxim, in my opinion, which is more liable to \n     be misapplied, and which, therefore, more needs elucidation, \n     than the current one, that the interest of the majority is \n     the political standard of right and wrong.\n\n\n[[Page S4175]]\n\n\n  In his first inaugural address, Thomas Jefferson said:\n       Though the will of the majority is . . . to prevail, that \n     will, to be rightful, must be reasonable. . . . The Minority \n     possess their equal rights, which equal laws must protect, \n     and to violate which would be oppression.\n  And John Adams wrote:\n\n       That the desires of the majority of the people are often \n     for injustice and inhumanity against the minority, is \n     demonstrated by every page of the history of the whole world.\n\n  More recently, Senator J. William Fulbright said:\n\n       The greatest single virtue of a strong legislature is not \n     what it can do but what it can prevent.\n\n  In 1984, retiring Congressman Barber Conable told Time Magazine: \n``Congress is `functioning the way the founding fathers intended--not \nvery well.' He explain[ed], `They understood that if you move too \nquickly, our democracy will be less responsible to the majority. I \ndon't think it's the function of Congress to function well. It should \ndrag its heels on the way to decision.' ''\n  And Senator Byrd, who has stood on both the giving and receiving end \nof many a filibuster, writes in his Senate history:\n\n       The Senate is the only forum in the government where the \n     perfection of laws may be unhurried and where controversial \n     decisions may be hammered out on the anvil of lengthy debate. \n     The liberties of a free people will always be safe where a \n     forum exists in which open and unlimited debate is allowed.\n\n  For all their inconvenience, the Senate traditions of deliberation \nand amendment serve our Nation. It is through those traditions that the \nSenate protects liberty. It is through those traditions that the Senate \ncan effect justice.\n  When we stand and look back at the Senate's glorious history, we can \nbe forgiven when we do not measure up to the standards of our greatest \npredecessors. We cannot be forgiven--and we should not be forgiven--\nwhen so often we do not even care to try.\n  We can be forgiven if, after considering the traditions of the \nSenate's hallowed past, we choose to depart from those traditions. We \ncan not be forgiven--and we should not be forgiven--if we depart from \nthose traditions unaware or oblivious of what we leave behind.\n  I invite my colleagues to look around this Senate Chamber, to read \nthe inscriptions in the marble reliefs over the doors. To the east is \nwritten ``Patriotism.'' To the west is inscribed ``Courage.'' And to \nthe south is carved ``Wisdom.''\n  These are the icons under which we walk whenever we come into this \nChamber and whenever we leave it. These walls do not speak of ``ease.'' \nThe marble does not memorialize ``rapidity.'' These sculptures do not \nenshrine ``convenience.''\n  This Senate advances the love of country that is patriotism when it \nstruggles to deliver justice. The Senate serves the people not when it \navoids difficult issues but when it acts with courage to address them \nfully. And it is only through the crucible of debate and amendment that \nthis Senate can come, as come it must, to wisdom.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank my colleague \nand my neighbor from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold. I have a very strong \nfeeling and belief that this speech, which has been given at 5 o'clock \nthis Thursday afternoon, will end up being one of the more memorable \nspeeches given on the floor of the Senate. I think the speech was \neloquent and powerful. It went way beyond political party. I thank my \ncolleague from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Minnesota for his \nefforts on each and every issue I tried to raise to try to constantly \npoint out that this place is supposed to be where we can deliberate and \nactually talk about these issues and offer amendments. He is probably \nthe best example of a person who understands the need to do that.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I won't be--I can't be--as eloquent, \nbut I actually thought I would come to the floor and try to basically \nspeak to what I think are some important questions for the Senate.\n  This is, in part, the discussion we had yesterday; and especially \nwith the majority leader not on the floor, I will make sure that what I \nsay, I say in such a way that if he wants to respond later, he can. In \nany case, I intend to say it at least in the best possible way I can.\n  I know the majority leader today, in a couple of interviews--it has \ncome my way from several journalists--has said that yesterday he sort \nof believed that I was responsible for this exchange that we had on the \nfloor--in getting it started. I believe he also mentioned Senator \nDurbin.\n  I want to say that, actually, if that is the case, I would be proud \nto accept the blame. I think it is a discussion we needed to have, \nalbeit what I hope is that something positive will come out of it. That \nis to say--and this is what Senator Feingold was trying to say--I came \nhere to do my very best to represent the people in Minnesota. I think \nwhen you are a Senator, and also when you pass amendments or bills, it \ncan have implications for people all across the country.\n  What I have always loved about the Senate in the time I have been \nhere is that individual Senators can matter and can make a difference. \nWe are really much more of an amendment body. I think the Senate is at \nits best when bills come to the floor and Senators bring amendments out \nand we start early in the morning and--we don't need to go until \nmidnight; that is not good for families. But we can go until 7 or 8 \no'clock at night.\n  We are about the work of democracy. That is what we are doing. We \nhave votes up or down, and we are all held accountable; we are able to \ncome out here and introduce amendments that speak to the concerns and \ncircumstances, in our view, of the people we represent. That is why I \ncame here.\n  Yesterday, on the floor of the Senate, in response to some of what \nthe majority leader said--I will make sure I do not make the response \npersonal--I said I felt that we have had a pattern here--and Senator \nFeingold has spoken about this--over and over and over again where \nbills are considered and the majority leader and others make it clear \nthat only certain amendments are acceptable--not very many--for debate. \nIf there is no agreement on the minority side, then the majority leader \nfiles cloture and usually doesn't get it. The bill is pulled and no \nlegislation is passed. This has been happening over and over and over \nagain.\n  From my point of view, a point of order challenge for the first time \nin 16 years, or thereabouts, which prevented Senators from introducing \neven sense-of-the-Senate resolutions to appropriations bills--the \nargument that was made was, well, hey, we have to do business and we \nhave to get going. You know what. Every year we have appropriations \nbills--last year and the year before that and the year before that. \nNever before--at least in the last 16 or 17 years--has this been done.\n  My view was that all of this added up to an effort to basically run \nthe Senate like the House of Representatives. That is what I have said, \nand that is what I believe. I have said it many times. I think that is \ndetrimental to the Senate. I think it takes away the vitality that we \nhave and robs us of some of the capacity for debate, for deliberation, \nfor honest differences of opinion, which need to be expressed out here \non the floor of the Senate, and for individual Senators to be able to \nspeak to their priorities.\n  Now, some of my colleagues on the other side may want to talk about \ntax cuts or about this or that and the other. I may want to talk about \nthe poverty of children and the need to have affordable child care and \nthe need to make sure we have food and nutrition programs so children \ndon't go hungry. We all have things about which we care the most. \nNobody is better than anybody else. But do you know what. I want the \nright to be able to do that. What I was trying to say yesterday--and I \nwill say it, given what the majority leader said to several \njournalists--was I actually didn't intend to be silenced.\n  So I will continue to issue challenges and speak out. I think that \nSenator Daschle spoke probably for every single Democrat yesterday. I \nthink it is going to be important for us to move forward, and I hope we \nwill. Sometimes what happens on the floor of the Senate is that people \nspeak with some indignation because that is what they\n\n[[Page S4176]]\n\nfeel, and they may feel very strongly. So the words are uttered in that \nway, and some of the discussion takes place that way. Do you know what? \nI think there comes a time when that is necessary.\n  Frankly, I think it is important that the minority party makes sure \nwe maintain our rights. It is important that the minority maintains its \nvoice. It is important that Senators have opportunities to bring \namendments out here and do their very best to legislate for people back \nhome, to introduce amendments, have debate, to win or to lose, but to \nbe at the work of democracy. I just think that the Senate doesn't do \nthe work of democracy when we basically go through bills that are laid \nout, and then cloture is filed and the bills are pulled, and that is \nabout it. And we really aren't about doing the work I think we ought to \nbe doing. That is my own view.\n  Again, in responding to some of what has been said today, listen, if \nthe majority leader feels that I am the blame for getting this debate \nstarted yesterday, I am proud to accept that. I think we needed to have \nthe debate. But the most important thing is that we all figure out a \nway we can move forward from it.\n  I will tell you that I feel very strongly that we have to get back to \nsome debate out here on the floor of the Senate. We have to get back to \nthe deliberation.\n  I would be interested in the Senator's response, frankly, if he can \nhelp me a moment.\n  To me, the work of democracy is when Senators come out here with \namendments. As I said earlier, we should start early in the morning, go \nto 8 or 9 at night, and have at it. We would have good deliberations \nand good debate, and we would vote amendments up or down. Senators \nwould be able to raise the kinds of questions they want to raise and \nspeak to the kinds of issues they think are so important to the people \nthey represent; we are all accountable. But it is substantive. It is \nreal. It is about issues, and nobody is gagged; nobody is blocked. That \nis the Senate and the vitality of the Senate.\n  I wonder what my colleague thinks about that.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I couldn't agree more.\n  First, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for his discussion of the \nproblems we are having in the Senate, and for that important statement. \nBut I also certainly will not accept his apology for what he did \nyesterday, for what he did was right.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I wasn't trying to apologize.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I understand. What the Senator did was absolutely \nessential. We need to get out here and talk about what is happening.\n  I remember when I first came here. The Senator from Minnesota was \nhere several years before I was--I believe two. But I remember when we \nwere in the majority, Senators on the other side were allowed to freely \namend bills.\n  I learned a great deal from my colleagues, the Senators on the other \nside. When they offered an amendment, I sometimes agreed with them. \nUsually I wouldn't. I learned a great deal about what they were \nthinking, and about what my constituents might think. I, in particular, \ngive credit to the Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm. He is a superb \nSenator in terms of his ability. For us to be deprived because of this \nkind of a process of benefiting from the knowledge and thinking and \nsentiments of our colleagues on the other side is a terrible loss to \nthe Senate. I have not been here that long, but I remember when it used \nto be different that it was better.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will ask my colleague another question. It is \ninteresting that he mentioned Senator Gramm from Texas because I \nremember that several years ago, we were in the majority. We were in \nthe office because I know it was July 21. It was my birthday, and we \nhad the cake and candles. Somebody said: Senator Gramm is out there \nwith an amendment on legal services that you don't agree with. You have \nto go out there and debate him.\n  I didn't know he was going to bring that amendment up. I had to end \nthe birthday party, get the notes, and run down here. There was a 2- or \n3-hour debate on it.\n  But that is what I love about being a Senator. It is not a game. He \nwas serious about what he was doing, and I was serious in opposition.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I find it hard to believe in these few \nyears that the nature of what we do out here has changed this much. I \nwonder if there is any way that the number of Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle, who remember, who valued that, could sort of come together \nand talk about restoring this institution to what it was.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would like to ask the Senator from Wisconsin another \nquestion. This has not been brought up. I think the Senator gave a \nspeech that, as I said, will be memorable for many years to come. This \nis a little bit away from the framework. The Senator can respond in any \nway, of course, that is appropriate from the Senator's point of view.\n  One of the things that I think in part caused me to raise these \nquestions with the majority leader yesterday was that I was little \nworried. Back home, people meet with you, and they believe because of \nthe chance of meeting with you that something positive can happen, that \nit will make a difference in lives, that it will help them.\n  I get worried that if you can't offer amendments and you are shut \nout, you are not able to respond to people.\n  For example, take agriculture and dairy farmers in Wisconsin and in \nMinnesota, much less other farmers. For them, time is not mutual. They \nreally believe when I meet with them that I can do something right now \nabout the abysmally low prices, whether it is the livestock producers, \nor whether it is the corn growers. You meet with people. With what is \ngoing on in farm country with crops, people are in such pain. They \nstill come out to meetings because they still believe you are their \nSenator, and by meeting with you and talking about what is happening to \nthem, somehow since you are their Senator you can do something to help. \nBut I can't do anything to help right now.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Again, Mr. President, looking back over the last \nseveral years, I have worked a great deal on agriculture issues, as \nwell, and I remember these kinds of meetings and being able to honestly \nsay to a group of farmers I didn't know if we were going to be able to \npass a bill. But I could say there was a decent chance to be able to \nbring it up on the floor, either as a bill or as an amendment. Maybe we \nwould win; maybe we would lose.\n\n  It is an odd feeling now to tell a bunch of farmers that we are not \nallowed to offer amendments anymore. They look at you as if you have \nlost your mind. But that is what we have to tell them. We aren't \nallowed anymore in the Senate to bring up ideas and have amendments and \nhave bills because they have to be cleared with the majority leader. We \nhave to show him the amendment first. If he doesn't like it, we can't \noffer it. I try to be candid with people. That is a candid comment. \nThat is truly different from the way things were. And I have served \nboth in the majority and in the minority in the short years that I have \nbeen here.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wonder what the response of the \nSenator from Wisconsin would be. I even found myself saying to people--\nI can think of different meetings, but I will stay with agriculture. I \nwant to talk about some of the other issues where I literally sometimes \nslip into, if you will, I guess, what I call ``Washington language,'' \nand say to people I don't know if there will be a vehicle. People are \nthinking: Wait a minute; we are losing our farms.\n  They do not know what you are talking about. They have no health care \ncoverage, and can't there be more support for child care, teachers talk \nabout what will make a difference in the schools--pick your issue. And \nyou are at a meeting with people, you are moved by people, and you want \nto do something to help.\n  Other Senators might have a very different viewpoint, in which case \nwe can have the debate. I find myself saying I just hope there will be \na vehicle. People do not know what you are talking about. What do you \nmean, there is no vehicle? Don't you have an opportunity as a Senator \nto try to legislate and to be out there representing people and \nfighting for people?\n  That is what I am worried about. That is what yesterday was about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has the floor.\n\n[[Page S4177]]\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I asked the Senator from Wisconsin whether or not he \nhas been in a similar experience. I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota may accept \nquestions when he has the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Minnesota \nwould respond to a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. If he will yield for a question, I suggest to the \nSenator that if I tell a group of my constituents that I cannot find a \nvehicle, they would offer me a ride. They would say: Do your job; here \nis your ride. That is the problem.\n  I ask the Senator if he would agree, if we are forced to talk to our \nconstituents about the minutia of Senate procedure, and if that is the \nkind of conversation we have to have with our dairy farmers in \nWisconsin instead of talking to them about what we should be talking \nabout, the substance of the legislation--let us worry about the Senate \nprocedure--then really the opponents of any kind of change have won \nbecause that is not something they should have to concern themselves \nwith. It is very interesting; great. But that is not what dairy farmers \nin Wisconsin need. They have some great ideas about how to do things \ndifferently, and we should be able to come out here and have an \namendment or a bill.\n\n  In fact, I ask the Senator from Minnesota if he would agree with \nthis. We are not used to getting a lot of votes sometimes. Sometimes we \ndon't get many votes on our amendments. Sometimes there is a little \nlaughter about how Wellstone and Feingold only got 10 or 12 votes. But \nat least we got a chance to get some votes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The Senator should speak for himself.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That is right. I would ask the Senator how he would \nreact to that.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would say to my colleague from Wisconsin that I have \ntwo answers. The first answer is part of what I have been trying to \nsay, which is I am really in a debate with the majority leader. I think \nother Democrats are with me. I hope some Republicans are. It is not a \ndebate for the sake of debate because what I worry about the most is to \ngo back home all the time and to have people meet with you to talk \nabout their lives and have the hope that you as a Senator can make a \ndifference, and you can't make a difference. If there is this effort \nbasically to silence you and if there is this effort basically to block \namendments and block debate, Senator Feingold is right. Sometimes you \nwin; sometimes you lose. But you have to have that opportunity to be \nout here advocating and legislating and fighting for people.\n  That is important to me.\n  Second, this didn't come up in yesterday's debate. I ask my colleague \nin the form of a question, part of what is going on I think is whether \nor not the Senate becomes just a nondecisionmaking body. Whether that \nis good or bad very much depends on one's view about government. If one \nthinks there is no positive role that government or public policy can \nplay in the lives of people and in improving the lives of people, it \nwould not bother Members that Senators cannot introduce amendments and \nthat we don't debate these issues.\n  I ask my colleague whether or not he thinks that is in part what is \ngoing on. If one believes there is nothing the government can or should \ndo to respond to dairy farmers, family farmers, by way of making health \ncare more affordable, or improving educational opportunities for \nchildren, then denying Senators the opportunity to debate and offer \namendments and moving forward is not a problem. If one believes there \nis a role for government to be doing this, I think it is a problem.\n  I ask my colleague whether he thinks there is a philosophical debate.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I suggest that is one way that a person \ncan come to the conclusion that the Senate should operate this way. \nHowever, there are others who would believe that government sometimes \nhas to stop things that are bad that other levels of government or \nperhaps the other body would want done.\n  I ask the Senator if he does not agree that the Senate has a role \nfrom another philosophical point of view; I think it is called the \n``saucer'' that Thomas Jefferson spoke of, the saucer that goes with \nthe cup in order to cool the Senate.\n  Whether this reflects a belief that government does not have a \nfunction, or whether it reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of what \nthe Senate is supposed to be, I wonder if the Senator would react.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague from Wisconsin. I am a political \nscientist and taught American politics classes, but I think the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin is my teacher.\n  I talked about it from the point of view we ought to be about the \nbusiness of legislating and deciding, not about the business of not \ndeciding and not moving forward.\n  I think what my colleague from Wisconsin is saying is, but also, \nSenator Wellstone, the other critical role of the Senate is by \ndefinition, two Senators from every State, regardless of population of \nState. It is not straight majority or majoritarian principles. The \nSenate is there to defend the rights of minorities, sometimes to \nrepresent unpopular causes, and sometimes to make sure that if there is \na rush to pass a piece of legislation which has cataclysmic \nconsequences in people's lives, such as the bankruptcy bill, there is \nan opportunity for Senator or Senators to say: Wait a minute; I insist \nthis not move through. I will be out here fighting, even if it is an \nunpopular cause. I want the public and the country to know. Sometimes \nthere is much to be said for deliberation. Sometimes there is much to \nbe said for the Senate as a deliberative body, and therefore there is \nmuch to be said for a Senator's rights or a group of Senators' rights \nto represent this viewpoint.\n  I thank my colleague from Wisconsin for his comments, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota. This \nwas a useful opportunity to discuss very serious problems in the \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/18/senate-section/article/S4177-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4177-S4178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CRISIS FACING THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE DEATH PENALTY\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the crisis \nfacing our criminal justice system. For the first time since the \nreinstatement of the modern death penalty almost a quarter century ago, \nthere is an increasing recognition, from both death penalty supporters \nand opponents, that the administration of capital punishment in our \ncountry has reached a crisis stage.\n  Our criminal justice system is fraught with errors and the risk that \nan innocent person may be condemned to die. Since 1976, there have been \nover 600 executions in the United States. But during this same period, \n87 people who were sentenced to death were later proven innocent. That \nmeans for every seven persons executed, our criminal justice system has \nfound an innocent person was wrongly condemned to die. The system by \nwhich we impose the sentence of death is rife with errors, inadequate \nlegal representation of defendants and racial disparities. At the same \ntime, Congress, state legislatures and the courts have curtailed \nappellate review of capital convictions.\n  With declining crime rates and a world where our closest allies have \nincreasingly shunned capital punishment, a growing number of \nAmericans--both opponents and supporters of the death penalty--are \nrealizing that something must be done. Indeed, momentum for a \nmoratorium on executions has been building for some time. In 1997, the \nAmerican Bar Association called for a moratorium on executions. \nNumerous city and local governments have followed the ABA's lead by \npassing resolutions urging a moratorium on executions. Governor George \nRyan, a death penalty proponent, has acknowledged that fatal flaws \nexist in the criminal justice system in Illinois and earlier this year \neffectively put a halt to executions in his state while a blue ribbon \npanel reviews his state's criminal justice system. Christian Coalition \nfounder and death penalty supporter, the Reverend Pat Robertson, also \nrecently proclaimed his support for a moratorium.\n  Today, on the heels of this activity, the New Hampshire state \nlegislature earlier today took a historic step that is indicative of \nthe deepening public\n\n[[Page S4178]]\n\nconcern about the accuracy and fairness of the use of the death \npenalty. New Hampshire has had a provision for the death penalty on its \nbooks for almost ten years. Over two months ago, the lower chamber of \nthe New Hampshire legislature passed a bill that would repeal the death \npenalty. Earlier today, the New Hampshire Senate followed the House's \nlead and passed a bill to abolish the death penalty. This marks the \nfirst time since the late 1970's that a state legislature has passed \nlegislation to abolish the death penalty, and I urge Governor Shaheen \nto let the will of the legislature stand. The New Hampshire \nlegislature's action is particularly remarkable because it comes at the \nsame time that the pace of executions has been accelerating in this \ncountry. Last year, we hit an all-time high for executions in any one \nyear since 1976, 98 executions. This year, we are on track to execute \nat least 100 people.\n\n  The action of the New Hampshire legislature and long-time death \npenalty supporters like Governor Ryan and Reverend Pat Robertson \nindicates that our nation is beginning to re-think its longstanding \nsupport for capital punishment. When an auto manufacturer produces a \nvehicle with a bad fuel tank or malfunctioning airbags that risks \ninjury or death to passengers, we push to have that product recalled, \nthoroughly review the problem and don't allow the vehicle back on the \nroad until the problem is solved. Like a defective automobile, it is \ntime for a recall on the death penalty. It is time to suspend \nexecutions nationwide while we review our criminal justice system to \nunderstand why so many innocents have been condemned to death row and \nto ensure that our justice system is a truly just system.\n  A bill I introduced just a few weeks ago does just that. The National \nDeath Penalty moratorium Act would place a moratorium on executions \nnationwide while a national, blue ribbon commission reviews the \nadministration of capital punishment. When Americans, both death \npenalty supporters and opponents, take a moment to consider the flaws \nin our criminal justice system, they can reasonably reach only one \nconclusion: the system is broken and must be fixed. I encourage my \ncolleagues to join me in calling for a nationwide moratorium.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on a motion to proceed on an \nappropriations bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/18/senate-section/article/S4178-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4178-S4179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   BLOCKING CONSIDERATION OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to visit just a little bit, \nmaybe express some frustration about what we are doing here on the \nfloor and mostly what we are not doing here on the floor. It seems to \nme, we, of course, are here for a reason and that is to move bills \nforward. There is not going to be unanimous understanding or agreement \non all these bills, but we have a system. We can have a reasonable \ndebate and vote on them. But the idea that each time we bring up some \nissue that then we are going to bring back again, issues that are \nclearly raised for political purposes only and hold up the progress of \nthis entire body, hour after hour and day after day, that begins to be \na bit trite. It seems to me that is the direction we are taking. Our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle seem to be perfecting this \nprocedure, and we move forward at our own risk, knowing we are going to \nhave a blocking activity going on.\n  Republicans are trying to move forward with some issues for the \nAmerican people that are very important: marriage penalty, tax relief, \nfarm assistance, education, critical needs of the men and women in the \narmed services, and all of the 13 bills we have on appropriations that \nare before us. What we have had and what we are continuing to have is \nSenate Democrats trying to tie up the Senate by changing the subject, \nby attaching irrelevant amendments to every bill that comes to the \nSenate floor.\n  It took five votes before Republicans could break the Democrat \nfilibuster and pass the Ed-Flex bill in 1999. It took five votes in \norder to deal with an issue that said local school boards, local \ngovernments could have more flexibility in what they do with Federal \nmoney. Is that something to hold up? I don't think so.\n  When Republicans offered the lockbox legislation in 1999 to protect \nthe Social Security trust fund, Democrats opposed it six times. Senate \nDemocrats even opposed a measure that passed the House last year by a \nvote of 416-12, when we were talking about taking Social Security money \nand insulating it from expenditures on non-Social Security matters. \nTell me that is a reasonable thing to do.\n  On April 13, Senate Democrats blocked a marriage penalty relief bill \nfrom continuing through the legislative process, a bill that is based \nlargely on fairness. It is based on the notion that a man and woman, \neach working singly, earning a certain amount of money, when married \nearn the same amount of money and pay more taxes. This was a way to \nresolve that. However, Democrats were rejecting a discussion of the \nmarriage penalty tax. In the House, the Democrats joined the \nRepublicans 268-158 to pass relief. President Clinton pledged his \nsupport of the marriage tax penalty relief in his State of the Union. \nBut still they block this because they want to bring up some amendments \nthat are irrelevant to this issue, bring them up totally for political \npurposes. Unfortunately, we find ourselves in a position of being more \ninterested in raising issues than seeking solutions. That is too bad. \nThat is a shame. It is terribly frustrating, frankly.\n  I just came from a meeting. We could not have a hearing this \nafternoon because our friends objected to having a hearing. We had \npeople who came all the way from Alaska to testify. So I can tell you \nwe went ahead and had a meeting and listened to what they had to say. I \ndo not think that is the way we intended for this body to function. We \ndisagree? Of course, we disagree. Different views? Of course, we have \ndifferent views.\n  On May 4, Rollcall recounted that one of our friends on the other \nside promised to work with his colleagues on an education bill if we \ncould do it. Unfortunately, he decided to change in the middle of the \nstream and we did not go forward.\n  Now we have 13 appropriations bills that must be passed. Really, our \ndestination, our purpose, was to pass those before the August recess so \nwe would have that out of the way and could deal with other things that \nare important. By the looks of it, we will not be able to move forward \nin that important area.\n  It is very difficult. We just spent 2 days working on military \nconstruction. I do not think anybody would argue that we need to move \nforward on the military; we need to strengthen the military; we need to \ndo something about strengthening the opportunity for people to belong \nto the military and at least not to be on food stamps. We could do \nthat. But, no, we have to get off on something totally irrelevant, an \nissue--whether it is gun control or whatever--that we have already \ndealt with. It keeps coming up on every issue.\n  I do not argue with the difference of view on it, but to use those \nthings to keep us from moving forward and do the things we ought to be \ndoing is disruptive and is not the intended purpose of what we do here.\n  There are only 65 legislative days remaining for the Senate to finish \nits work. Yet we continue to find obstruction; we continue to find \ndelay.\n\n  Military construction finally got through. We spent all that time \ntalking about something totally irrelevant to it. We had to get off on \nthe thing. Yesterday we did nothing all afternoon, basically. We \nfinally got it passed. I am pleased with that. I, frankly, voted \nagainst it. I voted against it because I did not agree with the \nprocess. I do not have any argument with what was in it.\n  Education had to be pulled, the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct, probably the broadest issue with which we will deal. It touches \nalmost everyone. Almost everyone agrees we need\n\n[[Page S4179]]\n\nto do something with that. Could we finish it? No, we sure couldn't. \nSure, there is a little different view. We wanted to let the local \npeople have more flexibility. Our friends over there wanted the rules \nto come from here. OK, we have a difference. We have a difference in \nphilosophy. I don't argue with that. We have an honest difference. \nLet's vote. But, no, that is not what happened. What we did was have \nintroduced all kinds of irrelevant, nongermane amendments. I don't know \nhow long we can do that.\n  The marriage penalty--I have already mentioned it. That is something \nthat certainly ought to be done. As far as I know, it is agreed to by \nnearly everyone, including the President. It is a fairness issue. We \nought to be doing it.\n  Agriculture, crop insurance, that is one of the things we need to \nstrengthen, since we are moving away from the old farm program. \nAgriculture is out there; farmers are running some risks and crop \ninsurance is part of it. We were not able to do that. Things that were \nnot pertinent were there.\n  The juvenile justice bill, we passed juvenile justice. It is still in \nthe committee. We are trying to get some agreement. It is being held up \nby nongermane kinds of things.\n  I respect fully the difference of view. I respect fully the \ndifferences in philosophy. That is why we are here. That is what \nelections are about. I understand that. But we simply have to find a \nway to put aside this business of stalling, just put aside this \nbusiness of delay, put aside this business of constantly seeking to \nbring to the floor issues that are totally political and have nothing \nto do with the topic we are on and talk about them at the time to talk \nabout them. But talk about them once. Don't talk about them every other \nday. That is what we do. That is wrong. We ought to change it.\n  We have a chance to take a look at where we are and where we want to \ngo. I have thought more recently, I don't know quite why, about the \nconcept that each of us has goals for ourselves, whether they be \npersonal goals, whether they be professional goals, whether they be \nspiritual goals, whether they be family goals, and seek to identify \nthose and then decide what our goal is and what we have to do to reach \nit.\n\n  Frankly, I wish it applied a little more to Government. As we enter \ninto these, we ought to not only be looking at the daily issues with \nwhich we deal, but we should also be looking at, having set goals and \nidentified where we want to be, whether what we are doing now is \ncontributing to the attainment of those goals.\n  It is my view we have not done enough of that. If we have a goal of \naccomplishment in the Senate, a goal of doing the things the people \nsent us here to do, and then find ourselves caught up in business which \ndoes not move toward the attainment of that goal, it is frustrating.\n  I hope we can move forward. I believe we will. I appreciate the \nPresiding Officer's efforts. I look forward to next week to accomplish \nmore than we did this week.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett).

Mr. President, I just finished presiding, and the last 15 \nminutes I presided was a quorum call. It occurred to me there are \nprobably people watching the quorum call who wonder why there was a \nquorum call. Since I had to listen to some of the previous discussion \nthat I don't think gave a full explanation of why there is a quorum \ncall, or why we are not proceeding on the business of this country, I \nfeel compelled to give a brief explanation.\n  In the Senate, we have to get permission to proceed to debate a bill. \nThat is where we are right now. We are trying to get permission to \nproceed to debate an appropriations bill. It is a foreign operations \nappropriations bill. The Democrats have decided, because of a \nprocedural motion on which they lost yesterday, which will have an \neffect on the debate of the Senate for years to come perhaps, that we \nare not going to debate anything for a while.\n  Let me explain a little more about what that is. What we are having \nis a filibuster. It is being done rather silently, and sometimes in a \nwhining way. We are having a filibuster over whether we are going to \ndebate any of the appropriations bills. What you heard earlier was them \nsaying that if we can't debate extraneous, nongermane items on any one \nof the appropriations bills, we are going to see that the business of \nthis country does not go forward. I want to tell you, I think that is \nwrong and I think the American people need to know about it.\n  We can do a lot of finger-pointing over why things aren't happening \naround here, and that isn't going to get anything done except allow the \nvoters in November to make a decision. But the voters need to know what \nit is that is happening. We are talking about whether a Senator ought \nto be able to run down here to the floor on any measure that comes up \nunder appropriations--we have 13 appropriations bills to pass, and it \nusually takes a week to pass each one, and we have about 13 weeks left \nof the session this year. We are debating now whether or not you can \ncome down here and just stick in any amendment you want, on any issue \nyou want, and call it ``deliberative debate.''\n\n  You can't have an appropriations amendment that legislates. Nobody \nquestions that. That has been determined. We have a Senate rule that \nsays you can't legislate on an appropriations bill. But there is a \nloophole there. It isn't clear whether you can pontificate on an \nappropriations bill, whether you can't stick in something that is your \npet project and talk ad infinitum on it. That is what this is about. \nThat is what the silence is about. That is what the inability to go \nforward is about. It is about whether we ought to be able to \npontificate on anything we want to, whether or not it is relevant to \nthe item that is up.\n  Why is that important? I guess it is because this Chamber has \ntelevision in it now and what we say can be carried to people all \nacross this country. It is cheaper than buying a campaign ad. But it \ndoesn't make it right.\n  You can't legislate on an appropriations bill, so should you be able \nto do a sense of the Senate? I say you should not be able to. We should \nbe at the business of taking the appropriations bills we have and \ndeciding on each and every issue that is in that appropriations bill to \nsee if it is the right thing to do. If it is some other issue we want \nto debate, we should not get to do it then. When we finish up the 13 \nappropriations bills, we can go back to the regular legislation of this \nbody. On those, there is no requirement on what can be added to them. \nYou can debate and put in an amendment whether it has anything to do \nwith the bill or not. My personal opinion is that you should not be \nable to do that either. We would get more business done. But there \nisn't a rule that keeps you from doing nongermane amendments on the \nregular legislative business; it is only on the appropriations.\n  Why would we do that? Why would there be requirements on what can be \ndebated when we are talking about appropriations? Well, the bill on \nwhich we are trying to get permission to debate right now is one of the \nsmaller ones. A lot of people probably don't think it is very important \nto this country. In fact, if this bill didn't pass, a lot of people in \nWyoming would probably be overjoyed. But it is our business to make \nsure we deliberate and pass this bill before October 1. What bill is \nit? The permission that has been requested is to debate the foreign \noperations appropriations bill.\n  Earlier, a couple of my colleagues mentioned that if people come to \nsee them in their office and they want to talk about the dairy \nbusiness, they expect them to be able to come over here to the floor \nand solve their problem. Well, I want to tell you, that isn't how it \nhappens. You can't talk to somebody in your office, leave your office, \ncome over here, and solve their problem. There are days I wish it were \nthat easy and that fast. But it is designed not to be that easy and \nthat fast. You really have to be able to put it with something that \nwill convince enough Senators it is a good idea that you can do it.\n\n[[Page S4180]]\n\n  If we happen to be debating a bill that has that dairy problem in it \nand the funding allocated for it, you can make a difference at that \npoint in time. That is what we are talking about--how to spend the \nmoney of this country. As I said, this is a very small bill. This is a \n$13 billion bill--$13 billion that we are going to spend partly in the \nUnited States and partly around the world. It has some interesting \nprovisions in it that are probably worthy of debate--funds for \nuniversity development assistance programs across the United States. On \npage 23, they go into a whole bunch of countries that we help. In the \nreport on the bill on page 34, we talk about physician exchanges, so we \ncan have better health around the world. We have vitamins for at-risk \nwomen. On page 35, we have violence against women. One of the items \nthat will undoubtedly be debated at some length in this bill is whether \nthere ought to be some bilateral economic assistance to Colombia for \nnarcotics control and law enforcement. But we are not going to get to \ndebate those because perhaps we ought to be able to debate a sense of \nthe Senate on this bill that has nothing to do with it. Patients' Bill \nof Rights is very important.\n  I am one of the people on the Senate team negotiating between the \nRepublicans and Democrats in the House and Senate for a Patients' Bill \nof Rights. We passed that bill. It is an important bill. We are trying \nto get resolution on that bill.\n  As a Senator, if we don't have the rule about how peripheral and how \nnongermane you can get, I could offer an amendment that says I have \nthis sense of the Senate that everyone will agree with me on, and I \nwould like that Patients' Bill of Rights finished by next week. It \nisn't going to happen because there are too many details that need to \nbe worked out.\n  I would have had the right day before yesterday to do that. That is \nwhat we are talking about. I could have demanded debate time.\n  It is very difficult to bring debate to a close in this body. As you \nsaw with the gun amendment which was a sense of the Senate, it was a \nnonbinding sort of thing that said they wanted the juvenile justice \nbill resolved between the House and the Senate, and they wanted it done \nby May 24, sometime next week. And it had to be done.\n  Well, it isn't going to be done. It can't be done. They demanded 12 \nhours of debate on that issue--12 hours of debate holding up the \nSenate. That issue is important to a lot of Members. We already debated \nit and sent it to the conference committee. It is being resolved in the \nconference committee.\n  Does it deserve another 12 hours of debate when we are on \nappropriations? The appropriations bill that we are trying to get done \nnow is on foreign ops. The one we finished when that came up was \nmilitary construction, building the things that our military needs at \nhome and abroad to do the right job for our national security.\n\n  Deliberation is different than publicizing.\n  These desks down here on the floor were built two per State as the \nStates came into the Nation. They are the same desks that all of the \nSenators have used through the years. If you have an opportunity to be \non the floor, you can take out the bottom drawer of these desks. \nSenators, as they were leaving this deliberative body, carved their \nnames in that drawer as a tradition. Those are now preserved in \nPlexiglass. That is taken out, and Members can add their names as they \nleave.\n  There is a list in each desk that shows each and every Senator who \nsat at that desk in the history of the United States. It is fascinating \nto come down here at night and sit at these desks, look at those lists, \nand see the names of Senator after Senator whom you have read about in \nyour history book who has been here and debated. You can read about \nsome of the great debates they gave.\n  For a long time there was not even a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. \nWe didn't have this pontificating, saying I really think we will feel \nbetter if we debate and do a sense of the Senate on this nongermane \nissue. But if you sit here at night and read those names, it is like a \nwalk through history. It is also an opportunity for you to get the \nfeeling that they are still in this Chamber debating whether we are \ndoing the job that we ought to be doing.\n  In my opinion, the job that we ought to be doing is getting the \nappropriations bills of this country done as fast as we possibly can, \nas deliberately as we possibly can, as carefully as we possibly can but \ngetting it done and sticking to the issue of what is in that \nappropriations bill, or what we think ought to be in that \nappropriations bill, or what we think ought to be disappearing from \nthat appropriations bill.\n  Those are the amendments that we ought to be debating, turning in, \nand turning over. Those are the ones that we ought to be giving grand \nconsideration to in the style that used to in this Chamber--not \nbringing in peripheral amendments and saying I think I can delay this \nwhole bill so that the President can negotiate it when the new year \nbegins.\n  It is even possible to delay the whole thing by doing genuine \namendments to a genuine bill. It is important for Senators to be able \nto express themselves on all issues. I daresay if you watch television \nevenings and weekends you can see Senators debating absolutely every \nissue. You can't see them making progress on every issue. That is a \nvery prized thing and very difficult to do around here.\n  I have to tell you that a sense-of-the-Senate amendment doesn't do \nthat. A sense of the Senate delays the actual amendments that change \nappropriations.\n  I suspect that if we don't get some agreement to proceed on this \nbill, we will check and see if there are other appropriations bills \nthey believe are maybe important enough that we ought to be getting on \nwith the business of and debating. We have 13 of them.\n  I think another one that has now cleared the committee is \nagriculture. I have to tell you that I think the farmers across this \ncountry are going to be pretty livid if this appropriations bill is \nbeing held up because somebody has a sense of the Senate where they \nkind of want to see if all of the Senators kind of feel good about \nsomething that doesn't have to do with agriculture. They ought to be \nlivid about it.\n\n  I know when I go home, they say: How come you guys put other \nnonrelated stuff in bills you are talking about? How come some of those \nget in there? They really want the stuff to be germane to the bill that \nwe are working on and they want it debated. They want it debated in a \ntimely fashion. They think we ought to be getting on with the business.\n  We can finish appropriations. We can talk about other bills. We \ntalked about a lot of them. They just need to be resolved. But we can \ntalk about those other bills. On the other bills of the Senate, you can \nstill add anything you want, including a sense-of-the-Senate amendment, \nor including a motion, or legislation that has nothing to do with \nanything.\n  The debate should be moving on. The debate should not be held up over \nwhether we can do feel-good motions on appropriations. The debate \nshould center around whether an appropriations bill is justified or not \njustified, whether we ought to spend the money or we ought not to spend \nthe money, whether the program is good or whether the program is bad.\n  That is the appropriations process. We have plenty of it to do as we \nspend close to $2 trillion in this United States.\n  For those of you who have family budgets and scrimp and save and \nworry and force that into your capability to buy things, you can \nrecognize how important it would be for us even on something as small \nas $13 billion to get started on the debate, to look at the items that \nare included to decide whether or not they are justified and make a \ndecision and move forward so that we can get to the bigger bills that \namount to billions more dollars than this one. This should be a bill \nthat is done in about 1 day. But it isn't going to be 1 day. It isn't \neven going to be started in 1 day. I suspect we may not be started on \nit next weekend, unless the American people get upset with the way \ntheir Government is being run. I am sure they will express their \nopinion that we ought to be debating every dollar that is involved, and \nwhen the debate on the dollars is over, get to the other business of \npassing laws in this country.\n  I thank the President. I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S4181]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/18/senate-section/article/S4181-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4181-S4184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS IN HAITI\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, as we prepare to begin the debate \nconcerning the provisions within the fiscal year 2001 foreign ops \nappropriations bill, I would like to call my colleagues' attention to \nan event scheduled to take place this Sunday, May 21, referring to the \nparliamentary elections of Haiti.\n  The openness, the fairness, the transparency of these elections that \nwill be held on Sunday are critical to Haiti, and really place the \ncountry and its people at a crossroads. These are the elections that \nhave been postponed, postponed, postponed, and postponed. Finally, it \nappears as if they will actually take place this Sunday.\n\n  The world is watching to see how Haiti conducts these elections. The \ninternational community and the United States will be judging Haiti \nbased on these elections. I think it is a fair statement to say that \nfuture assistance, future aid from the international community, from \nthe private sector, private organizations, as well as governments, as \nwell as the United States, will depend certainly to some extent on how \nthese elections are conducted. Not how they turn out but how they are \nconducted. The world will be looking on Sunday to see the amount of \nviolence connected with these elections; to see whether or not the \nelections are fair, transparent, and open; to see what kind of \nparticipation takes place among Haitian people.\n  We have every right to be concerned about these elections. We have a \nright to be concerned because of the investment the United States has \nmade in Haiti, which I will discuss in a moment. We have a right to be \nconcerned because these elections have been postponed, postponed, and \npostponed. We have a right to be concerned because we want to see \nwhether or not this fledgling democracy is, in fact, making progress.\n  So, yes, the world will be watching. We are concerned, quite \ncandidly, about these elections because of the action and because of \nthe inaction of Haiti's political elite, its upper class, what they \nhave not done and what they have done during the past 5 years.\n  We all had high expectations for Haiti when the United States sent \n20,000 U.S. troops to that island in 1995 to restore President Aristide \nto power. At that time, we understood it would take time for Haiti to \nbecome politically stable. We understood it would take time to \nestablish a free and open market system in that country. We understood \nit would take time to invoke the rule of law and privatization of \ngovernment-run-and-owned industries. And we understood it would take a \nwhile to establish a fair and impartial and functioning judicial \nsystem.\n  Quite tragically, time has passed and very little, if anything, has \nchanged. The phrase ``Haitian Government'' is an oxymoron, given \nPresident Preval has been ruling by decree without a democratically \nelected Parliament since January 1999. Political intimidation is \nrampant, with violence and killings increasing as the elections \napproach. Furthermore, the Haitian economy is, at best, stagnant. Haiti \nremains the poorest nation by far in our entire hemisphere, with a per \ncapita income estimated at $330 per year per person, where 70 percent \nof the people are either without jobs or certainly underemployed.\n  When we deal with Haiti, the statistics don't matter. We are not even \nsure how reliable they are. Anyone who has visited Haiti--and I have \nhad occasion to visit Haiti nine different times in the last 5\\1/2\\ \nyears--sees where that economy is and sees the years of wrenching, \nunbelievable poverty in Haiti, a country that is just a short trip from \nMiami.\n  Absent a stable and democratic government, Haiti has no hope of \nachieving real and lasting economic nor political nor judicial reforms. \nThat is why Haiti is finding itself stuck in a vicious cycle of \ndespair. It is a cycle in which political stalemate threatens the \ngovernment and judicial reforms, which, in turn, discourages investment \nand privatization.\n  Caught in this cycle, the economy stands to shrink further and \nfurther until there is no economic investment to speak of at all. With \nno viable law enforcement institutions in place, and given the island's \nweak political and economic situation, drug traffickers operate with \nimpunity.\n\n  I have talked about this on this floor on several different occasions \nin the last few years. I predicted several years ago that we would see \nthe amount of drug transportation in Haiti, the amount of drugs flowing \nthrough that country, go up and up and our own Government has estimated \ntoday that prediction has, tragically, come true. Our Government \nestimates Haiti accounts for 14 percent of all cocaine entering the \nUnited States today. Haiti is now the major drug transshipment country \nin the entire Caribbean. We estimate 75 tons of cocaine moved through \nHaiti in 1999. That represents a 24-percent increase over the previous \nyear.\n  Quite frankly, Haiti has become a great human tragedy. While the \ndecade of the 1980s witnessed unbelievable changes in Central America, \nwith countries moving from totalitarian regimes to democracies, that \nwas the great success story of the 1980s. Many of us hoped in the \n1990s, and into the next century, we would see that same progress made \nin Haiti. Tragically, that has not taken place. Haiti now stands as a \nmissed opportunity for reform, a missed opportunity for progress, for \ngrowth, and for development. The true casualties, the real victims of \nall the turmoil and instability are the children. They are the victims \nbecause the small band of political elite in Haiti has not moved \nforward and taken seriously the need for reform. They have missed their \nopportunity.\n  The economy is worse, human rights are being violated, and there is \nvery little optimism today in Haiti. These dire conditions are every \nday killing children. Haiti's infant mortality rate is approximately 15 \ntimes that of the United States. Because Haiti lacks the means to \nproduce enough food to feed its population, the children who are born \nsuffer from malnutrition, malnourishment. They rely heavily on \nhumanitarian food aid. Additionally, because of the lack of clean water \nand sanitation, only 39 percent of the population has access to clean \nwater. It is estimated only 26 percent have access to sanitation. \nDiseases such as measles and tuberculosis are epidemic.\n  Given this human tragedy, we can't turn our backs on these children \nas mad as we may get at the political leaders of that country, as \nfrustrated as we may become with the political leaders of that country. \nHaiti is part of our hemisphere, and what happens in our hemisphere, \nwhat happens in our own backyard, is very much our concern. If we \nignore the situation, we risk another massive refugee exodus for our \nshores, and drug trafficking through Haiti will continue to increase \nand increase and increase.\n  We must seek ways to foster democracy building in Haiti and promote \nfree markets in the rule of law. We also must fight drug trafficking \nthrough Haiti and expand agricultural assistance through \nnongovernmental organizations. Let me say there are good nongovernment \norganizations that are in Haiti working to make a difference in spite \nof the Haitian Government. I must also say I have personally seen and \nvisited a number of Americans in church groups who are down in Haiti \nrisking their lives, making a difference every day to save the lives of \nchildren.\n\n  Finally, most important, I believe we must ensure that humanitarian \nand food assistance continues to reach the Haitian people, especially \nthe children. We cannot just sit back and let the political elite in \nHaiti starve these orphan children as well as the elderly and the \ndestitute.\n  Ultimately, though, Haiti will not really progress until its \npolitical leaders and the elite of the country take responsibility for \nthe situation and commit to turning things around. The tragedy of the \nlast 5 years is that the elite in Haiti has not made a decision that it \nis in their interests and in the interests of their country to change \nthings. Until the elite of Haiti decides to make these changes, it is \ngoing to be very difficult, no matter what we do, to have any \nsignificant progress made in that very poor country.\n  Haiti can succeed as a democracy if, and only if, the elite has the \nresolve to hold open elections, create free markets, reduce corruption, \nimprove its judicial system, respect human rights,\n\n[[Page S4182]]\n\nand learn how to sustain an agricultural system that can feed its \npeople. Nothing the United States does with regard to Haiti can provide \nlong-term permanent solutions unless and until the Haitians take \ndemocratic and societal reforms seriously and work in earnest to create \na stable political system in a free and democratic market economy. That \nis why the world is watching to see how these elections are conducted \nthis Sunday.\n  Let me turn to another portion of the foreign operations \nappropriations bill. There is language, as I have just talked about, in \nregard to Haiti in this bill. I wanted to speak about Haiti this \nevening on the Senate floor because of that language in the bill but \nalso because of the upcoming elections.\n  There is another provision in the foreign operations appropriations \nbill we hope we will be taking up shortly. This provision has to do \nwith our neighbor to the south, Colombia.\n  Let me first commend the chairman and ranking member on the \nsubcommittee, Senator McConnell and Senator Leahy, and also the \nchairman and ranking member of the full committee, Senator Stevens and \nSenator Byrd, for working with me, for working with Senator Coverdell, \nSenator Grassley, Senator Graham of Florida, and so many others on the \nColombia/Andean emergency antidrug assistance package which is now part \nof this bill.\n  This assistance to Colombia would provide approximately $934 million \nto support Colombian efforts to eliminate drugs at the source, to \nimprove human rights programs, to improve rule of law programs, and to \nincrease economic development--$934 million is what is contained in \nthis bill. Passage of this assistance package is crucial to helping \nkeep drugs off our streets here at home and to bring stability to our \nhemisphere.\n  No one questions there is a real emergency that currently exist in \nColombia. Colombia is a democratic success story that is now in crisis. \nThanks largely to the growing profits from illicit drug trafficking, \nColombia is embroiled in a destabilizing and brutal civil war, a civil \nwar that has gone on for decades with a death toll that continues to \nrise and that we estimate is at least 35,000 people. We have seen and \ncontinue to see the tragedy of Colombia unfold in our newspapers; we \nsee the violence that is occurring there. Members of the army, members \nof the police are killed on a daily basis at an unbelievably alarming \nrate.\n\n  Just this week we saw a graphic, horrible picture in our newspapers \nof a bomb necklacing, where one of the terrorist groups, one of the \nguerrilla groups, placed a bomb around a woman's neck, asked her family \nfor money, locked the bomb so it could not be removed, and told the \nfamily the bomb would go off at 3 in the afternoon. The bomb squad came \nin, the army. For 8 hours they tried to get the bomb off. Tragically, \nthe bomb went off. The bomb killed the woman and killed the young man \nwho was working to try to free her. That is just a graphic example of \nwhat is occurring, in one form or the another, in Colombia every single \nday.\n  Many of us on the floor were in Congress in the 1980s when we worked \nso hard to give assistance to the countries in this hemisphere, \nparticularly in Central America, to drive communism out to allow these \ncountries to become democratic. The 1980s are a true success story for \nthis hemisphere. We paid a very heavy price, but I think most of us \nbelieve that was a price worth paying. We brought democracy, we brought \nopportunity to our hemisphere.\n  Today the drug trade has emerged as the dominant threat to peace and \nfreedom in the Americas. Communism was the threat in the 1980s. Today \nthe drug trade is the threat. It threatens the sovereignty of the \nColombian democracy and the continued prosperity and security of our \nhemisphere.\n  We have devoted a good portion of this week to discussing the threat \nthat is involved in the whole situation in the Balkans, specifically in \nregard to Kosovo. I think we should have; it is very important. But I \nbelieve what we are seeing right here in our own hemisphere, what is \nhappening in Colombia, is certainly equally important and maybe more \nimportant than what is going on in the Balkans.\n  Tragically, it is America's own drug habit that is fueling this \nthreat in our hemisphere. It is our own drug habit that is causing the \ninstability and violence in Colombia and in the region. Let's just look \nat what is happening in my own home State of Ohio, in Cincinnati, OH. \nIn 1990, there were 19 heroin-related arrests in Cincinnati--1990, 19 \nheroin-related arrests. Last year, there were 464 arrests. Law \nenforcement officers in Cincinnati understand the reason for this \nsurge. Colombia produces low-cost, high-purity heroin, making it more \nand more the drug of choice. And because of our Government's inadequate \nemphasis on drug interdiction and eradication efforts, that Colombian \nheroin is making its way across our borders and in my case, to the \nState of Ohio.\n  We may say, sure, Cincinnati is just one urban area, one metropolitan \narea. But if there is a heroin problem in Cincinnati, you can bet there \nis a heroin problem in New York City and Chicago and Los Angeles and \nthroughout our country. The fact is that drugs from Colombia are cheap \nand plentiful in this country, so our children across America are using \nthem. In fact, more children today are using and experimenting with \ndrugs than 10 years ago--many more than did 10 years ago. The facts and \nstatistics are startling. According to the 1999 Monitoring the Future \nStudy, since 1992 overall drug use among tenth graders has increased 55 \npercent, heroin use among tenth graders has increased 92 percent, and \ncocaine use among tenth graders has increased 133 percent.\n  The ability of our law enforcement officers to succeed in keeping \ndrugs off our streets and away from our children is clearly, directly \nlinked to our ability to keep drugs produced in places such as Colombia \nfrom ever reaching our shores. To be effective, our drug control \nstrategy needs to be a coordinated effort that directs and balances \nresources and support among three key areas: Domestic law enforcement, \ninternational eradication and interdiction efforts, and demand \nreduction. This means we must balance the allocation of resources \ntowards efforts to stop those who produce drugs, those who transport \nillegal drugs into this country, and those who deal drugs on our \nstreets and in our schools.\n  The sad fact is, the cultivation of coca in Colombia has skyrocketed, \ndoubling from over 126,000 acres in 1995 to 300,000 in 1999. Poppy \ncultivation has grown to such an extent that it is now the source of \nthe majority of heroin consumed in the United States. Not surprisingly, \nas drug availability has increased in the United States, drug use among \nadolescents also has increased.\n  To make matters worse, these Colombian insurgents see the drug \ntraffic as a financial partner to sustain their illicit cause, only \nmaking the FARC and ELN grow stronger. The sale of drugs today not only \nfuels the drug business, but also the antidemocratic insurgents in \nColombia.\n  Why does Colombia matter? It matters to us, first of all, because of \nwhat I just talked about, and that is the drugs Colombia ships into the \nUnited States.\n  Why else does it matter? The drug trade in Colombia is a source of \nrampant lawlessness and violence in Colombia. It has destabilized that \ncountry and stands to threaten the entire Andean region. Fortunately, \nin the last few years, Congress has had the foresight to recognize the \nescalating threats, and we have taken the lead to restore our drug-\nfighting capability beyond our borders off our shores.\n  Many of my colleagues who have worked so hard on this Colombia \nassistance package also worked with me just a few short years ago to \npass the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act, a $2.7 billion, 3-\nyear authorization initiative aimed at restoring international \neradication, interdiction, and crop alternative development funding.\n  With this law, we already have made an $800 million downpayment. We \nhave appropriated and spent $800 million, $200 million of which \nrepresented the first substantial investment in Colombia to \ncounternarcotics activities.\n  I stress to my colleagues that the emergency assistance package \nbefore us is based on a blueprint that Senator Coverdell and I \ndeveloped and introduced last October, 3 months before the \nadministration unveiled its proposal.\n  Like our plan, the emergency assistance package before us this \nevening goes beyond counternarcotics assistance and crop alternative \ndevelopment\n\n[[Page S4183]]\n\nprograms in Colombia. This plan targets Latin American countries, \nincluding Bolivia, Peru, Panama, and Ecuador.\n  This is a regional approach, and a regional approach is crucial. Peru \nand Bolivia have made enormous progress to reduce drug cultivation in \ntheir countries, and they have done it with our assistance. What has \ntaken place in those two countries has been a success story.\n  An emphasis only on the Colombian drug problems risks the spillover \neffect of Colombia's drug trade shifting to other countries in the \nregion. That is why resources are needed and provided in this bill for \ncountries such as Bolivia, Panama, Ecuador, and Peru.\n  I also note the positive contributions to our antidrug activities \nmade by the chairman and ranking member, Senator Burns and Senator \nMurray, of the Military Construction Subcommittee. We passed today the \nmilitary construction bill which includes investments in equipment and \nsupport activities as part of our Colombia-Andean region antidrug \nstrategy.\n  That bill also includes funding for the Coast Guard to provide \nsupplies, reduce the maintenance backlog, and for pay and benefits for \nCoast Guard personnel.\n  Funding in that bill also was provided for six C-130J aircraft, which \ngive critical support to our counternarcotics efforts.\n  That bill also contains funding for forward operating locations which \nwill provide the logistic support needed for our aircraft to conduct \ndetection and monitoring flights over the source countries. The closure \nof Howard Air Force Base in Panama, as part of the Panama Canal \ntransfer treaty, severely diminished this capability. That is why we \nneed these forward operating locations, and that is why the money \nprovided in this bill is so important.\n\n  As I stated a moment ago, a balanced approach is critical to the \nsuccess of our counterdrug policy. We must continue to invest resources \nin our law enforcement agencies--Coast Guard, Customs, and the Drug \nEnforcement Agency. They are our front line of defense against drugs \ncoming into the United States. They also work with law enforcement \nagencies of other countries to eradicate and interdict drugs. These \nagencies need additional resources to ensure the increase in illicit \ndrug production in Colombia does not result in a corresponding increase \nin drugs on the streets and in the schools of our country.\n  Addressing the crisis in Colombia is timely and necessary. It is in \nthe national security interest of Colombia and the United States to \nwork together and with our other partners in the hemisphere to curb the \ncorroding effects of illicit drug trafficking. The bottom line is that \nan investment in the Andean region to help stop the drug trade and \npreserve democracy is a direct investment in the peaceful future of our \nentire hemisphere. It is in our national interest.\n  I know there are some of my colleagues on this side of the aisle who \nhave expressed some hesitancy and reluctance about the provision in \nthis bill concerning Colombia. I want to take a moment to direct my \ncomments specifically to them.\n  The Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act that Congress passed \nseveral years ago was an attempt to change the direction of our drug \npolicy. What do I mean? I consistently said during this speech and \nother speeches on the floor that we need a balanced drug policy. We \nhave to have treatment, education, domestic law enforcement, and we \nhave to have international law enforcement and interdiction. We have to \ndo all these things. We have to have a balanced approach.\n  We found 3 years ago when we looked at what had happened in our \nantidrug effort over the last decade that beginning with the Clinton \nadministration, that administration began to reduce the percentage of \nthe money we were spending on international drug interdiction.\n  When George Bush left the White House, we were spending approximately \none-third of our total Federal antidrug budget on international drug \ninterdiction, basically on stopping drugs from ever getting inside the \nUnited States--spending it either on law enforcement in other \ncountries, on Customs, on DEA, on crop eradication, stopping drugs from \never reaching our shores. That was about one-third of our budget. That \nis what we were spending when George Bush left the White House.\n  As of 2 years ago, after 6 years of the Clinton administration, that \none-third has been reduced to approximately 8 to 10 percent, a dramatic \nreduction in the amount of money we were spending on international drug \ninterdiction.\n  Some of us in this body--Senator Coverdell, myself, and others--\ndecided we had to change that, so we introduced the Western Hemisphere \nDrug Elimination Act. A corresponding bill was introduced in the House \nof Representatives. Then Congressman Hastert, now Speaker Hastert, \nplayed a major role in working on that bill, as did others.\n  The bottom line is, we passed the bill, it became law, and we have \nbegun to change that direction. The initiative for that came from this \nside of the aisle. We saw what the administration was doing. We said \nthe policy has to change; we need to put more money into interdiction, \nand we need to begin to do that. We did do that.\n  Fast forward a couple more years as the crisis in Colombia continued \nto get worse and worse. Again, Senator Coverdell, Senator Grassley, \nmyself, and others put together a new package. It was a package aimed \nspecifically at dealing with the crisis in Colombia. We introduced that \npackage last October. After we introduced that package, a few months \nlater the administration finally came forward and said: Yes, we have to \ndo something about Colombia. But it was our initiative that started it.\n  It brings us now to where we are today. The initiative that Senator \nCoverdell, Senator Grassley, and others introduced has now been wrapped \ninto this bill. The good news is that the administration is on board.\n\n  The administration also came forward with a proposal to deal with \nColombia and has stated their understanding of the severity of this \nproblem. So that is where we are today.\n  I ask my colleagues to look at the big picture and to think about \nwhat is in the best interests of the United States. This package is not \nput together for Colombia. It is not put together for the Colombians. \nIt is put together for us. It is put together because Colombia is our \nneighbor, and what happens to our neighbor, in our neighbor's country, \naffects us.\n  Why? Trade. Colombia is a major trading partner of the United States. \nWhat happens in that country affects our trade. The drugs that come \ninto this country, as I have already demonstrated in this speech, come \nfrom Colombia to a great extent. The drugs that are killing our young \npeople come from Colombia.\n  So we have a very real interest in stabilizing that country, keeping \nthat country democratic, keeping that country a trading partner of the \nUnited States, and to help that democratically elected government in \nColombia help themselves to beat back the drug dealers, to beat back \nthe guerrillas.\n  They face a crisis that is different than any crisis that any other \ncountry has probably ever faced. Many countries have faced guerrilla \nmovements throughout history. But I do not know any other country that \never faced a guerrilla movement that was fueled with so much money. \nThere is this synergistic relationship now that has been created \nbetween the drug dealers and the guerrillas. Each one benefits the \nother. Each one takes care of the other. The end result is that the \nguerrillas are emboldened and enriched by the drug dealers' money. So \nit is a crisis that Colombia faces, but it is a crisis that directly \nimpacts the United States.\n  I ask my colleagues to remember how we got here, to remember what \nrole this side of the aisle played in trying to deal with the Colombia \nproblem and deal with the problem in Central America, South America, \nwhat role we played in trying to increase the money that we are \nspending and resources we are spending on stopping drugs from coming \ninto this country.\n  If we recall that history, and recall what the situation is in \nColombia today, we will be persuaded that this is the right thing to do \nand that this provision in this bill that deals with an aid package for \nthe Colombia-Andean region is clearly in the best interests of\n\n[[Page S4184]]\n\nthe United States and is something that we have to do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions).

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate my good friend, \nRhesa Hawkins Barksdale. Last month marked the tenth anniversary of \nJudge Barksdale's investiture as a United States Circuit Judge for the \nFifth Circuit. On April 1, 1990, Judge Barksdale was sworn into office \nby Justice Byron White, for whom Judge Barksdale clerked following his \ngraduation from the University of Mississippi School of Law. Throughout \nthe past ten years Judge Barksdale has faithfully fulfilled his sworn \nduty to enforce the Constitution and laws of the United States. \nNeedless to say, his service to the Fifth Circuit has brought \ndistinction to his family, our State, and the Nation.\n  I might add that this country is indebted to Judge Barksdale for more \nthan his zealous commitment to justice. His service as a Circuit Judge \ncontinues a lifetime of dedication and sacrifice to protect the \nfreedoms and liberties of all Americans, as exemplified by his valiant \nand decorated service to his country during the Vietnam War. Judge \nBarksdale served in combat in Vietnam as an officer in the United \nStates Army, and he was awarded a number of medals, including the \nSilver Star, Purple Heart, Bronze Star for Valor, and Bronze Star for \nMeritorious Service.\n  Mr. President, Mississippians and Americans are grateful for Judge \nBarksdale's public service, and I congratulate and honor him on the \ntenth anniversary of his service on the bench.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/18/senate-section/article/S4184-3", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    READING THE NAMES OF GUN VICTIMS\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the \nColumbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on \nsensible gun legislation.\n  Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. \nUntil we act, Democrats in the Senate will read some of the names of \nthose who lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we \nwill continue to do so every day that the Senate is session.\n  These names come from a report prepared by the United States \nConference of Mayors. The report includes data from 100 U.S. cities \nbetween April 20, 1999 and March 20, 2000. The 100 cities covered range \nin size from Chicago, Illinois, which has a population of more than 2.7 \nmillion to Bedford Heights, Ohio with a population of about 11,800. But \nthe list does not include gun deaths from some major cities like New \nYork and Los Angeles.\n  The following are the names of some of the people who were killed by \ngunfire one year ago today--on May 18th, 1999: Gregory Babb, 24, \nPhiladelphia, PA; Clifford Clark, 54, Detroit, MI; James Courtney, 20, \nProvidence, RI; Julius Ford, 32, San Antonio, TX; Derrick Hall, 24, \nChicago, IL; Jason Horsley, 25, Denver, CO; Keith Mitchell, 21, \nDetroit, MI; Laredo Schetop, 48, Dallas, TX; Jamaar Wynn, 15, \nNashville, TN.\n\n  In the name of those who died, we will continue the fight to pass gun \nsafety measures.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/18/senate-section/article/S4184-4", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4184-S4185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE MILLION MOM MARCH\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on Mother's Day 2000, half a million \nmothers and others marched on Washington to demonstrate their fury at \nthe number of children killed by gun violence last year. Their goal: to \nconvince Congress to pass even more laws restricting citizen access to \nhandguns. All in all, it was quite a spectacle. But while it reflects \nthe modern American view that every ill can be remedied through the \npower of law, it seems to me the real--and only--question to be \nanswered is will more laws actually produce the result we all seek?\n  Before we can answer that question, Mr. President, we must examine \nthis one: is the recent spate of gun violence involving children the \nresult of rising levels of crime and escalating gun ownership, or \nsomething else?\n  Let's look at the facts:\n  During the 1060s, 1970s, and 1980s, gun violence increased \ndramatically. During the 1990s, however, the numbers actually began to \ndecline, with school violence of the type exhibited at Columbine \nfalling precipitously to the point where kids today are probably the \nsafest they've been in decades.\n  In 1996 (the last year for which statistics are available), 1,134 \nAmericans died in accidental shootings--the lowest level ever recorded. \nOnly 42 were under the age of 10. Yet more than 2,400 10-year-olds died \nthat year in motor vehicle accidents, another 800 were drowned, and \nwell over 700 died from fire. As for the danger of guns in homes, only \nabout 30 people each year are accidently killed by homeowners who \nbelieve they are shooting an intruder, as opposed to 330 who are \naccidentally killed by police.\n  So why are the numbers declining? While there could be lots of \nreasons--tougher judges, stiffer penalties, and little mercy for repeat \noffenders--it's also interesting to note that the decline in murder and \nviolent crime has paralleled an increase in gun ownership.\n  Mr. President, today about 80 millions Americans, or 40 percent of \nthe population, own almost 250 million firearms, as compared with about \n27 percent in 1988. And in states like Texas where citizens are allowed \nto carry concealed weapons, the number of murders, assaults, and \nburglaries has dropped dramatically. Significantly, in 15 states with \ntough gun control measures including the trigger locks and ``safe \nstorage'' laws moms on the Mall were rallying for, there were--\naccordingly to Mr. Lott--3,600 more rapes, 22,500 more robberies, and \n64,000 more burglaries. Could it be that criminals are smart enough to \nknow where they're likely to encounter resistance and where it's \neasiest to operate?\n  Mr. President, there is nothing more tragic than losing a child. And \nnothing more wonderful than mothers fighting to keep their children \nsafe from harm. But before any war can be won, we must understand the \nenemy and develop a strategy to defeat him. In the war against gun \nviolence, the enemy is not the weapon, but the criminal who uses it. \nMaking it easier for him to win by restricting those who could thwart \nhis evil act, or deter it in the first place, is not the answer.\n  Marching on the Mall is stirring spectacle, but ending the tragedy of \ngun violence requires a much more serious solution.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the Senate's \nattention an excellent report on the state of child care in the U.S. \nmilitary and the implications for improving civilian child care. ``Be \nAll That We Can Be: Lessons from the Military for Improving Our \nNation's Child Care System'' documents the Department of Defense's \nimpressive turn-around of its troubled child care system and its \nemergence as a model of affordable and quality child care for the \ncivilian world. As recently as ten years ago, military child care was \nin crisis--changing demographics in the military workforce had led to a \nsurge in demand for child care that the Department was unprepared to \nmeet. Child care waiting lists soared and quality plummeted. Prodded by \na GAO report, Congressional hearings, and the recognition that child \ncare is a fundamental issue for military readiness, the Department of \nDefense turned its child care system the gold standard for the Nation.\n  The experience of the Department of Defense offers important lessons \nfor the civilian world and offers great hope\n\n[[Page S4185]]\n\nfor improving child care across the Nation. Parents should not have to \njoin the service to receive good child care. High quality, affordable \ncare is a basic necessity for all working families. It is my hope that \nwe will take these lessons to heart and commit to ensuring that all \nchildren are given opportunities for the right start in life.\n  I would like to express my gratitude to Nancy Duff Campbell and \nJudith Appelbaum of the National Women's Law Center for their hard work \non producing this valuable report and I would ask that a summary of the \nimportant ``lessons learned'' from their report be entered into the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Six Lessons Learned\n\n       First, those seeking to make improvements in civilian child \n     care should not be daunted by the task: the military has \n     shown by its example that it is possible to take a woefully \n     inadequate child care system and dramatically improve it over \n     a relatively short period of time. If even a tradition-bound \n     institution like the military can turn its child care system \n     around, similar progress should be achievable in other \n     settings.\n       Second, to achieve progress, it is necessary to acknowledge \n     the seriousness of the child care problem and the \n     consequences of inaction. Policy makers in Congress and the \n     Department of Defense acted to reform military child care \n     after extensive Congressional hearings and GAO reports not \n     only exposed the poor state of military child care, but also \n     documented two results: because the child care system was \n     failing to meet the needs of a changing workforce it was \n     jeopardizing workforce performance (and thus military \n     readiness), and it was affecting the welfare of the children. \n     Similar concerns about the unavailability of high-quality, \n     affordable child care across the U.S. today--its impact on \n     workforce performance, and the effects on the healthy \n     development and learning of children--should prompt action to \n     improve civilian child care.\n       Third, the quality of child care can be improved by \n     focusing on establishing and enforcing comprehensive \n     standards, assisting providers in becoming accredited, and \n     enhancing provider compensation and training. The military \n     has developed comprehensive standards that providers must \n     meet in order to be certified to operate, and it ensures \n     that these standards are met through a system of \n     unannounced inspections and serious sanctions for failure \n     to comply. It also assists providers in meeting the \n     additional requirements necessary to become accredited by \n     a nationally recognized program. It encourages parental \n     involvement through parent boards, an ``open door'' \n     policy, and an anonymous hotline for reporting problems. \n     And it has increased provider compensation and training, \n     and linked compensation increases to the achievement of \n     training milestones. While some states have taken steps \n     forward in one or more of these areas, on the whole the \n     states have been far less effective in addressing these \n     issues, and could benefit substantially from emulating the \n     military's formula for success.\n       Fourth, child care affordability should be addressed \n     through a system of subsidies. The military child care system \n     keeps care affordable for parents through the use of a \n     sliding schedule of fees based on parent income, as well as \n     other subsidies. As a result, the average weekly fee paid by \n     military families for center-based care is significantly \n     lower than the average weekly fee paid by civilian families \n     for such care. In the civilian world, a patchwork array of \n     government measures assists some families in meeting their \n     child care expenses, but these policies are inadequate. \n     Policy makers at both the federal and state levels should \n     follow the military's example in making more resources \n     available-as well as using the mechanisms it has used to \n     distribute these resources--to help subsidize care for \n     families who cannot afford to pay the full cost of good child \n     care.\n       Fifth, the availability of care should be expanded. \n     Although demand still far exceeds supply in the military \n     system, the military has made significant progress in this \n     regard by continually assessing unmet need and taking steps \n     to address it through a comprehensive approach that includes \n     all kinds of care: child care centers, family child care, and \n     before and after-school programs, as well as resource and \n     referral agencies to assist parents in locating care. Some \n     states and localities have taken a variety of steps to expand \n     the supply of child care, but the military's experience \n     demonstrates, among other things, that it is essential to \n     measure unmet demand and then develop a plan for meeting it \n     with specific goals and timetables.\n       Sixth, improving the quality, affordability, and \n     availability of child care is a costly proposition, and will \n     succeed only if policy makers commit the resources necessary \n     to get the job done. Through increased Congressional \n     appropriations and allocations from within DoD resources, the \n     funds provided for military child care have been climbing \n     dramatically in recent years, making the turnaround in \n     military child care possible. The same commitment of \n     resources on the civilian side is not yet evident. An \n     increased public investment is critical if the same progress \n     is to be achieved in civilian child care. The military's \n     experience shows, in short, that policy makers can be prodded \n     into action by the acknowledgment of a serious child care \n     problem, and that once they make child care a top priority \n     and allocate the resources that are needed to address it, a \n     seriously deficient system can be turned around. Those faced \n     with the challenge of expanding access to affordable, high-\n     quality child care across the United States today--policy \n     makers, child care administrators, advocates, providers, \n     parents, and others--should find encouragement in this \n     conclusion. Inspired by the military's example, and armed \n     with knowledge of the tools it used to achieve its successes, \n     they need only to apply the lessons learned to make child \n     care for all working families, like the child care provided \n     to military families--to echo the Army's familiar jingle--\n     ``be all that it can be.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/18/senate-section/article/S4185-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to call for Senate action \non reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. Earlier this \nweek, the Supreme Court in its decision in United States versus \nMorrison struck a specific provision from the Violence Against Women \nAct of 1994. But that decision leaves intact the bulk of this landmark \nlaw. For the past five years, VAWA has funded and promoted significant \ninnovations in federal, state and local programs to assist victims of \nviolence, enhance prosecution of domestic violence and sexual assault \ncrimes, and prevent violence against women and children in their homes \nand on our streets. This support has enabled shelters, rape crisis \ncenters, health care professionals, schools, police forces and \ncommunities across the country to address and prevent violence against \nwomen. I commend my distinguished colleague from Delaware, Senator \nBiden, for his authorship of the original Violence Against Women Act \nand for his commitment to ensuring that this important legislation is \nre-authorized.\n  Women across the nation, including in my home state of Wisconsin, \nhave benefitted from this important legislation. Women's lives have \nbeen saved. Countless victims of domestic violence or sexual assault \nare receiving the services they need. Police are participating in \ntraining programs to arrest and bring abusers to justice. Both men and \nwomen are learning about the problem of domestic violence and sexual \nassault. In short, women are safer today because of this legislation.\n  Our nation's progress in preventing violence against women, however, \nis now in serious jeopardy. Authorization for the Violence Against \nWomen Act ends this year. I understand that Senators Biden and Hatch \nhave been working closely to craft a compromise re-authorization bill. \nI commend both of my colleagues for their commitment to this issue. But \nwith only weeks remaining in this abbreviated session, I urge the \nSenate leadership to take action on this legislation without further \ndelay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/18/senate-section/article/S4185-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          EXPLANATION OF VOTES\n\n  Mr. DODD.

As the Commander, he was the \ndriving force behind the development of a host of automation \nmodernization programs, which significantly improved the crisis \nmanagement decision process of the Nation and placed the Command upon \nthe cutting edge of the information revolution. Colonel Miller \nroutinely interacted with the National Security Council, White House \nMilitary Office, and the White House Staff. The consummate \nprofessional, he demonstrated the ability to work successfully with \neach of these offices and build consensus thereby ensuring mission \nsuccess.\n  Upon completion of the Program Manager's Course, Colonel Miller \nserved as the Commander of the U.S. Army Research, Development and \nAcquisition Information Systems Activity, where he directly supported \nthe Assistant Secretary of the Army for Research, Development and \nAcquisition. Colonel Miller introduced a myriad of initiatives that \nresulted in dramatic improvements in the daily operation of his \norganization. Chief among these was his ability to reduce base \noperations costs by 38 percent which translated into a yearly savings \nof over three hundred thousand dollars.\n  Colonel Miller culminated his career as the Commander of the United \nStates Army Information Systems Software Center, a centrally selected \nCommand with over 900 military and civilian personnel supported by over \n400 contractors. He managed a budget of over $115 million. Colonel \nMiller, a recognized leader in the acquisition and automation \ncommunities, did an exceptional job of leading his command through a \ndifficult period of downsizing and budget cuts while continuing to \nimprove automation support to the Warfighter.\n  Colonel Miller is one of the Army's most outstanding automation \nofficers. His selfless dedication, consummate professionalism, and \nvisionary leadership have enabled him to lead his Command to \nunprecedented heights, eliciting praise from field commanders Army \nwide. He personifies the very best character attributes of the \nOfficers' Corps. The Army will be greatly diminished the day that he \nretires.\n  I am honoring Colonel Miller today as a way of thanking him for his \nfaithful and honorable service to the Army and to the citizens of the \nUnited States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/18/senate-section/article/S4186-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     KIDS DAY AMERICA/INTERNATIONAL\n\n Mr. SANTORUM.

Stefanou \nChiropractic is the official chiropractic office representing Kids Day \nAmerica/International at the event, which will benefit the World \nChildren's Wellness Foundation.\n  Kids Day America/International is a special day set aside to address \nhealth, safety and environmental issues. It was founded for the purpose \nof educating families and communities about important social concerns \nthat affect us as individuals and as a community.\n  Our children represent the promise of a bright future, and we must \nuphold our obligation to nurture and protect them, providing them with \nthe opportunity to learn, achieve, grow and succeed in a healthy and \nsafe environment.

To honor \nthis event, I put forward the following proclamation:\n\n       Whereas, the health and well-being of children is our \n     responsibility; and\n       Whereas, the safety of our children is a significant \n     concern for parents, community leaders and health care \n     givers; and\n       Whereas, environmental welfare is of universal concern and \n     deserves the utmost attention; and\n       Whereas, if started in childhood, proper health, safety and \n     environmental habits can be maintained for a lifetime, \n     producing a valued member of society, and enhancing our \n     community;\n       Now, therefore, I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in \n     proclaiming the 20th of May, 2000 as ``Kids Day America/\n     International.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/18/senate-section/article/S4186-3", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4186-S4187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN MEMORY OF JO-ANN MOLNAR\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to share just a few \nwords about a good friend we recently lost, someone I have known since \nI first ran for Lieutenant Governor in Massachusetts in 1982, a good \nhearted and selfless individual who was always an inspiration, Jo-Ann \nMolnar. Jo-Ann recently passed away after bravely battling cancer, and \nI know that I am not alone in saying that as someone whose life was \ntouched by Jo-Ann Molnar's service, activism, and warmth, there is \ntoday a deep and profound sense of loss. In Jo-Ann many of us have \nlost--and today I would like to honor--a committed activist, a person \nof enormous courage and character and, most simply, a great friend.\n  I first met Jo-Ann Molnar when I became involved in politics in the \n1970s. Jo-Ann approached me at one of our earliest events and offered \nto help in any way she could. Jo-Ann was one of those individuals who--\nthrough her commitment to do what is right, through her belief in \npolitics not as sport but as a fight for principle--could reaffirm \nprecisely why politics matters and why public service is worthwhile.\n  Jo-Ann and I remained in touch ever since that first involvement, and \nI looked forward to and always appreciated Jo-Ann's warm cards and \ngreetings. Always a loyal friend, Jo-Ann would share with me her \nthoughts on issues of importance, keep me abreast of her \naccomplishments, and offer me words of encouragement as I worked \nthrough the challenges of the United States Senate.\n  It was through her frequent cards and letters--and the occasional \nhappy meeting either in Massachusetts or at political gatherings around \nthe Maryland area--that I learned of the many ways in which Jo-Ann \ncontinued to dedicate herself to public service. Her determination to \nmake a difference led her to remarkable achievements. In 1977, Jo-Ann \ngraduated magna cum laude from Fairleigh Dickinson University, with a \ndegree in history and political science. She went on to earn a master's \ndegree in political science from American University. Jo-Ann selflessly \noffered her leadership to her fellow Democrats, serving admirably as \nPresident of the Montgomery County, Maryland Young Democrats, as Vice \nChair of the Handicapped Commission in Montgomery County, and on the \nBoard of Directors of the Montgomery County public libraries. In \naddition to her help with my campaigns, Jo-Ann served as a legislative \nintern to U.S. Senator Donald Reigle, U.S. Representative Gene Andrew \nMaguire, and Montgomery County Council member Michael L. Gudis. She \nalso worked as a Congressional Liaison Assistant for the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. For almost a decade, Jo-Ann \nserved as a legal researcher for the Human Relations Commission. She \ngave of herself as a Sunday School teacher and a confirmation teacher \nat the Foundary United Methodist Church in Washington, D.C, as well as \nan instructor at Colesville United Methodist Church in Silver Spring, \nMaryland.\n\n[[Page S4187]]\n\n  Mr. President, Jo-Ann lived a life true to her ideals of service--\nservice to community, service to faith. I would add, though, that none \nof these achievements would have been possible if Jo-Ann had not worked \nso hard to overcome cerebral palsy. Jo-Ann refused to be slowed by her \ndisability--and in fact rejected the notion that she should in any way \nlower her expectations for herself or expect different expectations \nfrom those to whom she so selflessly offered her best efforts. Jo-Ann \nwas a fighter, and I continually marveled at her drive to rise above \nwhat some would view as limitations.\n  For that reason, Jo-Ann served as one of the best possible advocates \nand activists for the Americans with Disabilities Act. Honored as a \nteenager for her activism on the Education for All Handicapped Children \nAct, Jo-Ann kept pushing as an adult to break down barriers in our \nsociety that she believed kept disabled Americans from maximizing their \ncontributions to their communities and our nation. Jo-Ann was not just \nan advocate for legislation to protect and empower disabled Americans--\nshe was the living embodiment of those efforts.\n  Mr. President, it is difficult to accept that we have all lost a \nfriend in Jo-Ann Molnar, but it is particularly difficult, I know, for \nJo-Ann's family--her mother, Helen, and her two sisters, Dorothy and \nIlona. They are in our thoughts and prayers.\n  I was comforted, though, to learn that Jo-Ann was able to enjoy life \nas she had always done, up until her last days. Jo-Ann's mother, Helen, \nlet me know that she had a wonderful Christmas with her family and was \nable to attend a New Millennium New Year's Eve celebration, complete \nwith the 60's rock music she loved. Just as she did throughout her \nlife, even in her most difficult days, Jo-Ann kept on doing the things \nthat she loved--and she moved forward in so many remarkable efforts \ndriven by a real sense of social conscience.\n  Mr. President, today I remember Jo-Ann for her service, her \nfriendship, and her kindness. All of us who knew her continue to draw \nstrength from her courage and her faith, and Jo-Ann's life continues to \ninspire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/18/senate-section/article/S4187-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COMMEMORATING SAMUEL JAMES TOBIAS\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to join the \ncommunity of Ruidoso, New Mexico in mourning the loss of Samuel James \nTobias. Sam, a twenty-four-year veteran of the U.S. Forest Service, \nlost his life this week battling the Scott Able Fire in southern New \nMexico when the spotter plane he was in crashed shortly after takeoff. \nHis loss leaves a tremendous void for his wife, Jackie, the Forest \nService, and the entire community of Ruidoso.\n  Sam joined the Forest Service in 1977 and worked in Recreation \nManagement his whole career because of his love for the National Forest \nand the public. Preserving the land was his passion, and although fire \nfighting was the most dangerous aspect of his job, it was the part he \nespecially enjoyed. Sam joined many local and regional fire teams and \nbecame trained as an Air Attack Coordinator. His skills in coordinating \nair tankers, helicopters and fire crews became well known and he gained \nthe respect of all throughout the fire fighting community.\n  Sam was also deeply respected as a person. A big man with a soft \nvoice, he was known as always having a smile on his face. One of his \ncoworkers remembered him as ``the peacemaker with that big smile, \nalways helping and giving good advice.'' Others have talked about the \n``twinkle in his eyes'' and his big ``bear hugs.'' His lifelong friend, \nDale Mance, recalled how Sam helped him find his way out of the steel \nmills of Pennsylvania and into a career with the Forest Service. There \nare so many examples of Sam's goodness; obviously, he had a heart that \nmatched the size of his physical stature.\n  The many testimonals about Sam that his friends and family have \noffered carry a common theme: his willingness to help others, his \nselflessness, his concern for others. Often, such character is uncommon \nin men. For Sam Tobias it was natural, because he held genuine love for \nhis family, his neighbors, and the land. Mr. President, I share the \ngrief of the community of Ruidoso and my heartfelt condolences go out \nto the Tobias family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/18/senate-section/article/S4187-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4187-S4188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ALICE FULLER\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nremarkable woman, Alice Fuller. At the age of 81, she has two adult \ndaughters, six grandchildren, and nine great grandchildren. She manages \na thirteen-acre farm and garden, and still spoils her family with \nhomemade rolls and baked goods at every family dinner. Her stamina and \ngood-nature should be an inspiration to all Americans. A native of \nMissouri, she moved with her family to California in 1936, and in 1941, \nshe married and moved to Oregon. Irrespective of her southern and \nwestern roots, she is an enthusiastic and loyal fan of the New York \nYankees. On Mother's Day, The Register-Guard of Eugene, Oregon included \nthe following story on this, ``One Tough Mom.''\n  Mr. President, I ask that this statement and the following article be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                          A Farmer's Instinct\n\n                (By Kimber Williams, The Register-Guard)\n\n       Veneta.--Seated on a stack of newspapers astride her John \n     Deere tractor, dragging a brush cutter around her 13-acre \n     farm, she looks no bigger than a child.\n       At 81, Alice Fuller is small--her slim, delicate limbs \n     whittled by the inevitable bending and shrinkage that come \n     with the years.\n       Steadied by a wooden cane, she stands at 4 feet 6 inches \n     and weighs maybe 91 pounds.\n       Don't be fooled. She's still got plenty of horsepower.\n       Fuller has lived alone since her husband's death, tending \n     her beloved garden and fruit trees, hauling in wood to heat \n     her home--she prefers wood heat--cooking and baking her \n     famous from-scratch dinner rolls. As always, keeping her \n     place up.\n       Hard work is the essential rhythm to her life--as sure and \n     steady as her own heartbeat.\n       As the daughter of Missouri sharecroppers, Fuller grew up \n     working the land.\n       Corn and wheat and oats, watermelon and canteloupe. She \n     quit school early to help her brothers, the baby of the \n     family intent on carrying her own weight.\n       It was a good life, an honest life. But she would never \n     tell you that it's been hard.\n       Like many children of the Depression--like mothers \n     everywhere--she simply did what had to be done.\n       As a wife and mother in rural Oregon, Fuller learned to run \n     a chicken ranch--raising up to 75,000 chickens five times a \n     year. She could clean and dress 100 chickens, dissect a \n     chicken and tell you what killed it, then turn around and fry \n     up a batch for dinner.\n       Once, when Fuller left to visit her own ailing mother, she \n     returned to find that someone had left a chicken house door \n     unlatched.\n       Cows had wandered in among the 15,000 maturing broilers, \n     sending terrified chickens scrambling. Smothered chickens \n     were stacked in every corner of the chicken house.\n       Without complaint, she went to work slaughtering and \n     dressing a couple of hundred chickens.\n       Fuller's Poultry Farm is behind her now, but the will to \n     work remains, a siren song even in her waning years.\n       Work is the call that propels her out of bed each morning. \n     It gives her purpose and keeps her moving. Call it a farmer's \n     instinct. It is the only life she has known.\n       She is blessed with both extraordinary drive and internal \n     blinders that allow her to ignore many barriers of age--much \n     to the consternation of her grown daughters, Evelyn McIntyre \n     and Judy Bicknell, who view their tiny, determined mother \n     with love, gratitude and amazement.\n       If there is a problem, Fuller tackles it. That simple.\n       ``When a water pipe broke earlier this year, Mom went out \n     in the rain, muck and mud, and dug the hole for the plumber \n     to be able to fix the pipe,'' McIntyre recalled. ``She falls \n     often, and in fact, fell into the hole, but climbed back out \n     and went right back to digging.\n       ``I don't think Mom ever, ever thought there was anything \n     she couldn't do.''\n       At this, Fuller can't keep quiet.\n       ``Well there's one thing that I can't do, much to my \n     daughters' delight,'' she said with a good-natured grumble. \n     ``There are four chain saws out in the shop, and I can't \n     start one of them. It's been so frustrating to me, and I \n     don't think anything could make them happier.''\n       It might be hard to imagine a 91-pound woman with arms as \n     slight as a 10-year-old's waving around a roaring chain saw. \n     But you don't know Fuller.\n       There's still a touch of flame in her once-auburn hair, and \n     a bit of fire in her belly.\n       ``Oh, I'm pretty reckless,'' she jokes with a wave of her \n     hand. ``I stalled the John Deere yesterday--tried to put it \n     between two trees. The tractor would make it, but the brush \n     cutter wouldn't. Had to get out the Oliver, the big \n     tractor, to get her out.''\n       It's like her. Over the years, she has developed a habit of \n     depending on herself.\n       Once, while climbing a metal ladder to check a feed bin on \n     a rainy day, she discovered a short in the electric auger \n     that moved chicken feed into the bin. Her hand froze to\n\n[[Page S4188]]\n\n     the ladder, fixed with an electrical current. It wouldn't \n     budge.\n       ``Well, the girls had gone to school, my husband had gone \n     to work and there I stood. I could not let loose of this \n     ladder,'' she chuckled. ``It was about 9 in the morning, and \n     I decided I couldn't possibly stand there all day.''\n       With her left hand, Fuller grabbed the fingers of her right \n     hand, carefully prying each one off the metal.\n       ``They just stayed stiff until they were all off,'' she \n     smiled. ``I was kind of lucky that time.''\n       Other times, she wasn't so lucky. A cow kick that led to \n     knee surgery. A broken ankle. A torn rib cartilage from a \n     fall off a ladder. The rigors of farm life.\n       ``Once she rode her riding mower under a sign, but was \n     looking behind her and forgot to duck,'' McIntyre recalled. \n     ``She hurt her neck quite a bit, but at the hospital the \n     doctors couldn't read the X-rays of the bones in her neck to \n     tell if anything had been broken because of so many arthritic \n     changes in her bones.\n       Fuller wasn't one to complain.\n       ``Mom always gave us the feeling that we could and should \n     accomplish the next challenge before us,'' McIntyre added. \n     ``She demanded absolute honesty--always counted her change \n     and checked the clerk's math, but would just as readily \n     return an error in her favor as point out when she was short-\n     changed.\n       ``One tough mom,'' she added. ``She's ours and we love \n     her.''\n       Ask Fuller where she finds strength, and she shrugs.\n       She doesn't give advice to others. She knows what she \n     knows. And what she knows is work.\n       She'll tell you that she's slowed down. ``Not nearly as \n     active as I once was,'' Fuller insisted, a wistful note in \n     her voice. But in the same breath, she talks about the tasks \n     before her.\n       It's spring out at her place, with calla lilies unfurling \n     and bleeding hearts and sword ferns awakening in the shade of \n     towering fir trees. Tall grass stretches upward beneath \n     gentle spring rain, a yard demanding to be mown.\n       There is a garden to plant, nearly an acre of raspberry \n     bushes to tend, fruit trees in flower and a grape arbor that \n     promises 40 to 50 quarts of grape juice this summer.\n       There are jobs to be done. And that's enough.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/18/senate-section/article/S4188-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MR.

Gardner, an exceptionally dedicated public servant. \nMr. Gardner is retiring after ten years of service as the President of \nthe Quad City Development Group, a public/private not-for-profit \ncorporation. This organization promotes economic growth in and around \nthe cities of Davenport and Bettendorf, Iowa, and Moline and Rock \nIsland, Illinois. The Development Group markets these communities as \nlocations for companies seeking to expand or relocate. It also works \nwith Quad City communities to improve their climate for job creation.\n  Under his leadership, the Quad City Development Group has been the \ndriving force behind the retention and addition of more than 14,000 \njobs and the investment of over $1 billion in the Quad Cities area. \nJohn's leadership style, which was developed and honed in the private \nsector, was ideal for his position as the President of this vital \ncommunity and business-based group.\n  I would like to take a moment to highlight John's career. Immediately \nbefore joining the Quad City Development Group, John was the director \nof economic development for Lee Enterprises, Inc., the owner of the \nQuad City Times and the Southern Illinoisan newspapers. Before that \nassignment, John was publisher of the Quad City Times for five years. \nHe learned the newspaper business in a 23-year career as a reporter, \neditor and eventually publisher of The Southern Illinoisan newspaper in \nCarbondale, Illinois. He is active in a number of professional and \ncommunity organizations, and has been involved in various statewide \nprojects in both Iowa and Illinois. He is a member of the Iowa Group \nfor Economic Development and was chairman of the Iowa Future project, a \nstatewide strategic planning effort.\n  It gives me great pleasure to present the credentials of John C. \nGardner to the Senate today. It is clear that the Iowa and Illinois \ncommunities he has served so well are losing a great talent. They will \nmiss his leadership, his winning smile, and his personal and \nprofessional dedication. I would like to wish both John and his wife, \nAnn, the best in their retirement and continued success in all their \nfuture endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/18/senate-section/article/S4188-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CONGRATULATIONS TO MR.

In 1973, Tom became General Supervisor \nof Labor Relations followed by General Supervisor of Industrial \nRelations in 1976. The following year, he was named Administrator of \nLabor Relations at the GMAD-Central office in Warren, Michigan.

A bill to reduce the backlog in the processing of \nimmigration benefit applications and to make improvements to \ninfrastructure necessary for the effective provision of immigration \nservices, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n    immigration services and infrastructure improvements act of 2000\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing bipartisan \nlegislation that, if enacted, will enable the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service (INS) to cut through and eventually eliminate \nthe unacceptably long backlogs in its processing of applications for \nnaturalization, adjustment of status, and other immigration benefits.\n\n  I am pleased that Senators Abraham, Jeffords, DeWine, Leahy, Reid, \nMoynihan, Mikulski, Graham, and Durbin have joined me as original \ncosponsors of this important bill.\n  All of us have heard the horror stories of the long delays in \nprocessing naturalization and immigration applications. What was once a \n6-month process has now become a 3- to 4-year ordeal.\n  The ``Immigration Services and Infrastructure Improvement Act of \n2000,'' which I am introducing today, would provide the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service with the direction and resources it needs to \nreduce the current immigration backlogs and hold it accountable to get \nthe job done.\n  It is unacceptable that millions of people who have followed our \nnation's laws, made outstanding contributions to our nation, and paid \nthe requisite fees have had to wait months--and in too many cases, \nyears--to obtain the immigration services they need. The enormous \ndelays in processing have had a negative impact on the reunification of \nspouses and minor children, and on businesses seeking to employ \nessential workers to help keep them globally competitive.\n  The fact is, there are many victims of an agency that is in dire need \nof a change in the way it does business. Today, it has become all too \nclear that the INS needs to re-engineer its adjudication process, which \nwill require both additional resources and strong congressional \ndirection and oversight.\n  The ``Immigration Services and Infrastructure Improvement Act'' would \nenable millions of law-abiding residents, immigrants, and businesses, \nwho have played by the rules and paid fees to the INS, to have their \napplications processed in a timely manner.\n  This bill evolved from discussions with immigration advocates, the \nbusiness community, State and local leaders, and the Administration. \nSpecifically, this legislation would do three things.\n  First, it would create a separate ``Immigration Services and \nInfrastructure Improvement Account'' (``Account'') and authorize such \nsums as may be necessary to fund it.\n  This account would permit the INS to fund across several fiscal years \ninfrastructure improvements, including additional staff, computer \nrecords management, fingerprinting, and nationwide computer \nintegration. Moreover, it would pay for these infrastructure \nimprovements through direct appropriations rather than through \nincreased application fees.\n  Second, the ``Immigration Services and Infrastructure Improvement Act \nof 2000'' would require the INS to put together a plan on how it will \neliminate existing backlogs and report on this plan before it could \naccess any of the funds.\n  In its report, the INS would be required to describe its current \nprocessing capabilities and detail its plans to eliminate existing \nbacklogs in immigration benefit applications and petitions.\n  And third, it would require the Department of Justice to submit an \nannual, detailed report to Congress, including data on the number of \nnaturalization applications and immigration petitions processed and \nadjudicated in each of the fiscal years following enactment of the act.\n  The act would also require the INS to report on the number of cases \nstill pending in the naturalization, immigrant and nonimmigrant visa \ncategories. In some cases this would involve a state-by-state or \nregional analysis of INS's progress in processing applications in a \ntimely fashion.\n  In the past 7 years, 6.4 million people applied for U.S. \ncitizenship--more than the previous 37 years combined. Today, INS faces \na backlog of 1.3 million naturalization applications. Although the INS \nhas put more resources into processing naturalization applications, \nthis has come at the expense of processing other immigration-related \napplications, such as those for lawful permanent residence. At the \nbeginning of this year, the INS had a pending caseload of 951,350 \nadjustment of status applications--an eightfold increase since 1994.\n  As a result, major cities continue to face tremendous delays in the \nprocessing of INS naturalization and immigrant applications. Five \ncities--Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Miami, and Chicago--\nhandle 65 percent of the nation's naturalization workload.\n  By now, most of us are familiar with the numbers. Indeed, it would be \neasy for one to look at and decry the statistics reflecting the \nenormous number of backlogged applications. Instead, I come to floor of \nthe Senate today to talk about the human cost of these backlogs and \nwhat I intend to do through legislation to help the INS put itself on \nits proper course.\n  As one who represents California, a State that is number one among \nimmigrant-receiving States, I have seen firsthand how families and \nbusinesses can be disproportionately affected by the smallest \nfluctuations in INS resources and services.\n  One out of every four Californians--about 8.5 million people--is \nforeign born. The average number of new immigrants to the State is more \nthan 300,000 annually. Population growth of this magnitude is like \nadding a city the size of Anaheim, California each year.\n  The constant processing delays at the INS have had a tremendous \nimpact on the ability of immigrants to naturalize, and seek services \nrelated to their application for green cards, work authorization, and \nfamily reunification.\n  On almost a daily basis, my office fields calls from people who have \nbeen waiting three or four years to naturalize or to adjust their \nstatus to that of lawful permanent resident. And this is after having \npaid a fee of $225 per naturalization application, and $220 for an \nadjustment of status application--per person. Imagine how much of an \ninvestment a family makes in order to play by the rules.\n  Applicants for these services are never really sure if their \napplication is still in the process or lost, especially when the \nexpected time for a fingerprint or interview notice comes and goes.\n  I have received numerous letters from constituents that vividly \nportray the human toil these backlogs have taken.\n  For example, one person wrote that he and his family have been in the \ncountry legally for more than 10 years. They filed their request for \npermanent residency at the right time. Their file, however, has moved \nso slowly within the INS that one of their sons is now about to ``age \nout'' of qualifying for permanent residence because he will turn 21 \nsoon.\n  Just recently, I received a letter from a young student at Berkeley \nwho filed a citizenship application in October 1996. She is still \nwaiting to receive word from the INS on the correct status of her file.\n  She was told by the INS in January this year that it had closed her \ncase in June 1999 without her knowledge or ability to address any \nconcerns they might have had with her case. In fact, she was never told \nthere were problems with her case.\n  Up until January, she had been told by the INS that she would be \nreceiving her interview notice within six weeks. Unfortunately, six \nweeks became three years. Now, almost four years later, she has come to \nmy office for assistance, wondering what she might have done to create \nthis situation.\n  The fact is, like millions of others throughout the country, she is a \nvictim of an agency that is in dire need of a change in the way it does \nbusiness.\n\n[[Page S4192]]\n\n  Millions of people are being prevented from participating in American \ncivic life because of the inability of INS to process their \nnaturalization applications in a timely fashion (e.g., they cannot \nvote, run for public office, assume certain government positions). U.S. \ncitizens are unable to be reunited with their spouses and minor \nchildren because of the delays in INS processing.\n  And thousands of American businesses, such as high tech companies \nlike Sun Microsystems and others, have been prevented from getting \nqualified workers because of the INS's inability to provide access to a \ncritical portion of their workforce. Lengthy delays and inconsistencies \nin INS processing have taken a toll on company projects, planning and \ngoals.\n  How does this legislation help Congress hold the INS accountable for \nthe prompt delivery of services? If INS does not met the goals of set \nout in this legislation, it would have to explain to Congress why the \nbacklogs persist and what the agency is doing to fix them. This \nlegislation would also require the INS to describe the additional \nmechanisms and resources needed to meet Congress's mandate that \nbacklogs be eliminated and that the processing of applications take \nplace in an acceptable time frame.\n\n  While funds devoted to enforcing our immigration laws have rightfully \nbeen increased in recent years, until very recently, Congress had not \nprovided increases in funding to the INS specifically to deal with the \nincreased missions that Congress has imposed on it. Nor has Congress \nprovided adequate funding to deal with the increased number of \nnaturalization and other immigration benefits applications that have \nbeen submitted in recent years and continue to be submitted.\n  The business community, immigration community, and the Administration \nhave indicated their support for mechanisms such as those included in \nmy legislation. I wish to thank the following organizations whose \nvaluable input and ideas helped shaped this important legislation:\n  American Business for Legal Immigration; American Council on \nInternational Personnel; American Immigration Lawyers Association; \nHebrew Immigration Aid Society; Mexican American Legal Defense and \nEducation Fund; National Association of Latino Elected Officials; \nNational Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium; National Council of \nLa Raza; United Jewish Communities; and United States Catholic \nConference.\n  Mr. President, the ``Immigration Services and Infrastructure \nImprovement Act of 2000'' would provide direction and accountability on \nhow the INS uses appropriated funds. Passage of this legislation would \nsend a strong congressional directive to the INS that timely and \nefficient service is not merely goal, but a mandate.\n  I urge the Senate to act swiftly and pass this urgently needed \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NICKLES (for himself and Mr. Voinovich):\n  S. 2587.

A bill to assist the economic development of the Ute Indian \nTribe by authorizing the transfer to the Tribe of Oil Shale Reserve \nNumbered 2, to protect the Colorado River by providing for the removal \nof the tailings from the Atlas uranium milling site near Moab, Utah, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n                     ute-moab land restoration act\n\n Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I take the floor today to \nintroduce the Ute-Moab Land Restoration Act, a proposal that enjoys \ngreat support from the State of Utah and many of my constituents. This \nlegislation contains two major components that will enable the \nrestoration of Ute Indian Tribal lands and the remediation of a uranium \nmill tailings site near Moab, Utah.\n  The first component is the transfer of the Naval Oil Shale Reserve \nNumbered 2 (NOSR 2) lands east of the Green River to the Ute Indian \nTribe. The lands that contain the NOSR 2 were taken from the Ute tribe \nin 1916 by the government to provide the Navy with a source of \npetroleum for oil-burning ships. This transfer will return these \ntraditional homelands to the Ute tribe. Additionally, the return of \nthese lands will spur economic development on the Uintah and Ouray \nIndian Reservation, home of the Ute Tribe. The increased economic \ndevelopment will include oil and gas production. It should be noted \nthat the Ute Tribe has a history of environmentally responsible \npetroleum development on one of Utah's largest oil and gas fields. The \nbill also incorporates a provision whereby a nine percent royalty will \nbe returned to the Secretary of Energy for the purposes of offsetting \nthe cost of removing the Atlas tailings pile as I shall describe in a \nmoment. I expect the tribe will give all future petroleum developments \nthe same amount of care they have demonstrated in the past.\n  The economy of the Uintah Basin will not be the sole beneficiary of \nthe land transfer. There are numerous conservation provisions \nincorporated into the transfer. These provisions include the \nestablishment of a quarter mile corridor along 75 miles of the Green \nRiver to conserve its scenic qualities and protections for wild horses \nand threatened and endangered plants life.\n  The second component will facilitate the removal of the tailings from \nthe Atlas uranium milling site across the Colorado River from Moab, \nUtah. It should be noted that the determination to locate the Atlas \nmilling facility at MOAB was driven by encouragement from the former \nAtomic Energy Commission. Further, the Department of Energy (DOE) bears \nresponsibility for approximately 56 percent of the 10.5 million tons of \nmildly radioactive debris left as a residue from the Cold War and our \nnation's effort to maintain its nuclear weapons stockpile. These \ntailings, produced from 156 to 1988, are currently leaching ammonia \ninto the waters of the Colorado River. Additionally, the pile is a \nsignificant source of airborne radon. Both of these pollutants need to \nbe addressed.\n  In January of this year, Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson \nannounced the intention of DOE to move the Atlas tailings pile to a \nremote location where this waste could be contained in a sealed cell. \nThis proposal follows work done previously by DOE on 22 former uranium \nmill tailings sites. The legislation I am introducing today amends the \nUranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act (UMTRCA) by adding the \nAtlas tailings site as the 23rd site for DOE remediation.\n\n  I note that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission conducted a \nlengthy five-year environmental impact statement on the Atlas site. Its\n\n[[Page S4193]]\n\nconclusion held that the site could be remediated in place by \ndewatering the pile, treating the ground water, and capping the \ntailings. Indeed, the NRC has appointed a trustee that is moving \nforward with this remediation process today. However, given the \ninterests of the State of Utah and the people of Grand County, I am \nintroducing this legislation so the tailings can be removed and treated \nin a more secure manner.\n  I am concerned that securing the funding for this clean-up may be \ndifficult. Therefore, I have a included a provision which will enable \nthe NRC trustee to continue on-site remediation up to the point that \nDOE obtains the necessary appropriations to step up and take over the \nprocess. I believe this is the responsible approach to ensure that \npublic health and the environment are protected regardless of the \noutcome of future appropriations.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in moving this \nlegislation forward and restoring these Utah lands.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2588\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reauthoize and amend the Comprehensive \nEnvironmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980; to the \nCommittee on Environmental and Public Works.\n\n\n                 BROWNFIELDS REVITALIZATION ACT OF 2000\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation that will provide incentives to clean up abandoned \nindustrial sites--or brownfields--across the country and put them back \ninto productive use and preserve our greenspaces.\n  It is time to create more certainty in the brownfields cleanup \nprocess. Parties that clean up non-Superfund sites under state cleanup \nlaws need certainty about the rules that apply to them, particularly \nthat their actions terminate the risk of future liability under the \nfederal Superfund program.\n  The bill that I introduce today, the Brownfield Revitalization Act of \n2000, creates that certainty by allowing states to release parties that \nhave cleaned up sites under state laws and programs from federal \nliability. This bill has strong bipartisan support from our nation's \nGovernors who have written to me expressing their support for this \nlegislation.\n  I strongly believe that there should be no requirement that the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) pre-approve state laws and \nprograms. State brownfields programs address sites that are not on the \nNational Priorities List (NPL) and where the federal government has \nplayed little or no role.\n  States are leading the way in cleaning up sites more efficiently and \ncost-effectively. According to state solid waste management officials, \nstates average more than 1,400 cleanups per year. And they are \naddressing approximately 4,700 sites at any given time.\n  This is helping to recycle our urban wastelands, prevent urban sprawl \nand preserve our farmland and greenspaces. These programs are cleaning \nup eyesores in our inner cities, making them more desirable places to \nlive. Because they are putting abandoned sites back into productive \nuse, they are the key to providing economic rebirth to our urban areas, \nand good-paying jobs to local residents. This bill makes sense for our \nenvironment and it makes sense for our economy.\n  The bill I am introducing today is similar to the brownfields \nprovisions in S. 1090, the Superfund Program Completion Act of 1999, by \nSenator Bob Smith and the late-Senator John Chafee. The purpose of my \nbill is to build upon the success of state programs by providing even \nmore incentives to clean up brownfield sites in order to provide better \nprotection for the health and safety of our citizens and the \nenvironment. What we don't need are delays caused by the U.S. EPA's \nsecond-guessing of state decisions.\n  A good example of second-guessing occurred in my own state of Ohio. \nOne company, TRW completed a cleanup at its site in Minerva under \nOhio's enforcement program in 1986. Despite these cleanup efforts, the \nU.S. EPA placed the site on the NPL in 1989. However, after listing the \nsite, the U.S. EPA took no aggressive steps for additional cleanup. The \nsite has been untouched for years. In fact, it is now likely that the \nsite will be delisted.\n  To enhance and encourage further cleanup efforts, Ohio has \nimplemented a private sector-based program to clean up brownfields \nsites. When I was Governor, Ohio EPA, Republicans and Democrats in the \nOhio Legislature and I worked hard to implement a program that we \nbelieve works for Ohio. Our program is already successful in improving \nOhio's environment and economy.\n  In almost 20 years under the federal Superfund program, the U.S. EPA \nhas only cleaned up 18 sites in Ohio. In contrast, 103 sites have been \ncleaned up under Ohio's voluntary cleanup program in 5 years. And many \nmore cleanups are underway.\n  States clearly have been the innovators in developing voluntary \ncleanup programs, and Ohio's program has been very successful in \ngetting cleanups done more quickly and cost effectively. For example, \nthe first cleanup conducted under our program--the Kessler Products \nfacility, near Canton--was estimated to cost $2 million and take 3 to 5 \nyears to complete if it had been cleaned under Superfund. However, \nunder Ohio's voluntary program, the cost was $600,000 and took 6 months \nto complete. These cleanups are good for the environment and good for \nthe economy.\n  Mr. President, Ohio and other states have very successful programs \nthat clean up sites more efficiently and cost effectively. This bill \nwould help build on their success by providing assurances to parties \nthat when they clean up a site correctly, they will not be held liable \nunder Superfund down the road. The bill precludes the federal \ngovernment from taking action at a site where cleanup is being \nconducted under a state program except under certain circumstances, \nsuch as when a state requests federal action, when the U.S. EPA \ndetermines that a state is unwilling or unable to take appropriate \naction, or when contamination has migrated across state lines. The bill \ndoes not take away the U.S. EPA's authority to conduct emergency \nremovals or their authority to conduct tests at a site to determine if \na site should be listed on the NPL.\n  This legislation also ensures that Federal facilities are subject to \nthe\n\n[[Page S4195]]\n\nsame environmental cleanup requirements as private sites. In 1992, \nCongress enacted the Federal Facilities Compliance Act (FFCA), which \nholds Federal facilities accountable to meet State and Federal \nenvironmental laws regulating hazardous waste. However, subsequent \nFederal court decisions have undermined the intent of FFCA and similar \nlanguage in other statutes. We should be reminded that contamination \nproblems at Federal facilities are largely the result of years of self-\nregulation by Federal agencies. It is essential that States have the \nauthority to oversee cleanup and enforce their own laws and standards. \nMy bill merely ensures that Federal agencies are held accountable to \nthe same state and federal regulations that govern private entities.\n  This bill is just plain commonsense. It provides more protection for \nthe environment by providing incentives to clean up hazardous waste \nsites. It helps preserve our greenspaces. And it helps our economy by \nputting abandoned sites back into productive use, providing jobs and \nbetter places to live in our urban areas.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2590\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

George V. Voinovich,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Voinovich: On behalf of the National \n     Governors' Association (NGA), we are pleased with the \n     introduction of the Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2000. \n     NGA has reviewed the bill and believe that it addresses key \n     issues raised by the nation's Governors to facilitate the \n     speedy cleanup of brownfields sites and make some important \n     corrections to the Superfund statute. We hope that all \n     Senators will work with you to ensure passage of legislation \n     that the President can sign this year.\n       We would like to briefly comment on four provisions in the \n     bill. We applaud the inclusion of a provision dealing with \n     certainty at state brownfields sites. The bill's finality \n     provision would improve the effectiveness and pace of \n     hazardous waste cleanups by allowing state voluntary cleanup \n     programs to provide assurance to landowners who wish to \n     develop their property without fear of being engulfed in the \n     federal liability scheme. There is no question that voluntary \n     cleanup programs and brownfields redevelopment are currently \n     hindered by the pervasive fear of federal liability under the \n     Superfund law. Your bill addresses this problem by precluding \n     enforcement by the federal government at sites where cleanup \n     has occurred or is being conducted under a state program. In \n     instances when a state is unwilling or unable to take \n     appropriate action, or if contamination has migrated across \n     state lines, your bill contains reasonable exceptions to this \n     preclusion of enforcement.\n       In addition, the Governors greatly appreciate the inclusion \n     of a provision requiring gubernatorial concurrence before a \n     site is listed on the National Priorities List. Such a \n     requirement will help avoid duplication of effort when a \n     state can take the lead in restoring a site to productive \n     use. As you know, states are currently overseeing most \n     cleanups; listing a site on the NPL when a state is prepared \n     to apply its own authority is not only wasteful of federal \n     resources, it is often counterproductive, resulting in \n     increased delays and greater costs.\n       We also support the provision in the bill that clarifies \n     that the state cost-share at Superfund sites is limited to \n     ten percent for both remedial activities and operations and \n     maintenance (O & M). This provision has been interpreted to \n     require states to be responsible for 100 percent of the O & M \n     expenses at a site. Your provision will correct this \n     inequitable situation, and at the same time, help ensure that \n     there is no financial bias toward remedies that involve more \n     intensive O & M than necessary.\n       The funding provisions in the bill that provide grants to \n     states and local governments for both response actions as \n     well as site assessments are very positive steps in assuring \n     that financial assistance is available so that sites can \n     actually move toward final cleanups.\n       Lastly, we applaud you for adding a provision that makes \n     all federal facilities subject to CERCLA and state hazardous \n     waste laws to the same extent as other nongovernmental \n     entities. There is no legitimate rationale for exempting the \n     federal government from the same environmental protection \n     laws that apply to businesses, individuals and state and \n     local government.\n       We look forward to continuing our strong working \n     relationship with you on these issues. The nation's Governors \n     believe that brownfields revitalization and some reasonable \n     Superfund ``fixes'' can be accomplished if done in a \n     bipartisan manner and we believe that your bill will go a \n     long way toward accomplishing that goal. We will work with \n     you to ensure that this bill has bipartisan support as it \n     begins to move.

Chafee, Mr. Bryan, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 2591. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \ntax credits for alternative fuel vehicles and retail sale of \nalternative fuels, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  alternative fuels tax incentives act\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today, Senator Hatch and I, \ntogether with Senators Rockefeller, Chafee, Bryan, and Kerry are \nintroducing a bill which we believe will serve two important national \ninterests: air quality and energy security. We call it the \n``Alternative Fuels Tax Incentives Act,'' and it consists of a series \nof temporary tax provisions to encourage purchases of cars and trucks \noperating on alternative fuels, and to promote the retail sale of these \nfuels.\n  The sharp gasoline price spikes earlier this year were a reminder of \nwhat can happen when the United States is not in control of the source \nof the energy it consumes. Some of us remember the long lines in the \nmid-1970s, when the Middle East pipeline was shut down, when service \nstations rationed the amount of gas you could buy, and when fistfights \nbroke out over gasoline purchases. Science is now taking us to a point \nwhere we can develop other sources of energy and free ourselves from \nthis over-reliance on foreign oil.\n  Imports of foreign oil now exceed 50 percent of our oil consumption. \nMost of the oil that we use--more than two-thirds--is used for \ntransportation. But there's some good news: cars and trucks that \noperate with alternative fuels are rapidly becoming a fact of life. \nEach of the major automobile manufacturers offers alternative fuel \nvehicles, but low production volume and high initial costs have impeded \ntheir widespread use and adoption. Consumers and businesses are \nreceptive to alternative fuel vehicles and electric vehicles, but are \noften reluctant to pay the additional costs manufacturers charge for \nthem.\n  This bill's tax incentives will make those vehicles more cost \ncompetitive. With their environmentally-friendly fuels, these vehicles \nwill mean significant benefits to the air we breathe. The levels of \npollutants emitted by these alternative fuels vehicles are a tiny \nfraction of those released from a conventional gasoline or diesel \nengine. Some of these cars don't even have tail-pipes. To assure that \nowners of alternative fuel vehicles can find fuels\n\n[[Page S4200]]\n\nfor their cars, the bill also provides for two incentives to encourage \nthe retail sales of alternative fuels: a tax credit for retailers for \neach gasoline gallon-equivalent of alternative fuel sold, and a \nprovision allowing retailers to immediately expense up to $100,000 of \nthe costs of alternative fuel refueling infrastructure.\n  Passing this bill would mean cleaner air, energy independence, and \nmore jobs in a developing sector of the auto industry. We have the \ntechnology and the resources to accomplish these goals. And we have \nmanufacturers ready to deliver. It shouldn't take another oil crisis \nfor us to get moving on this.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and colleague, \nSenator Jeffords, to introduce the Alternative Fuels Tax Incentives \nAct. I am pleased that we are being joined by Senators Rockefeller, \nRobb, Chafee, and Bryan as original cosponsors.\n  This bill is an outgrowth of S. 1003, the Alternative Fuels Promotion \nAct of 1999, which was sponsored by many of the same sponsors of this \nyear's bill. And, like S. 1003, the bill we are introducing today is \ndesigned to achieve two vital goals--reduce our dependency on foreign \noil and reduce air pollution from motor vehicles.\n  While the goals of both of these bills are the same, Mr. President, \nthe Alternative Fuels Incentive Act takes a similar, but more \ncomprehensive approach to achieving them.\n  There is a little dispute that our growing dependency on imported oil \nis dangerous, not only to our continued economic growth, but also to \nour national security. We are witnessing again this year just how \nvolatile the price of gasoline and other motor fuels are and how \ndecisions made by oil producers far from our shores affect the everyday \nlives of all Americans. As we increase our dependence of energy from \nothers nations, we are literally placing our future in the hands of \nforeign entities. Yet, we are stymied at every turn in trying to \nsignificantly increase the discovery and development of new domestic \nsources of oil.\n  At the same time, we continue to face serious air quality challenges \nfrom our almost exclusive use of conventional fuels for motor vehicles. \nJust in my home state of Utah, transportation vehicles account for 87 \npercent of carbon monoxide emissions, 52 percent of nitrogen oxide \nemissions, 34 percent of hydrocarbon emissions, and 22 percent of \ncoarse particulate matter in the air. All of these emissions can be \nharmful to individuals suffering from chronic respiratory illnesses, \nheart disease, asthma, and other ailments.\n  More than just harming our health, however, these emissions detract \nfrom the natural beauty of our country. Furthermore, as the United \nStates grows in population and dependency on automobile transportation, \nthese problems will only become worse unless something is done to turn \nthe tide.\n  Fortunately, Mr. President, answers to both problems exist. Vehicle \ntechnology using domestically plentiful and clean-burning alternative \nfuels have advanced to the point that, if widely adapted by Americans, \nwe could reverse the course on both foreign dependence and clean air. \nThe challenge is in getting over the hurdle of initial acceptance of \nthe new technologies by the American public.\n  In essence, there are currently three market barriers to this initial \nacceptance of alternative fuels vehicles by Americans--the incremental \ncost of the vehicles over conventionally-fueled vehicles, the cost of \nthe fuel, and the lack of convenient fueling stations. Providing \nincentives--not mandates--to overcome all three of these barriers is \nwhat this bill is all about.\n  Mr. President, the bill addresses the first barrier--the extra cost \nof the alternative fuels vehicles--by providing a tax credit for a \nportion of the difference in cost. This is key component of the bill \nthat was lacking in S. 1003. By bringing the cost of these vehicles \nwithin the range where savings on the cost of the alternative fuel will \nmake owning these vehicles economically viable over the life of the \nvehicle, public acceptance of the technology should rapidly increase. \nOnce this occurs, production economies of scale will bring the price of \nthe vehicles down further.\n  The bill addresses the second and third market barriers, that of fuel \ncost and availability, by providing tax credits for the alternative \nfuels and tax benefits for suppliers who decide to sell it to the \npublic. This is important because the ready availability of the fuel in \nall geographic locations where the public needs to go or to send goods \nis key to their acceptance of alternative fuels vehicles. These tax \nbenefits, when combined with the market effect caused by the demand for \nmore fueling stations created by the purchase of more vehicles, will \nhelp ensure that such stations will appear where people need them.\n  Mr. President, the incentive approach taken by this bill is meant to \nprovide a temporary bridge over these barriers. If this approach works, \nthe tax incentives will not be needed in the long run. This is why we \nhave placed a seven-year sunset on these provisions. At the end of this \nperiod, Congress should take a close look at how well these incentives \nworked and how the market has developed.\n  There is little doubt that sooner or later this Nation will have to \nturn to alternative fuels to help solve the two problems I mentioned \nearlier. I believe it should be sooner and the move should be \nincentive-based and market-driven. The bill we are introducing today \ncan create the momentum to get us to a cleaner and more secure America \nmuch sooner. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I gladly lend my support to the \nAlternative Fuels Tax Incentives Act being introduced by Senator \nJeffords, along with Senators Hatch, Robb, Kerry, Bryan, and Chafee. I \njoin with my colleagues because of my longstanding dedication to \nincreasing the use of alternative fuels for transportation, and my \nunderstanding that to do so we must stimulate interest in the still \nfledgling alternative fuel vehicle industry. The success of this \nindustry, and the acceptance of these vehicles in the market place, is \ncritical to lowering our dependence on imported oil, improving the \nquality of the air we breathe, and reducing the greenhouse gases our \nnation emits.\n  Let me take a few moments to relate some of the reasons why it is so \nimportant that we reduce our consumption of petroleum and use \nalternative sources of energy. The first and most tangible reason is \nthe need to reduce our nation's dependence on foreign oil. Currently, \nwe import more than half of the oil consumed in this nation. That \ntranslates to $180,000 per minute that is being spent to purchase \nforeign oil. That's bad for our balance of trade, but more important, \nnone of us want to continue to have our energy costs fluctuate and \nspike at the whim of OPEC or any other foreign organization. The recent \nprice increase shows just how important this is, and how vulnerable we \nare.\n  A second reason is that it is critical that we reduce the \ntransportation sector's negative impact on air quality. While the \nautomobile industry has made great strides in reducing the emissions of \ncars and trucks, the improvement has been largely offset by the \ndramatically increasing number of miles these vehicles are driven each \nyear, and by our increasing desire for larger, more powerful vehicles. \nIn 1980, light trucks, a category that includes minivans and SUVs, \naccounted for only 19.9 percent of the U.S. automobile market. \nTraditionally, these vehicles have been exempted from corporate average \nfuel economy (CAFE) standards. In the past couple of years, some in \nCongress have been successful in blocking any adjustment to CAFE \nstandards, including the inclusion of SUVs and minivans. Now the reason \nfor including them is even more obvious. By 1998, these larger vehicles \naccounted for 47.5 percent of the automobile market, with SUVs alone \naccounting for 18.1 percent. Clearly, doing something to cut air \npollution and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will require an \nenormous change in our transportation sector.\n  Because I believe it is the right thing to do for the people of West \nVirginia, and for the nation as a whole, I have been a long-time \nsupporter of research into, incentives for, and commercial \nimplementation of alternative fuel technologies. During my first term \nin the United States Senate, I introduced the Alternative Motor Vehicle \nAct of 1988. That legislation has been credited with a dramatic \nincrease in the production of alternatively fueled vehicles,\n\n[[Page S4201]]\n\nnotably the so-called flexibly-fueled vehicles, which run on either \nalternative fuels or gasoline. In fact, 500,000 of the 17 million cars \nsold in the United States in 1999 were flexible-fuel vehicles. In 1992, \nwhen Congress passed the Energy Policy Act (EPAct), I authored and \nsupported a number of provisions in that law to promote the use of \nalternatively-fueled and electric vehicles through tax credits for \nvehicle purchase and installation of supporting infrastructure.\n\n  Finally, just over a year ago, along with my colleagues Senators \nHatch, Crapo, and Bryan, I introduced the Alternative Fuels Promotion \nAct, S. 1003. Both the Alternative Fuels Tax Incentives Act introduced \ntoday, and the Alternative Fuels Promotion Act introduced last year, \nwould provide the alternative fuel vehicle industry some of the help it \nneeds to begin to get a sustainable foothold in the market place. While \nthese bills differ in the size and type of tax incentives, I strongly \nbelieve that both bills are appropriate steps toward a cleaner \nenvironment and a more energy independent nation.\n  As I have stated on the Floor of the Senate before, the options for \nbringing about change in the transportation sector are somewhat \nlimited. Congress could impose new taxes, mandates, or regulations. \nHowever, these approaches are sometimes unpopular with both the \nAmerican people and our colleagues in Congress. I believe the best way \nto bring about the change we need is to provide incentives for \nmanufacturers to develop and sell clean technology and for consumers to \nbuy and use this technology. I believe that the Alternative Fuels Tax \nIncentives Act being introduced today offers manufacturers and \nconsumers these necessary incentives.\n  Our domestic automobile manufacturers have developed a number of \nclean-running and efficient vehicles. These vehicles are virtually \nindistinguishable from their gasoline-powered counterparts in terms of \nperformance, safety, and comfort. However, there are still two major \nbarriers to widespread acceptance. The first is cost. Though \nmanufacturers have made great strides in reducing the cost of these \nvehicles, most, including those powered by natural gas, propane, \nmethanol, and electricity, are still significantly more expensive than \ntheir gasoline-powered counterparts.\n  A second critical roadblock impeding acceptance of alternatively \nfueled vehicles is the lack of an adequate refueling infrastructure. I \nreceived a call a few months ago from a woman who had just purchased a \ncompressed natural gas-powered car made by a domestic manufacturer. Her \nentire car pool loved the car, especially the absence of any ``exhaust \nsmell'' when you stood behind the car. She was calling to find out if \nwe could help her locate more places to fuel it. She lives in Boston, \nand knew of only three fueling stations within a reasonable driving \narea. If this is the case in a major metropolitan area--which has a \nsignificant number of compressed natural gas-powered fleets in \noperation--it is clear that we have a long way to go. The Alternative \nFuels Promotion Act offers strong incentives aimed at minimizing these \nroadblocks.\n  We know that when national policy supports the creative energies and \npotential of the private sector, progress is made at a faster rate. The \nprivate sector is leading the way in developing alternative fuel \nvehicle technology. We need to provide consumers with a strong \nfinancial incentive to use this technology. Certainly, our continued \ndependence on foreign oil and the contribution of conventionally-\npowered vehicles to air pollution--including greenhouse gases--compels \nus to try. I encourage my colleagues to take a hard look at our \nenvironment and our national energy security, and to pass the \nAlternative Fuels Tax Incentives Act during this Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this statement be inserted in the Record \nimmediately after Senator Jeffords' statement introducing the \nAlternative Fuels Tax Incentives Act.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original co-sponsor of \nthe Alternative Fuels Tax Incentive Act. This legislation will help \naccomplish two things. First, it will promote the production and use of \ncars that use clean fuels, and will consequently improve air quality. \nSecondly, the tax credit will improve our energy independence. I \nhonestly believe that one of the best things we can do for this country \nis to find a way to fuel transportation that is cleaner, and more \nreliable. Our automobile emissions get cleaner every year. But there \nare more of us on the road every year, and we drive more miles every \nyear. So we have to keep increasing our efforts in the direction of \nmore efficient vehicles and cleaner fuels.\n  Earlier this year, we experienced a sharp spike in fuel prices, \ncourtesy of OPEC. It wasn't the first time and it won't be the last. It \nis imperative for our country to keep moving in the direction of energy \nindependence, and I am convinced that it can be done without \nsacrificing convenience, mobility, or the environment. But we need to \nfind a substitute for gasoline, and we need to combine the most \nefficient technologies in a way that provides convenient \ntransportation.\n  New automotive technologies are being developed by automobile \ncompanies, in concert with some of our fine engineering schools. All \nthese technologies show promise, but after the pilot stage and before \nachieving mass appeal, there is a critical phase at which we can help a \nnew idea grow, or we can ignore it and perhaps let it fail. This tax \ncredit is a tool that can be used to bridge the gap between an \nexperimental vehicle and a commercially available vehicle. It \nencompasses the kind of creative thinking that we need to employ if we \nare going to reach a new standard of efficiency in automotive \ntechnology.\n  I look forward to a full discussion of the benefits of this bill, and \nhope my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill, and move for \nquick passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kerry, \n        Mr. Bryan, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Reed, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Bayh, and \n        Mr. Edwards):\n  S. 2592. A bill to establish a program to promote access to financial \nservices, in particular for low- and moderate-income persons who lack \naccess to such services, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                       First Accounts Act of 2000\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to address a very \nserious problem facing our nation: millions of low- and moderate-income \nAmericans lack adequate access to basic financial services. I am \npleased to introduce the First Accounts Act of 2000 (``FAA''). This \nbill, which has been proposed by the Administration, establishes a \npilot program within the Department of the Treasury designed to promote \naccess to financial services for the millions of low- and moderate \nincome persons currently facing barriers to affordable and convenient \nbanking services. Joining as original co-sponsors in the introduction \nof this legislation are the Senate Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, \nand my fellow Democratic members of the Banking Committee--Senators \nDodd, Kerry, Bryan, Johnson, Reed, Schumer, Edwards, and Bayh.\n  Access to basic banking services is essential for Americans seeking \nto participate fully in our increasingly complex financial and economic \nsystem. Unfortunately, recent studies show that millions of families \nlack access to affordable banking accounts and safe and secure ATMs, \nand do not have adequate knowledge of beneficial financial services and \nproducts. The lack of information and access to such financial services \nlimits economic opportunities for low- and moderate-income persons, \nsteers them toward high cost services offered by fringe operators in \nthe financial services industry, reduces their ability to manage their \nfinances and plan for the future, and may even place these individuals \nat a risk to their personal safety. Under the bill, the Treasury \nDepartment is authorized to partner with financial institutions, \ncommunity organizations, and financial services electronic networks to \nimprove access to mainstream financial services in four ways: \naffordable banking accounts, safe and secure ATMs, extensive financial \nliteracy, and research and development efforts.\n\n\n                      Affordable Banking Accounts\n\n  First, the bill would promote access to financial services by helping \nwrite-down the cost to depository institutions of establishing low-cost \naccounts\n\n[[Page S4202]]\n\nfor low- and moderate-income consumers. According to the Federal \nReserve, approximately 8.4 million low- and moderate-income families \ndid not have a bank account in 1998. This represents 22% of such \nhouseholds. The high cost of banking services--particularly high \nminimum opening balances and monthly fee--remains a major obstacle to \nmany families establishing a relationship with a federally-insured \ndepository institution. According to the Federal Reserve Board, the \naverage minimum opening balance requirement was $115 in 1997. Moreover, \na 1999 U.S. Public Interest Research Group study revealed that \nconsumers who could not meet account minimum balances at banks paid an \naverage of $217 annually.\n  Althoguh seven states currently require banks to offer some form of \nlow-cost banking accounts, there is a growing recognition that banks \nwould voluntarily expand access to affordable accounts with appropriate \nencouragement. For instance, Treasury currently provides incentives \nunder the Electronic Funds Transfer (``EFT'') program to banks that \nprovide low-cost accounts for recipients of government checks. More \nthan 538 federally-insured institutions signed up to offer the low-cost \naccount during the first nine months of the EFT program.\n  I am pleased to have worked closely with Treasury in developing the \nEFT program to extend its benefits to the ``unbanked'' who receive \ngovernment checks. This legislation would build on that experience to \nextend the benefits of direct deposit accounts to those who receive \nprivate sector checks.\n  The lack of access to basic banking services creates numerous \ndifficulties for the ``unbanked.'' First, it increases the cost of \nfinancial transactions for law- and moderate-income persons. These \nindividuals pay high service fees to check cashing outlets and other \nnonbanks when cashing checks and purchasing money orders. A 1998 study \nby the Organization for a New Equality showed that over a lifetime, a \nlow-income family could pay over $15,000 in fees for cashing checks and \npaying bills outside the financial services mainstream.\n  Moreover, the lack of a banking account often makes it difficult for \nlow- and moderate-income individuals to establish traditional credit \nand limits their ability to access other financial products. First-time \nhomeowner programs, rental property managers, utility companies, and \ncredit card companies are increasingly requiring applicants to have \nbank accounts. In the absence of a relationship with banks, low- and \nmoderate-income individuals often end up as customers of fringe bankers \nwho charge them exorbitant fees to access credit.\n\n\n                          safe and secure atms\n\n  Second, Treasury would provide assistance to banks and financial \nservices automated networks that expand the availability of ATMs in \nsafe, secure, and convenient locations in low-income neighborhoods. The \navailability of convenient and safe ATMs and point-of-sale terminals is \ntaken for granted by most Americans. However, a substantial number of \nAmericans live in communities where there are either no ATMs or the \nATMs are located in unsafe and insecure environments. A recent Treasury \nanalysis of census tracts in Los Angeles and New York showed that there \nwere nearly twice as many ATMs in middle-income census tracts than \nthere were in low-income areas. The absence of safe and secure ATMs in \nmany neighborhoods places residents in situations that risk their \npersonal safety. Every day many low- and moderate-income Americans \ndecide between the risk of carrying large sums of money on their \npersons and going to an ATM at night. The FAA would increase the number \nof safe and secure access points into the financial mainstream by \nworking with financial institutions and financial services networks to \ninstall ATMs in secure locations such as U.S. post offices. A pilot \nprogram between Treasury and a major financial institution has already \nplaced ATMs in post offices in underserved communities in Baltimore and \nTallahassee, and there are plans to expand the program to post offices \nacross the country.\n\n\n                           financial literacy\n\n  Third, FAA would support financial education for low- and moderate-\nincome Americans. Proponents of affordable banking services and \nproducts have come to recognize that the creation and design of these \nservices only represents an initial step to improving access for this \nsegment of the population. States such as New York have discovered that \ndespite the existence of affordable banking accounts targeted towards \nunderserved communities, many people do not take advantage of such \nservices because they either do not know that such services are \navailable or do not believe that they would benefit. This lack of \ninformation remains one of the greatest obstacles to bringing \n``unbanked'' Americans into the economic mainstream. Through \npartnerships with community organizations and a public awareness \ncampaign, Treasury will educate low- and moderate-income Americans \nabout the availability of affordable financial services and the \nusefulness of having a bank account, managing household finances and \nbuilding assets.\n\n\n                        research and development\n\n  Finally, the FAA authorizes the Treasury to conduct research and \ndevelopment in order to expand access to financial services for low- \nand moderate-income communities.\n  The Administration has strongly supported expanding access to \nfinancial services for all Americans. The FAA would build upon and \nexpand current initiatives by the Administration. The Administration's \nFY 2001 budget seeks an appropriation of $30 million in fiscal year \n2001 for this program.\n  The First Accounts Act will help millions of low- and moderate-income \nAmericans who lack access to affordable and convenient financial \nservices to become part of the economic mainstream. This will be to \ntheir benefit, the benefit of the financial institutions with which \nthey do business, and the benefit of our society as a whole. This \nmodest legislation can make an enormous contribution to giving all \nAmericans the opportunity to participate fully in our current economic \nprosperity. I urge its support by all of my colleagues.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GORTON (for himself, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Voinovich, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. Crapo, and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 2597. A bill to clarify that environmental protection, safety, and \nhealth provisions continue to apply to the functions of the National \nNuclear Security Administration to the same extent as those provisions \napplied to those functions before transfer to the Administration; to \nthe Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n             legislation assuring cleanup of defense sites\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in 1989, the Department of Energy \nsigned an historic agreement with the State of Washington and the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, committing to clean up the Hanford \nNuclear Reservation in the South-Central part of the State of \nWashington. This pact, known as ``The Tri-Party Agreement'' has, for \nthe most part, worked well to assure that the federal government keeps \nits commitment to the citizens of the state of Washington to keep the \nbyproducts of nuclear materials production from harming the people who \nlive and work in that area.\n  Last year, responding to different pressures, Congress created the \nNational Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). Some officials, \nincluding my own state Attorney General, are concerned that the \ncreation of the NNSA may create some uncertainty as to the Department \nof Energy's continued legal obligation to clean up the site. The NNSA \nwas never intended to disrupt the enforceability of legal agreements \nthat assure sites such as Hanford are to be cleaned up under specific \ntimelines.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to clarify that environmental, \nsafety and health provisions continue to apply to the functions of the \nrecently created NNSA to the same extent as they applied to those \nfunctions before transfer to the NNSA.\n  While the legislative history of the legislation creating the \nNational Nuclear Security Administration demonstrated clear \nCongressional intent that the NNSA remain subject to state, federal and \nlocal environment, safety and health requirements, some have raised \nconcern that the legislation could be construed as narrowing the \nexisting waivers of federal sovereign immunity with respect to these \nrequirements.\n\n[[Page S4203]]\n\n  The Department of Energy hosts some of the most challenging \nenvironmental contamination sites in the country. Although the Hanford \nsite is perhaps the biggest challenge, there are sites in several other \nstates as well.\n  It is critical to the preservation of the environment and the \nprotection of human health that states maintain their existing \nauthority to enforce environmental, safety, and health requirements \nwith respect to Department of Energy facilities under the NNSA's \ncontrol.\n  A wide range of support exists for this legislation clarifying that \nthe earlier legislation creating the NNSA was not intended to impair \nstate regulatory authority over facilities under the NNSA's \njurisdiction. Organizations supporting this legislation include the \nNational Governors Association, the National Conference of State \nLegislatures, and the National Association of Attorneys General.\n  Just as this bill will clarify that the NNSA does not impair state \nregulatory authority over facilities under the NNSA's jurisdiction, the \nbill is carefully worded so as not to expand the states' authority in \nthis regard. This bill simply reaffirms the ability of states to use \nthe enforcement measures that are contained in cleanup agreements made \nwith the federal government, such as the Tri-Party Agreement.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Hatch, Mr. \n        Daschle, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Moynihan, Mrs. Boxer, \n        Mr. Schumer, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Kohl, Mr. \n        Levin, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Robb, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. \n        Lieberman, and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 2598. A bill to authorize appropriations for the United States \nHolocaust Memorial Museum, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n        united states holocaust memorial museum reauthorization\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation which reauthorizes appropriations for the United States \nHolocaust Memorial Museum. In addition to extending the authorization \nfor the museum and the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, the \nbill makes several clarifying and conforming changes to the 1980 \nenabling legislation to incorporate the recommendations of a recently \ncompleted review of the museum and the council by the National Academy \nof Public Administration.\n  As described in the museum's mission statement, the United States \nHolocaust Memorial Museum is America's national institution for the \ndocumentation, study, and interpretation of Holocaust history, and \nserves as this country's memorial to the millions of people murdered \nduring the Holocaust. The Museum's primary mission is to advance and \ndisseminate knowledge about this unprecedented tragedy; to preserve the \nmemory of those who suffered; and to encourage its visitors to reflect \nupon the moral and spiritual questions raised by the events of the \nHolocaust as well as their own responsibilities as citizens of a \ndemocracy.\n  Since the museum was opened to the public in 1993, it has been one of \nthe most heavily visited sites in our nation's capital, with more than \n2 million visitors last year. Previous bills authorizing appropriations \nfor the museum have enjoyed broad bipartisan support, and I am pleased \nthat this bill is no exception, with over 17 original cosponsors on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. President, identical legislation has already been introduced in \nthe other body. Given the broad support for the museum and the memorial \ncouncil, it is my hope that the Senate will approve this legislation \nexpeditiously. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2598\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill \nwith my good friend, Senator Bingaman that will reauthorize the United \nStates Holocaust Memorial Museum.\n  The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum is America's national \ninstitution for the documentation, study, and interpretation of the \nhistory of the Holocaust and serves as this country's memorial to the \nmillions of people murdered during the Holocaust.\n  The Museum's primary mission is to advance and disseminate knowledge \nabout the unprecedented tragedy; to preserve the memory of those who \nsuffered; and to encourage its visitors to reflect upon the moral \nquestions raised by the events of the Holocaust as well as their own \nresponsibilities as citizens of a democracy.\n  The work of the Museum is not limited to the building which overlooks \nthe tidal basin here in Washington, D.C. I and my constituents in \nAlaska have benefitted from the work of the Museum. Through a system of \nvery well designed traveling exhibits the Museum has been able to bring \nthe story of the Holocaust, and its related history to millions of \nAmericans nationwide. I know my constituents in Anchorage and Fairbanks \nwill never forget their opportunity to view the traveling programs.\n  The legislation makes some changes in the management authorities for \nthe Museum and streamlines the procedures to appoint the Museum's \nDirector. The legislation also provides the United States Holocaust \nMemorial Museum with the same permanent authorization as we have \npreviously provided for the Smithsonian Institution.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Grams, Mr. Kennedy, \n        Ms. Snowe, Mr. Craig, Ms. Collins, Mr. Gorton, Mr.  Jeffords, \n        Mr. Schumer, Mr. Graham, Mr. Levin, Mr. DeWine, and Mrs. \n        Murray):\n  S. 2599. A bill to amend section 110 of the Illegal Immigration \nReform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\nimmigration and naturalization service data management improvement act \n                                of 2000\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service Data Management Improvement Act of 2000. \nThis bill is designed to save jobs in Michigan and other states and \nprevent potentially enormous, hours-long traffic delays on the U.S.-\nCanadian border. That is achieved by amending Section 110 of the 1996 \nimmigration law.\n  Mr. President, Section 110 of the 1996 Immigration Act mandated that \nan automated system be established to record the entry and exit of all \naliens as a means to provide more information on individuals who ``over \nstay''\n\n[[Page S4205]]\n\ntheir visas. In the opinion of many it became clear that this well-\nintentioned measured, if implemented, could have an unforeseen impact. \nToday, when INS or Customs officials inspect people at land borders, \nthey examine papers as necessary and make quick determinations, using \ntheir discretion on when to solicit more information. According to Dan \nStamper, President of the Detroit International Bridge Company, if \nevery single passenger of every single vehicle were required to provide \ndetailed information in a form that could be entered into a computer--\neven assuming an incredibly quick 30 seconds per individual--the \ntraffic delays could exceed 20 hours in numerous jurisdictions at the \nNorthern border. This would obviously create significant economic and \neven environmental harm. Moreover, it would divert scarce law \nenforcement resources away from more effective measures.\n  Out of concern for its harmful impact on Michigan and law \nenforcement, I passed legislation in 1998 to delay implementation of \nSection 110 from its original start date of Sept. 30, 1998, until March \n30, 2001. But it remained clear that a delay could not sufficiently \nsatisfy concerns that the INS might develop a system that would prove \nharmful to the people of Michigan and other states.\n  Mr. President, Fred Upton showed great leadership in the House on \nthis issue and served his constituents extraordinarily well in helping \nto forge this compromise. Lamar Smith deserves great credit for working \nclosely with us and his other House colleagues in making an agreement \nthat meets the economic and security interests of all sides on this \nissue.\n  This is a great victory for the people of Michigan. This agreement \nstrikes the right balance in enhancing our security and immigration \nenforcement needs while ensuring that we preserve the jobs and the \nother economic benefits Michigan receives from our close relationship \nwith Canada.\n  This bill, the product of the agreement with the House, replaces the \ncurrent requirement that by March 30, 2001, a record of arrival and \ndeparture be collected for every alien at all ports of entry with a \nmore achievable requirement that the Immigration and Naturalization \nService develop an ``integrated entry and exit data system'' that \nfocuses on data INS already regularly collects at ports of entry.\n  The goal of Section 110 has been to track individuals who overstay \ntheir allowable stay in the United States. That goal is redirected into \na more achievable direction. INS will be directed to put in electronic \nand retrievable form the information already collected at ports of \nentry and pursue other measures steps to improve enforcement of U.S. \nimmigration laws. In addition, a task force chaired by the Attorney \nGeneral that will include representatives of other government agencies \nand the private sector is established to examine the need for and costs \nof any additional measures, including additional security measures, at \nour borders. The bill also calls for increased international \ncooperation in securing the land borders.\n\n  In essence, the agreement substitutes this approach in place of a \nmandate that a system be developed that would have required that all \nforeign travelers or U.S. permanent residents be individually recorded \ninto a system at ports of entry and exit, thereby likely bringing \ntraffic to a halt on the northern border for miles, trapping U.S. \ntravelers in the process and costing potentially tens of thousands of \njobs in manufacturing, tourism and other industries. The agreement also \nmaintains the status quo in preventing new documentary requirements on \nCanadian travelers.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is that we will have a system that \nenhances law enforcement capabilities and will not impose new or \nonerous requirements on travelers that would damage Americans or the \nAmerican economy.\n  I would like to thank the cosponsors of this legislation who have \nbeen so important in achieving success in this long three-year effort: \nSenators Leahy, Grams, Kennedy, Snowe, Collins, Craig, Gorton, \nJeffords, Schumer, Graham, Levin, DeWine, and Murray.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2599\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING INTERNATIONAL BORDER \n                   MANAGEMENT COOPERATION.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that the Attorney General, \n     in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of \n     Commerce, and the Secretary of the Treasury,\n\n[[Page S4207]]\n\n     should consult with affected foreign governments to improve \n     border management cooperation.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor this bill, which \nwill help protect both America's economy and our relationship with \nCanada. In particular, citizens of states all across our Northern \nBorder should breathe a sigh of relief that we appear to be close to \nfinding a legislative solution to a potentially serious problem brewing \nalong our border with Canada.\n  This bill will replace section 110 of the Illegal Immigration Reform \nand Responsibility Act (IIRIRA). Section 110 would mandate that the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service (INS) establish an automated \nsystem to record the entry and exit of all aliens in order to track \ntheir movements within the United States and to determine those who \n``overstay'' their visas. the system has not yet been implemented.\n  By requiring an automated system for monitoring the entry and exit of \n``all aliens,'' this provision requires that INS and Customs agents \nstop each vehicle or individual entering or exiting the United States \nat all ports of entry. Canadians, U.S. permanent residents and many \nothers who are not currently required to show documentation of their \nstatus would likely either have to carry some form of identification or \nfill out paperwork at the points of entry.\n  This sort of tracking system would be costly to implement along the \nNorthern Border, especially since there is no current system or \ninfrastructure to track the departure of citizens and others leaving \nthe United States.\n  Section 110 would also lead to excessive and costly traffic delays \nfor those living and working near the border. These delays would surely \nhave a negative impact on the $2.4 billion in goods and services \nshipped annually from Vermont to Canada and would likely reduce the \n$120 million per year which Canadians spend in Vermont.\n  The Immigration and Naturalization Service Data Management \nImprovement Act will replace the existing Section 110 with a new \nprovision that requires the Attorney General to implement an \n``integrated entry and exit data system.'' This system would simply \nintegrate the arrival and departure data which already is authorized or \nrequired to be collected under current law, and which is in electronic \nformat within databases held by the Justice and State Departments. The \nINS would not be required to take new steps to collect information from \nthose entering and leaving the country, meaning that Canadians will \nhave the same ability to enter the United States as they do today.\n  This bill will ensure that tourists and trade continue to freely \ncross the border, without additional documentation requirements. This \nbill will also guarantee that more than $1 billion daily cross-border \ntrade is not hindered in any way. Just as importantly, Vermonters and \nothers who cross our nation's land borders on a daily basis to work or \nvisit with family or friends should be able to continue to do so \nwithout additional border delays.\n  This is an issue that I have worked on ever since section 110 was \noriginally adopted in 1996. In 1997, along with Senator Abraham and \nothers, I introduced the ``Border Improvement and Immigration Act of \n1997.'' Among other things, that legislation would have (1) \nspecifically exempted Canadians from any new documentation or paperwork \nrequirements when crossing the border into the United States; (2) \nrequired the Attorney General to discuss the development of \n``reciprocal agreements'' with the Secretary of State and the \ngovernments of contiguous countries to collect the data on visa \noverstayers; and (3) required the Attorney General to increase the \nnumber of INS inspectors by 300 per year and the number of Customs \ninspectors by 150 per year for the next three years, with at least half \nof those inspectors being assigned to the Northern Border.\n  I also worked with Senator Abraham, Senator Kennedy, and other \nSenators to obtain postponements in the implementation date for the \nautomated system mandated by section 110. We were successful in those \nattempts, delaying implementation until March 30, 2001. But delays are \nby nature only a temporary solution; in the legislation we introduce \ntoday, I believe we have found a permanent solution that allows us to \nkeep track of the flow of foreign nationals entering and leaving the \nUnited States without crippling commerce or our important relationship \nwith Canada. That is why I am proud to support this legislation, and \nwhy I urge prompt action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/18/senate-section/article/S4207-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4207-S4208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 74\n\n  At the request of Mr. Daschle, the name of the Senator from Maryland \n(Mr. Sarbanes) was added as a cosponsor of S. 74, a bill to amend the \nFair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to provide more effective remedies to \nvictims of discrimination in the payment of wages on the basis of sex, \nand for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 345\n\n  At the request of Mr. Allard, the name of the Senator from Indiana \n(Mr. Bayh) was added as a cosponsor of S. 345, a bill to amend the \nAnimal Welfare Act to remove the limitation that permits interstate \nmovement of live birds, for the purpose of fighting, to States in which \nanimal fighting is lawful.\n\n\n                                 S. 801\n\n  At the request of Mr. Santorum, the name of the Senator from Wyoming \n(Mr. Thomas) was added as a cosponsor of S. 801, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to reduce the tax on beer to its pre-1991 \nlevel.\n\n\n                                 S. 890\n\n  At the request of Mr. Wellstone, the names of the Senator from \nCalifornia (Mrs. Boxer) and the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Helms) \nwere added as cosponsors of S. 890, a bill to facilitate the \nnaturalization of aliens who served with special guerrilla units or \nirregular forces in Laos.\n\n\n                                S. 1159\n\n  At the request of Mr. Stevens, the name of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland (Mr. L.

Mr. President, I know the distinguished leader has been \nworking on trying to find a way to confirm some more judges. I hope we \ndo.\n  I remind the Senate, and the American public, that there is a \nmistaken belief that in a Presidential election year we stop confirming \njudges. That is not so.\n  As one who has been here for 25 years, I note that there is an \ninformal procedure called the Thurmond rule, named after our beloved \nPresident pro tempore, the Senator from South Carolina, Strom Thurmond. \nThis rule basically says that as we get close to the Presidential \nelection time--July, August, and into the fall--we slow down and nearly \nstop the confirmation of judges to lifetime appointments to see how the \nPresidential election comes out, because the next President will be \nable to nominate judges.\n  But having said that, I point out what happened in the last year of \nPresident Bush's term. Democrats controlled the Senate, and we \nconfirmed 66 judges--66 judges nominated by President Bush--more than \nhave been confirmed in any year of President Clinton's term in which \nthere has been a Republican majority, even when he was not facing \nreelection. In 1996 they confirmed only 17 judges all year.\n  With a Democratic Senate in the last year of President Reagan's term, \nwe did not have this kind of a slowdown and stoppage. Democrats \nconfirmed more than 40 judges.\n  I hope we will look, first and foremost, not at some kind of partisan \ngame but at what is best for the judiciary.\n  We are seen throughout the world as having the most independent \nfederal judiciary anywhere. Look at what happens in other parts of the \nworld where the President or Prime Minister or leader of a country can \ntell the judiciary exactly what to do, and they do it. Look at what \nhappened in Peru. President Fujimori got the Supreme Court to allow him \nto run unconstitutionally for a third term.\n  Look at a number of other countries around the world where dictators, \nand those who seize power, get the courts to bend to their will. That \nis not done here in the United States. Our Federal judiciary truly is \nindependent. We should protect their independence by not making judges \na partisan pawn in a political program. We should make sure they remain \nindependent.\n  Democrats have given an enormous amount of flexibility to Republican \nPresidents. I hope--it may be a vain hope--that a Democratic President \nwould get at least a goodly percentage of that same kind of flexibility \nfrom a Republican-controlled Senate. If we were to confirm all 16 of \nthe judges on the Senate Executive Calendar today, we still would only \nhave confirmed 23 judges so far this year. That is about half the total \nfrom 1988 and only one-third of the 66 judges confirmed in 1992.\n  We will not accomplish anything tonight on this. But I urge--as I did \nlast night when I was speaking to the Capitol Historical Society, \nspeaking of the history of the Judiciary Committee, when I praised a \nnumber of Republican chairmen of that committee, from the past and \npresent, and Democratic chairmen--and if I might, just for a moment, \nreflect on my 25 years here--we  should lower our decibel level, \nespecially in this area. I urge that the distinguished Republican \nleader and the distinguished Democratic leader, both of whom are dear \nfriends of mine--and I have enjoyed the friendship and serving with \nthem--might try once again. And the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee, the senior Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, and I will do that, \ntoo, because whatever momentary political advantage either party might \nhave, it does not begin to equate with our responsibility to the \nindependence of the finest judiciary in the world. We should make that \ntry.\n\n  It will not happen tonight, but over the weekend maybe calmer heads \nwill prevail. I see my good friend from Kansas on the floor. He and I \nhave joined on legislation. We are certainly not seen as political and \nphilosophical allies, but we have reached across the aisle on \nsignificant legislation; one of the most significant is the collegiate \ngambling legislation. The distinguished Presiding Officer, the Senator \nfrom Alabama, and I have also joined together and voted together \noftentimes in the Judiciary Committee. We know that, eventually, if \nsomething is going to work it has to have the support of Democrats and \nRepublicans. I mention this because I hope that maybe the temperatures \nwill lower. Let us realize that we have more things to unite us than to \ndivide us and we can work together. I thank my two colleagues for their \nforbearance and letting me take these few minutes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for \nhis thoughtful comments on the need to work together, which I think is \ncritically important. As I understood it, the distinguished Democratic \nleader and the majority leader were getting pretty close to getting \nsomething done and then it fell apart at the end. So I am hopeful that \nmaybe come tomorrow, or the first of next week, those can move forward. \nI agree that we ought to work together in a calmness for the betterment \nof the country. I think we can get that done. This has been a tough \nweek, and I have enjoyed working with my colleague.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/18/senate-section/article/S4210-3", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4210-S4211]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 106-24\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

As the \nreport explains, the Treaty will not require implementing legislation.\n  The provisions in this Treaty follow generally the form and content \nof extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States.\n  The Treaty is one of a series of modern extradition treaties being \nnegotiated by the United States to counter criminal activities more \neffectively. Upon entry into force, the Treaty will replace the \noutdated Treaty Relating to the Reciprocal Extradition of Criminals \nsigned at Washington, December 18, 1947, and in force between the two \ncountries since April 30, 1951. Together with the Treaty Between the \nGovernment of the United States of America and the Government of the \nRepublic of South Africa on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal \nMatters, also signed September 16, 1999, this Treaty will, upon entry \ninto force, enhance cooperation between the law enforcement communities \nof the two countries.

Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nWisconsin, Senator Feingold, as well as my distinguished colleagues \nSenators Wellstone, Grams, Kohl and Grassley, for their leadership and \neffort on behalf of the Hmong veterans and in support of this \nlegislation. Also, I\n\n[[Page S4212]]\n\nwould like to make special mention of Senator Kohl's critical role in \nbringing all parties together and in negotiating this compromise. \nSenator Kohl's role truly was pivotal.\n  With respect to Senator Grams, I would like to point out my \nappreciation for all that he has done to assist the Hmong veterans and \ntheir families in Minnesota.\n  I also appreciate very much the efforts of the Lao Veterans of \nAmerica with their national recognition ceremonies for the Hmong and \nLao veterans of the U.S. Secret Army and the monument that they \ndedicated at Arlington National Cemetery.\n  Mr. President, it is important to state that a negative inference \nshould not be drawn from the fact that in moving this legislation \nthrough the Senate today, the Senate has amended the bill to eliminate \nspecific mention of any one organization. In fact, the distinguished \norganization mentioned in the original House legislation was cited \nbecause of its role in developing, organizing and keeping records \nregarding the service of Hmong and Lao veterans who served with U.S. \nmilitary and covert forces in Laos during the Vietnam War. It, along \nwith other such organizations, may be helpful in providing input for \nthe naturalization of the Hmong veterans and their families.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, for his assistance in getting \nthis legislation to the floor. I concur with Senator Hatch that a \nnegative inference should not be drawn from the fact that the bill was \namended to remove reference to a specific organization. Given that \nthere is reason to believe that the federal government has little, if \nany, remaining records of which Lao and Hmong participated in the U.S. \nSecret Army, I think it is entirely reasonable for the Attorney General \nto consider documentation provided by the Lao Veterans of America or \nother Lao or Hmong veterans' organizations. In fact, I understand that \nthe Lao Veterans of America was named in the House legislation because \nit has maintained extensive records of the Hmong and Lao veterans of \nthe U.S. Secret Army.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Hatch, Senator \nFeingold and Senator Kohl for their work in passing the Hmong Veterans \nNaturalization Act through the Judiciary Committee today. I am proud to \nbe its sponsor in the Senate. In particular, I would like to commend \nRep. Bruce Vento for his efforts on this legislation and his \nextraordinary courage and selfless devotion to the important cause of \nthe Hmong veterans.\n  I would like to affirm my colleagues' remarks and thank the Lao \nVeterans of America, the nation's largest Hmong veterans organization, \nfor its leadership in helping to bring long-overdue national \nrecognition to the Hmong and Lao veterans of the U.S. Secret Army, as \nwell as pushing for the passage of this legislation in the House and \nSenate. Lao Veterans of America is the nation's first non-profit \nveterans organization representing Hmong and Lao veterans of the U.S. \nSecret Army. These veterans and their families served with U.S. \nmilitary and clandestine forces in Laos during the Vietnam War. \nStarting in 1990, the group established and began maintaining the \nnation's largest repository of records relating to the Hmong and Lao \nveterans who served with U.S. clandestine and military forces.\n  Mr. President, the Lao Veterans of America's second largest chapter \nis headquartered in Minnesota. I have heard from hundreds of Hmong \nAmericans in support of this bill over the years. I want to thank them, \nas well as all the Hmong people from Minnesota and around the country \nwho made the passage of this bill possible.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would also like to add my comments. Thank \nyou Chairman Hatch for your kind words and all your help and the help \nof your staff in moving this important legislation forward. Thank you \nas well to my fellow Senator from Wisconsin and Senators Wellstone and \nGrams from Minnesota. I am pleased that we were able to work together \nto reach a compromise and help give the Hmong veterans and their \nfamilies the chance to become citizens. The Hmong community, \nparticularly the Lao Veterans of America, have worked tirelessly to \nbring us to this point. As my colleagues have mentioned, no negative \ninference should be drawn from the compromise language. Last week, I \nwas proud to participate in the Lao Veterans of America National \nRecognition Ceremonies with so many Hmong veterans from Wisconsin. With \nthis bill, we are attempting to repay them for their tremendous \nsacrifices and courage. I hope that we can achieve the final steps and \nsend this bill to the President's desk for signature as soon as \npossible.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I rise today in support of the Hmong Veterans' \nNaturalization Act of 2000, which has passed the House and deserves our \nsupport as well. The beneficiaries of this bill are guerrilla \nsoldiers--and their spouses and widows--who were our allies in Laos \nduring the Vietnam War. Many of these soldiers came to the United \nStates with their families after the war and have contributed to the \nAmerican economy through their labor and by paying taxes. Now many of \nthem seek to become citizens of this country, but find it difficult to \nmeet the prerequisites for naturalization due to the unique \ncharacteristics of their native culture.\n  Until quite recently, the Hmong people had no written language. This \nlack of experience with written language has made it more difficult for \nHmong people who have moved to the United States to learn English, \nwhich in turn makes it more difficult for them to obtain citizenship. \nThis bill would waive the English language requirement and provide \nspecial consideration for the civics requirement for Hmong veterans and \ntheir spouses and widows. It is a small concession to make in return \nfor the great sacrifices that these men made in fighting for the \nAmerican cause in Southeast Asia.\n  I would like to commend Senators Wellstone and Feingold for the \nefforts they have made to draw attention to this issue and this bill, \nand to thank Representative Vento whose persistence has made this bill \npossible. I would also note that this is a bipartisan bill that \nSenators Hagel and McCain have cosponsored. My only disappointment is \nthat the majority made it impossible to report this bill from the \nJudiciary Committee last week, when we were joined at the hearing by \nmany of the brave soldiers whom this bill would benefit. Instead of \nworking out its concerns with the bill's sponsors in advance, the \nmajority insisted upon an 11th-hour amendment, an amendment that--in \nviolation of normal practice--was not distributed to members of this \nCommittee. This conduct came only a week after the majority objected to \nan attempt to pass the House bill on the floor--an attempt that was \ncleared by every Senator on my side of the aisle.\n  But it is better to pass this bill after a delay than not at all. I \nam grateful for the opportunity to have helped bring this bill to the \nfloor today, and I look forward to the day when these brave veterans \nbecome American citizens. It is a privilege that they have more than \nearned.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will take a moment to thank my \ncolleagues for passing S. 890, the Hmong Veterans Naturalization Act. \nFrankly, this bill is long overdue.\n  As the Senator from Minnesota, I am proud to represent the largest \nHmong population in America. There are nearly 70,000 Hmong people \nliving in the twin cities. My experience as a Senator has become so \nmuch greater as a result of coming to know the nobel history and rich \nculture of the Hmong people in Minnesota. I am in awe of their \nsacrifice for the American people.\n  Hmong soldiers died at ten times the rate of American soldiers in the \nVietnam War. As many as 20,000 Hmong fell on the mountains in Laos. \nHmong soldiers were paid $3 a month and often lived off of rice alone. \nWhere American pilots were sent home after a year or after their one \nhundredth mission, Hmong soldiers never stopped fighting. ``Fly till \nyou die'' was what the Hmong soldiers said. And, as adults died, \nchildren as young as twelve were called up to take their place. In \nexchange for their service, the Hmong were given a promise of \nprotection by the United States Government.\n  Yet the promise made on the battlefield was abandoned. When the \nUnited States military fled South East Asia, the Hmong Geurillas were \nleft to fight\n\n[[Page S4213]]\n\nalone. A trail of 100,000 refugees were left to fend for themselves. \nMany were slaughtered as they waited for evacuation planes that never \ncame.\n  Because America's war effort in Laos was covert, perhaps the largest \ncovert action in our history, the sacrifices and service of the Hmong \nand Lao veterans is still largely untold. As a result, many of these \nbrave people are still suffering from poverty, discrimination, and \npersecution.\n  The legislation we passed today is a tribute to this sacrifice. It is \na small but meaningful step in honoring and fulfilling our promise to \nthe Hmong people. This legislation will simply waive the literacy \nrequirement to all Hmong Veterans and their spouses to become citizens \nof the United States--a nation for which so many of them spilled their \nblood and a nation that has long ignored their unique struggle.\n  The need for this legislation is acute because the Hmong had no \nwritten language until recently, and because so many Hmong children \nwere fighting for America when they should have been in school.\n  I want to thank my colleagues for their support. In particular, I \nalso want to take a moment to thank and honor Congressman Bruce Vento. \nHe, more than anyone in the Congress, has dedicated himself to ensure \nthat Hmong and Lao veterans receive the honor and respect that has been \nso long deserved and too long delayed. I also want to thank Chairman \nHatch, for guiding this bill through the Judiciary Committee and \nSenator Russ Feingold who, with Senator Herb Kohl, has worked so hard \nto see that this bill is passed. Mostly, I thank the Hmong people. You \ngave us your lives and your families. You are American heroes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate today \nwill pass H.R. 371, the Hmong Veterans' Naturalization Act. I was proud \nto join my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, as an original \nco-sponsor of S. 890, which was companion legislation to H.R. 371. I \ncommend Senator Wellstone for his leadership on this issue and for his \npersistence in pressing for the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate \nto consider the bill.\n  By passing this legislation today, the Senate recognizes the \ncontribution of Hmong and Lao immigrants who risked their lives to \nsupport U.S. interests in Southeast Asia. The Senate not only \nrecognizes the valor of Hmong and Lao veterans, but also helps them \nachieve their goal of citizenship.\n  Mr. President, Wisconsin is home to the third largest Hmong community \nin the United States. We are proud of the Hmong veterans and their \nfamilies who sacrificed so much for U.S. national security during the \nVietnam War and have done so much to enrich Wisconsin and the United \nStates. I have had the opportunity to meet many Lao and Hmong veterans \nand their families as I travel throughout Wisconsin. I am struck by the \nprofound importance they place on becoming citizens of the United \nStates. The most important thing to many of these individuals is to \nbecome legal citizens of the country they risked their lives to help \nand that they now call home. This bill is the least we can do to help \nrepay the huge debt we owe these brave individuals\n  This legislation is truly long overdue. The Hmong and Lao veterans of \nthe U.S. Secret Army should not have had to suffer for so long in \nobscurity after the end of the Vietnam War. It should not have taken so \nlong for the United States to finally dedicate a monument in Arlington \nNational Cemetery to the Hmong and Lao veterans of the U.S. Secret \nArmy, when it did so in May 1997.\n  Mr. President, the monument at Arlington National Cemetery to the \nHmong veterans contains important language for us to remember as we \npass this legislation today in the Senate. The monument in Arlington \nCemetery, dedicated by many of the Hmong veterans and their families \nfrom Wisconsin and across the United States, reads as follows:\n\n          Dedicated to the U.S. Secret Army in Laos 1961-1973\n\n       In memory of the Hmong and Lao combat veterans and their \n     American Advisors who served freedom's cause in Southeast \n     Asia. Their patriotic valor and loyalty in the defense of \n     liberty and democracy will never be forgotten ``You will \n     never be forgotten. (in Laotian and Hmong)--Lao Veterans of \n     America, May 15, 1997.''\n  Mr. President, I am particularly proud of the Lao Veterans of America \nchapters throughout the state of Wisconsin--in Milwaukee, Green Bay, \nMadison, Wausau, Stevens Point, Sheboygan, Oshkosh, Eau Claire and \nelsewhere. They played a positive role in helping to establish this \nmonument as well as pressing the Congress to enact this legislation. \nThey have also worked with the national headquarters of the Lao \nVeterans of America and its chapters across the United States to \nreconstruct many of the records of the veterans, which were destroyed \nin Laos at the end of the Vietnam War.\n  More than a thousand Hmong veterans from Wisconsin were in \nWashington, D.C. last week to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the \nend of the Vietnam War in Laos and the passage of this legislation in \nthe House of Representatives. Over four thousand Hmong veterans marched \ndown Pennsylvania Avenue and attended ceremonies at the Vietnam War \nMemorial, the U.S. Capitol and Arlington National Cemetery.\n  Mr. President, during the course of our consideration of this bill in \nCommittee, an objection was raised to a provision of the bill that \nspecifically mentions the Lao Veterans of America as an organization \nwhose certification of the eligibility of an individual veteran as \neligible for the benefits of this bill could be considered by the \nAttorney General. Given that there is reason to believe that the \nfederal government has few remaining records of which Lao and Hmong \nparticipated in the U.S. Secret Army, I think it is entirely reasonable \nfor the Attorney General to consider documentation provided by the Lao \nVeterans of America or other Lao or Hmong veterans' organizations. In \nfact, I understand that the Lao Veterans of America was named in the \nHouse legislation because it has maintained extensive records of the \nHmong and Lao veterans of the U.S. Secret Army. Frankly, I do not \nunderstand why this provision became such a sticking point, but in \norder to move this bill along and get it to the President's desk as \nquickly as possible, I agreed to a modification of this provision.\n  I am pleased that we reached agreement that this provision should not \nbe removed in its entirety. And I emphasize, and I know that the \nChairman of the Judiciary Committee agrees, that a negative inference \nshould not be drawn from the fact that the name of this specific \norganization, the Lao Veterans of America, was removed from the bill. \nEven though its name was removed from the bill, the Lao Veterans of \nAmerica can still provide documentation to the Attorney General, and \nthe Attorney General may consider it.\n  Mr. President, I again want to thank Senator Wellstone, Senator Kohl, \nand Senator Hatch for their work to facilitate passage of this \nimportant legislation that will help Hmong veterans finally attain \ntheir well-deserved goal of U.S. citizenship.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill, \nas amended, be read the third time and passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating \nthereto be placed in the Record at the appropriate place as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 371), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield a moment, I thank \nthe Senator from Kansas and others for passing this bill. I know this \nhas been a major cause of our retiring colleague from the other body, \nBruce Vento. We had this before the Judiciary Committee this morning. I \nthank Senator Hatch and the others who helped make it possible to bring \nit out. It rights a grievous wrong, and it is a good piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank my colleague for mentioning that. It is \nimportant that we are getting this bill passed. It is right to bring \nattention to this matter. These are people who have done great things \nfor us and for our country. It should be taken care of. I am glad it \ncleared through committee so well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/18/senate-section/article/S4213-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4213-S4214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENTS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
