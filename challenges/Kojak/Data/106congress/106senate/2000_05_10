Mr. President, I was going to speak for about 15 \nminutes, but if my colleague had expected to speak as one of the \nmanagers, I don't want to precede him.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to speak for a few minutes \nopening up debate on the African trade bill. Senator Moynihan will want \nto make opening comments. After we have completed our remarks, I will \nnot object.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nfollow Senator Grassley and Senator Moynihan for a period of up to 15 \nminutes on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as a person who supports the African \ntrade bill, I rise in support of this conference committee report on \nthe Trade and Development Act of 2000. This legislation contains the \nconference agreement on the African Growth and Opportunity Act, the \nCaribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act, and even some miscellaneous \ntrade measures that were passed as part of the Senate's consideration \nof this legislation in November last year.\n  Passage of the African Growth and Opportunity Act conference \nagreement by the Senate will send to the President the first \nsignificant trade legislation to pass both Houses of Congress since \n1988, other than legislation implementing trade agreements under very \nspecial fast-track procedures.\n  If I could characterize this conference agreement with one word, it \nwould be the word ``opportunity.'' That word is in the title of the \nAfrican portion of this bill.\n  First, this conference agreement provides people in sub-Saharan \nAfrica with the opportunity and promise for a better life. In many \ncases, these countries are not able to sustain their own people. They \nlack even the simplest, most basic infrastructure. This prevents the \npeople of Africa from meeting necessary agriculture, education, \ntransportation, and health care needs.\n  By giving these countries new tools to develop a textile and apparel \nindustry, they will have new opportunities to participate in the global \ntrade flows and the increased prosperity that have largely bypassed the \nmajority of Africa's people.\n  I stress this bill provides opportunity. Once again, this bill is \nabout opportunity. It is not about a guarantee, and it is not about a \npanacea, but an opportunity that has, up until now, been missing for \nthe people of sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n  This legislation will give these countries the opportunity to build \nthe essential capital that struggling economies need to increase their \ninvestment in their own people to help themselves. What we will create \nwith this bill is opportunity for these struggling economies, and do it \nin a way that will not in any way jeopardize U.S. employment.\n  Some 30 sub-Saharan countries of Africa have begun dynamic economic \nreform programs that help make it much easier to pass this bill because \nwe know they are taking the first steps to help themselves. They are \nliberalizing exchange rates; they are privatizing state-owned \nenterprises; they are reducing harmful barriers to trade and \ninvestment; they are also ending costly trade-distorting subsidies.\n  All of these things, for those who believe enhanced freedom of \ninternational trade is the right direction in which to go, always need \na little bit of help from the indigenous economies of the respective \ncountries. We believe the 30 countries of sub-Saharan Africa are doing \nall the right things. This legislation will create greater \nopportunities for new partnerships with these African nations based on \neconomic directions they have already begun to take.\n  The Africa Growth and Opportunity Act is designed to compliment the \neconomic reform policies that African nations have already decided to \npursue by offering increased access to U.S. markets for non-import-\nsensitive goods and textiles while creating enhanced opportunities to \ndeepen our bilateral trade relations.\n  Speaking of opportunity, we will open up for American goods and \nservices a market for 700 million potential new consumers, more than in \nJapan\n\n[[Page S3789]]\n\nand all the ASEAN nations combined, if we approve this conference \nagreement.\n  Both the United States and African nations recognize this legislation \nfor the win-win opportunity it is. The United States benefits and \nAfrica benefits from this legislation. The African Growth and \nOpportunity Act has been endorsed by every African ambassador in \nWashington. We don't see unanimous agreement on many things in these \ncities these days. However, we do here. All of the 48 nations of sub-\nSaharan Africa are united in support of this legislation.\n  The conference agreement is also a win-win opportunity for the \ncountries of the Caribbean Basin region and for the United States. This \nconference report grants duty-free, quota-free benefits to apparel made \nin the Caribbean Basin Initiative countries from U.S. yarn and U.S. \nfabric. The Caribbean Basin nations will now have an opportunity to \ncompete with Mexico and other developing countries in Asia in a way \nthat will permit them to more fully participate in the global economy.\n  Additionally, the conference report provides benefits for apparel \nmade with regional fabric under clearly specified conditions to be fair \nto the United States. This will encourage additional U.S. export of \ncotton and yarn and U.S. investment in the region while also helping to \ncreate desperately needed jobs for the Caribbean workers. In fact, I \ncannot think of a time when this legislation was needed more. We have \nto act now to help rebuild the shattered Caribbean economies and the \nruined lives of those whose nations were devastated by Hurricanes \nGeorges and Mitch. This all happened in 1998, but the recovery is not \nwhat it should be.\n  It is hard for us to imagine the destruction these storms inflicted. \nWe were not there. We saw them on television, but, as so many things \nseen on television, they soon get out of mind. The devastation is still \nthere, although there has been some cleaning up, some enhancement of \nthe economy. But this will help, not by giving them our money, as we \nhave done under the humanitarian programs we have, but helping them to \nhelp themselves through enhanced trade opportunities.\n  In the worst-hit Caribbean countries, virtually all sectors of the \neconomy were affected. Houses by the hundreds were washed away. Roads \nand bridges disappeared under tons of water. Hotels were wrecked. Beach \nerosion demolished tourism. Both the administration and the Congress \ndeserve credit for joint efforts to enact an assistance package of \nclose to $1 billion to aid in the reconstruction of the most basic \nelements of infrastructure--roads, bridges, and sewer systems--for what \nthey did 2 years ago. But even this investment falls far short of what \nis needed to rehabilitate the economies of these countries.\n  The Caribbean nations hit by these disasters have seen the basic \npillars of their economies--agriculture and tourism--almost completely \nruined. I have spoken to many of the ambassadors from the Caribbean \nnations about this. I just had a meeting this morning with the \nPresident of Costa Rica, thanking us for our work on this particular \nbill, telling us about how their economies are starting to turn around. \nIn my view, based on these discussions, comprehensive reconstruction \nwill not be possible without an effective trade and investment \ncomponent. The ambassadors tell me--and the regional leaders and the \nU.S. officials all agree--it will take years for the hardest hit \ncountries to recover. These countries are more than just our friends; \nthey are our neighbors. They are right there in our backyard. We must \nput in place a program to help them rebuild and to sustain growth \nduring the long road back to economic prosperity. We can do this \nwithout threatening jobs in our own country.\n  The Caribbean Basin is one of the few regions of the world where the \nUnited States consistently--I want to emphasize consistently--maintains \na trade surplus. In fact, close to 70 cents of every dollar spent in \nthe region is returned in the form of increased exports from the United \nStates. In 1999, the U.S. exports to Caribbean Basin countries exceeded \n$19 billion, making this group the sixth largest export market of U.S. \ngoods in that year, 1999.\n\n  We will see other long-term benefits to the United States if we \napprove this conference agreement and help our Caribbean neighbors to \nhelp themselves. We will contribute to the U.S. national security, in \naddition to our economy, by helping democratic countries in our own \nbackyard maintain political and economic stability.\n  In closing, I want to say a word, then, in addition to all the big \ncomponents of this bill, a word about the significance of our work. \nThis is very general, but this work is an example of U.S. leadership in \ntrade policy. But that U.S. leadership in trade policy has suffered \nserious setbacks in the last few years. One obvious setback has been \nthe repeated failure of the Congress to renew the President's fast-\ntrack trade negotiating authority. Another setback has been the failure \nof the negotiations on the multilateral agreement on investment in the \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development. And the most \nserious blow to U.S. leadership in global trade policy was the failure \nlast December of the Seattle ministerial conference meeting of the \nWorld Trade Organization.\n  The entire world is watching, wondering whether the lack of \nleadership on the part of the United States for the last 7 or 8 years, \nor maybe the last 5 or 6 years, is a pattern we are going to continue \nto follow because it is such a different pattern from what the United \nStates has done as a world leader in breaking down barriers to \ninternational trade since 1947.\n  I suppose you could go back to the 1930s, when we learned the lesson \nof the Smoot-Hawley legislation that brought about the world \ndepression, and the world depression brought about World War II. We \nvery quickly learned that high tariffs are not good for the world \neconomy. It was not good for the American economy because we suffered \nas much or more than they did elsewhere in the world in that Great \nDepression as a result of Smoot-Hawley. Under Cordell Hull's leadership \nas Secretary of State, working for President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, \nwe started reciprocal trade agreements at that particular time. They \nwere the forerunner of gradually reducing some of these very high \nbarriers to trade we had at that time around the world, mostly high \ntariffs--bringing them down on a reciprocal basis. But all of that \neventually resulted in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \nprocess that we led the world in establishing in 1949.\n  There have been eight rounds of GATT. Those eight rounds have been \nvery successful in breaking down barriers to trade, so successful that \nPresident Clinton can tell the American people with all honesty, on a \nfactual basis, that one-third of the jobs created during his Presidency \nare a result of international trade.\n  So if anybody thinks we are here promoting an African trade bill and \nCaribbean Basin Initiative bill to somehow benefit the economies of \nAfrica and the Caribbean nations without any concern about the workers \nof America, the working men and women of America, the taxpaying people \nof our country, and are they going to have enough jobs, we have \nhistory, since 1947, to demonstrate the value of international trade to \nthe economy of the United States and the economic benefit of the United \nStates.\n  Too often, in international trade, we look to the economic issues \nonly. But I believe commerce does more to promote international peace \nand humanitarian progress than anything we as political leaders or \ndiplomats can do--as important as political leadership is in the world, \nand as important as diplomats are. But there are just not enough \npolitical leaders or diplomats in the world--if you take all the \ncountries combined--to guarantee any peace. But as you break down \nbarriers among the diverse people of our world--that is, one on one, \nwhether it is business or nonbusiness relationships--that has more to \ndo with the promotion of international peace, prosperity, democratic \nprinciples, and free market principles than anything.\n  So I see this legislation as part of a small process of promoting \nthose issues as well as our concern about Africa, among others.\n  So the entire world I think is watching what we do today because it \nis some show of America wanting to retain that leadership in the \nreduction of trade barriers and enhancing peace and\n\n[[Page S3790]]\n\nprosperity of which we have been a part since 1947.\n  It is vitally important to not only approve this conference agreement \nbut to do it in a resounding way. If we do that, we can send a message \nto the rest of the world that American leadership in trade policy is \nalive and well. For many in the international community, that \nleadership, as I said before, is in serious doubt.\n  It is especially important to approve this conference agreement after \nthe profoundly disappointing failure of the Seattle WTO negotiations. \nWe are only now beginning to pick up the pieces with the start of new \nagriculture and service trade negotiations in Geneva.\n  I have been watching these negotiations very closely. They are both \ndifficult and delicate. We are trying to rebuild confidence, both in \nthe World Trade Organization and in U.S. leadership. After Seattle, \nthis is necessary and vitally important. It is not an exaggeration to \nsay that failure to approve this conference agreement, or even a tepid \napproval, would send a shockwave through these negotiations. It would \nundermine our negotiators, jeopardize any progress we might make in \nGeneva, and do great harm to our long-term international trade \ninterests.\n  By the same token, a strong Senate endorsement of this conference \nreport would say to the entire world that the Senate is engaged, \ncommitted, and we want to reestablish the historic leadership role that \nhas characterized U.S. trade policy for the last 50 years.\n  Finally, I salute the hard work of the majority leader, Senator Lott, \nas well as that of my distinguished colleagues, Senator Roth and \nSenator Moynihan. Without their vision, their efforts, and their \nperseverance, we would not be here today.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in a resounding show of support for \nAmerican leadership in world trade negotiations by supporting the Trade \nand Development Act of 2000.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise in complete accord with the \nresounding statement of the Senator from Iowa. I know he would agree \nwith me when I say we are both here speaking in the intellectual grasp \nof our chairman, Senator Roth, who will return to the Senate next week \nafter necessary surgery and who is so much responsible for our being \nhere today.\n  The Senator from Iowa said the world is watching. The world is \nwatching and has been watching with dismay for 6 years as we seem to \nhave backed away from that tradition which Cordell Hull took up at the \ndepths of the recession, which I will get to, and we have carried on, \non a bipartisan basis, right into the nineties and then we seem to have \nstopped.\n  This is the first trade bill to come to the Senate floor in 6 years. \nMore, we have defeated measures. We have denied the President the trade \nnegotiating authority for trade agreements. It took the administration \ntoo long to ask for it. It responded to the same domestic pressures we \nsaw in Seattle and we saw in front of the World Bank, baffling in some \ninstances, but powerful.\n  Now we return to our tradition. The Senator from Iowa spoke of \nsending a resounding message. Can there be a more resounding message \nthan our vote this morning of 90-6 to proceed to the consideration of \nthis measure, following, perhaps, an equally, more astounding and \nequally resounding measure, a vote in the House of 309-110 to send us \nthis conference report?\n  Senators will recall that the House had sent over to us the African \nGrowth and Opportunity Act. This was a measure to give some measure of \ntrade stimulation to sub-Saharan African countries in the area of \napparel exports. The distinguished chairman, our revered Senator Roth, \nsaw to it, in a near to unanimous Finance Committee, that the Caribbean \nBasin Initiative, an initiative begun by President Reagan, that this, \ntoo, was included in the bill--it is a combined measure--with a number \nof other provisions of interest to the Senators.\n  The importance of the CBI, as we say for purposes of simplification, \nin this regard is very simple. Having created the North American free \ntrade area, we created an incentive to develop trade ties with Mexico--\nin essence, Mexican production would enter the United States on a \ncompletely free basis, whereas its neighbors in Central America and \nnearby Caribbean islands were suddenly disadvantaged. We will call it \nan unanticipated consequence. It had to be dealt with. We do not \ncompletely deal with it here, but we acknowledge that it is an urgent \nmatter, and we begin it.\n  Nearly all the Senate provisions--the bill passed the Senate 76-19--\nwere retained, thanks to extraordinary exertions by our respective \nstaffs who we will thank fulsomely in time.\n  We must particularly acknowledge that this 5 months of negotiation, \nand often going into 5 in the morning, would never have come to any \nconclusion absent the active participation of our majority leader who \nconvened the meetings in his own office and listened to a lot of \nincomprehensible discord over tariffs.\n  I speak as a veteran, if I may, and ask the indulgence of the younger \nand more vital persons. I was one of the three persons who negotiated \nthe Long-Term Cotton Textile Agreement of 1962 for President Kennedy, \nthat having become a condition of passing the Trade Expansion Act of \n1962 by the textile industry and the garment industry, which we \nsuccessfully did, but it was not an easy effort with the French at the \nheight of Gaullist recidivism. That 5-year Cotton Textile Agreement, \nwhich we negotiated nearly 40 years ago, is now in its eighth \nreincarnation and will continue well into the now new century. Still, \nwe got it. And we got as well the series of trade rounds in the GATT \nabout which Senator Grassley has spoken. Finally, the Uruguay Round \nAgreements Act, which authorized our participation in the World Trade \nOrganization, was enacted in 1994.\n  I make the point that in establishing the WTO, we were only getting \nback to where we were in the immediate aftermath of World War II when, \nat Bretton Woods in New Hampshire, the British-American-Chinese-French \nnegotiators thought of how to establish a world which would not have \nthe profound instability of the 1930s, and they envisioned three \ninstitutions: One, the International Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment, which we call the World Bank, headquartered here; the \nInternational Monetary Fund, to deal with monetary fluctuations, which \nwe established here; and an international trade organization, which was \nto be headquartered in Havana--I acknowledge that that died in the \nSenate Finance Committee.\n\n  So we established, on an ad hoc basis, the General Agreement on \nTariffs and Trade. Eric Wyndham White, a British Treasury official, \nwith three or four assistants, managed these negotiations in Geneva \nwhich would take place periodically. In time, we got back to the World \nTrade Organization.\n  This moved so well. But suddenly we find ourselves anxious about \nproceeding in a policy direction that has been so profoundly successful \nfor two-thirds of a century--66 years, since Congress enacted the \nReciprocal Trade Agreements program.\n  We recognize the extraordinary results of the Smoot-Hawley tariff. It \nis a point not often noted that there has not been a tariff bill on the \nSenate floor since 1930. We tried that and it did not work. I think it \nis fair to say that the dynamics of horse-trading--I will do this for \nyour product; you do this for mine--are not suited to a world in which \ntrade is so important today.\n  Indeed, also the 19th century tariff legislation was hugely \nacrimonious and at times divisive. I think the division between North \nand South had something to do with the tariffs imposed in the early \npart of the 19th century.\n  As the Senator from Iowa has said, if you would make a short list of \nfive events that led to the Second World War, and the horror associated \nwith that war, the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930 would be one of them.\n  Tariffs were increased to unprecedented levels in the United States--\nby 60 percent. Incidentally, they are still the legal, official \ntariffs. It is only through trade agreements that we have negotiated \nreciprocal reductions.\n  As predicted, imports dropped by two-thirds, in value terms. And all \nthe simple-minded persons who said, if we do not let any foreign \nproducts come in, then our producers will prosper, what they did not \nknow is that exports\n\n[[Page S3791]]\n\nwould drop by two-thirds, and the depression settled in.\n  The stock market crash of 1929 would have worked itself out. It was a \nmatter of a crisis on paper. Factories did not close. Factories began \nto close when there was no market for their products, much of which had \nbeen going overseas.\n  The result was ruinous overseas. The British abandoned free trade, \nwhich had made them the principal economic power of the 19th century. \nThey had to fight it a very long time, and much later than we think, \nwhen they abolished the so-called corn laws, which kept the price of \nwheat high enough to maintain the economic viability of the large land \narea of the state and not let that Iowa wheat get into Liverpool. The \nminute they did, they became an industrial power, and their farms did \nnot disappear either.\n  As a matter of fact, Britain is self-sufficient in agriculture today. \nBut it was free trade that gave them the advantage in the world. And \nthey kept it right up until the Smoot-Hawley tariff, after which they \nadopted commonwealth preferences.\n  The Japanese began the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. And, \nsir, in 1933, with unemployment at 33 percent, Adolph Hitler was \nelected Chancellor of Germany. That is what you get when you do things \nlike this.\n  The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934--Cordell Hull's \ninnovation of President Roosevelt's initiative--got us back on track. \nFor more than half a century, from one administration to another, \nwithout exception, there we have stayed. It had looked like we were \ngoing to stray. But here we are, moving again in the context--I \ndaresay, the shadow--of the decision on China coming within the next 2 \nor 3 weeks.\n\n  With the African trade bill--the African Growth and Opportunity Act--\nfor the first time, the United States is, with this legislation, \nputting in place a trade policy with respect to sub-Saharan Africa, a \npolicy that is long overdue.\n  The economic challenges facing that region may be even greater than \nthey were at the height of the cold war. There has been a decline of \ninstitutions on a massive scale.\n  Consider the differing paths of South Korea and Ghana. In 1958, the \nyear after Ghana achieved independence, its per capita gross national \nproduct was $203; South Korea's was lower. South Korean per capita GNP \nat that time was $171.\n  Forty years later, in 1998, South Korea's per capita income has \nsoared to $10,550--even after the financial crisis of Asia a few years \nback--while Ghana's has stood at a modest, an impoverished, $390.\n  According to the most recent World Bank data, the average per capita \nGNP for sub-Saharan Africa was $513 in 1998, or $316 if South Africa is \nexcluded. These countries simply do not pose competitive threats to us. \nThey are, if anything, a source of concern for economic aid, \npeacekeeping forces, and the like.\n  The legislation we have before us, which we will pass overwhelmingly \nafter we hear some arguments that are all too familiar, is intended to \nassist sub-Saharan Africa to develop one of the basic building block \nindustries of economic development, which is textile and apparel \nproduction.\n  It offers duty-free, quota-free treatment to certain categories of \napparel--principally those that are made with American fabric that is \nitself made, indeed, with American yarn.\n  There is some allowance for so-called regional fabric; that is, \nfabric made in sub-Saharan Africa. But the benefits are subject to a \nvery tight cap, beginning at 1.5 percent of total U.S. imports and \ngrowing over the life of the bill to only 3.5 percent of total imports.\n  For a transition period of 4 years, the less developed of the sub-\nSaharan African countries may use third country fabric as they ramp up \ntheir own production capacity.\n  But we should put this in some perspective. In 1999, domestic \nproduction of apparel and certain fabricated textile products such as \nhome furnishings--but not fabrics and yarns--in the United States \ntopped $81 billion.\n  That same year, U.S. imports of apparel from sub-Saharan Africa were \nvalued at $584 million--that is to say, 0.7 percent of domestic \nproduction and just 1.1 percent of total apparel imports.\n  Should imports from sub-Saharan Africa grow to 3.5 percent of the \ntotal U.S. imports--the maximum quantity allowed for regional fabric \nunder the bill--they will barely register in a market this size.\n  The African trade legislation in this package will not reverse years \nof neglect and decline, but it may provide a decent start.\n  Just a final word on the enhanced Caribbean Basin Initiative, the \nCaribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act. As I mentioned, it was begun in \n1983 under President Reagan, and which the Senate Finance Committee \nadded to this bill, and the House accepted it. The House was very open \nin this matter. I remarked earlier how the North American free trade \narea has eroded the market positions of Central America and the \nCaribbean islands.\n  Senator Roth and I met last fall, in September of 1999, with the \nPresidents and Vice Presidents and Foreign Ministers of a number of the \nCaribbean and Central American states--the Dominican Republic, \nHonduras, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica. They made a simple \nrequest. They said: Look, we are here before you as democratically \nelected or appointed members of stable democratic governments. We are \nnot here asking for aid. But the unanticipated effects of NAFTA have \nput us at a great disadvantage. All we want to do is trade with you. \nAnd that is what our provisions would allow. This is trade both ways, \nand again, in American textiles.\n  The provisions in the bill will help our producers structure their \nproduction in this hemisphere so that they will be in a position to \ncompete with Asian producers when--as I mentioned earlier, after more \nthan 40 years--textile and apparel quotas will be eliminated by January \nof 2005, as agreed in the Uruguay Round Agreement on Textiles and \nClothing.\n  If we don't have a trade infrastructure going with Central America \nand the Caribbean, we will all be overwhelmed by Asian production; and \nwe can do it simply by passing this legislation--or we think we can do \nit, and we have not been wrong in our understanding of these matters.\n  I have a brief note about the problem of fine wool fabrics. After \nmonths of negotiation, and with great good faith on the part of all \ninterested Senators and industry representatives, we have finally \nreached agreement on a measure that will begin to address this \nproblem--again, the unanticipated consequence of free trade with Canada \nand the fact that we have exorbitant tariffs still in place.\n  Senators Durbin, Schumer, Gramm, Hagel, Mikulski, Specter, Nickles, \nFitzgerald, Santorum, and Thompson joined me in sponsoring a very \nmodest measure, and we are very happy with the outcome of the effort to \nprovide some relief for our suitmakers.\n  The conference agreement begins to address this problem. It will also \nbegin a data collection process that will give us a better database on \nthis industry in the near future. It is not a perfect solution, and it \ndoes not permanently fix the problem, but it is a start. So I strongly \nsupport the conference agreement. I signed the papers. We had a long 5-\nmonth negotiation. These are exhausting efforts. They tend to exhaust \nour staffs more than we because we go home at midnight and they stay \nuntil daybreak. But we have done it.\n  Just to repeat what my friend from Iowa has said, this is important--\nif modest--legislation. A good debate, a strong vote on this conference \nreport will surely set a positive tone for permanent normal trade \nrelations with China. That debate will engage us in the very near \nfuture. We have a wonderful beginning. This morning, we voted 90-6 to \ntake up this conference agreement, and I hope that reverberates into \nthe other Chamber. I can speak for the Finance Committee. The China \npermanent normal trade relations--just normal trade relations--will \npass the Senate Finance Committee and will pass the Senate floor, but \nwe need to send a signal to the other Chamber that we are ready. We \nhope they are willing. Sixty-six years of American trade policy is in \nthe balance. So let's begin this debate and conclude it on the same \nresounding support that we commenced this morning.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S3792]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Hill just came out today, and the \nheadline is ``Capitol Police face loss of 400 in 2001 budget cut.''\n\n       The U.S. Capitol Police force would be reduced by more than \n     400 officers under a bill approved Tuesday by the House \n     Appropriations Committee.\n\n  And then later on there is a quote from John Lucas, chairman of the \nU.S. Capitol Police Labor Committee. He says:\n\n       This budget cut comes on the heels of promises to improve \n     Capitol security for members, staff, visitors and the \n     officers who protect this wonderful institution.\n       ``Where is the passion of yesterday's promises? What \n     happened to the commitments to the officers who protect you \n     and to their survivors?'' he continued, in an attempt to \n     invoke the concern expressed by Congress shortly after the \n     1998 shootings.\n\n  That was, of course, Officer Chestnut and Agent Gibson. Today, at \n3:30, there will be an appointment of a new police chief. What a way \nfor the new police chief to be sworn in.\n  I spoke to our Sergeant at Arms, Mr. Ziglar, about this. Senator \nBennett, Senator Feinstein, with key positions, care deeply about this \nissue. I find this to be, in the years I have been in the Senate, one \nof the most unconscionable decisions that has ever been made.\n  I just for the life of me don't get it, albeit I have my own emotion \non this question, and I have spoken on the floor many times.\n  In July, almost 2 years ago, we lost two police officers. We said we \nwere going to do everything we could to make sure it would never happen \nagain, albeit it could never be 100-percent certain. One of the things \nwe certainly were going to make sure of was that there were two \nofficers at every one of these posts, because if one deranged person \nshows up--especially if 20 or 30 people are coming through the door. \nSenator Grassley is my neighbor over at the Hart Building. This happens \nat the Hart Building sometimes in the middle of the day. This is just \nsimply unacceptable.\n  I am telling you that there is an unbelievable amount of bitterness \nright now in the police force over what is happening with this vote. \nThey have been making the requests. They have been begging. They have \nbeen pleading. I think very soon we will start to at least get to the \npoint where we have two police officers at these posts because people \nare coming in and then one deranged person might show up sometime. That \nis all you need. Then, God knows what will happen.\n  In order to get there, there are one or two things that have to \nhappen: More money has to go into overtime; the slack could be taken up \nthat way; or more officers have to be hired.\n  Now we have a headline that they are going to cut 400.\n  This could be one of these sorts of inside games where the House says \nto the Senate: Look, we need to do this to show--whatever. I don't know \nwhat they are trying to show, frankly. Then you will put it back in. \nYou save us on the Senate side.\n  I will tell you something. Maybe it is my background in community \norganizing, but my hope is that they get to decide for themselves. This \nis a union. My hope is that the Capitol Hill Police Union will hold a \npress conference. I hope they are there in numbers. I hope they make it \ncrystal clear to people who voted for these cuts that they are not \ngoing to let you play around with their lives: We are not going to let \nyou profess such concern for us and our families and then put us in a \nposition where we not only cannot protect the public but we cannot \nreally protect ourselves, which is absolutely outrageous.\n  I do no damage to the truth when I say this on the floor of the \nSenate. As a matter of fact, I initially made the mistake, I say to the \nSenator from California, of listing some of the door posts. I was then \ntold by the police to not do that because they worry that you then \ncreate a security risk. So I don't do that anymore. But I can tell you \nthat I observe it all the time. This House vote is just so damaging to \npeople's morale. It is not right. It is going to create a dangerous \nsituation. It is already not a good situation. But we are going to see \na lot of people leave this police force. We are. They are going to join \nD.C. police, or go wherever; they are going to leave.\n  Hopefully, in the Senate we can be there and inject some sanity into \nthis appropriations process.\n  But I will tell you one thing. I think this union and these police \nofficers should take on this vote. They have been patient. They have \nbeen patient.\n  I think this is just absolutely unconscionable.\n  Two years ago, we went through hell. There was such emotion. We made \nthis commitment. What a short memory. What a short memory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/10/senate-section/article/S3792-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3792-S3795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2000--CONFERENCE REPORT--Resumed\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I now turn my attention to this bill. I \nthank both the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from New York, two \nexceptional Senators.\n  I am going to divide my remarks into two parts. We have some other \nSenators, Senators Feingold and Feinstein, who are going to talk at \ngreat length about what happened in the conference committee. I am \ngoing to speak to that briefly. I shall not take a lot of time. But I \nsay to both Senators that I will be pleased to come back later on this \nafternoon, if you need me, because I think we need to put a focus on \nwhat happened.\n  I am in some disagreement with both my colleagues for, I hope, \nsubstantive reasons, which I will go into in a moment on the overall \nbill. It is not because of either one of the Senators on the floor \nmanaging this bill. But we had an amendment--Feinstein-Feingold, \nFeingold-Feinstein; I don't know the order. It doesn't matter; they are \ntogether--regarding the HIV/AIDS drugs in Africa. We will go into the \nspecifics of the purpose of this amendment in a moment. But the purpose \nwas to figure out a way that these countries could afford the \ncombination of drugs that could help treat this illness so people \nwouldn't die.\n  I strongly support the amendment my colleagues introduced. The \namendment was accepted by the bill's managers, Senators Roth and \nMoynihan. It was simple. It basically prohibited the U.S. Government--\nhistory is not very inspiring, frankly--or any agent of the U.S. \nGovernment from pressuring African countries to revoke or change laws \naimed at increasing access to HIV/AIDS drugs so long as the laws in \nquestion passed by these countries adhered to existing international \nlaw and international standards.\n  In other words, this amendment said to the executive branch--\ncolleagues, I am being bipartisan in my condemnation, if you will--stop \ntwisting arms, White House and others, of African countries that are \nbasically using legal means to improve access of their citizens to HIV/\nAIDS pharmaceuticals. I thank Senator Feinstein and Senator Feingold \nfor this amendment.\n  One would think this effort to make anti-AIDS drugs more cheaply \navailable to citizens in African countries--so long as these countries \ndidn't violate any WTO rules--would be acceptable to every Senator and \nevery Representative and every human being.\n  I think for a while the administration and others leaned on some of \nthese governments to not use ``parallel'' importing in addition to \nlocal manufacturers, which is sort of interesting because some have \nlegislation dealing with this subject. In other words, they would \nbasically go to other countries and try to import FDA-approved drugs \nback from other countries at much less cost.\n  The ``why'' of this is because 13 million African lives have been \nlost since the onset of this crisis. Today, there are some 23 million \nAfrican people infected with the AIDS virus--men, women, and children.\n  This was a modest amendment. This was the right thing to do. I don't \nblame\n\n[[Page S3793]]\n\nmy colleagues. It is their institutional position.\n  The Senator from Iowa and the Senator from New York speak with pride \nabout this legislation. I am going to dissent from some of the \nlegislation dealing with some other issues. But I don't think there is \nmuch to be proud of in terms of what happened in this conference. They \nfought. But let's look at the result after this amendment is taken out. \nHonest to goodness, I say to Senator Feinstein and Senator Feingold, I \nhave absolutely no idea--well, I do actually have some ideas as to why \nthere is opposition. But I want to speak for the people of Minnesota.\n\n  I guarantee both Senators Feingold and Feinstein that 99.99 percent \nof the people in my State of Minnesota are behind their amendment. I \nguarantee them that if anybody attempts to do this in the light of day, \n99.99 percent of the people in this country support this amendment. It \nis the right thing to do. Our values tell us we should do this. If \nthese governments aren't violating any trade policy and they can make \nthese drugs more available to their populace--the people there don't \nhave a lot of money; they can't afford this cocktail of drugs--then \npeople can have some accessibility and we can save lives given the \nmagnitude of this crisis. What is happening is devastating. People in \nMinnesota say: God bless you for doing this.\n  How do these conferees--whoever they are--justify pressuring these \ncountries with, in some cases, a life expectancy that has dropped by 15 \nyears? What arrogance to tell these governments they cannot use all the \nlegal means at their disposal to make sure the people in their \ncountries, men and women and children, have access to these drugs. \nOtherwise, more people suffer and more people die. This is another \nexample of why people in this country become so furious about some of \nwhat happens here.\n  I love being a Senator. I love public service. But sometimes it is \njust too much. It really is. This amendment was accepted. If we had a \nvote on this amendment, I think it would be 100 to 0. However, it is \ntaken out in conference. I guarantee people in the country are for \nthis.\n  Why don't we turn our attention to the pharmaceutical industry, the \npharmaceutical companies? I can guarantee they were not worried about \nlosing customers in Africa because the people cannot afford their \nprices. They were worried about any kind of effort--regarding these \ndrugs that could save people's lives--at making them more affordable \nmight cut into their profits. That is what they are worried about.\n  This is a Fortune 500 report, of April 17, 2000. The annual Fortune \n500 report on American business is out. Guess what. The pharmaceutical \nindustry ranks first in profits. In the words of Fortune magazine--and \nI absolutely love this quote; I wish I made it up myself, but I can't \nplagiarize:\n\n       Whether you gauge profitability by median return or \n     revenues, assets or equity, pharmaceuticals had a Viagra kind \n     of year.\n\n  When the average Fortune 500 industry in the United States returned \n5-percent profits as a percentage of revenue, the pharmaceutical \nindustry returned 18.6 percent--the automobile industry, a pretty big \nindustry, 3.5 percent; chemicals, 5.1 percent; airlines, 5.7 percent; \ntelecommunications, 11.7 percent; pharmaceuticals, 18.6-percent \nprofits.\n  I can anticipate the reaction of some: There goes that Senator from \nMinnesota, out there railing about profits.\n  The idea that this industry can make such excessive profit off the \nsickness, misery, illness, and, in the case of Africa with this \namendment, death of people, is obscene. I say to this industry: You may \nhave had Viagra profits, but you are making your profits off the \nsickness, misery, illness, and death of people. And it is obscene. You \ngot your greedy paws into this conference committee. You were able to \nuse all of the money you contribute to the Congress and all of the \npolitical power you have and you were able to get this amendment out, \ntake it out. The result of that is many people--millions of people--\nwill die.\n  For a while, the administration was involved in this. I am not proud \nof that. They were pushing hard, putting pressure on these governments. \nThis amendment says you can't use any government money for any of this \nkind of lobbying, to try to prevent a government, which legally is \ntrying to do what it can do to make sure these drugs are more \naffordable.\n  That is what this amendment said. It got taken out of conference \ncommittee. Can anyone imagine that happening? The Fortune 500 report \nstated: ``Viagra kind of year.''\n  I am honored to support my two colleagues. Statistics show 23 million \npeople in Africa are infected with the AIDS virus. By the way, I do not \nbelieve that it is pandering or appealing to some special interest for \nme to be speaking about a disease that infects more than 15,000 young \npeople every day. I am not appealing to any special interest. I am \nrepresenting values of Minnesotans. I am representing the values of the \nAmerican people--which, obviously, were not the values of some people \nin this conference committee which took this amendment out.\n  I oppose this bill for that reason alone. I have some other reasons \nfor speaking in opposition to this bill. I think what has happened is \nabsolutely egregious. I would like to say to the pharmaceutical \ncompanies: Your days of being able to do this are over. I am not sure \nthat is the case, but people in the country are getting sick of you. \nThey are really getting tired of these companies. They are similar to a \ncartel. They charge excessive prices, they gouge Americans, they do \neverything they can to make sure other countries with large numbers of \npoor people, that the governments cannot do what they are legally \nentitled to do to get the drugs to people and to make them affordable. \nIt is absolutely unbelievable.\n  The economic question and the political question is, Does this \nCongress belong to people in the country or does it belong to people in \nthe pharmaceutical industry? The answer on the basis of what happened \nto this amendment is it belongs to the pharmaceutical industry. In \nother words, the pharmaceutical industry has great representation here \nin Washington. It is the rest of the people who do not. This is a real \nreform issue. This is about people who are dying in Africa. It is also, \nwhen we get into this debate about pharmaceutical coverage for people \nin our country, people who all too often in our country can die--not \nanywhere near the same magnitude. I think of senior citizens in my \nState who spend $300, $400, $500, $600 a month for drugs they cannot \nafford. And this industry makes not a profit--great, make profits, but \ndo not make obscene profits off of the sickness, misery, and death of \npeople.\n\n  We are going to be out here today speaking about this over and over \nand over again. I do not think the pharmaceutical companies will like \nit. I would not. I doubt whether any Senator is going to come out here \nto defend them. I do not even know whether anybody in the conference \ncommittee would speak out. Let's have dueling press conferences today. \nLet's have different press conferences. The people who took out this \namendment ought to speak publicly about why they did it.\n  Part B: This legislation, I know, is called the African Growth and \nOpportunity Act--I heard both my colleagues speak--and enhanced \nCaribbean Basin Initiative. But I will say this one more time. Every \nattempt that we made with this legislation to make sure these benefits \nwould trickle down to the people was defeated. I think the message of \nthis trade bill to African and Caribbean countries is a double message. \nHere is what it boils down to. For people in the United States, this is \nthe message: If you should dare to try to organize, join a union, and \nbargain collectively to get a better wage, to get more civilized \nworking conditions, to try to get health care coverage for your \nchildren, we are gone. We are on our way to these other countries \nbecause we can pay, as Wal-Mart is paying, 14 cents an hour in China. \nWe can pay 14 cents an hour; we are gone.\n  In this trade bill to African and Caribbean countries, the message \nis, if you should dare to have even child labor standards, much less \nbasic human rights standards, much less the right of people to organize \nand join a union to fight for themselves, then you do not get our \ninvestment. That is what this trade bill says.\n  So this is not a question of the first trade bill since NAFTA or are \nwe internationalists or are we not? We had a bill--Congressman Jesse \nJackson, Jr. on the House side, Senator Feingold\n\n[[Page S3794]]\n\non the Senate side--that expanded Africa's access to U.S. markets, but \nit also included labor rights and genuine debt relief. That is really \nimportant. We had jubilee. We had people here in Washington. When you \nlook at sub-Saharan Africa, about a quarter of its export earnings are \nlost to its never-ending foreign debt service. If you really want to \ntalk about what we need to help these countries, there you have it.\n  We had an alternative bill. I do not think it was ever voted on in \nthe House.\n  This is not about whether or not you are an internationalist or \nisolationist. My father was born in Ukraine. He lived in Russia. He \nfled persecution in 1914. He never was able to see his family again. \nHis family was, in all likelihood, murdered by Stalin. I grew up as an \ninternationalist. I have said on the floor of the Senate--I get to say \nit once; I will not go on and on about this--it is a story that means \nsomething to me. He was almost 50 when I was born, and he was old \ncountry and he was an embarrassment because he did not fit in with my \nfriends' parents. He just wasn't cool. But when I got to be high school \nage, I realized what a treasure he was. He spoke ten languages fluently \nand I miss him dearly. He was a very wise person--profound.\n\n  So Sunday through Thursday night at 10 o'clock, we would meet in the \nkitchen and we would have hot tea and sponge cake and he would talk \nabout the world. I am ``not an internationalist.'' I am not going to \nlet anybody put that label on me.\n  The question is what kind of trade, under what kind of terms? Who \ndecides who benefits and who is asked to sacrifice? Those are the \nquestions that are before us.\n  Every time I go to some of these trade meetings and I hear the \nministers from some of the developing countries say: Those of you, \nSenator Wellstone, who are opposed to these trade bills, you are in \nopposition to the poor--I always look for the poor there. I never see \nthe poor there. I see trade ministers; I see the elites; but I don't \nsee the poor.\n  But then, luckily, since I get a chance to work with the human rights \ncommunity, I get to either meet with or hear about the poor and the \ncitizens in these countries, ordinary people who are trying to get \nbetter wages, who are trying not to work with chemicals that are going \nto kill them, who are trying to do something about child labor \nconditions, who are trying to do something about the poisoning of their \nenvironment, who want to have jobs with dignity and who get thrown in \njail for trying to change their lives for the better. They tell me that \nall this discussion about the poor and how great this is for the poor \nin these countries is a bit disingenuous, as they see it.\n  My colleagues can have a different point of view, and do--many, most, \nthe vast majority.\n  My last point is this: I don't think I am going to do justice to \nthis. But I saw an interesting piece in American Prospect that Bob \nReich wrote, our former Secretary of Labor, that many of us might \nactually consider as a middle ground. Basically his argument went as \nsuch.\n  He said, assume for a moment, Paul, even if you don't want to--he \ndidn't use my name, but I felt like he was speaking to me--even if you \ndon't want to agree, just assume for the moment the position of those \nwho make the argument, ``Like it or not, this really will lead to \neconomic growth for these countries, and this is a better chance for \npeople than they have right now.'' Then consider your own position, \nwhich I have tried to lay out today.\n  He was saying, why not have some kind of framework that says when you \nhave such bills, they pass, and the proponents say they will lead to \neconomic growth and more opportunities, then what you would do would be \nto have a commitment, a priori, beforehand, commensurate with that \ngrowth and more opportunities and the country is doing better, minimum \nwage is going up and labor standards then put into effect.\n  I think it is an interesting idea. Maybe that will be a middle ground \neventually where some of us can come together. But right now there is \nno middle ground to this. I will say it one more time. I know this bill \nis called an opportunity act and all the rest, but I think that is the \nmessage to this legislation--not the bill that Representative Jackson \nand Senator Feingold introduced--to people in this country. You can't \nblame ordinary citizens. The polls show pretty conclusively that people \nwith incomes under $60,000 or thereabouts are more than a little bit \nsuspicious of these agreements. They do not think they are going to be \nin their best interests. They think they are going to be great for the \nbig multinational companies but not them. You cannot lay blame on them \nfor thinking that way because the message of this bill is, again, if \nyou try to organize, try to join a union, try to fight for higher \nwages, these countries will go to Africa, Mexico, wherever, where they \ndo not have to go by any of this. Goodbye.\n\n  Then the message to the people in these countries in this legislation \nis: Governments, people in these countries, don't you dare join a \nunion. Don't you dare fight for your family. Don't you dare try to get \nbetter wages. Don't you dare try to abolish these abominable, \nexploitative child-labor conditions. Don't you do any of that because \nif you do, you will not get our investment. That is the message of this \nlegislation.\n  I have spoken about the amendment that was deleted. I believe what \nhappened in the conference committee is atrocious, and I have laid out \nthe basis of my opposition to this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for \nhis spirited comments and also for his support of having two Capitol \nPolice officers at each entry. I want him to know, as the ranking \nmember on the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee, I am \nfully supportive of that request. I believe the chairman, Senator \nBennett, is as well.\n  Because he approached me with a big smile and I very much like it \nwhen the Senator from Texas smiles rather than frowns, I ask unanimous \nconsent to amend my unanimous consent agreement to permit him to speak \nfor 4 minutes and that I retain my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, first, I thank our wonderful colleague from \nCalifornia for doing such a sweet thing. She is going to speak for some \ntime. I know it would help educate me to stay and hear it, but like so \nmany other people, I am too busy and I want to say a few things.\n  First of all, I congratulate the President for proposing the Africa \nGrowth and Opportunity Act. The President recognized wisely that even \nif we took all the aid provided by every country in the world and gave \nit to sub-Saharan Africa, obviously we could have a short-term impact \non them, but the long-term impact would be small when compared to the \nimpact we can have through trade.\n  This bill is an opportunity for us to open up our markets for goods \nfrom some of the poorest countries in the world. I know there are some \nwho say that even though this will mean clothing will be cheaper for \nAmerican consumers, for working and low-income Americans, somehow there \nis a sacrifice involved. I fail to see it. I see everybody benefiting \nfrom trade. Desperately poor people in Africa will have an opportunity \nto produce products that can be sold in America, and we can raise their \nliving standards and our own through the miracle of world trade.\n  This is not a perfect bill. I wish it were less protectionist. One \nprovision in the bill requires that in order for textiles from sub-\nSaharan Africa to come into the country, they have to be made out of \nAmerican yarn and American thread. That provision is going to reduce \ntheir competitiveness, but I appreciate the fact that the conference \nput in an exception for the 41 countries that have per capita incomes \nof below $1,500 a year.\n  So the bill is not perfect, but it is a movement in the right \ndirection, and I strongly support it.\n  It is important for us to promote world trade. I know our colleague \nwho spoke before me believes that trade only helps rich people and big \ncompanies, but I believe trade helps working people. It creates jobs. \nIt creates opportunity. It expands freedom. That is\n\n[[Page S3795]]\n\nwhy I am so strongly in support of this bill.\n  I thank the Finance Committee for working out a compromise that will \nmean more trade, that will mean more products. I have to say I do not \nunderstand how, with a straight face, the textile industry was so \nadamantly opposed to this bill. If we unleashed all of the energies of \nsub-Saharan Africa and all of their productive capacity and had them \nproduce textiles to sell in America, they would still have no \nsubstantial impact on our market.\n  I do not understand why we continue to let special interests in \nAmerica direct our Government to limit our ability to buy goods that \nwould raise the living standards of working Americans. It is outrageous \nand unfair, and it is important that we stand up against these \nprotectionist forces. Who gives the American textile industry the right \nto say that, as a free person, I cannot buy a better shirt or a cheaper \nshirt produced somewhere else in the world? How is America diminished \nby it? I say it is not. My freedom is diminished by such forces.\n  We have a mixture of protectionism and trade in this bill. But, \noverall, it is a movement in the right direction, and I am in favor of \nit. When the Multifiber Agreement is implemented, we will open up trade \nin textiles. As late as 5 years ago, the average American family paid \n$700 more a year for clothing because of textile protection in America \nthan they would with free trade. This is a small step in the right \ndirection. I rejoice in it, and I support it.\n  I thank the Senator from California for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I notice that the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama is on the floor. So I ask unanimous consent to \nyield to him, and then to have the floor returned to me when he \nconcludes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/10/senate-section/article/S3795-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nVISIT TO THE SENATE BY A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OF DEPUTIES OF THE FEDERAL \n                           REPUBLIC OF MEXICO\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when \nSenator Feinstein has finished speaking, Senator Feingold be able to \nconsume his time for debate on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to address the conference \nreport on the African Growth and Opportunity Act and to express my deep \ndisappointment that the conference decided to strip out of the report \nthe amendment which has been spoken about on this floor which addresses \nHIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. This is an amendment I offered with the \nSenator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold.\n  This amendment was accepted by the Senate, and it was intended to \nprovide African countries experiencing an HIV/AIDS crisis with the \nability to institute measures consistent with the World Trade \nOrganization intellectual property rules that are designed to ensure \nthe distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical technology to afflicted \npopulations.\n  We offered this amendment because we believed the act inadvertently \nthreatened to undermine the fight against HIV/AIDS in Africa. Our \namendment was a simple, commonsense approach consistent with \ninternational law to fix this oversight. I believe the action of the \nconference in stripping this amendment was unconscionable. I found it \nespecially disappointing because my office and staff had been working \nwith the chairman of the Finance Committee, Mr. Roth, to develop \ncompromise language that met our concerns and would be acceptable to \nthe conference.\n  Chairman Roth negotiated in good faith, and he and the other Senate \nconferees--Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Biden, and Mr. Baucus--wanted to do the \nright thing. Unfortunately, as I understand it, because of the way in \nwhich the House and Senate Republican leadership dealt with this \nconference, the majority leader and the Speaker, as I have been told, \ndecided my amendment was to be eliminated and presented a take-it-or-\nleave-it offer to the conferees. The conference was never really even \ngiven a chance to address this issue.\n  Perhaps they did not understand the full impact of what is happening \nin Africa, and in these remarks I hope to make both the extent and the \nnature of the AIDS crisis better known. I say this as someone who \nsupports the legislation. I voted in favor of it. I believe the \nunderlying principles of this legislation--opening up new possibilities \nfor economic engagement and trade between the United States and the \ncountries of sub-Saharan Africa--are good ones. I know the countries of \nthis region want to receive the benefits of the bill which will assist \ntheir economic development and promote democracy in the region.\n  I said in earlier remarks the problem is that the way things are \ngoing, there will not be an Africa left for this bill to help. I think \npeople underestimate the impact of that statement. What I hope to do in \nthese remarks is talk about the scope of the problem, give specific \ncountry reports, talk about the economic, social, and political impact \nof HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa, the need for affordable access to \npharmaceuticals, what compulsory licensing and parallel importing is, \nand why the Feinstein-Feingold amendment is necessary.\n  I want to talk about drug companies' revenues from these drugs and \nwhat else is to be done.\n  But before I do so, I acknowledge the fact that this morning the \nWhite House has signed an Executive order to carry out the provisions \nof the Feinstein-Feingold amendment.\n  At this point, I will read into the Record the following letter, \ndated May 10:\n\n       I am pleased to inform you that today I will sign an \n     Executive Order that is intended to help make HIV/AIDS-\n     related drugs and medical technologies more accessible and \n     affordable in beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries. The \n     Executive Order, which is based in large part on your work in \n     connection with the proposed Trade and Development Act of \n     2000, formalizes U.S. government policy in this area. It also \n     directs other steps to be taken to address the spread of HIV \n     and AIDS in Africa, one of the worse health crises the world \n     faces.\n       As you know, the worldwide HIV/AIDS epidemic has taken a \n     terrible toll in terms of human suffering. Nowhere has the \n     suffering been as great as in Africa, where over 5,500\n\n[[Page S3796]]\n\n     people per day are dying from AIDS. Approximately 34 million \n     people in sub-Saharan Africa have been infected, and, of \n     those infected, approximately 11.5 million have died. These \n     deaths represent more than 80 percent of the total HIV/AIDS-\n     related deaths worldwide.\n       To help those countries most affected by HIV/AIDS fight \n     this terrible disease, the Executive Order directs the U.S. \n     Government to refrain from seeking, through negotiation or \n     otherwise, the revocation or revision of any law or policy \n     imposed by a beneficiary sub-Saharan government that promotes \n     access to HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals and medical technologies. \n     This order will give sub-Saharan governments the flexibility \n     to bring life saving drugs and medical technologies to \n     affected populations. At the same time, the order ensures \n     that fundamental intellectual property rights of U.S. \n     businesses and inventors are protected by requiring sub-\n     Saharan governments to provide adequate and effective \n     intellectual property protection consistent with World Trade \n     Organization rules. In this way, the order strikes a proper \n     balance between the need to enable sub-Saharan governments to \n     increase access to HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals and medical \n     technologies and the need to ensure that intellectual \n     property is protected.\n       I know that you preferred that this policy be included in \n     the Conference Report on the Trade and Development Act of \n     2000, as did I. However, through this Executive Order, the \n     policy this Administration has pursued with your support will \n     be implemented by the U.S. Government. The Executive Order \n     will encourage beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries to \n     build a better infrastructure to fight diseases like HIV/AIDS \n     as they build better lives for their people. At the same \n     time, the Trade and Development Act of 2000 will strengthen \n     African economies, enhance African democracy, and expand \n     U.S.-African trade. Together, these steps will enable the \n     United States to forge closer ties with our African allies, \n     broaden export opportunities for our workers and businesses, \n     and promote our values around the world.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this critically important \n     issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks, the \nExecutive order itself be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the President for this \nExecutive order. It is the right thing to do and it is a major help. I \nvery much hope that the African countries will make use of this \nExecutive order and acquire the necessary pharmaceuticals that we here \nin this country know can extend the lives and well-being of people.\n  Almost 1 year ago, on May 11, the World Health Organization declared \nthat HIV/AIDS is now the world's most deadly infectious disease. As of \nDecember of last year, the AIDS Epidemic Update, published by the Joint \nUnited Nations Program on HIV/AIDS, U.N. AIDS, and the World Health \nOrganization, notes the following:\n\n       As the 20th century draws to a close, some 33.6 million men \n     and women worldwide face a future dominated by a fatal \n     disease, unknown just a few decades ago. According to new \n     estimates from the Joint U.N. Program on HIV/AIDS and the \n     World Health Organization, 32.4 million adults and 1.2 \n     million children will be living with HIV by the end of 1999.\n       Sub-Saharan Africa bears the brunt of the HIV/AIDS with \n     close to 70 percent of the global total of HIV positive \n     people. Most will die in the next 10 years, joining the 13.7 \n     million Africans who have already died, and leaving behind \n     shattered families and crippled prospects for development.\n\n  Indeed, the hardest hit African companies face infection rates in \nexcess of 22 percent--that is 22 million people--an overall rate of \ninfection among adults in sub-Saharan Africa eight times the rate of \ninfection worldwide. In some countries of southern Africa, 20 to 30 \npercent of the population of the country itself are infected.\n  You can see from this chart the spread of AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. \nYou see the major countries affected that I am speaking about--Namibia, \nBotswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia--leading with 16 to 32 percent of adults \ninfected with HIV. The next tranche of 8 percent to 16 percent is in \nthe orange and it drops down from there. In South Africa, you have \nalmost 13 percent of the population infected; that is, 2.8 million \npeople. In Zimbabwe, it is 25.8 percent; that is, 1.4 million people. \nIn Uganda, it is 9.5 percent; that is, 870,000. In the Central African \nRepublic, it is almost 11 percent; that is 170,000. In Zambia, it is 19 \npercent; that is 730,000. In Kenya, it is 11.6 percent or 1.6 million \npeople.\n\n  The destruction caused by HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa, by far, \nsurpasses the devastation caused by famine, war, and even genocide in \nRwanda. According to the United Nations, over 10 times as many people \nwere killed by AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa last year as by war. This \nchart shows the estimated adult and child deaths from HIV/AIDS during \n1998--2 million people in sub-Saharan Africa, out of a global total of \n2.5 million. You see why this is pandemic today, actually exceeding the \nbubonic plague in Europe centuries ago.\n  The devastation caused by AIDS has dramatically reduced life \nexpectancy in sub-Saharan Africa from the highs witnessed in the early \nto mideighties, before the devastating effect of AIDS began to be felt. \nThis chart shows that in Botswana, which is this line, life expectancy \nhas fallen from the age of 61 to age 50. In Zimbabwe, it fell from 59 \nto 47. In Zambia, it fell from age 50 to 38 years. In Malawi, it fell \nfrom age 45 to 40 years. In Uganda, it fell from 48 to 38 years.\n  If the present trends continue, life expectancy--already shortened by \na decade or more in many sub-Saharan African countries--is projected to \nfall more dramatically still. In Zimbabwe, for example, life expectancy \nis expected to decline by 26 years by 2010, from the age of 59 to the \nage of 33. That is more than half the life expectancy in little more \nthan two decades. I never thought I would ever see that kind of \ndevastation in one country.\n  AIDS is also affecting infant and child mortality rates, reversing \nthe declines that have been occurring in many countries during the \n1970s and 1980s. According to the U.N., AIDS, by 2010, the child \nmortality rates of children under 5 will increase by 200 percent in \nBotswana, by 100 percent in Kenya, Malawi and Tanzania, and Zambia by \n100 percent, and by 300 percent in Zimbabwe.\n\n  This becomes critical, if you understand that four pills can prevent \nthe transmission of HIV/AIDS from a mother to a child--four pills.\n  Look at these expected child mortality rates.\n  Over 30 percent of all children born to HIV-infected mothers in sub-\nSaharan Africa will themselves be HIV infected. More than 500,000--half \na million--babies were infected this past year by their mothers, most \nof them in sub-Saharan Africa.\n  As these statistics in the U.N. AIDS Report that I cited attest, sub-\nSaharan Africa has been far more severely affected by AIDS than any \nother part of the world.\n  Mr. President, it is not just adults who are being killed by AIDS in \nsub-Saharan Africa. Out of 510,000 children killed by AIDS throughout \nthe entire world, 470,000 were African children. That is 92 percent of \nthe world's total.\n  What does that say for the future? Almost a half million children are \nkilled in one continent alone. For anyone who has ever been a mother or \na father, a grandmother or a grandfather, this number is mind numbing.\n  Beyond the carnage of the deaths, this disease has the potential to \ndestabilize already fragile political and economic systems in sub-\nSaharan Africa.\n  The United Nations reports that 23.3 million adults and children are \ninfected with the virus, up from 22 million a couple of years ago. \nAfrica has only 10 percent of the world's population, but it has 70 \npercent of the worldwide total of infected people.\n  That is what this chart shows. And it is shocking.\n  Worldwide, there were 5.6 million new AIDS infections in 1999--3.8 \nmillion of them in Africa. That is two-thirds of the new infections of \nAIDS taking place in Africa. Every day, 11,000 more people are infected \nwith HIV--1 in every 8 seconds--and 10,000 of the 11,000 new HIV \ninfections that take place around the world occur in this area.\n  Teachers, doctors, and nurses are today dying faster than they can be \nreplaced. What does that say about the human development and the \neconomic upward mobility of that country if the teachers, the doctors, \nand the nurses die faster than they can be replaced? In addition to the \ndeath toll striking down adults and children alike, as the ``Report on \nthe Presidential Mission on Children Orphaned by AIDS in Sub-Saharan \nAfrica'' notes:\n\n       Tragically, the worst is yet to come. During the next \n     decade more than 40 million children will be orphaned by \n     AIDS--40 million children orphaned by AIDS, and this\n\n[[Page S3797]]\n\n     ``slow-burn disaster'' is not expected to peak until 2030. \n     According to UNICEF, the HIV-AIDS pandemic in sub-Saharan \n     Africa is having and will continue to have more impact on \n     child survival and maternal mortality than all other \n     emergencies combined. Without a doubt, AIDS has placed an \n     entire generation of Africa's children in jeopardy.\n\n  Of the 13 million children orphaned by AIDS so far, 10 million of \nthem are in sub-Saharan Africa.\n  In Zimbabwe, there are currently 600,000 AIDS orphans, and the \nprojection is that there will be more than 1 million by 2005. That is a \n40-percent increase in orphans in one country alone in the next 5 \nyears. Think about it for a minute. It is staggering.\n  There are rumors that some of the leaders of these countries don't \nwant to deal with the drugs that can prevent passage from the mother to \nthe child because they don't want to deal with the number of orphans \nthat are going to be present in that country. I find this also \nshocking. You have more than 1 million orphans in 5 years growing up in \npoverty, without parents and with little or no social structure.\n  What does this say about the success of an African Trade Act, if you \nthink about it? No teachers, no doctors, no nurses, and millions of \norphans without parents, what does that say about economic and human \ndevelopment of a country?\n  In South Africa, there are already close to 250,000 AIDS orphans. The \nnumber is expected to skyrocket to 2\\1/2\\ million by 2010. This is \nSouth Africa. This is from 1990 to 2010. Here we are at 2000, and this \nis what is anticipated to be the number of orphans by 2010. The number \nis 2.5 million in one country alone. How can this bill provide them \nwith the resources to lead better lives in the future? What good will \nthis bill do if this happens?\n  All told, over 34 million people in Africa have been infected by HIV \nsince the pandemic began. That is the population of the State of \nCalifornia. And an estimated 13.7 million Africans have lost their \nlives to AIDS--more than the entire population of Los Angeles and New \nYork City combined. By 2005, if policies do not change, the daily death \ntoll will reach 13,000--double what it is today--with nearly 4 million \nAIDS deaths in sub-Saharan Africa alone.\n  A recent CNN Interactive story, ``AIDS in Africa: Dying by the \nNumbers,'' put the extent of the crisis in this way:\n\n       . . . The bubonic plague is reckoned to have killed about \n     30 million people in medieval Europe. The U.S. Census Bureau \n     projects that AIDS deaths and the loss of future populations \n     from the deaths of women of child-bearing age means that by \n     2010, sub-Saharan Africa will have 71 million fewer people \n     than it would otherwise.\n\n  In all of these countries in sub-Saharan Africa, there will be 71 \nmillion fewer people because of AIDS in the next 10 years. Just think \nabout that for a minute.\n  I would also like to spend some time addressing the situation in \nseveral different countries in the region--some hard hit, some less \nso--so that my colleagues have a better sense of the chaos and \ndisruption this disease is causing in individual countries and society.\n  The statistics that I cite below are drawn from UNA's World Health \nOrganization epidemiological fact sheets on AIDS and includes data up \nto 1997. By all accounts, in almost every country in the region, the \nsituation has grown much worse in the past 3 years. There could be \nlittle doubt about the pandemic.\n  Let's begin with Botswana. In Botswana, over 25 percent of the \npopulation between 15 and 49 is infected with HIV. That is 25 percent \nof the population. In Botswana's major urban areas, 40 percent of \npregnant women are infected with HIV. From 1994 to 1997, the rate at \nwhich children have been orphaned in Botswana quadrupled. Almost 50 \npercent of Botswana's children under 15 are AIDS orphans. AIDS is \nresponsible for over half of the deaths of all children under the age \nof five.\n  Let's look at Ethiopia. Ethiopia has a relatively low infection rate \nfor sub-Saharan Africa, just 9.3 percent, with 5.6 million out of a \npopulation of 60 million infected. Over 35 percent of women in Ethiopia \nage 20 to 24 have HIV. That is a rate 3 times higher than men. In 1985, \nless than 1 percent of prostitutes in Addis Ababa were HIV positive. By \n1990, that proportion had reached 54 percent. This is the point of \nspreading of the disease. Very little is being done about it.\n  Kenya currently has a relatively low rate of HIV infection. It is 11 \npercent. HIV prevalence is much higher in the major urban areas and is \nover 25 percent in Nairobi, where almost 90 percent of prostitutes are \nHIV positive. This is the wonderful city of Nairobi, where 90 percent \nof the prostitutes are spreading this disease heterosexually through \nthe countryside. There are currently at least 350,000 AIDS orphans in \nKenya, with the number expected to reach 1 million by 2005. By 2005, \nKenya will have one million orphans, thanks to AIDS. That is a 200 \npercent increase. The cumulative number of deaths due to AIDS has risen \nfrom 16,000 in 1989 to 200,000 in 1995 and is expected to pass the one \nmillion mark this year. One million dead and one million orphans.\n  Kenya is a beautiful country. It is shocking what is happening. I \nhope some of the pharmaceutical companies that lobbied against this \namendment are listening. Mr. President, 75 percent of AIDS cases in \nKenya occur among adults age 20 to 45, the economically most productive \ntime of the population. The prevalence of HIV in pregnant women in \nurban areas has risen from 2 percent in 1985 to 16 percent in 1997.\n  Let's go to Malawi. It is estimated around 1 in 7 of the population, \nage 15 to 49, is HIV positive. That is 15 percent of the population, or \n670,000 people. More than 80,000 people died of AIDS in 1 year alone, \n1997, and Malawi has an accumulative death toll of over 450,000 people. \nI hope the pharmaceutical companies are listening.\n  Over 25 percent of women attending prenatal clinics in the urban \ncenters test positive for HIV. Girls 15 to 24 years in age are six \ntimes more likely to be positive than boys the same age. Other \ninfectious diseases are also on the upswing. Tuberculosis has tripled \nsince the late 1980s, largely due to AIDS. By the end of 1997, over 6 \npercent of Malawi's children under 15 were orphans.\n  Let's look at Nigeria, Africa's most populace country, with 118 \nmillion people. More than 2.2 million people, around 5 percent, are HIV \npositive. Although Nigeria appears to have a relatively low incidence \nat present, trend lines are not comforting. The prevalence in pregnant \nwomen in urban areas went from below 1 percent in 1991 to almost 7 \npercent in 1994. Likewise, the prevalence of HIV in prostitutes has \nmore than doubled during this same period in urban areas, and increases \nfrom 3.9 percent to 23 percent in rural areas. Nearly 50 percent of the \nprostitutes in Lagos, the largest city, are HIV positive, spreading the \ndisease. There were 350,000 AIDS orphans in Nigeria as of 1997.\n\n  Let's look at South Africa. About 3 million people in South Africa \nare infected with HIV, 13 percent of a population of 43 million. \nEstimates are by 2010, 25 percent of South Africa's population will be \nHIV positive. By 1997, 180,000 children were orphaned. That figure will \nskyrocket to 2 million by 2010. There will be two million orphans in \nSouth Africa because of AIDS by 2010. Mr. President, 20 percent of \npregnant women are infected. There are close to 400,000 deaths due to \nAIDS in South Africa since the beginning of the epidemic.\n  Let's go to Zambia, with an infection rate close to 20 percent. It is \none of the hardest hit countries in sub-Saharan Africa. As of 1997, \nover 770,000 adults and children in Zambia were AIDS affected. There \nare more than 630,000 estimated AIDS cases. There have been 600,000 \ncumulative deaths since the beginning of the epidemic. After Uganda, \nZambia has the highest proportion of children orphaned by AIDS in the \nworld. By the end of 1997, 360,000 children, almost 10 percent of the \nchildren under 15, were orphaned because of AIDS. Four simple pills \ncould prevent the transmission of AIDS from a pregnant woman to a \nchild. Mr. President, 28 percent of adults in the urban area and 15 \npercent in rural areas are infected with HIV.\n  To give a sense of how the crisis is eroding social stability in \nZambia, last year alone, 1,300 teachers in Zambia died from AIDS. Only \n700 new teachers were available to take their place. How do you teach \nchildren to be able to get a job in the new marketplace that this bill \nhopes to bring about if the teachers\n\n[[Page S3798]]\n\nare dying of AIDS, if the children are orphaned? Zimbabwe has one of \nthe worst AIDS epidemics in the world. Currently, 26 percent of all \nadults age 15 to 49 are infected with HIV, more than 1.5 million out of \na total population of 5.5 million.\n  The United Nations Population Division has projected that over the \nnext five years half of all child deaths in the country will be due to \nAIDS.\n  As in Zambia, by the end of 1997 there were over 360,000 AIDS orphans \nin Zimbabwe and, as I mentioned earlier, projections are for Zimbabwe \nto be faced with over 1 million AIDS orphans in the next five years.\n  The HIV/AIDS crisis is driving families in sub-Saharan Africa worn-\ndown by widespread poverty to the brink of disaster, and eroding the \nability of the regions governments to provide services while at the \nsame time increasing the demand for them. This is especially true in \nhealth care, where AIDS-related illnesses sometimes account for almost \nhalf the hospital beds and in-patient days.\n  The transition to democracy in the region may also be imperiled, and \neconomic growth may grind to a halt as a result of the AIDS crisis \ndestabilizing social structures.\n  These numbers, and the impact this disease is having on individual \ncounties in sub-Saharan Africa, is staggering, but it is difficult to \ncapture the depth of the devastation and suffering in the region with \nstatistics and charts. To try to give a better sense of the impact of \nHIV/AIDS, let me read the first few paragraphs from a story published \nin the Village Voice last year, part of a Pulitzer Prize winning series \nof articles by journalist Mark Schoofs.\n  Let me warn you: the following is not for the faint of heart or faint \nof stomach.\n\n       They didn't call Arthur Chinaka out of the classroom. The \n     principal and Arthur's uncle Simon waited until the day's \n     exams were done before breaking the news: Arthur's father, \n     his body wracked with pneumonia, had finally died of AIDS. \n     They were worried that Arthur would panic, but at 17 years \n     old, he didn't. He still had two days of tests, so while his \n     father lay in the morgue, Arthur finished his exams. That \n     happened in 1990. Then in 1992, Arthur's uncle Edward died of \n     AIDS. In 1994, his uncle Richard died of AIDS. In 1996, his \n     uncle Alex died of AIDS. All of them are buried on the \n     homestead where they grew up and where their parents and \n     Arthur still live, a collection of thatch-roofed huts in the \n     mountains near Mutare, by Zimbabwe's border with Mozambique. \n     But HIV hasn't finished with this family. In April, a fourth \n     uncle lay coughing in his hut, and the virus had blinded \n     Arthur's aunt Eunice, leaving her so thin and weak she \n     couldn't walk without help. By September both were dead.\n       The most horrifying part of this story is that it is not \n     unique. In Uganda, a business executive named Tonny, who \n     asked that his last name not be used, lost two brothers and a \n     sister to AIDS, while his wife lost her brother to the virus. \n     In the rural hills of South Africa's KwaZulu Natal province, \n     Bonisile Ngema lost her son and daughter-in-law, so she tries \n     to support her granddaughter and her own aged mother by \n     selling potatoes. Her dead son was the breadwinner for the \n     whole extended family, and now she feels like an orphan.\n       In the morgue of Zimbabwe's Parirenyatwa Hospital, head \n     mortician Paul Tabvemhiri opens the door to the large cold \n     room that holds cadavers. But it's impossible to walk in \n     because so many bodies lie on the floor, wrapped in blankets \n     from their deathbeds or dressed in the clothes they died in. \n     Along the walls, corpses are packed two to a shelf. In a \n     second cold-storage area, the shelves are narrower, so \n     Tabvemhiri faces a grisly choice: He can stack the bodies on \n     top of one another, which squishes the face and makes it hard \n     for relatives to identify the body, or he can leave the \n     cadavers out in the hall, unrefrigerated. He refuses to \n     deform bodies, and so a pair of corpses lie outside on \n     gurneys behind a curtain. The odor of decomposition is faint \n     but clear.\n       Have they always had to leave bodies in the hall? ``No, no, \n     no,'' says Tabvemhiri, who has worked in the morgue since \n     1976. ``Only in the last five or six years,'' which is when \n     AIDS deaths here took off. Morgue records show that the \n     number of cadavers has almost tripled since the start of \n     Zimbabwe's epidemic, and there's been a change in who is \n     dying: ``The young ones,'' says Tabvemhiri, ``are coming in \n     bulk.''\n       The wide crescent of East and Southern Africa that sweeps \n     down from Mount Kenya and around the Cape of Good Hope is the \n     hardest-hit AIDS region in the world. Here, the virus is \n     cutting down more and more of Africa's most energetic and \n     productive people, adults aged 15 to 49. The slave trade also \n     targeted people in their prime, killing or sending into \n     bondage perhaps 25 million people. But that happened over \n     four centuries. Only 17 years have passed since AIDS was \n     first found in Africa, on the shores of Lake Victoria, yet \n     according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS \n     (UNAIDS), the virus has already killed more than 11 million \n     sub-Saharan Africans. More than 22 million others are \n     infected [and nobody cares].\n       Only 10 percent of the world's population lives south of \n     the Sahara, but the region is home to two-thirds of the \n     world's HIV-positive people, and it has suffered more than 80 \n     percent of all AIDS deaths.\n       Last year, the combined wars in Africa killed 200,000 \n     people. AIDS killed 10 times that number. Indeed, more people \n     succumbed to HIV last year than to any other cause of death \n     on this continent, including malaria. And the carnage has \n     only begun.\n\n  In addition to the devastating health impact, HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharan \nAfrica is also threatening to undermine economic, social, and political \nstability in the region--the very issues which the African Growth and \nOpportunity Act is intended to address.\n  In Zimbabwe and Botswana, for example, where roughly one of every \nfour people have AIDS, the disease has cut sharply into population \ngrowth with profound consequences. According to Karen Stanecki, chief \nof health studies for the U.S. Census Bureau:\n\n       The zero growth is coming because people are dying in their \n     young adult years, not after leading full lives and then \n     dying.\n\n  People are dying in the years when they're supposed to be most \nproductive.\n  As World Bank President James Wolfensohn said at the United Nations \nthis past January:\n\n       Many of us used to think of AIDS as a health issue. We were \n     wrong. AIDS can no longer be confined to the health or social \n     sector portfolios. AIDS is turning back the clock on \n     development.\n\n  As the HIV epidemic deepens in Africa, it is leaving an economically \ndevastated continent in its wake.\n  At the most simple level, already impoverished families that must \ncare for a member who is ill with HIV/AIDS find that what little they \nhad to pay for a child's education or invest for the future is now \ngone.\n  The United Nations Joint Program on HIV/AIDS found that urban \nfamilies in the Cote d'Ivoire, known as the Ivory Coast in this \ncountry, with a member sick from AIDS cut spending on their children's \neducation in half and reduced food consumption by about 40 percent as \nthey struggled to cover health care costs.\n  Moreover, as the epidemic has worsened, so have estimates of its \neffect on African economies, even without taking into account broader \nhuman welfare issues.\n  Indeed, because of the impact of HIV/AIDS, David Bloom, a professor \nof economics and demography at the Harvard School of Public Health, \nwarns that ``The whole economy [in Africa] could unravel.''\n  In ``Confronting AIDS,'' the World Bank factored in labor supply \nissues and the amount to which health care would be financed out of \nsavings to come up with a ``rough estimate'' of a 0.5 percent annual \nreduction in per capita GDP growth. I believe this estimate to be on \nthe low side.\n  One-half of 1 percent may not seem like much. Indeed, for countries \nwith relatively high growth rates such as Uganda, that kind of \nreduction will not seem to be immediately crippling, but a lower growth \nrate has a cumulative effect.\n  A country whose growth rate is 2 percent a year will increase its GNP \nper capita by 81 percent in one generation, or about 30 years. Each \ngeneration will live much better than the last.\n  However, if AIDS reduces growth to just 1.5 percent per year, the \nsame country will increase its GNP per capita by only about 50 percent \nin the same period.\n  This chart shows the change in per capita GDP caused by AIDS in \nKenya. The yellow is a no AIDS scenario, and one can see the enormous \nrise in GDP. The red is the AIDS scenario, even with the African Growth \nand Opportunity Act, and one can see how it is consequentially lower.\n  Thus, in Kenya, for example, UNAIDS estimates that while per capita \nGDP was estimated to increase from 5,600 Kenyan shillings in 1990 to \nover 6,000 Kenyan shillings by 2005 without AIDS, with the impact of \nAIDS per capita GDP will remain stagnant over the same period of time.\n  Likewise, in South Africa UNAIDS estimates that because of the impact \nof HIV/AIDS the Human Development\n\n[[Page S3799]]\n\nIndex--which measures the level of human development through a formula \nbased on life expectancy at birth, adult literacy, school enrollment, \nand real per capita GDP has dropped by over 15 percent from 1995 to the \npresent. That is a 15-percent drop due to AIDS in 5 years. Without HIV/\nAIDS South Africa's HDI was projected to remain more or less the same.\n  Finally, the combined effects of HIV/AIDS on health, economic life, \nthe social fabric, and political institutions, has created a genuine \nthreat to future stability and security in sub-Saharan Africa.\n  That is why, at the initiative of Ambassador Holbrooke and Vice \nPresident Gore, the 15-member United Nations Security Council decided \nto address AIDS earlier this year.\n  As Secretary General Kofi Annan told the Security Council:\n\n       In already unstable societies, this cocktail of disasters \n     is a sure recipe for more conflict. And conflict, in turn, \n     provides fertile ground for further infections.\n\n  And, as Dr. Peter Piot, Executive Director of the Joint United \nNations Programme on HIV/AIDS, said:\n\n       Visibly, the epidemic is eroding the social fabric of many \n     communities. In its demographic, social and economic impact, \n     the epidemic has become more devastating than war, in a \n     continent where war and conflict appear to be endemic.\n\n  As U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Richard Holbrooke said, if \nwe do not work with Africa now to address the problems associated with \nthe HIV/AIDS crisis, ``we will have to deal with them later when they \nwill get more dangerous and more expensive.''\n  It is in recognition of the destabilizing effects of HIV/AIDS in \nAfrica that the Clinton-Gore administration has taken the step of \ndesignating AIDS a threat to U.S. national security interests, as \nreported the other week in the Washington Post. I believe the \nadministration is to be congratulated for its recognition of the \nprofound effects that this disease is having, and for this effort.\n  There are many explanations for why this pandemic is sweeping across \nsub-Saharan Africa: Certainly the region's poverty, which has deprived \nAfricans of access to health information, health education, and health \ncare. Conflict, which has led to increases in refugee flows, and \nincreases in prostitution have also played a role. Cultural and \nbehavior patterns, which has led to sub-Saharan Africa being the only \nregion in which women are infected with HIV at a higher rate than men, \nmay also play a role.\n  Clearly, in addressing the challenges presented by this disease there \nneeds to be considerable emphasis addressing the health care \ninfrastructure of sub-Saharan Africa and on additional resources for \neducation. I intend to address both these points later.\n  I also believe that if the international community is to be \nsuccessful in meeting this challenge, we must make every effort to get \nappropriate medicine into the hands of those in need.\n  In the United States and much of the industrialized world, even as \nsub-Saharan Africa has been ravaged by the impact of HIV/AIDS, we have \nsucceeded, in large part, in turning HIV/AIDS into a chronic disease; \nnot curing it--that must still remain a top priority--but managing it. \nWe have done so, in large parts, by developing effective \npharmaceuticals and getting them to those in need.\n  Indeed, for too many years there were no effective drugs.\n  I remember, as Mayor of San Francisco, I was the first mayor to \nimplement a program to deal with AIDS in the United States, and \nremember trying to manage this disease in its early days, when cause, \nlet alone treatment, was unclear; when drugs were simply not available; \nwhen HIV/AIDS was devastating our community, and many, many promising \nyoung people--many of them my friends--were struck down in the prime of \ntheir lives; and when we simply did not know how big the crisis would \nget, or if our health care system could handle it.\n  So in some small way, I think I understand what policymakers in many \nsub-Saharan African countries are now going through.\n  Now, thanks to recent medical research, we do have effective \nmedicine. For example, some recent pilot projects have had success in \nreducing mother-to-child transmission by administering the anti-HIV \ndrug AZT, or a less expensive medicine, Nevirapine, NVP, during birth \nand early childhood.\n  In fact, new studies indicate NVP can reduce the risk of mother-to-\nchild transmission by as much as 80 percent. Just think of the \nstatistics on orphans and HIV-infected children that could be stopped \nwith four of these pills. NVP is given just once to the mother during \nlabor and once to the child within three days of birth. Three or four \npills can mean that a child is prevented from being born with AIDS.\n\n  For just $4 a tablet--a little more than the cost of a large latte at \nStarbuck's, not a lot here but a great deal in Africa--this inexpensive \ndrug regime has created an unprecedented opportunity for international \ncooperation in the fight against AIDS. Currently, however, less than 1 \npercent of HIV infected pregnant women have access to interventions to \nreduce mother-to-child transmission.\n  In addition to such drugs as NVP, drug ``cocktails\" administered in a \ntreatment regimen known as HAART--highly active antiretroviral \ntherapy--antiretroviral drugs can allow people living with AIDS to lead \na normal life. And use of the drugs can lead to long-term survival \nrather than early death. Such treatment has proven highly effective in \ndeveloped countries, including our own.\n  Although some pharmaceutical companies may try to tell you otherwise, \nmost antiretrovirals drugs are relatively inexpensive to produce. AIDS \nTreatment News recently reported that:\n\n       AZT in bulk can be purchased for 42 cents for 300 mg from \n     the worldwide suppliers; this price reflects profits not only \n     to the manufacturer but also to the middleman bulk buyer. The \n     same drug retails at my local pharmacy for $5.82 per pill. \n     This ridiculous price bears no real relation to the cost of \n     production.\n\n  Unfortunately--and inexplicably in my view--access for Africans to \nAIDS medications or ``antiretrovirals'' is perhaps the most contentious \nissue surrounding the response to the African epidemic.\n  According to an article, ``Poor Nations Ravaged by AIDS Need the \nRight Resources'' that appeared in the December 1, 1999 issue of the \nJournal of the American Medical Association:\n\n       For as many years as antiretroviral therapies have been \n     available, AIDS activists have accused pharmaceutical \n     companies of price gouging and challenged them to reduce \n     prices and cut their profit margins on drugs for people with \n     HIV infection and AIDS. In a pilot drug access initiative \n     launched in 1997 in Uganda, Cote d'Ivoire, Chile, and \n     Vietnam, UNAIDS succeeded in negotiating discounts on drugs \n     manufactured by Abbott Laboratories, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, \n     Glaxo Wellcome Inc, Merck & Co Inc, and Roche Laboratories.\n       In Uganda, the cost of dual antiretroviral drug therapy has \n     been cut from $600 to $250 per month; triple combination \n     therapy that used to cost $1000 per month is now between $500 \n     and $600 (J Int Assoc Physicians AIDS Care. 1999;5:48-60). \n     Dorothy Ochola, MD, coordinator of the drug access initiative \n     in Uganda, said the US Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention has offered free laboratory monitoring of patients \n     for 2 years.\n       While the program has helped hundreds of HIV-infected \n     people in Uganda gain access to therapy, it is far from a \n     cure-all. Along with government subsidies for drugs, the \n     initiative offers less expensive drugs for palliative care \n     and opportunistic infections, but patients must pay out of \n     pocket for antiretroviral drugs. With a population of 21 \n     million and the number of HIV-positive persons estimated at \n     930,000, Uganda's approximately 825 patients receiving \n     antiretroviral drugs through the program are a drop in the \n     bucket.\n\n  Unfortunately, it is true that even at reduced rates in all too many \ncases the cost of combination therapy is beyond the means of most \npeople living with AIDS and governments in sub-Saharan Africa.\n  Combination therapy in South Africa was estimated at $334 per month \nor $4,000 per year, and UNAIDS reports that Brazil treated 75,000 \npeople with antiretrovirals in 1999 at a cost of $300 million--or, \nagain, $4,000 per person.\n  I strongly believe that we have a strong moral obligation to try to \nsave lives when the medications for doing so exist, and it is critical \nthat the United States play a leadership role in the international \ncommunity to increase access to life-saving drugs.\n  For example, the United States should not oppose African governments \nand donor agencies from achieving reductions in the cost of \nantiretrovirals\n\n[[Page S3800]]\n\nthrough negotiated agreements with drug manufacturers.\n  The British pharmaceutical firm Glaxo Wellcome, a major producer of \nantiretrovirals, has already stated that it is committed to \n``differential pricing,'' which would lower the cost of AIDS drugs in \nAfrica. And I say, hooray; one company. These efforts are to be \ncommended, and it is my sincere hope that companies willing to adopt \n``differential pricing'' will help African countries get the drugs they \nneed at prices they can afford.\n  Now I will speak about compulsory licensing and parallel importing \nfor a moment.\n  This is the issue raised by my amendment and now the President's \nExecutive order. The United States must not oppose ``parallel \nimporting'' and ``compulsory licensing'' by African governments to \nlower the price of patented medications so that HIV/AIDS drugs are more \naffordable, and more people in Africa will have access to them.\n  Through parallel importing, patented pharmaceuticals can be purchased \nfrom the cheapest source, rather than from the manufacturer. Under \ncompulsory licensing an African government could order a local firm to \nproduce a drug and pay a negotiated royalty to the patent holder.\n  Both parallel imports and compulsory licensing are permitted under \nthe World Trade Organization agreement for countries facing health \nemergencies--and there can be little doubt that Africa is facing a \nhealth emergency of monumental proportions.\n  My amendment, cosponsored by my colleague from Wisconsin, would have \nsimply codified current administration policy--as the administration \nhas now opted to do itself via Executive order--which states that the \nU.S. Government will not oppose efforts by governments of the countries \nof sub-Saharan Africa to supply HIV/AIDS drugs to their citizens \nthrough compulsory licensing or parallel importing.\n  This amendment did not create new policy or a new approach on \nintellectual property rights under the World Trade Organization \nagreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, \nknow as TRIPS, nor does it require IP rights to be rolled back or \nweakened.\n  There are few in this body as committed to the notion of strict \nprotection of U.S. intellectual property rights as I am.\n  Just a few years ago, for example, when the United States and China \nwere involved in a dispute over IPR protection for movies, music, and \ncomputer software, I worked with the administration to convince China \nthat it was important to respect the rights of the patent holder and \nlive up to its commitments to respect intellectual property rights. \nAnd, I am pleased to note, China's record since that time on IP issues \nhas improved.\n  The compulsory licensing process under my amendment was fully \nconsistent with the WTO's approach to balancing the protection of \nintellectual property with a moral obligation to meet public health \nemergencies such as the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Africa.\n  According to an opinion I solicited from the Congressional Research \nService on this question, the amendment I offered:\n\n       . . . would appear to be consistent with the TRIPS \n     agreement since on its face it only prohibits U.S. government \n     authorities, such as the U.S. Trade Representative (U.S.T.R.) \n     From seeking a revocation of law or policy which offers \n     adequate intellectual property rights protection consistent \n     with the TRIPS agreement. . . . The TRIPS agreement permits \n     compulsory licensing under certain conditions. . . .\n\n  In other words, despite what some pharmaceutical companies have been \nsaying behind closed doors about this amendment over the past few \nweeks, this amendment did not weaken intellectual property rights \nprotection one iota. It left the bar exactly where it is right now.\n  Let me be clear about this: My amendment--and now the President's \nExecutive Order--does not create new policy or a new approach on IP \nrights under TRIPS, nor does it require IP rights to be rolled back or \nweakened. All it asked is that in approaching HIV/AIDS in Africa, U.S. \npolicy on ``compulsory licensing'' and ``parallel importing'' remain \nconsistent with what is accepted under international trade law.\n  By doing so, this approach will allow the countries of sub-Saharan \nAfrica to determine the availability of HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals in \ntheir countries, and provide their people with affordable HIV/AIDS \ndrugs.\n  It was, or so I thought, a simple, common-sense approach to dealing \nwith one facet of one of the most pressing and important national \nsecurity and international health issues that we face in the coming \ndecades: The HIV/AIDS pandemic currently sweeping across sub-Saharan \nAfrica.\n  Let me provide one example of why the approach adopted by my \namendment, and now the President's Executive Order, is necessary.\n  On March 14 of this year, Doctor's Without Borders--the medical \nrelief group that won the Nobel Prize last year--sent a letter to \nPfizer calling on Pfizer to lower the price of fluconazole, a drug \nneeded to treat cryptococcal meningitus, the most common systemic \nfungal infection in HIV-positive people, in developing countries.\n  As the Doctors Without Borders letter notes, in Thailand fluconazole \nis available for just $1.20 for a daily dose. Yet in Kenya and South \nAfrica, the daily dose costs $17.84, almost 15 times higher. That is \nunconscionable and is greed in the ultimate.\n  What accounts for the difference in price?\n  In Thailand a generic version is available. In Kenya and South Africa \nthe only supplier is Pfizer.\n  As Bernard Pecoul, director of the Doctors Without Borders Access to \nEssential Medicines Campaign has noted, ``People are dying because the \nprice of the drug that can save them is too high.''\n  As the March 14 Doctors Without Borders letter notes, ``While we \nappreciate that patents can be an important motor of research and \ndevelopment funding, there must be a balance to ensure that people in \ndeveloping countries have access to life-saving medicines.'' I could \nnot agree more.\n  Under pressure from Doctors Without Borders, Pfizer has since agreed \nto provide free fluconazole to South Africa. This situation never \nshould have existed to begin with.\n  Without ``compulsory licencing'' and ``parallel importing,'' which \nwould allow access to cheaper generic drugs, more people in sub-Saharan \nAfrica will suffer and die.\n  So why, given that it represented a common sense approach to a \ndevastating problem fully consistent with international trade law did \nmy amendment meet such stiff opposition in conference?\n  After long and hard consideration, I have concluded that there can be \nonly one possible answer to that question: Profits and corporate greed.\n  Simply put, the pharmaceutical companies which manufacture HIV/AIDS \ndrugs would prefer to be able to sell drugs for $18 a dose rather than \n$1 per dose, with the additional $17 going straight to fattening the \nbottom line.\n  If there was a legitimate policy debate to be had, why did the \nopponents of including this provision in the bill not wage their fight \nout in the open?\n  The answer is because they had no arguments which would stand up to \nthe light of day--so they restricted their activities to attacking this \namendment behind closed doors, out of the public view. And they \nsucceeded, in conference, with literally no one in the room except for \na few members, in getting this amendment killed.\n  The pharmaceutical companies who were opposed to this amendment--\nopposed because they want to squeeze every last drop of profit from the \nsuffering of the millions of HIV/AIDS victims in sub-Saharan Africa--\nwere successful, behind closed doors, in killing my amendment.\n  The revenue created from the sale of HIV/AIDS-related drugs is \nstaggering.\n  Crixivan, used to treat HIV infections, produced $675 million in \nrevenue for Merck, in 1998; Zithromax, used to prevent Mycobacterium \navium complex in people with advanced HIV infections, produced over \n$1.04 billion in revenue for Pfizer, in 1998; Fluconazole, used to \ntreat cryptococcal meningitis, produced $916 million in revenue for \nPfizer, in 1998; Epivir, used in combination with AZT as a treatment \noption for HIV infection in adults and pediatric patients that are at \nleast three months old, produced $595 million in revenue for Glaxo \nWellcome, in 1998; Combivir, used as a treatment option for HIV \ninfection in adults and adolescent patients that are at least twelve\n\n[[Page S3801]]\n\nyears old, produced $442 million in revenue for Glaxo Wellcome, in \n1998; AZT, used for the treatment of adults with AIDS, produced $248 \nmillion in revenue for Glaxo Wellcome, in 1998; Taxol, used to treat \nAIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, produced over $1.2 billion in revenue \nfor Bristol-Meyers Squibb, in 1998; Zerit, used for the treatment of \nadults with advanced HIV infections, produced $551 million in revenue \nfor Bristol-Meyers Squibb, in 1998; Videx, used for the treatment of \nadult and pediatric patients with advanced HIV that are intolerant to \nor deteriorating on AZT, produced $162 million in revenue for Bristol-\nMeyers Squibb, in 1998; Invirase, used for advanced HIV infections, \nproduced $397 million in revenue for Hoffman-La Roche, in 1998; Hivid, \nused in combination with AZT for patients with advanced HIV, produced \n$65 million in revenue for Hoffman-La Roche, in 1998; Famvir, used for \nthe treatment of recurrent mucocutaneous herpes simplex infections in \nHIV-infected patients, produced $172 million in revenue for SmithKline \nBeecham, in 1998; Gamimune N, used to prevent bacterial infections in \nHIV-infected pediatric patients, produced $235 million for Bayer, in \n1998; Biaxin, used to treat disseminated mycobacterial infections due \nto Mycobacterium avium-intracellular complex (MAC), produced $1.25 \nbillion in revenue for Abbott Laboratories, in 1998; Novir, used in \ncombination with nucleoside analogues for the treatment of HIV-\ninfections, produced $250 million for Abbott Laboratories, in 1998; \nEpogen, used to treat anemia related to AZT therapy, produced $1.38 \nbillion in revenue for Amgen, in 1998; Sustiva, used to treat HIV-1 \ninfections in combination with other antiretrovirals, produced $75 \nmillion in revenue for DuPont Pharmaceuticals in 1998.\n\n  Viramune, used to treat HIV-infected adults experiencing clinical or \nimmunologic deterioration, produced $154 million in revenue for \nBoehringer Ingelheim, in 1998; Serostim, used for the treatment of \nAIDS-wasting and cachexia, produced $88 million in revenue for the \nAres-Serono Group in 1998; Viracept, used to treat HIV infection when \nantiretroviral therapy is needed in adults and pediatric patients that \nare at least two years old, produced $530 million for Agouron \nPharmaceuticals, in 1998; and Abelcet, used to treat aspergillosis, a \nfungal infection, produced $73 million for The Liposome Company, in \n1998.\n  All of the above-mentioned drugs were among the 500 best selling \ndrugs in the world, in 1998.\n  Driven in no small part by the profits on HIV/AIDS drugs, the \npharmaceutical sector has proven to be one of the most profitable \ncorporate sectors in the world. In 1999 pharmaceutical companies had a \n18.6 percent return on revenues, which is 17 percent higher than the \nnumber two sector on the list, and a 16.5 percent return on assets, \nwhich is 7 percent higher than the number two sector on the list.\n  For shame, for opposing this amendment.\n  Merck, the producer of Crixivan, had an 18 percent return on revenues \nand a 17 percent return on assets.\n  Bristol-Meyers Squibb, the producer of Taxol, Zerit, and Videx, had a \n21 percent return on revenues and a 24 percent return on assets.\n  Pfizer, the producer of Zithromax and Fluconazole, had a 20 percent \nreturn on revenues and a 15 percent return on assets.\n  Abbott Laboratories, the producer of Biaxin and Norvir, had a 19 \npercent return on revenues and a 17 percent return on assets.\n  Amgen, the producer of Epogen, had a 33 percent return on revenues \nand a 27 percent return on assets.\n  Ironically, the pharmaceutical companies would profit more from the \napproach embodied in my amendment than they do right now. Presently, \nmost sub-Saharan African countries are not buying these drugs since \nthey can not afford the price tag, so the pharmaceutical companies are \nnot earning any money at all on these HIV/AIDS drugs in these \ncountries. But if sub-Saharan African countries produced HIV/AIDS drugs \nthrough ``compulsory licensing,'' or purchased them by ``parallel \nimporting,'' the pharmaceutical companies holding the patents on these \ndrugs would receive royalties.\n  I have a very hard time understanding how lobbyists behind closed \ndoors prevail on this body, in the middle of a world health crisis, to \nprevent the use of cheaper drugs when the figures I have documented are \ndecimating these countries in a major public health emergency. I don't \nknow how they sleep at night. I really do not. I don't know how they \ncan look at a country with 1 million or 2 million AIDS-produced orphans \nand sleep at night. I really do not understand it.\n  Let me touch for a moment on what else is to be done.\n  By itself, the approach of the Feinstein-Feingold Amendment, and the \nPresident's Executive order, will not solve the problem of HIV/AIDS in \nAfrica. It only addresses one area--an important area, but only one--of \na large and complex problem.\n  As Dr. David Satcher, the Surgeon General of the United States, wrote \nin ``The Global HIV/AIDS Epidemic'' in JAMA, the Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association, in April 1998:\n\n       More than a decade of experience has taught us how to \n     control HIV/AIDS--we know what works. Many developed \n     countries have successfully checked the spread of the \n     epidemic. While development of therapy and a vaccine \n     continue, prevention must be emphasized. The basic elements \n     of prevention include education, behavior change, voluntary \n     testing and counseling prevention of perinatal transmission, \n     and political commitment. Each country must find the mix of \n     methods appropriate to its particular conditions.\n       Education about HIV/AIDS is necessary but alone does not \n     change the behavior of populations. Promotion of voluntary \n     testing and counseling must complement education. Testing and \n     counseling break the deadly silence around HIV/AIDS and \n     empower individuals to make informed decisions and change \n     behaviors. Breaking the silence also will begin to diffuse \n     the stigma surrounding the disease. We have seen success with \n     behavioral change in Uganda and Thailand, the only two less-\n     developed countries with extensive capacity for voluntary \n     testing and counseling.\n       It is known that perinatal transmission of HIV can be \n     reduced by more than 50% by using antiretroviral therapy; \n     however problems with access to these drugs limit their use \n     in some countries. Transmission of HIV through breast-feeding \n     and poor survival of orphans make the avoidance of disease \n     via treatment for perinatal transmission more complex. We \n     continue to work with international organizations, other \n     governments, and pharmaceutical companies to lower costs and \n     expand access to antiretroviral drugs. Current treatment for \n     perinatal transmission, as well as use of antiretrovirals in \n     general, in less-developed countries is also limited by the \n     fact that very few people have been tested for HIV infection.\n       Treatment of other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) is \n     important to control the spread of HIV. One of the reasons \n     HIV has spread so rapidly in Africa is that so many STDs go \n     untreated. Untreated STDs break down natural barriers that \n     prevent transmission. Access to even basic treatment for STDs \n     remains a problem for many less-developed countries.\n       Perhaps most important in the global battle against HIV/\n     AIDS is political commitment. Leaders at the national, \n     provincial, and local levels of government must speak out \n     about HIV/AIDS and encourage businesses and nongovernmental \n     organizations to commit to work against the disease. I was \n     encouraged by U.S. Vice President Al Gore and Deputy \n     President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, who put the HIV/AIDS \n     threat at the top of the international agenda at the recent \n     meeting of the United States-South Africa Joint Commission. \n     They set an important example for leaders in developed and \n     less-developed countries.\n       American medicine and public health have an important role \n     to play in the global battle against HIV/AIDS by supporting \n     international organizations such as the Joint United Nations \n     Program on HIV/AIDS, the World Health Organization, and the \n     World Bank.\n       HIV/AIDS can be likened to the plague that decimated the \n     population of Europe in the 14th century. While the modern \n     epidemic affects people of all age groups, those of working \n     age are at highest risk, posing potentially dire economic, \n     social, and political consequences for the global community. \n     Unfortunately, the world continues to devote greater \n     attention and resources to traditional national security \n     issues such as wars, postponing notice of an epidemic that, \n     if left to spread unchecked, will kill more people than any \n     of the terrible conflagrations that have so marked this \n     century.\n\n  Because of the complexity of dealing with this issue, the Clinton-\nGore Administration has asked Congress to commit $150 million toward \nvaccine research and AIDS treatment and prevention programs in Africa.\n  The Administration's initiative dedicates $100 million for the \nprevention and treatment of HIV and AIDS in Africa, Asia and other \nregions, doubling current U.S. funding of AIDS prevention efforts. An \nadditional $50 million will go to the Vaccine Fund of the\n\n[[Page S3802]]\n\nGlobal Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations for research, and the \npurchase and distribution of vaccines for other infectious diseases in \ndeveloping nations.\n  The Administration's initiative, announced by the Vice President this \npast January, also includes plans for a public-private partnership with \nU.S. business leaders active in Africa, with a goal of developing \nworkplace education programs designed to end the stigma and ``break \ndown the barriers against discussing AIDS.''\n  The Vice President has also proposed specific funding for the U.S. \nmilitary to work with armed forces in Africa to combat AIDS, an \nespecially important initiative given the high rates of infection among \nsoldiers.\n  I believe that it is crucial that we provide support for these \nefforts at least at the level the Administration has called for.\n  In fact, I am a cosponsor of a bill introduced by my colleague from \nCalifornia, Senator Boxer, which calls for USAID to make HIV/AIDS a \npriority in foreign assistance funding and authorizes $2 billion over \nfive years, with at least 50 percent targeted at sub-Saharan Africa, \nfor a comprehensive coordinated effort to combat HIV/AIDS, including \ntesting, education, treatment, and the provision of medicines to \nprevent mother-to-child transmissions.\n  I should note here that I was also disappointed that the Conference \nchoose not to include an Administration initiative to provide a tax \ncredit for the President's Millennium Vaccine Initiative tax credit \nproposal. This proposal would create a tax credit to encourage the \ndevelopment of vaccines for malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, or any \ninfectious disease that causes over 1 million deaths annually \nworldwide.\n  Such a tax credit would encourage the development of a vaccine for \nHIV/AIDS. As Dr. Seth Berkley, president of the International AIDS \nVaccine Initiative has put it: ``We need new prevention technologies, \nand the most critical one is a vaccine. . . . Ultimately, only a \nvaccine can stop the epidemic.''\n  These actions and policies must be part of a larger development \neffort if we are to help these sub-Saharan African countries control \nthe HIV/AIDS pandemic.\n  Debt relief must also be part of a this larger development effort. It \nis unconscionable that many of these countries are spending more than a \nquarter of their precious export earnings on debt service payments to \nbilateral and multilateral creditors. The World Bank is correct when it \ndeclares that debt burdens at these levels are unsustainable.\n  The citizens of most of these countries are extremely poor, and they \nare burdened with unsustainable debts built up during the Cold War. \nThese debts were accrued during the 1970s and 1980s by unaccountable \ngovernments.\n  Debt service diverts scarce resources away from spending on health \ncare, health education, and poverty reduction initiatives in these \ncountries. Debt servicing absorbs up to 40 percent of national revenue \namong a majority of countries in sub-Saharan Africa.\n  We must lead the international community in efforts to write-off \nunsustainable debts so these countries can spend more money health \neducation, infrastructure and services, as well as other development \nneeds.\n  Let me conclude and thank the Senate for its forbearance. I am sorry \nfor my display of emotion. I have watched people die of AIDS. I know \nwhat it is like. I can't imagine what it must be like in Africa where \ncitizens maybe don't have a home, where they have an enormous cultural \ntaboo attached to it, where there is no food, there is no medicine, and \nto know that a few pills can prevent the transmission of AIDS to a \nchild for a nominal sum of money, and to know, literally, that in the \ncoming years this could save 5 to 10 million people.\n  Just to think of what went on behind closed doors by lobbyists for \npharmaceutical companies is unconscionable. The TRIPS agreement, the \nWorld Trade Organization, at a time of national health emergency, \npermits compulsory licensing and parallel importing. For these \npharmaceutical companies that have made the kind of money they have \nmade--and I know they will say they spent millions and millions on \nresearch and development; I have a member of my family who was director \nof research for one of the companies that worked on an antiretroviral--\nthe bottom line is every one of these annual reports shows a \nsubstantial increase in profit.\n  Yet in little-known countries in sub-Saharan Africa, people are \nliterally dying by the millions. Today we are considering a trade \ninitiative bill which aims at giving them a better way of life. What is \nthe better way of life if you can't live? What is the better way of \nlife if you are dying of AIDS? What is a better way of life if you were \n1 of 5 million orphans born in sub-Saharan Africa? What is a better \nlife if you were born one of these HIV-infected orphans?\n  I find the act of pharmaceutical companies in opposing this amendment \nunconscionable.\n  I thank the Chair for its forbearance, and I thank the Senate. I also \nthank the administration for doing a major act of conscience in the \nproduction of an Executive order which will allow the purchase of these \ndrugs at the lowest possible rates.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                            Executive Order\n\n\n      access to hiv/aids pharmaceuticals and medical technologies\n\n       By the authority vested in me as President by the \n     Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, \n     including section 141 and chapter 1 of title III of the Trade \n     Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2171, 2411-2420), section \n     307 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 2421), and \n     section 104 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended \n     (22 U.S.C. 2151b), and in accordance with executive branch \n     policy on health-related intellectual property matters to \n     promote access to essential medicines, it is hereby ordered \n     as follows:\n       Section 1. Policy. (a) In administering sections 301-310 of \n     the Trade Act of 1974, the United States shall not seek, \n     through negotiation or otherwise, the revocation or revision \n     of any intellectual property law or policy of a beneficiary \n     sub-Saharan African country, as determined by the President, \n     that regulates HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals or medical \n     technologies if the law or policy of the country:\n       (1) promotes access to HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals or medical \n     technologies for affected populations in that country; and\n       (2) provides adequate and effective intellectual property \n     protection consistent with the Agreement on Trade-Related \n     Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) \n     referred to in section 101(d)(15) of the Uruguay Round \n     Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3511(d)(15)).\n       (b) The United States shall encourage all beneficiary sub-\n     Saharan African countries to implement policies designed to \n     address the underlying causes of the HIV/AIDS crisis by, \n     among other things, making efforts to encourage practices \n     that will prevent further transmission and infection and to \n     stimulate development of the infrastructure necessary to \n     deliver adequate health services, and by encouraging policies \n     that provide an incentive for public and private research on, \n     and development of, vaccines and other medical innovations \n     that will combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa.\n       Sec. 2. Rationale: (a) This order finds that:\n       (1) since the onset of the worldwide HIV/AIDS epidemic, \n     approximately 34 million people living in sub-Saharan Africa \n     have been infected with the disease;\n       (2) of those infected, approximately 11.5 million have \n     died;\n       (3) the deaths represent 83 percent of the total HIV/AIDS \n     related deaths worldwide; and\n       (4) access to effective therapeutics for HIV/AIDS is \n     determined by issues of price, health system infrastructure \n     for delivery, and sustainable financing.\n       (b) In light of these findings, this order recognizes that:\n       (1) it is in the interest of the United States to take all \n     reasonable steps to prevent further spread of infectious \n     disease, particularly HIV/AIDS;\n       (2) there is critical need for effective incentives to \n     develop new pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and therapies to \n     combat the HIV/AIDS crisis, including effective global \n     intellectual property standards designed to foster \n     pharmaceutical and medical innovation;\n       (3) the overriding priority for responding to the crisis of \n     HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa should be to improve public \n     education and to encourage practices that will prevent \n     further transmission and infection, and to stimulate \n     development of the infrastructure necessary to deliver \n     adequate health care services;\n       (4) the United States should work with individual countries \n     in sub-Saharan Africa to assist them in development of \n     effective public education campaigns aimed at the prevention \n     of HIV/AIDS transmission and infection, and to improve their \n     health care infrastructure to promote improved access to \n     quality health care for their citizens in general, and \n     particularly with respect to the HIV/AIDS epidemic;\n       (5) an effective United States response to the crisis in \n     sub-Saharan Africa must focus in the short term on preventive \n     programs designed to reduce the frequency of new infections \n     and remove the stigma of the disease,\n\n[[Page S3803]]\n\n     and should place a priority on basic health services that can \n     be used to treat opportunistic infections, sexually \n     transmitted infections, and complications associated with \n     HIV/AIDS so as to prolong the duration and improve the \n     quality of life of those with the disease;\n       (6) an effective United States response to the crisis must \n     also focus on the development of HIV/AIDS vaccines to prevent \n     the spread of the disease;\n       (7) the innovative capacity of the United States in the \n     commercial and public pharmaceutical research sectors is \n     unmatched in the world, and the participation of both these \n     sectors will be a critical element in any successful program \n     to respond to the HIV/AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa;\n       (8) the TRIPS Agreement recognizes the importance of \n     promoting effective and adequate protection of the \n     intellectual property rights and the right of countries to \n     adopt measures necessary to protect public health;\n       (9) individual countries should have the ability to take \n     measures to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic, provided that such \n     measures are consistent with their international obligations; \n     and\n       (10) successful initiatives will require effective \n     partnerships and cooperation among governments, international \n     organizations, nongovernmental organizations, and the private \n     sector, and greater consideration should be given to \n     financial, legal, and other incentives that will promote \n     improved prevention and treatment actions.\n       Sec. 3. Scope. (a) This order prohibits the United States \n     Government from taking action pursuant to section 301(b) of \n     the Trade Act of 1974 with respect to any law or policy in \n     beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries that promotes \n     access to HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals or medical technologies \n     and that provides adequate and effective intellectual \n     property protection consistent with the TRIPS Agreement. \n     However, this order does not prohibit United States \n     Government officials from evaluating, determining, or \n     expressing concern about whether such a law or policy \n     promotes access to HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals or medical \n     technologies or provides adequate and effective intellectual \n     property protection consistent with the TRIPS Agreement. In \n     addition, this order does not prohibit United States \n     Government officials from consulting with or otherwise \n     discussing with sub-Saharan African governments whether such \n     law or policy meets the conditions set forth in section 1(a) \n     of this order. Moreover, this order does not prohibit the \n     United States Government from invoking the dispute settlement \n     procedures of the World Trade Organization to examine whether \n     any such law or policy is consistent with the Uruguay Round \n     Agreements, referred to in section 101(d) of the Uruguay \n     Round Agreements Act.\n       (b) This order is intended only to improve the internal \n     management of the executive branch and is not intended to, \n     and does not create, any right or benefit, substantive or \n     procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against \n     the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its \n     officers or employees, or any other person.\n                                               William J. Clinton.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent, at the conclusion of my \nremarks, a Republican Senator be recognized to speak, if one seeks \nrecognition, and that Senator Hollings be the next speaker recognized \nto speak thereafter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me first say the senior Senator from \nCalifornia certainly should not apologize for her emotion. If there \never was an issue that deserves such a powerful display of passion and \nemotion, it is this issue of the AIDS crisis in Africa and the \noutrageous nerve of these pharmaceutical companies of removing this \nmodest provision that the Senate unanimously placed in the bill in the \nconference report. It is an abysmal moment.\n  I thank the Senator for her leadership, her passion, and for her \nwillingness to continue this fight that we all will continue as long as \nit takes.\n  Before we go any further with this conference report, I come to the \nfloor to follow on the comments of the Senator from California to make \nsomething clear to my colleagues. I think we can do better than this. \nWe have lost our way with this new Africa policy. We have to chart a \nnew course if we are to seek a better world for Africa and for America.\n  I say this as a Senator, an American, and as a human being who has \nbeen to Africa, seen its promise, and been appalled by its suffering. I \ncome here to express my disappointment about the African Growth and \nOpportunity Act and my deep dismay about how and why the Feinstein-\nFeingold amendment on the HIV/AIDS crisis was kept out of the \nconference report.\n  Very simply, I am talking today about the future of U.S.-Africa \npolicy. We have a role to play in Africa's future and we have to decide \nwhat that role is going to be. Some in this body think AGOA is the \nright example of what our role in Africa's future should be. The \nAfrican Growth and Opportunities Act supporters believe this \nlegislation is somehow a landmark, that it represents a real \nopportunity for growth on the continent, a new way of thinking about \nAfrica. They want us to believe, as they believe, that to reject it \nwould be to reject all engagement with the continent and, indeed, to \nreject all of the enterprise and energy of the people of Africa.\n  But they are wrong. This bill is deeply flawed. For 7 years I have \nserved on the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Africa and I have \ncommitted myself to supporting democratization, peace, and development \nin the many countries of that continent. I support engagement with \nAfrica as strongly as any Member of this body. I am deeply concerned \nabout the dearth of economic ties between the people of the United \nStates and those of the African Continent. The current level of trade \nbetween us is depressingly small. Africa represents only 1 percent of \nour imports, 1 percent of our exports, and only 1 percent of our \nforeign direct investment.\n  So if the question is, Should something be done to stimulate our \ntrade with Africa, the answer is ``absolutely.'' But I urge this body, \nlet's not pretend we are now somehow debating a comprehensive trade \npackage for Africa, for this bill is not in any sense comprehensive. \nLet's not fail to address the need to build an environment, an actual \nenvironment that will foster and sustain mutually beneficial economic \nrelationships. If we fail to assemble the components of that \nenvironment in this trade package, it cannot be called comprehensive, \nand I would certainly say it should not even be passed.\n  There really are only two defensible views of this bill. It either \ndoes virtually nothing at all, or it does actual harm. This legislation \ndoes very little for Africa. The trade benefits we are talking about \nare not terribly significant, primarily making African states eligible \nfor temporary preferential access to the U.S. markets for textiles and \napparel. Many of Africa's primary exports are not addressed at all by \nthis legislation. This legislation does little to address the African \ncontext for economic growth and that context is a challenging one. It \nis a context of boundless potential amid a web of obstacles.\n  Economic growth in sub-Sarahan Africa faces the obstacle of a \nstaggering $230 billion in bilateral and multilateral debt. Africa's \ndebt service requirements now take over 20 percent of the region's \nexport earnings. How can Africa, to which the Presiding Officer has \ncertainly devoted a lot of his attention, become a strong economic \npartner when its states must divert funds away from schools, away from \nhealth care, and away from infrastructure in order to service this \ncrushing debt burden? How can we talk about economic engagement and \nsimply pay lip service to these painfully obvious realities?\n  I am sorry to say in several ways I think this legislation actually \nwould do harm. By addressing seriously only one industry, the textile \nindustry, it fails to support the kind of diversification that any \neconomy, including African economies, need to regain strength and \nstability. I fear AGOA also fails to adequately tackle the serious \nproblem of transshipment.\n\n  Transshiment is a practice whereby, for example, producers in China \nand other third party countries establish sham production facilities in \ncountries which may export to the United States under more favorable \nconditions. Then these producers ship goods, made in their factories at \nhome and meant for the U.S. market, to the third country. In this case \nit would be an African country. They pack it or assemble it in some \nminor way and send it off to the United States of America with a new \nlabel ``Made In Africa,'' thereby enjoying all the trade benefits that \nlabel would bring.\n  As I told my colleagues on a number of occasions, and as I think they \nknow, transshipment is really a very serious problem. Approximately $2 \nbillion worth of illegally transshipped textiles\n\n[[Page S3804]]\n\nenter the United States every year. The U.S. Customs Service has \ndetermined that for every $1 billion of illegally transshipped products \nthat enter the United States, 40,000 jobs in the textile and apparel \nsector are lost.\n  In this regard, just to give you a sense of the thinking that goes on \nbehind this kind of scam, I would like to share some of the words from \nthe People's Republic of China. This is a quote taken directly from the \nofficial web site of the Chinese Ministry of Trade and Economic \nCooperation. This is the quote:\n\n       There are many opportunities for Chinese business people in \n     Africa. . . . Setting up assembly plants with Chinese \n     equipment, technology and personnel could not only greatly \n     increase sales in African countries, but also circumvent the \n     quotas imposed on commodities of Chinese origin imposed by \n     European and American countries.\n\n  There it is, right on their web page. It is not hard to see that \nthose who would engage in transshipment are not too worried about the \nprotections we currently have in place to guard against it. This same \nvisa system that has failed us in the past is the basis, again, for the \nallegedly effective AGOA protections. In fact, the African Growth and \nOpportunity Act does not require that Africans themselves be employed \nat firms that are receiving the trade benefits. This is progress? If \nnothing else, I think it raises a red flag for my colleagues, when they \nconsider the African Growth and Opportunity Act. This should be a \ncrystal clear signal: Nothing in this Act ensures that whatever \nopportunities this legislation may create--there is no guarantee these \nwill be opportunities for Africans, for citizens of African countries.\n  AGOA does not mention environmental standards at all, but any plan \nfor sustainable economic development must include some notion of \nenvironmental protection. I think this is especially true of a \ncontinent like Africa where, in some countries, 85 percent of the \npeople live directly off the land. We are all affected when logging and \nmining deplete African rain forests and increase global warming.\n  We all lose when species unique to Africa are lost to hasty profit-\nmaking schemes, hatched without regard to sustainability or long-term \nenvironmental effects. Environmental quality also has serious \nimplications for peace and stability in the region. As we have seen in \nthe Niger Delta, environmental degradation can lead to civil unrest. \nResponsible trade policies must adequately address human rights and \nenvironmental issues, not just because it is the right thing to do but \nbecause also in the long run it will create a better business climate \nfor Africans and Americans alike.\n  In addition, the African Growth and Opportunity Act fails to address \nthe critical role that development assistance ought to play in \npromoting African growth and opportunity. That failure has raised an \nalarm here at home and internationally. The perception is that the \nUnited States has deluded itself into believing that a small package of \ntrade benefits, benefits which may not actually benefit Africans \nthemselves, can replace a responsible and well-monitored program of \ndevelopment assistance. I am afraid that this inevitably will cast \ndoubt on the U.S. commitment to development in Africa.\n  I care about each of the objections I just raised to this bill. But \nlet me tell you, just as the senior Senator from California indicated, \nmore than anything else what makes me doubt the U.S. commitment to \ndevelopment in Africa is that this conference report turns a blind eye \nto the AIDS crisis by excluding the modest Feinstein-Feingold \namendment. As the ranking member of the subcommittee on Africa, I have \nalways felt very strongly about the issue of AIDS in Africa. I tried to \nraise it last year and this year in the context of the Africa trade \ndebate. I raised it on many occasions in meetings with African heads of \nstate.\n  I applaud the U.N. Security Council's decision to address the crisis \nearlier this year, and I do support the administration's call to \nincrease the resources directed at this AIDS crisis. But what I cannot \nsupport, what I cannot applaud, and what I cannot even understand is \nhow this body can pass up an opportunity to take just one small step \ntoward addressing the AIDS crisis in Africa. I am referring to the \nFeinstein-Feingold amendment. It was very modest. It simply prohibited \nFederal money from being used to lobby a government to change TRIPS-\ncompliant laws, allowing access to HIV drugs. Our amendment was taken \nout in the conference committee. So now this bill, which makes a weak \nattempt to address Africa trade as it is, does nothing--an African \nGrowth and Opportunity Act does nothing to actually address the HIV/\nAIDS crisis that affects every aspect of the African economy, not to \nmention every African life.\n  We have before us a conference report which does nothing to fight the \nAIDS crisis that is ravaging Africa, threatening to destroy its \neconomies and decimate its communities. Why? How can it be that we will \ndebate a bill of this nature and ignore the single most important issue \nfacing sub-Sarahan Africa today? Why is it that one modest provision \nincluded by this Senate, the Feinstein-Feingold amendment regarding \nHIV/AIDS drug in Africa, was removed from this bill?\n  When the Senate was debating that legislation last year, Senator \nFeinstein and I offered our amendment, which was readily accepted by \nthe bill's managers, Senators Roth and Moynihan, to address a \ncritically important issue--an issue relating to Africa's devastating \nAIDS crisis; an issue that has cast a dark shadow on United States-\nAfrican relations in the past.\n  Our amendment was simple. It prohibited the U.S. Government or any \nagent of the U.S. Government from pressuring African countries to \nrevoke or change laws aimed at increasing access to HIV/AIDS drugs, so \nlong as the laws in question adhere to existing international \nregulations governing trade. Quite simply, our amendment told the \nexecutive branch to stop twisting the arms of African countries that \nare using legal means to improve access to HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals for \ntheir people.\n  The Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property \nRights, or TRIPS, allows for compulsory licensing in cases of national \nemergency. Approximately 13 million African lives have been lost since \nthe onset of the crisis. According to the Rockefeller Foundation's \nrecent report, ``on statistics alone, young people from the most \naffected countries in Africa are more likely than not to perish of \nAIDS.'' Consider that I say to my colleagues: more likely to perish \nthan not. If these do not constitute emergency conditions, then I do \nnot know what does.\n  This was a very modest amendment, but the final version of the \namendment discussed by the conferees was even more modest. It was a \ntrue compromise. It was not as strong as I would have liked it to be, \nand I worked hard to keep it strong, but even the compromise pushed our \npolicy closer to the right thing. I again thank the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Feinstein, the Senator from New York, Mr. Moynihan, \nand the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Roth, and their staffs for working \nso hard to keep this amendment in at the conference level.\n  But despite these efforts, despite the concessions that Senator \nFeinstein and I made, despite the fact that this is the right thing to \ndo, the Feinstein-Feingold amendment was stripped in conference. The \nopposition to our amendment is baffling. How do the conferees who \nkilled this provision justify pressuring these countries, where in some \ncases AIDS has reduced life expectancies by more than 15 years, not to \nuse all legal means at their disposal to provide effective medicines \nfor their citizens? Without broader access to these drugs in Africa, \nmore people will suffer, more people will die--that is a simple fact.\n  I cannot imagine that ordinary Americans are urging their \nrepresentatives to oppose the Feinstein-Feingold amendment. I cannot \nimagine that anyone would try to prevail upon my colleagues to oppose \nthis measure--except perhaps for pharmaceutical companies. The \npharmaceutical industry does not fear losing customers in Africa, \nbecause they know that Africans simply cannot afford their prices. But \nthey do fear that taking this modest step in this time of crisis could \nsomehow, in some ill-defined scenario in the future, cut into their \nmost important consideration: their bottom line.\n  That brings me to the calling of the bankroll.\n  From time to time on this floor when we debate the issues, I review \nsome\n\n[[Page S3805]]\n\nfacts and figures that most of my colleagues are unwilling to discuss.\n  I have dubbed it the ``calling of the bankroll''--a chance for my \ncolleagues and the public to consider not just the issues, but the \nmoney that drives the issues in our democracy today.\n  I can tell you, the pharmaceutical industry is certainly no exception \nwhen it comes to playing the political money game--in fact, huge \ndonations to the parties are the rule in the pharmaceutical industry.\n  I would like to discuss a few of the companies that fought against \nthe Feinstein-Feingold amendment, not in terms of policy, although I \nhave certainly done that and will continue to, but in terms of \npolitical donations.\n  All the figures I am about to cite are for the first 15 months of the \ncurrent election cycle--all of 1999 and the first 3 months of this \nyear.\n\n  I will start with Pfizer, which is one of several pharmaceutical \ngiants that rank among the top soft money donors in 1999, and with good \nreason. Pfizer and its executives gave more than $511,000 in soft money \nduring the period, including a $100,000 contribution earlier this year. \nPfizer was also a top PAC money donor in its industry during the \nperiod, with more than $242,000 to Federal candidates during the \nperiod.\n  Then there's Bristol Myers Squibb, another top soft money donor, \nwhich, with its executives, gave nearly $529,000 in soft money to the \nparties, including two $100,000 contributions during the period. \nBristol Myers Squibb also gave more than $146,000 in PAC money during \nthe period.\n  Merck and Company gave more than $51,000 in soft money and nearly \n$168,000 in PAC money during the period.\n  And finally, Glaxo Wellcome and its executives gave more than \n$272,000 in soft money to the parties and gave more PAC money than any \nother pharmaceutical company during the period--more than $291,000.\n  Those are the donations of some of the pharmaceutical companies that \nfought so hard against the Feinstein-Feingold amendment. They are \ndonations that signal influence, power, and political clout--political \nclout that most Americans could never hope for, and no African living \nwith HIV could ever dream of. In the fight over the Feinstein-Feingold \namendment, the pharmaceutical companies clearly got their way, while \nmillions of Africans suffering from HIV and AIDS were left without even \none glimmer of hope from this body or this bill.\n  The people of Africa desperately need hope in the midst of the AIDS \ncrisis. I am going to share some numbers, along the lines of other \nspeakers, that put the staggering AIDS crisis in Africa in stark \nrelief.\n  The disease is already the fourth biggest cause of death in the \nworld. In at least five African countries, more than one adult in five \nhas HIV.\n  Economic growth in Africa faces the obstacle of a devastating HIV/\nAIDS epidemic. In the course of 1998, AIDS was responsible for an \nestimated 2 million African deaths. That is 5,500 deaths a day. At \nleast 12 million Africans have been killed by AIDS since the onset of \nthe crisis. Africa accounts for over half of the world's cases of HIV. \nThe realities of a continent gripped by this disease are truly \nhorrifying--lines outside cemeteries as families wait to bury the dead, \nand morgues that operate around the clock, 7 days a week. I am told in \nHarare, Zimbabwe there are 24-hour morgues.\n  For Africa's children, it may be most horrifying of all. Eighty-seven \npercent of the world's HIV-positive children live in Africa. According \nto World Bank President James Wolfensohn, the disease has left 10 \nmillion African orphans in its wake. Their lives are that continent's \nfuture. Their chronic illness and their deaths each day erode a little \nmore of Africa's promise. It is difficult to see how the United States \ncan enjoy mutually beneficial trade relations with Africa unless we \ncommit ourselves to addressing the HIV/AIDS crisis on a scale beyond \nanything we have done before.\n  In Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe, 25 percent of the people \nbetween the ages of 15 and 19 are HIV positive.\n  One report by ING Barings, an investment bank, said that almost 19 \npercent of all skilled workers in South Africa will have HIV by 2015. \nTo make matters worse, food production in southern Africa has been \nimpacted by the crisis. For example, maize production in Zimbabwe \ndeclined 61 percent last year due to illness and death from AIDS.\n  By 2010, sub-Saharan Africa will have 71 million fewer people than it \nwould have had if there had been no AIDS epidemic.\n  My recent trip to ten African countries only renewed my resolve to \naddress this matter with the urgency and seriousness it deserves.\n  When we were in Namibia, I saw a group of HIV-positive citizens pull \nup to a meeting in a van with curtained windows, and they hurried to \nthe safety of the meeting room as soon as they arrived. They were \nfearful. They were afraid that their identity would be revealed, and \nthat the stigma still attached to the disease would cause them to lose \ntheir jobs and maybe even to be disowned by their own families. It was \nshocking--in a country gripped by the epidemic, people are still afraid \nto acknowledge the crisis.\n  In Zambia I visited an orphanage of sorts, where 500 children, many \nof them orphaned when AIDS killed their parents, gathered by day.\n  This isn't even an orphanage where you get to stay at night. It is \njust a place where a bunch of kids who don't have any parents hang out \nduring the day before they go out to the streets at night to sleep. At \nnight, there is only room for 50 of them--the rest must make their own \narrangements, and many end up sleeping on the streets, sometimes \nprostituting themselves--thereby risking exposure to HIV in their own \nstruggle to survive. By the end of this year, an astonishing 10.4 \nmillion African children under 15 will have lost their mothers or both \nparents to AIDS--90 percent of the global total of AIDS orphans.\n\n  In Zimbabwe, some estimates indicate that life expectancy has \nprecipitously dropped from 65 to 39 years. Let me repeat that: life \nexpectancy in Zimbabwe dropped from 65 to 39. Walking past the \nParliament building one day, I asked how old one had to be to become a \nlegislator there in Zimbabwe. What was the answer? The answer was 40. \nLife expectancy is 39, but you have to be 40 to be elected to the \nlegislature. That exchange helped me to grasp how far-reaching the \nconsequences of this disease really are--no society is structured in a \nway that prepares it to deal with an unchecked epidemic like AIDS. In \nsouthern Africa, life expectancy at birth is dropping at a frightening \nrate. According to one recent U.N. report, expected life spans in the \nregion will drop from 59 years in the early 1990s to just 45 by the \nyear 2010.\n  In July 1999, the National Institutes of Health released a report on \nthe effectiveness of a drug called nevirapine--NVP--in preventing \nmother-to-child transmission of HIV. Studies indicate that this drug \ncan reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission by more than 50 \npercent.\n  NVP is given just once to the mother during labor and once to the \nbaby within 3 days after birth. It cost $4 per tablet. This relatively \nsimple and inexpensive drug regimen has created an unprecedented \nopportunity for international cooperation in the fight against the \nvertical transmission of HIV.\n  And Uganda is making real headway with regard to prevention. There \nwas a time in Uganda when, of the women coming to the reproductive \nhealth clinics, 35 to 40 percent of them tested positive for HIV. But \nsince 1992, the Ugandan Government's very frank and high-profile public \neducation efforts have helped to reduce the incidence of HIV infection \nby more than 15 percent. Uganda has shown that something can be done. \nUganda has demonstrated that prevention can work.\n  But despite these positive signs, there are many fronts on which \nthere has been very little progress. Virtually no one has access to \ndrugs to treat the disease. Prevention is unquestionably the most \nimportant element of the equation, but treatment cannot be ignored. \nPoverty should not be a death sentence--not when the infectious disease \nthat is destroying African society can be treated.\n  The AIDS crisis in Africa is exactly what the TRIPS agreement was \nmeant to address. This is a crisis, an emergency on an incomprehensibly \nvast scale. This is the rare and urgent situation that calls for \nsomething beyond a\n\n[[Page S3806]]\n\ndogmatic approach to intellectual property rights.\n  If allowing for a TRIPS-compliant response seems expensive, just \nthink how expensive it will be, in the long run, not to do so. Even \nbeyond the human tragedy, there are vast economic costs to this \nepidemic. AIDS affects the most productive segment of society. It is \nturning the future leaders of the region into a generation of orphans.\n  It is simply unconscionable for the U.S. Government to fight the \nlegal efforts of African states to save their people from this plague. \nI cannot imagine why any of my colleagues would support such action. \nThose dissatisfied with the TRIPS agreement should focus their efforts \non changing it--not on twisting the arms of countries in crisis who \nseek only to protect their people from sickness and death in a manner \nthat complies fully with international law.\n  Again, how could the irresponsible and callous decision to strip the \nFeinstein-Feingold amendment from the conference have been made? I have \nsome idea, as I said before. Some may have bowed to the pressure of the \npharmaceutical industry. And some members just don't get it.\n  But this body has to ``get it.'' We don't have time to posture while \nHIV infects more than 15,000 young people each day, and the most \nproductive segment of a society is wiped out by disease. We cannot \nwaste precious legislative opportunities as millions of orphans grow up \non Africa's streets, without any guidance or education. After \nwitnessing the shocking violence that resulted, in large part, from the \nmasterful manipulation of disenfranchised youth in West Africa over the \nlast decade, I think we all have to take this threat seriously, and \nacknowledge that the threat is fueled each day by the withering scourge \nof AIDS that today is galloping through so much of Africa and other \nparts of the developing world.\n\n  Mr. President, until recently this Senate has been moving in the \nright direction on these issues. I have been pleased to work with many \nof my colleagues in a bipartisan effort--I do want to mention in \nparticular the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Tennessee for his \nefforts in this regard--we have worked together to raise the profile of \nthe epidemic and to work toward a comprehensive package aimed at \naddressing this crisis. It disturbs me a great deal to think that \nMembers of this body have somehow failed to hear us, or perhaps refused \nto listen.\n  As long as we fail to grasp the magnitude of the epidemic and its \nconsequences, AIDS will continue to take its terrible toll on families \nand communities, on economies, and on stability around the world. And \nas long as we pass legislation like AGOA, we fail to seriously address \nvirtually every crucial aspect of our trade relationship with sub-\nSaharan Africa.\n  Everytime we make this kind of weak attempt to improve our trade \nrelationship with Africa, we admit that we are willing to dismiss \nAfrican countries' problems, and that we are comfortable ignoring the \ncontinent's boundless promise.\n  I care deeply about Africa and about U.S. policy towards Africa, and \nmy colleagues know that. But I am here today not just because of my own \nconcerns, but because of others--because I know how deeply they care \nabout Africa, and I have heard them voice their very serious concerns \nabout AGOA.\n  African-American leaders ranging from Cornel West to Randall Robinson \nhave opposed the African Growth and Opportunity Act.\n  Last year, a group of African-American Ministers representing \ncommunities from Massachusetts and Mississippi, California and New \nJersey, Virginia and Illinois came to Capitol Hill to express their \nopposition to the African Growth and Opportunity Act. I would like to \nsubmit the statement of Reverend Alexander Hurt of the Hurt Inner-City \nMinistries for the Record.\n  Here is what he said.\n\n       I have never fully felt like an American until the day that \n     I watched my President land in the land of my fathers. It was \n     like introducing two old friends to each other. That the AGOA \n     is in any way associated with that trip is saddest part of \n     this debate. There are millions of African-Americans who, \n     like me, connect the President's trip of Africa with a start \n     of a new kind of relationship between not only Africa and \n     America, but Africa and the West. AGOA closes that \n     possibility. For it represents not a new future, but a return \n     to the past.\n       America in a period of abundance that is unknown in human \n     history, can not be moved to reach out to Africa to help \n     starving nations. In the end we must decide if we will have a \n     foreign policy that reaches out with a hand toward nations as \n     equals, or with a hammer and pound them into subjection.  Few \n     things have changed with America's position toward Africa. \n     What was once done with the canon and the gun is now being \n     done with medicine and debt.\n\n  I have heard African voices raise the alarm about AGOA as well as \nAmerican ones. The Congress of South African Trade Unions, COSATU, has \nissued a statement opposing the African Growth and Opportunity Act.\n  A statement issued by 35 African NGOs--including Angola's Journalists \nfor the Environment and Development, Kenya's African Academy of \nSciences, South Africa's International People's Health Council and \nZambia's Foundation for Economic Progress--strongly opposed AGOA.\n  Women's groups have spoken out as well. WiLDAF--Women in Law \nDevelopment in Africa, a coalition of African women and women's \nadvocacy groups, opposes the African Growth and Opportunity Act, as \ndoes Women's EDGE, a coalition of international development \norganizations and domestic women's groups.\n  The Africa-America Institute organized focus group discussions in \neight African countries and the U.S. to foster discussion of proposed \nU.S.-Africa trade legislation. They found that AGOA will not contribute \nto African development unless the U.S. and other donor countries also \nincrease investments in African human resource development and take \nmeasures to relieve Africa's debt burden.\n  I know that others have voiced support for AGOA, and I don't question \ntheir motives. Some of those supporters believe that this is the only \ngame in town, and that a deeply flawed Africa trade bill is better than \nno bill at all. They are wrong. This bill should not become law.\n  Originally, I tried to make this bill better. I proposed alternative \nlegislation, the HOPE for Africa Act. It was based largely on the \nefforts of my colleague from the House, Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr., \nwho has been an important leader on this issue.\n  The provisions of the HOPE bill pointed the way toward a more \ncomprehensive and a more responsible U.S.-Africa trade policy.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to amend AGOA to make goods listed under the \nLome Convention eligible for duty-free access to the U.S., provided \nthose goods are not determined to be import-sensitive by the President. \nThese provisions would mean more trade opportunities for more African \npeople.\n  My proposals clearly spelled out the labor rights that our trade \npartners must enforce in order to receive benefits. They also contained \na monitoring procedure that involves the International Federation of \nTrade Unions, so that violations would not be glossed over at the \nexpense of African workers.\n  I proposed stronger human rights language, and incentives for foreign \ncompanies operating in Africa to bring their environmental practices \nthere up to the standards that they adhere to at home.\n  I proposed tough transshipment protections that give American \nentities a stake in the legality of the products they import. I wanted \nto be sure that Africans and Americans really would benefit from our \nU.S.-Africa trade policy.\n  In that same vein, I proposed that trade benefits be contingent upon \nthe level of African content in products and the employment of African \nworkers.\n  I proposed that the U.S. re-assert its commitment to responsible, \nwell-monitored development assistance for Africa.\n  Mr. President, I would have been irresponsible not to propose changes \nto AGOA to address the factors crippling Africa's economic potential \ntoday--debt, HIV/AIDS, and corruption.\n  I urged this Senate to include anti-corruption provisions, to address \ndebt relief, to prioritize HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, and to \naddress the issue of Africa's intellectual property laws, to ensure \nthat U.S. taxpayer dollars are not spent to undermine the legal efforts \nof some African countries to gain and retain access to low-cost \npharmaceuticals.\n\n[[Page S3807]]\n\n  Mr. President, if all of this sounds ambitious, it was. Any plan to \nseriously engage economically with Africa must be ambitious. We must be \nwilling to do what is necessary to knock down the obstacles to a \nhealthy, thriving and just commercial relationship between the \ncountries of Africa and the U.S. The bill before us falls far short of \nthe minimum meaningful effort. The rhetoric that surrounds the African \nGrowth and Opportunity Act is certainly ambitious. It is the content \nthat is insufficient.\n  We must demand more of a U.S.-Africa trade bill than AGOA has to \noffer. Ambitious plans can lead to rich rewards for both America and \nAfrica. Every time we turn our backs on a strong economic partnership \nwith African nations, we pass up an opportunity to bring stability, \ndemocracy, and prosperity to the continent.\n  We can do better than this, Mr. President. We must do better. We have \nveered dangerously off course with this legislation and with this \nconference report. It is time to reconsider this bill and the direction \nof U.S.-Africa policy because, very simply, our current course promises \nfailure of U.S. policy toward Africa and decades more of despair and \nlost opportunity for Africa's people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from Kentucky is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the conference \nreport to H.R. 434, the Africa/CBI bill.\n  This is a bad proposal, and it should not become law. In fact, the \nonly good thing that I can say about it is that it's not as bad as it \ncould have been. Still, it should not pass.\n  In recent years, we have lost over 5,000 textile jobs in southern \nKentucky. Nationwide, we have lost over 100,000 textile jobs since \nNAFTA. They're gone. They're not coming back.\n  Now there aren't many left, and I am not going to support any \nlegislation that I believe is going to ship the rest of these jobs \noverseas.\n  But, that's just what this bill would do. It would suspend quotas and \nduties on clothing made from many African-made fabrics. It calls for \nduty-free imports of T-shirts and fabric from the Caribbean.\n  In short, it's going to make it cheaper and more enticing for the \ntextile companies to locate overseas, where labor costs are lower, and \nto take jobs with them.\n  The bill also extends duty-free treatment to other ``import \nsensitive'' items like certain types of watches, electronic articles, \nsteel products, footwear, handbags, luggage, and glass products.\n  I respect the good intentions of those who support this bill in \nwanting to help poor countries in Africa and the Caribbean. But I don't \nthink we should do that at the expense of American workers and their \njobs.\n  Furthermore, this bill simply looks like a one-way street to me. It \nmakes it easier for African and Caribbean nations to import products to \nthe United States, but as far as I can tell it doesn't do much for the \nUnited States.\n  Of course, our economy is a lot bigger and stronger than all of \ntheir's put together, but that doesn't mean we just give away part of \nthe store for free.\n  Mr. President, I believe strongly in free trade. I have long \nsupported fast-track legislation to give the President broad authority \nto negotiate trade agreements. And I voted for the GATT legislation the \nlast time it came before Congress.\n  But I also believe in fair trade, and this bill isn't fair.\n  As I said earlier, this bill is bad but it is not as bad as it could \nhave been. When Congress first started working on this bill over 5 \nyears ago, it was intended to provide NAFTA-like treatment to imports \nfrom Caribbean nations. Fortunately, this bill doesn't go that far.\n  But, it still follows the same flawed concepts that are behind NAFTA \nand have driven at least 7,000 Kentucky jobs south to Mexico.\n  Supporters of this bill say that economic growth and investment in \nAfrican and Caribbean nations will benefit us in terms of increased \nexports and increased domestic employment because of those exports.\n  Of course we want healthy economies in this area to help strengthen \nthe growth and stability of democracy. But it doesn't make sense to \nsacrifice a United States industry to do it.\n  As I pointed out on the Senate floor last year, the Caribbean Basin \napparel and textile business is already booming. Last year, apparel and \ntextile exports from the Caribbean and Central America to the United \nStates grew 9 percent, double that of the United States economy.\n  Passing this bill simply rewards the U.S. companies that have already \nmoved offshore, and entices others to do the same. In the process, we \nstand to lose another 1.2 million jobs in the apparel and textile \nindustry.\n  We keep talking about creating a level playing field when it comes to \nfair trade. But this bill pulls the field right out from under U.S. \nindustries which have already had an uphill fight just to stay alive.\n  This is a flawed bill and I'm going to vote against it. I just don't \nsee where it's in our interest to make it easier for other countries to \ncompete with American industries, and to entice U.S. companies to \nrelocate abroad.\n  This bill is not fair to the American worker.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose it and any amendments that even try to \nmake it better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nSouth Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, as one would say on the bill affecting \ntextiles, in the famous words of President Reagan, ``Here we go \nagain.''\n  This is about more than textiles and textile jobs. It involves the \neconomic strength of the Nation. It involves its political strength. \nThe middle class is disappearing fast. We talk about the digital \ndivide. I want to comment on the disappearance of the middle class \nitself.\n  Let me go right to textiles.\n  I was a witness some 40 years ago relative to the textile industry. \nIn that particular time period, 10 percent of America's consumption in \ntextiles was going to be represented in imports. That was a threat not \nonly to industry itself but to the Nation.\n  Specifically, I testified before the International Trade Commission. \nAt the time, President Eisenhower was in office. We went by to see \nGeneral Persons, his Chief of Staff. He said: Don't worry, you will win \nthe case. But in June we got an adverse decision.\n  At that time, with that adverse decision, I went to our friend, \nSenator John F. Kennedy, a candidate for the Presidency of the United \nStates, and discussed at length the particular problem. We agreed on an \nexchange of letters, so to speak, with me outlining the problem, and in \nturn Senator Kennedy outlining what he thought would be a solution.\n  We all know then, that Kennedy was elected President. Early in 1961, \nwe had a conference at the White House. He said: In line with what I \noutlined to you in the campaign, I want it to come under the national \nsecurity provisions of our trade laws.\n  So, hark, ye, all who talk and lament that we haven't passed a trade \nbill in 6 years. It is a good thing we did not pass one, because what \nwe really need to do is get competitive and stop treating foreign trade \nas foreign aid. This is not a Finance Committee. This is a Foreign \nRelations Committee. It is a giving away the manufacturing backbone of \nthe United States of America.\n  Under that national security provision to protect the textile and \napparel industry, you had to have a hearing and a determination that \nthe particular commodity, or article, or product was important to our \nnational security.\n  I will never forget it. We set up the hearing with Secretary Ball--he \nwas the undersecretary for Dean Rusk at State--Secretary Goldberg of \nLabor, Secretary Freeman of Agriculture, Secretary Hodges of Commerce. \nA few people remember that Senator Kennedy had a bipartisan Cabinet \nwith a Republican Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Dillon, and a \nRepublican Secretary of Defense, Mr. McNamara.\n  We had those five. We brought the witnesses. They made the finding \nthat, next to steel, textiles were second most important to our \nnational security. I remember the particular ``wag'' at that time, \nthat, look, you couldn't send them to war in a Japanese uniform. So we \nhad to be able to make the clothing and the uniforms.\n\n[[Page S3808]]\n\n  As a result, President Kennedy on May 13, 1961, promulgated his \nSeven-Point Program relative to the importation of textiles.\n  Mind you me: We feared at the time that 10 percent of America's \nconsumption in textile products was being imported or just about to be \nimported.\n  As I look at the Chamber now, two-thirds of the clothing I am looking \nat is imported--not 10 percent. With this particular conference report, \nthere isn't any question that certain parts of the textile industry \nwill immediately disappear, and the rest of it in a 4- or 5-year period \nwill be on the ropes.\n  You say: Why, oh, why, Senator from South Carolina, are you \nobjecting? Because the American Textile Manufacturers Institute is in \nfavor of the conference report\n  That selfish crowd. I call them selfish in a studied way. I authored \nfive textile bills that have gotten through this Senate. I had four of \nthose textile bills go through the House and the Senate, and four of \nthem were vetoed. I know from whence this particular Senator got the \nvotes for these bills. Yes. It was the apparel group in America, the \nones who make the clothing.\n  The little ditty is: We produce for America. We have the fine middle-\nclass jobs, and we are working around the clock. And, yes, we are the \nmost productive textile workers in the world.\n  The industry itself has invested some $2 million a year over the past \n15 years, keeping up with modernization, with the best of machinery, \nthe best of approaches in employment.\n  I have made many a sneak through and they don't want to let a \nDemocrat in the plant. But I would sneak in on one floor and duck down \ninto the plant on the bottom floor. It is totally automated in the \nweave room with the looms, spinning away. They used to have 115 \nemployees, and now have only 15. They have cut back on the employees \nand put in the most modern machinery. The worker, the machinery, and \nthe industry is the most productive. It is not a question of \nproductivity. We don't have to get globalization and competition so we \ncan make them productive. The politicians run around on the floor of \nthe Senate and some of them have never worked for a living. They don't \nknow what productivity is.\n  We have quite an opposition. Let me say a word about that. When we \nfirst started out, we only had, say, the Japanese Government, with \ntheir representatives coming in to talk. But soon after, Chase \nManhattan and Citicorp made a majority of their money outside of the \nUnited States.\n  So, in addition to Koreans and Japanese, now we have the \ninternational banks. Along with the international banks came the \ninternational groups funding campus studies with contributions and they \nbegan to get the expert studies off the campuses with the consultants. \nSo we had the banks, the universities, the consultants, and the foreign \noperation. Then, of course, we had the retailers. They wanted to sell a \ncheap product. So we had the National Retail Federation. They are the \nbiggest supporters of the print media in America, the newspapers. They \nmake their money off of retail advertising. So we have these \neditorialists, who never bit into customs or the trade practices, \nwriting about free trade, free trade, free trade.\n  So we have the retailers. Then go to the book ``Agents of \nAffluence,'' published about 10 years ago. At that time, Japan was \npaying $113 million for over 100 representatives in Washington, DC, to \nlook out for their industry, their game of market share.\n  This bill is all backed up. The white tent is out. We saw it in \nNAFTA. Only they are afraid to bring the tent down. They are meeting in \nthe White House itself. They are all getting together and running \naround with the former Presidents, the former Secretaries of State. The \nformer chairman of the Finance Committee, the distinguished ranking \nmember, Senator Moynihan of New York said: When a freshman at City \nCollege of New York, I heard that corporations ran America. He was \ntelling corporate America to get out and get the vote.\n  We had that crowd and we have my ATMI, which is my point. They don't \nknow from ``sic 'em'' about competition. They know extremely well how \nwe got the votes from Evelyn Dubrow and the apparel workers of America. \nThat's how we passed those bills. The cloth manufacturers have divorced \nthemselves from the apparel manufacturers and said: Fend for yourself. \nWe've got a better offer and we are going to start free trade. It \ndoesn't make any difference so long as we can get fabric forward. If we \ncan get the cloth, we can sell it to them in Africa, in the Caribbean \nor in Mexico. We will let any trade bill go so long as we can sell. But \nfend for yourself. You are out of business.\n  Let me tell you how many jobs we have now that are bound to be gone \nbecause the States will be inundated. Alabama has presently 26,500 \napparel jobs. Goodbye, Alabama. I want to see those Senators come here \nnow.\n  California, 146,900 textile, middle-class American jobs, earning $8 \nand sometimes $10 or more an hour. Middle class--I want to emphasize \nthat. Henry Ford said he wanted to make sure the person manufacturing \nhis product was capable of buying it. So he put in the wage scale which \nallowed that and he started developing a strong middle class.\n  Florida, let's see the Florida Senators come here and say: Free \ntrade, free trade. Forget about the 19,700 apparel jobs. They are gone. \nWhy?\n\n  Because of us, because of us as Senators and Members of Congress, \nsetting the standard of living for industrial America. We say before \nyou can open up that ABC Manufacturing Company, that what you need do, \nfirst, is have a minimum wage, then Social Security, then Medicare, \nthen Medicaid, then plant closing notice, then parental leave, then \nclean air, then clean water, then safe working machinery, then a safe \nworking place--or we sent OSHA after you. Republicans and Democrats all \nagree, before you open the front door, you better have all of that in \nthe plant or you are in violation of Federal law. You are out of step \nwith the standard of American living.\n  But if you can take off and get your T-shirts made in Bangladesh, you \nhave none of those requirements, and pay one cent an hour. In Burma, it \nis 4 cents an hour. In China, it is 23 cents an hour. In the country of \nColombia, it is 70 to 80 cents an hour. In the Dominican Republic, it \nis 60 cents an hour. In El Salvador, it is 59 cents an hour. In \nGuatemala, it is 37 to 50 cents an hour. In Haiti, it is 30 cents an \nhour. In Honduras, 43 cents an hour. In India, 20 to 30 cents an hour. \nIn Indonesia, 10 cents an hour. Malaysia, $1 an hour. Mexico, 50 to 54 \ncents an hour. Nicaragua, 23 cents an hour. Pakistan, 20 to 26 cents an \nhour. Peru, 90 cents an hour. The Philippines, 58 to 76 cents an hour. \nRomania, 24 cents an hour. Sri Lanka, 40 cents an hour. Thailand, 78 \ncents an hour.\n  As you well know, 30 percent in manufacturing is your labor cost, and \nyou can save as much as 20 percent by transferring your production \noffshore to a low-wage country. That is, maintain your executive \noffice, maintain your sales force, but with a company of $500 million \nin sales, transfer the production to Mexico or a low-wage country \noffshore and you can make $100 million before taxes. Or you can \ncontinue to work your own people and go broke. That is the trade policy \nof this wonderful Finance Committee that runs all over the floor, \nbleating and wailing and wondering: Oh, what are we doing for Africa? \nIsn't this a grand thing we have for the Caribbean and everything else, \nwith no regard to the reality.\n  They taught us early on, at the beginning of the war in artillery, no \nmatter how well the gun is aimed, if the recoil is going to kill the \nguncrew, you do not fire. The aim is good.\n  I would like to put in a Marshall Plan for Mexico. It is a fine \nbusiness. Let's help the Caribbean, let's help Africa, let's help \nanybody. There is hunger in the world so let's find it and help with \nit. But this crowd, wow, they are not going to pay for anything--\nnothing. They are not going to have any regard from whence they came \nand the strength of America itself.\n  Two-thirds of the garments already coming in are imported. In \nGeorgia, there are 26,100 apparel workers; Kentucky, 18,900; Maine, \n2,600; Massachusetts, 10,400; Mississippi--the distinguished majority \nleader said it is a wonderful thing. I want him to go back and tell \nthese 16,600 apparel workers it is the last call for breakfast.\n  In my beginning days, they used to have that early morning program, \nthe\n\n[[Page S3809]]\n\n``Breakfast Club,'' in Chicago, the Stevens Hotel, with Don McNeil. \nThey would get to the very end and they would say: ``It is the last \ncall for breakfast.'' I can hear the music now. This is the last call \nfor Texas, certainly the last call for the apparel workers, because \nthey are gone. Goodbye Mississippi, 16,600 will be applying for \nunemployment compensation or going--where? I will tell you where they \nare going. I think we had a list from the Department of Commerce of \nthese great jobs. I will tell you where they are.\n  You say: Wait a minute, Senator. How about that employment rate? We \nhave such low unemployment.\n  Here is where they are going: cashiers, janitors, cleaners, retail \nsalespeople, waiters and waitresses, registered nurses, systems \nanalysts, home health aides, security guards, nursing aides, anything \nthey can get that they can possibly do--for less pay, obviously. In \nfact, the retail workers, they found out you can hire them as \nindependent contractors and you don't even have to pay for their health \ncare. They have every gimmick in the book to squeeze that middle class \nhere in the United States and bring them down to nothing.\n  So it goes, for New York, the Senators from New York, I want to \ninform them, advisedly, there are 74,700. There is no one I respect \nmore, of course, than the senior Senator from New York and the senior \nHouse Member, my friend, Charlie Rangel. But if I had Charlie here I \nwould say: Charlie, 74,700: Going, going--gone. This vote is fixed. \nThat is why we have this exercise here.\n  They talk about the most deliberative body. They do not call a thing \nuntil it is greased; the jury is fixed. Then, after you have gotten the \nvote of the jury, then you let them talk because it is all over.\n  North Carolina, 38,300; Pennsylvania, 34,900; South Carolina, 18,500; \nTennessee, 23,500; Virginia, 12,900--those are the apparel jobs that \nare going, going, gone once we get this conference report voted on by \ntomorrow, I take it. It will go to the President. They will all stand \naround with big smiles in the Oval Office: Look what we have done. We \nunderstand humankind. We want to help sub-Sahara. We want to help the \nCaribbean.\n  Let me get right to the point with respect to the apparel versus the \ncloth manufacturers. As you well know, the manufacture of the fabric \nitself is capital intensive, so that is why they have not caught up \nwith them yet. But now they are beginning to build those facilities \ndown in Mexico. So, as I said a minute ago, it will be about 5 years \nand then they will have their own fabric manufacturers down there \nshipping into the American market. Otherwise, all that fine Japanese \nmachinery that we have in American plants, all of a sudden the price is \ngoing to go up. They know how to compete. Our trade policy is anything \nbut reciprocal.\n\n  Cordell Hull said ``reciprocal free trade.'' My friend, the \ndistinguished Senator from New York, gets with Smoot-Hawley and Cordell \nHull and how we started the reciprocal trade agreements in the 1930s, \nand we have been for freedom.\n  Not so at all. No. The very Congress that passed the reciprocal free \ntrade, historically they put in subsidies for agriculture in Montana--\nyes. Subsidies for agriculture in Montana, and protective quotas. Do \nnot give me free trade for agriculture, you will not get my vote. No, \nsir, I am not for free trade for agriculture because our protections, \nour subsidies have made America's agriculture the showcase of the \nworld. We feed ourselves and 15 other countries.\n  But wait until the China bill. I can't wait for that one to come. \nThey are trying to sell the farmers a bill of goods. There are \n3,338,000--go look at the record at the Department of Agriculture. \nThere are 3,338,000 farmers in America. In China, they have 700 to 800 \nmillion farmers. They talk about the percentage of arable land. Do not \nbe getting along with that percentage of arable land and everything \nelse. We already have a deficit in the balance of trade in cotton with \nChina. In wheat and cereals and corn and other feedgrains, we had a \nplus balance 4 years ago, with the country of China, of 440 million. It \nis down last year to 39 million. You watch them, in 2 years they will \nhave a plus balance. They will be shipping us wheat. But you are going \nto hear these farmers out on the floor bleating--whoa, we have China \nfree trade for America's agriculture.\n  So with the wrong facts they have to go to the Department of \nAgriculture and go to the People's Republic of China and see exactly \nwhat they are doing. Actually, they have a glut in the People's \nRepublic of China in agriculture. They do not have the transportation. \nThey do not have the distribution. They do have hunger. But mind you \nme, when they solve that transportation and distribution problem, then \nthey will be feeding the world like we have been bragging. And the \nfarmers will be coming up here again.\n  Like that Freedom to Farm, we gave them that sort of freedom to farm. \nThey came up and got, I think it was, $7 or $8 billion last year. They \nare looking for another $6 billion here. You know that is the crowd \nthat looks to me, the textile Senator, saying: Free trade, free trade, \nfree trade, the whole time they are drooling at those subsidies, those \nprotective quotas, you know; looking at me like something is wrong, \nthat I do not understand how to be nice in this world globalization.\n  So here we go. Since NAFTA alone, we have lost, in the United States, \n440,000 textile and apparel jobs--440,000.\n  I know in South Carolina we have lost 37,000 textile and apparel jobs \nsince NAFTA. This is from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Remember, we \nwere going to create 200,000 jobs with NAFTA. Oh, we were going to do \neverything. We were going to solve the drug problem. We were going to \nsolve the immigration problem. We were going to create jobs. And we \nhave gone from a $5 billion-plus balance of trade with Mexico to $23 \nbillion minus, a deficit in the balance of trade. The average Mexican \nworker has less take-home pay today than prior to NAFTA. It has not \nhelped anybody, but they are talking now about NAFTA for Africa and \nNAFTA for the Caribbean.\n  I could get into that at length with respect to the disparity in \ntariffs, with respect to our own quotas. They are being phased out by \n2004.\n  Let me go to the main thrust of my point this afternoon, and that is \nthe importance of these middle-class jobs to the economy. I will never \nforget a seminar in Chicago in the early eighties with Akio Morita, the \nchairman of the board of Sony. He was lecturing about Third World \ncountries, emerging countries. He said the Third World countries had to \ndevelop a strong manufacturing sector in order to become a nation \nstate. Then, pointing to me, he said: And, by the way, Senator, the \nworld power that loses its manufacturing capacity will cease to be a \nworld power.\n  Was Morita making some original observation? Not at all. Alexander \nHamilton made the same observation to the British in the early days of \n1789. The British corresponded with the fledgling Colonies and said: \nNow that you won your freedom, you trade with us what you produce best, \nand we will trade back what we produce best--David Ricardo, the \nDoctrine of Comparative Advantage.\n  Mr. Alexander Hamilton wrote a booklet. It is at the Library of \nCongress, if someone on the Finance Committee wants to read it. In a \nword, Hamilton told the British: Bug off; we are not going to remain \nyour colony; we are not going to export to you our agriculture, our \nfoodstuffs, our cotton, grain, indigo, our timber and iron ore and \nimport from the mother country the finished product; we are going to \ndevelop our own manufacture.\n  The second bill that ever passed with respect to the National \nCongress, in which I am privileged to serve, the second bill--the first \nbill was the Seal of the United States--the second bill, on July 4, \n1789, was a tariff bill of 50 percent on 60 different articles. We \nstarted this economic giant, the United States of America, with \nprotectionism.\n  Abraham Lincoln followed it in the building of the transcontinental \nrailroad. They said: Mr. President, we can get the steel from England. \nHe said: Not at all. We will build our own steel plants, and when we \nare through, we will not only have the railroad, we will have the steel \ncapacity.\n  Roosevelt, in the darkest days of the Depression, passed import \nquotas on the subsidies for America's agriculture.\n  Dwight Eisenhower in 1955 put quotas on oil.\n  We have practiced, more or less, a protected trade policy--we have \nmany\n\n[[Page S3810]]\n\ntariffs on many things still--while we have bleated: Free trade, free \ntrade, free trade, and joined the chorus: I like fair trade; I like a \nlevel playing field.\n  Do not give me a level playing field. I want to trade to my advantage \nand my interests. Business is business, and the game is market share. \nThe Japanese have set the tone, the practice, and the policy in the \nPacific rim, and the Europeans are following.\n  Let's talk China. There is not a deficit in the balance of European \ncountries. The European countries have a plus balance of trade with \nChina. What do we have with this ``free trade, free trade''? We have \n$68 billion deficit and growing. That is not the most recent figure, \nbut $68 billion is the most authoritative figure I can give right now, \nand it is getting worse every day. They know how to trade and how to \nadminister. We actually export about the same to Belgium and Singapore \nthan we do to the 1,300,000,000 Chinese in the People's Republic of \nChina.\n\n  Talk about exports, exports, exports, and the wonderful agreements--\nwe will have plenty of time to get into those agreements. They want to \ncontinue that so we will not have even a touch of sobriety. Give us one \nchance at bat to sober America up because America is becoming very \nanxious and very concerned.\n  The Nation's strength of security is like a three-legged stool: We \nhave the one leg, the values of the Nation, and that is unquestioned. \nThe people the world around admire the United States of America. We \nhave stood for years on end for individual rights, human rights, and \ndemocracy. I can talk on that because I am so proud of this country.\n  The second leg is the military, which is also unquestioned.\n  The third leg is the economic leg that has been fractured in the last \n50 years and needs refurbishing, strengthening, and rebuilding. I say \nfractured, I emphasize intentionally fractured.\n  I heard the distinguished Senator from Iowa say, since 1945, look at \nthe commerce, the commerce, the commerce. We were just like England in \n1789. We had the only industry, the only production. In 1945, Europe \nwas devastated and the Pacific rim was devastated. We were looking for \ncustomers. We were looking for buyers. We had production. Yes, we said \nfree trade, free trade. Concurrent with that, we instituted the \nMarshall Plan and sent the money. We instituted along with that plan \nthe machinery and the expertise. We sent it overseas in the contest \nbetween capitalism and communism, and it has worked. After 50 years, we \ncan stand proudly and say it has worked. Capitalism has defeated \ncommunism. We are all proud of that and the sacrifice that went along \nwith it, because in those days of 1945 we were willing to sacrifice. \nToday, we are not willing to sacrifice to save America itself--the \nmiddle class and the economic strength of our society.\n  What happens is we have been engaged in this for some time and, as a \nresult, we have treated foreign trade as foreign aid. I think of Akio \nMorita and losing manufacturing capacity. In 1945, we had 41 percent of \nthe workers in the United States engaged in manufacturing. In the year \n2000, we are down to 14 percent.\n  In the nineties, in the United States, we have lost some 779,000 \nmanufacturing jobs and in South Carolina, my State alone, some 40,500. \nThe industrial strength is fast diminishing.\n  I look at the different things about textiles, but I look also at the \nratios of imports to consumption and what we are going to manufacture \nfor ourselves. Let's see.\n  As a young Governor, they looked at me at that hearing I told you \nabout, at the very beginning, and said: Governor, what do you expect \nthem to make? Let them make the shoes. Let them make the clothing. And \nwe will make the airplanes and the computers.\n  My problem today is, they are making the shoes, they are making the \nclothing, and they are making the airplanes and the computers. And so \nit is.\n  Certain industrial thermal-processing equipment, 48.9 percent--almost \nhalf of what we consume is imported--67 percent of textile machinery \nand parts used in the United States we have to get from abroad; 55.3 \npercent of the machine tools for metal forming and parts; 51.9 percent \nof semiconductor manufacturing equipment and robotics--we import it.\n  I remember one good thing President Reagan did was to put in \nSEMATECH. He saved Intel microprocessing. Everybody is running around \nhere falling over each other after that Silicon Valley money: high \ntech, high tech. We have somebody here from high tech. Bill Gates walks \naround convicted of violating the Sherman antitrust law but you would \nthink he is a visiting potentate. All the little staffers and Senators \nstreaming behind him as he goes through the Halls. And then I go to \nanother policy meeting, and they announce we have another \nmicroprocessing, high tech, Silicon Valley.\n  Let's get right to the point. Microsoft has 20,000 employees in \nSeattle and Boeing of Seattle has approximately 75,000. They are in the \nmanufacturing. General Motors has 250,000. Mind you me, they are not \nsatisfied in high tech. They want to do away with the income tax, the \ncapital gains tax, the estate tax. They want to do away with 200 years \nof State tort law--Y2K. They want to do away with the immigration laws \nbecause--why?--they can import the Indians and the Filipinos in here \nnext to nothing.\n  Generally speaking, America Online has a service center now in the \nPhilippines. Call them and ask them. My light bill in South Carolina is \nrun through India. But high tech, high tech--they are all in a heat to \nsee. Who is fooling whom. They are after the money. High tech is after \nthe exemptions. They do not want to pay their wage. So there you go.\n  Right to the point, why do you think that the march in Seattle--I am \nnot talking about the crazies who came up there from Eugene, OR, and \nbroke up the town; I am talking about the march in Seattle in December; \nthe AFL-CIO, the responsible individuals--that march was led by Boeing \nmachinists. Why? Read Bill Greider's book ``One World, Ready or Not'' \nand you will see that much of that Boeing 777, before it can be sold in \ndowntown Shanghai, has to be made in downtown Shanghai. So they are \ntaking the airplane jobs there.\n  Or pick up the morning paper and you will see the automobile jobs in \nChina that are being taken from us. All the time I have to hear that \nnauseating chant: free trade, free trade. Yes, I am for free trade. All \nthe interviewers. GE owns NBC. The president of GE, Jack Welch, told \neverybody to go down to Mexico: All you suppliers, you aren't going to \nbe a GE supplier because I can get it cheaper. I will show you that \narticle in ``Business Week.''\n  Let's go right down to boilers and turbines; 44.4 percent of what we \nconsume has to be imported; electrical transformers, 43.2 percent; \naircraft engines and gas turbines, 70.3 percent; motorcycles, 48.5 \npercent; aircraft, 45.7 percent--we used to have 100 percent of that \nbusiness--office machines, 47.2 percent; microphones, loud speakers, \naudio amplifiers, and combinations thereof, 77.9 percent; tape \nrecorders, tape players, video cassette recorders, turntables, compact \ndisc players, 100 percent; radio transmission and reception, 57.9 \npercent of what we consume--used to be made by middle-class America; no \nlonger--television apparatus, including cameras, camcorders, and cable \napparatus, 68.5 percent.\n\n  I remember when Zenith had their case, and their competitors had been \nfound in violation for dumping. And the International Trade Commission \nin a unique decision held for Zenith--because they usually cancel out \nthe trade administration--but the trade commission exacted the penalty. \nAnd the last stop, of course, was in the White House, in the Oval \nOffice, where the President had the authority to cancel it out.\n  The Cabinet all around the table, they all voted to enforce the \ndecision of the International Trade Commission. And in walked President \nReagan. He said: I just talked to Nakosone and we are not going to do \nthat.\n  You see, yes, it has been wonderful. It has been fine. It has worked. \nWe have peace in the world--whatever--and we have a booming economy. \nBut in a booming economy, you have to look at the consummate, the \nconcurrent effect here.\n  Electrical capacitors and resistors, 69.5 percent; automatic data \nprocessing machines, 51.6 percent.\n\n[[Page S3811]]\n\n  I read this because colleagues in the Senate say: There he goes again \non textiles. I have given up on textiles. I resign. I quit. When the \nATMI tackles me from behind, and they leave out the people who have \nbeen getting the votes--the polls all taken--poor old Jay Mazur, poor \nEvy Dubrow, and the rest of them--and unit, and the others who have \nbeen working together--Seth Bodner, the knitwear folks, the apparel \nfolks--I just have to say it is gone. This bill is passed.\n  But while it passes, we have to have a stop, look, and listen at the \ncrossing and realize that 62.2 percent of clocks and timing devices \nthat we use in America are now imported; watches, 100 percent--\napparently we do not manufacture them anymore--drawing and mathematical \ncalculating and measuring instruments, 71.4 percent; luggage, handbags, \nand flat goods, 79.7 percent; musical instruments and accessories, 57.2 \npercent; umbrellas, whips, riding crops, and canes, 81.1 percent; \nsilverware, 59.9 percent.

Mr. President, this is one little reading of the U.S. \ndeficits in advanced technology because you know we have gone, they \nsay, from manufacturing to high tech.\n  They told England at the end of World War II: Don't worry. Instead, \nof a nation of brawn, you are going to be a nation of brains. Instead \nof producing products, you will provide services. Service economy, \nservice economy is the chant. And then, instead of creating wealth, you \nare going to handle it and be a financial center.\n  England has gone into an economic hand basket. They have a bunch of \njust scandal sheets--the newspapers and Parliamentarians--debating and \nshouting at each other. Downtown London is an amusement park.\n  Are we going that way, too? They have gone out of business there.\n  Here are some deficits in advanced technology products. Parts of the \nadvanced machinery incorporated, $18.23 billion; hard disc drive units, \n$9.72 billion; parts of turbojet or turbo propeller engines, $4.28 \nbillion, Turbojet aircraft engines, $3.74 billion deficit, balance of \ntrade; parts for printers, $3.52 billion; new turbo fan planes, non-\nmilitary, $3.23 billion; cellular radio telephones, $3 billion; video \ncassette and cartridge recorders, $3.32 billion, deficit; display \nunits, $1.64 billion; optical disc players, $1.64 billion; camcorders, \n$1.09 billion; digital still-image video cameras, $1.07 billion.\n\n  Mr. President, rather than taking further time, I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record at this point the U.S. Trade in \nAdvanced Technology Products showing the exports and imports and the \nbalance thereof.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S3812]]\n\n\n\n                                U.S. TRADE IN ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS: 1999\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Commodity code and description: Advanced\n                technology product                       Exports              Imports              Balance\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n8473301000  PRTS OF ADP MCH, NOT INCRPRTNG CRT,                      0       18,227,808,970     (18,227,808,970)\n PRT CRCT ASSEM..................................\n8471704065  HARD DISK DRIVE UNT, NESOI, W/OUT            2,048,470,249       11,769,756,784      (9,721,286,535)\n EXTNL POWR SUPLY................................\n8473305000  PTS & ACCESSORIES OF MACH OF HEADING                     0        7,743,829,608      (7,743,829,608)\n OF 8471, NESOI..................................\n8542138034  MONO IC, DIGITAL, MOS TRANS, DRAM,                       0        4,980,391,722      (4,980,391,722)\n >15000000 BITS..................................\n8542138072  MONOLITHIC IC, DIGITAL, SILICON,             4,047,156,775        8,377,018,602      (4,329,861,827)\n (MOS), (ASIC), (PLA)............................\n8411919080  PARTS OF TURBOJET OR TURBOPROPELLER A/                   0        4,277,502,862      (4,277,502,862)\n C ENGINES.......................................\n8471300000  PORT DGTL ADP MACH, 4536 & 15000 KG................................\n2934903000  OTHER HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUNDS USED AS                     0        3,029,957,678      (3,029,957,678)\n DRUGS...........................................\n8525209070  CELLULAR RADIOTELEPHONES FOR PCRS, 1                     0        3,020,465,433      (3,020,465,433)\n KG AND UNDER....................................\n3004909090  MEDICAMENTS NOT ELSEWHERE SPECIFIED                      0        2,726,075,442      (2,726,075,442)\n OR INCLUDED.....................................\n8471706000  STORAGE UNITS, NESOI, NOT ASSEMBLED            511,587,342        3,211,010,776      (2,699,423,434)\n IN CABINETS.....................................\n8521106000  VIDEO CASSETTE & CARTRIDGE RECORDER/                     0        2,321,010,825      (2,321,010,825)\n PLAYERS, COLOR..................................\n8517903800  PC ASSEMBLIES FOR TELEPHONIC                             0        1,728,565,731      (1,728,565,731)\n APPARATUS, NESOI................................\n8471604580  DISPLAY UNITS, NESOI, WITHOUT CRT....                    0        1,637,784,048      (1,637,784,048)\n8519990045  OPTICAL DISC (INCLUDING COMPACT DISC)                    0        1,637,445,266      (1,637,445,266)\n PLAYERS.........................................\n8542138057  MONO IC, DIG, SIL, MOS, EXC VOL,                         0        1,591,589,716      (1,591,589,716)\n (EEPROM) >900,000 BITS..........................\n8542138066  MONO IC, DIG, SIL, MOS (ASIC) & (PLA)          266,700,462        1,505,423,883      (1,238,723,421)\n MICROPROCES 8 BITS & 3,000,000 BITS.................................\n8542300065  MONOLITHIC IC, OPERATING FREQUENCY           1,284,391,376        2,181,812,559        (897,421,183)\n , FREQ. 400 MHZ........................................\n8534000020  PRINTED CIRCUITS OF PLASTIC/GLASS = 3          586,324,029          980,378,544        (394,054,515)\n LAYERS, CNDT....................................\n8542138041  MONO IC, DIG, SIL, MOS, VOL (SRAM)                       0          369,673,484        (369,673,484)\n 300,000 \n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/10/senate-section/article/S3822-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3822-S3823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO NAVY CAPTAIN GEORGE STREET\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute \nto an outstanding officer of the U.S. Navy.\n  Captain George Street, a World War II submarine war hero and Medal of \nHonor winner, proudly served our country in the United States Navy for \nover 39 years. Sadly, he passed away on February 28, in Andover, \nMassachusetts, his home for many years after his retirement from the \nNavy in 1966.\n  Captain Street was a native of Richmond, Virginia, and a 1937 \ngraduate of the United States Naval Academy. He served on two naval \nsurface combat ships, the USS Concord and the USS Arkansas, before \nreporting to submarine school. His first submarine assignment was in \nthe USS Gar where he made nine wartime patrols in the Pacific. On his \nvery first patrol, as the submarine's Torpedo Data Computer Operator, \nhis leadership and courage earned him the Silver Star for actions in \nwhich the Gar sank over 10,000 tons of enemy shipping.\n  On a subsequent patrol, he earned a second Silver Star as the Gar's \nAssistant Approach Officer. Operating in Japanese-controlled waters, he \nplayed a vital role in sinking three enemy ships, and was also \ninstrumental in enabling the Gar to evade a barrage of enemy \ncountermeasures and return safely to port. Captain Street continued to \nbuild upon his brilliant service as the war went on.\n  In November 1944, he took command of the USS Tirante and on March 3, \n1945, he led the submarine out of Pearl Harbor on her first war patrol. \nWithin a month, Captain Street and the crew of the Tirante sank three \nenemy ships off the shores of Japan and survived a seven-hour \ncounterattack by Japanese ships. Captain Street continued his patrol in \nthe East China Sea, near Japan's southern coast, wreaking havoc on \nJapanese shipping.\n  On April 14, 1945, the Tirante began a major battle that would earn \nthe crew a Presidential Unit Citation and result in President Harry S. \nTruman awarding Captain Street the Congressional Medal of Honor. \nReceiving intelligence that a major Japanese transport ship and escort \nvessels had anchored in a harbor on Quelpart Island off the coast of \nKorea, Captain Street took the fight to the enemy. He surfaced the \nTirante and manned his gun crews since the Tirante would have to fight \nher way out on the surface if attacked. He maneuvered to penetrate the \nmined, shoal-obstructed, and radar-protected harbor. He evaded enemy \npatrols and, once in the inner harbor, fired two torpedoes into a large \nJapanese ammunition ship, completely destroying it. The resultant \nexplosion revealed the Tirante's position to the enemy. In the light of \nthe burning ammunition ship, two Japanese Mikura class frigates spotted \nthe Tirante and attacked. Quickly bringing his submarine to bear on the \nleading frigate, Captain Street counterattacked with a torpedo, and \nthen swung his boat around and fired his last torpedo at the other \nfrigate. Clearing the harbor at emergency full-speed-ahead, he slipped \nundetected along the shoreline and safely evaded a depth charge attack \nby a pursuing patrol. The ammunition ship and both frigates had been \nsunk.\n  Captain Street was awarded the Navy Cross for another bold action two \nmonths later. On June 11, 1945, the Tirante sank several hostile \nfreighters and other vessels, then moved through treacherous shallow \nwaters into the heart of Nagasaki Harbor, where he sank another \nJapanese ship and destroyed docking facilities vital to the\n\n[[Page S3823]]\n\nenemy. The Tirante surfaced and escaped from the harbor under hostile \ngunfire from ship and shore batteries.\n  After World War II, Captain Street continued to serve with \ndistinction as the commanding officer of three naval surface ships, as \na submarine division commander, and as the commander of a submarine \ngroup. On his retirement in 1966, he became an active member of \nnumerous local, state, and national veterans organizations and was a \npopular speaker at patriotic and community functions in Massachusetts \nand New England. Captain Street often helped veterans and veterans \norganizations, and had a strong interest in talking with and inspiring \nschool children.\n  Captain Street's dedication and service to his country and community \nwere extraordinary. I am grateful, as I know the entire nation is, for \nhis lifetime of outstanding service. He was a great American hero, role \nmodel, and citizen. He will be missed, but his memory and example will \nlive forever.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Daschle and Mr. Kennedy pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 2541 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/10/senate-section/article/S3823-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ELIMINATION OF COST-OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENTS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have just witnessed this week another \nexample of indifference by Congress to the needs of lower-wage and \nhard-working American workers. While our minimum wage bill still \nlanguishes in the Congress in spite of all our efforts, the House \nAppropriations Committee just passed a bill that will eliminate the \ncost-of-living adjustments for the low-wage workers in the legislative \nbranch. They cut the COLAs of the Library of Congress, the Government \nPrinting Office, and other vital congressional agencies. This is after \nthe Members of Congress got a cost-of-living increase of $4,600 last \nyear.\n  The Republican leadership has cut out a COLA increase for these \nworkers who happen to be the lowest-paid Congressional workers. If you \nare a truck driver for the Government Printing Office, you are out of \nluck. Again, when it comes to the staffs of the Members, they made sure \ntheir interests were protected. Drawing that kind of a line with \nworkers who work for this institution is absolutely scandalous.\n  What is it about our Republican friends that they believe they have \nto be so harsh with the lowest-income working families in this country, \nrefusing to permit us to vote on a pay increase, an increase in the \nminimum wage, of 50 cents this year and 50 cents next year? They have \ntaken convoluted parliamentary tricks to block us from considering \nthat, and then we find their own priorities are that this institution \ntakes $4,600 for its COLA increase and cuts out the COLA increase for \nthe lowest-paid workers who are serving the Congress. That is wrong. I \nhope the House of Representatives will change it. I hope it will not be \ntolerated.\n  There will be an effort on the Senate floor to make amends because \nthat is wrong and unjust. We are not going to permit it to stand.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/10/senate-section/article/S3823-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3823-S3827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2000--CONFERENCE REPORT--Continued\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to take time to share some \nexcerpts taken from the National Intelligence Estimate 99-17D of \nJanuary 2000, which frames infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, as a \nnational security threat to the United States.\n  This is, obviously, pursuant to the discussion we have been having \nmost of the day with regard to the inadequacy of the African Growth and \nOpportunity Act with regard to the provisions concerning HIV/AIDS in \nAfrica and, in particular, the very serious error of the conference \ncommittee in eliminating the Feinstein-Feingold amendment concerning \nHIV/AIDS.\n       This report represents an important initiative on the part \n     of the Intelligence Community to consider the national \n     security dimension of a nontraditional threat. It responds to \n     a growing concern by senior US leaders about the \n     implications--in terms of health, economics, and national \n     security--of the growing global infectious disease threat. \n     The dramatic increase in drug-resistant microbes, combined \n     with the lag in development of new antibiotics, the rise of \n     megacities with severe health care deficiencies, \n     environmental degradation, and the growing ease and frequency \n     of cross-border movements of people and produce have greatly \n     facilitated the spread of infectious diseases.\n       As part of this new US Government effort, the National \n     Intelligence Council produced this national intelligence \n     estimate. It examines the most lethal diseases globally and \n     by region; develops alternative scenarios about their future \n     course; examines national and international capacities to \n     deal with them; and assesses their national global social, \n     economic, political, and security impact.\n       Of the seven biggest killers worldwide, TB, malaria, \n     hepatitis, and, in particular, HIV/AIDS continue to surge, \n     with HIV/AIDS and TB likely to account for the overwhelming \n     majority of deaths from infectious diseases in developing \n     countries by 2020.\n       Sub-Saharan Africa-accounting for nearly half of infectious \n     disease deaths globally--will remain the most vulnerable \n     region. The death rates for many diseases, including HIV/AIDS \n     and malaria, exceed those in all other regions. Sub-Saharan \n     Africa's health care capacity--the poorest in the world--will \n     continue to lag.\n       The most likely scenario, in our view, is one in which the \n     infectious disease threat--particularly from HIV/AIDS--\n     worsens during the first half of our time frame, but \n     decreases fitfully after that, owing to better prevention and \n     control efforts, new drugs and vaccines, and socioeconomics \n     improvements. In the next decade, under this scenario, \n     negative demographic and social conditions in developing \n     countries, such as continued urbanization and poor health \n     care capacity, remain conducive to the spread of infectious \n     diseases; persistent poverty sustains the least developed \n     countries as reservoirs of infection; and microbial \n     resistance continues to increase faster than the pace of new \n     drug and vaccine development. During the subsequent decade, \n     more positive demographic changes such as reduced fertility \n     and aging populations; gradual socioeconomic improvement in \n     most countries; medical advances against childhood and \n     vaccine-preventable killers such as diarrheal diseases, \n     neonatal tetanus, and measles; expanded international \n     surveillance and response systems; and improvements in \n     national health care capacities take hold in all but the \n     least developed countries.\n       Barring the appearance of a deadly and highly infectious \n     new disease, a catastrophic upward lurch by HIV/AIDS, or the \n     release of a highly contagious biological agent capable of \n     rapid and widescale secondary spread, these developments \n     produce at least limited gains against the overall infectious \n     disease threat. However, the remaining group of virulent \n     diseases, led by HIV/AIDS and TB, continue to take a \n     significant toll. The persistent infectious disease burden is \n     likely to aggravate and, in some cases, may even provoke \n     economic decay, social fragmentation, and political \n     destabilization in the hardest hit countries in the \n     developing and former communist worlds.\n       The economic costs of infectious disease--especially HIV/\n     AIDS and malria--are already significant, and their \n     increasingly heavy toll on productivity, profitability, and \n     foreign investment will be reflected in growing GDP losses, \n     as well, that could reduce GDP by as much as 20 percent or \n     more by 2010 in some Sub-Saharan African countries, according \n     to recent studies.\n       Some of the hardest hit countries in Sub-Saharan Africa--\n     and possibly later in South and Southeast Asia--will face a \n     demographic upheaval as HIV/AIDS and associated diseases \n     reduce human life expectancy by as much as 30 years and kill \n     as many as a quarter of their populations over a decade or \n     less, producing a huge orphan cohort. Nearly 42 million \n     children in 27 countries will lose one or both parents to \n     AIDS by 2010; 19 of the hardest hit countries will be in \n     Sub--Sahran Africa.\n       The relationship between disease and political instability \n     is indirect but real. A wide-ranging study on the causes of \n     state instability suggests that infant mortality--a good \n     indicator of the overall quality of life--correlates strongly \n     with political instability, particularly in countries that \n     already have achieved a measure of democracy. The severe \n     social and economic impact of infectious diseases is likely \n     to intensify the struggle for political power to control \n     scarce state resources.\n\n\n                            the deadly seven\n\n       The seven infectious diseases that caused the highest \n     number of deaths in 1998, according to WHO and DIA's Armed \n     Forces Medical Intelligence Center, AFMIC, will remain \n     threats well into the next century. HIV/AIDS, TB malaria, and \n     hepatitis B and C--are either spreading or becoming more \n     drug-\n\n[[Page S3824]]\n\n     resistant, while lower respiratory infections, diarrheal \n     diseases, and measles, appear to have at least temporarily \n     peaked.\n\n\n                                hiv/aids\n\n       Following its identification in 1983, the spread of HIV \n     intensified quickly. Despite progress in some regions, HIV/\n     AIDS shows no signs of abating globally. Approximately 2.3 \n     million people died from AIDS worldwide in 1998, up \n     dramatically from 0.7 million in 1993, and there were 5.8 \n     million new infections. According to WHO, some 33.4 \n     million people were living with HIV by 1998, up from 10 \n     million in 1990, and the number could approach 40 million \n     by the end of 2000. Although infection and death rates \n     have slowed considerably in developed countries owing to \n     the growing use of preventive measures and costly new \n     multidrug treatment therapies, the pandemic continues to \n     spread in much of the developing world, where 95 percent \n     of global infections and deaths have occurred. Sub-Saharan \n     Africa currently has the biggest regional burden, but the \n     disease is spreading quickly in India, Russia, China, and \n     much of the rest of Asia.\n\n\n                                   TB\n\n       WHO declared TB a global emergency in 1993 and the threat \n     continues to grow, especially from multidrug resistant TB. \n     The disease is especially prevalent in Russia, India, \n     Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and parts of Latin \n     America. More than 1.5 million people died of TB in 1998, \n     excluding those infected with HIV/AIDS, and there were up to \n     7.4 million new cases. Although the vast majority of TB \n     infections and deaths occur in developing regions, the \n     disease also is encroaching into developed regions due to \n     increased immigration and travel and less emphasis on \n     prevention. Drug resistance is a growing problem; the WHO has \n     reported that up to 50 percent of people with multidrug \n     resistant TB may die of their infection despite treatment, \n     which can be 10 to 50 times more expensive than that used for \n     drug-sensitive TB. HIV/AIDS also has contributed to the \n     resurgence of TB. One-quarter of the increase in TB incidence \n     involves co-infection with HIV. TB probably will rank second \n     only to HIV/AIDS as a cause of infectious disease deaths by \n     2020.\n       Malaria, a mainly tropical disease that seemed to be coming \n     under control in the 1960s and 1970s, is making a deadly \n     comeback-especially in Sub-Saharan Africa where infection \n     rates increased by 40 percent from 1970 to 1997. Drug \n     resistance, historically a problem only with the most severe \n     form of the disease, is now increasingly reported in the \n     milder variety, while the prospects for an effective vaccine \n     are poor. In 1998, an estimated 300 million people were \n     infected with malaria, and more than 1.1 million died from \n     the disease that year. Most of the deaths occurred in Sub-\n     Saharan Africa. According to the U.S. Agency for \n     International Development, USAID, Sub-Saharan Africa alone is \n     likely to experience a 7- to 20-percent annual increase in \n     malaria-related deaths and severe illnesses over the next \n     several years.\n       Sub-Saharan Africa will remain the region most affected by \n     the global infectious disease phenomenon--accounting for \n     nearly half of infectious disease-caused deaths worldwide. \n     Deaths from HIV/AIDS, malaria, cholera, and several lesser \n     known diseases exceed those in all other regions. Sixty-five \n     percent of all deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa are caused by \n     infectious diseases. Rudimentary health care delivery and \n     response systems, the unavailability or misuse of drugs, the \n     lack of funds, and the multiplicity of conflicts are \n     exacerbating the crisis. According to the AFMIC typology, \n     with the exception of southern Africa, most of Sub-Saharan \n     Africa falls in the lowest category. Investment in health \n     care in the region is minimal, less than 40 percent of the \n     people in countries such as Nigeria and the Democratic \n     Republic of the Congo DROC have access to basic medical care, \n     and even in relatively well off South Africa, only 50 to 70 \n     percent have such access, with black populations at the low \n     end of the spectrum.\n       Four-fifths of all HIV-related deaths and 70 percent of new \n     infections worldwide in 1998 occurred in the region, totaling \n     1.8 to 2 million and 4 million, respectively. Although only a \n     tenth of the world's population lives in the region, 11.5 \n     million to 13.9 million cumulative AIDS deaths have occurred \n     there. Eastern and southern African countries, including \n     South Africa, are the worst affected, with 10 to 26 percent \n     of adults infected with the disease. Sub-Saharan Africa has \n     high TB prevalence, as well as the highest HIV/TB co-\n     infection rate, with TB deaths totaling 0.55 million in 1998. \n     The hardest hit countries are in equatorial and especially \n     southern Africa. South Africa, in particular, is facing the \n     biggest increase in the region.\n       Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for an estimated 90 percent of \n     the global malaria burden. Ten percent of the regional \n     disease burden is attributed to malaria, with roughly 1 \n     million deaths in 1998. Cholera, dysentery, and other \n     diarrhea diseases also are major killers in the region, \n     particularly among children, refugees, and internationally \n     displaced populations. Forty percent of all childhood deaths \n     from diarrhea diseases occur in Sub-Saharan Africa. The \n     region also has a high rate of hepatitis B and C infections \n     and is the only region with a perennial meningococcal \n     meningitis problem in a ``meningitis belts'' stretching \n     from west to east.\n\n\n                      middle east and north africa\n\n       The region's conservative social mores, climatic factors, \n     and high levels of health spending in oil-producing states \n     tend to limit some globally prevalent diseases, such as HIV/\n     AIDS and malaria, but others, such as TB and hepatitis B and \n     C, are more prevalent. The region's advantages are partially \n     offset by the impact of war-related uprooting of populations, \n     overcrowded cities with poor refrigeration and sanitation \n     systems, and a dearth of water, especially clean drinking \n     water.\n       The HIV/AIDS impact is far lower than in other regions, \n     with 210,000 cases, or 0.13 percent of the population, \n     including 19,000 new cases, in 1998. This owes in part to \n     above-average underreporting because of the stigma associated \n     with the disease in Muslim societies and the authoritarian \n     nature of most governments in the region.\n\n\n                    international response capacity\n\n       International organizations such as WHO and the World Bank, \n     institutions is several developed countries such as the US \n     CDC, and Nongovernmental Organizations (NGOs), will continue \n     to play an important role in strengthening both international \n     and national surveillance and response systems for infectious \n     diseases. Nonetheless, progress is likely to be slow, and \n     development of an integrated global surveillance and response \n     system probably is at least a decade or more away. This owes \n     to the magnitude of the challenge; inadequate coordination at \n     the international level; and lack of funds, capacity, and, in \n     some cases, cooperation and commitment at the national level. \n     Some counties hide or understate their infectious disease \n     problems for reasons of international prestige and fear of \n     economic losses. Total international health-related aid to \n     low- and middle-income countries--some $2-3 billion \n     annually--remains a fraction of the $250 billion health bill \n     of these countries.\n\n\n                          macroeconomic impact\n\n       The macroeconomic costs of the infectious disease burden \n     are increasingly significant for the most seriously affected \n     countries despite the partially offsetting impact of declines \n     in population growth, and they will take an even greater toll \n     on productivity, profitability, and foreign investment in the \n     future. A senior World Bank official considers AIDS to be the \n     single biggest threat to economic development in sub-Saharan \n     Africa. A growing number of studies suggest that AIDS and \n     malaria alone will reduce GDP in several sub-Saharan African \n     countries by 20 percent or more by 2010.\n       The impact of infectious diseases on annual GDP growth in \n     heavily affected countries already amounts to as much as a 1-\n     percentage point reduction in the case of HIV/AIDS on average \n     and 1 to 2 percentage points for malaria, according to World \n     Bank studies. A recent Namibian study concluded that AIDS \n     cost the country nearly 8 percent of GDP in 1996, while a \n     study of Kenya projected that GDP will be 14.5 percent \n     smaller in 2005 than it otherwise would have been without the \n     cumulative impact of AIDS. The annual cost of malaria to \n     Kenya's GDP was estimated at 2 to 6 percent and at 1 to 5 \n     percent for Nigeria.\n       Public health spending on AIDS and related diseases \n     threatens to crowd out other types of health care and social \n     spending. In Kenya, HIV/AIDS treatment costs are projected to \n     account for 50 percent of health spending by 2005. In South \n     Africa, such costs could account for 35 to 84 percent of \n     public health expenditures by 2005, according to one \n     projection.\n\n\n                        disruptive social impact\n\n       At least some of the hardest-hit countries, initially in \n     Sub-Saharan Africa and later in other regions, will face a \n     demographic catastrophe as HIV/AIDS and associated diseases \n     reduce human life expectancy dramatically and kill up to a \n     quarter of their populations over the period of this \n     Estimate.\n\n\n                 life expectancy and population growth\n\n       Until the early 1990's, economic development and improved \n     health care had raised the life expectancy in developing \n     countries to 64 years, with prospects that it would go higher \n     still. The growing number of deaths from new and reemergent \n     diseases such as AIDS, however, will slow or reverse this \n     trend toward longer life spans in heavily affected countries \n     by as much as 30 years or more by 2010, according to the US \n     Census Bureau. For example, life expectancy will be reduced \n     by 30 years in Botswana and Zimbabwe, by 20 years in Nigeria \n     and South Africa, by 13 years in Honduras, by eight years in \n     Brazil, by four years in Haiti, and by three years in \n     Thailand.\n\n\n                            family structure\n\n       The degradation of nuclear and extended families across all \n     classes will produce severe social and economic dislocations \n     with political consequences, as well. Nearly 35 million \n     children in 27 countries will have lost one or both parents \n     to AIDS by 2000; by 2010, this number will increase to 41.6 \n     million. Nineteen of the hardest hit countries are in Sub-\n     Saharan Africa, where HIV/AIDS has been prevalent across all \n     social sectors. With as much as a third of the children under \n     15 in hardest-hit countries expected to comprise a ``lost \n     orphaned generation'' by 2010 with little hope of educational \n     or employment opportunities, these countries will be at risk \n     of further economic decay, increased crime, and political \n     instability as such young people become radicalized or are \n     exploited by various political groups for their own ends; the \n     pervasive child soldier phenomenon may be one example.\n\n[[Page S3825]]\n\n              destabilizing political and security impact\n\n       In our view, the infectious disease burden will add to \n     political instability and slow democratic development in Sub-\n     Saharan Africa, parts of Asia, and the former Soviet Union, \n     while also increasing political tensions in and among some \n     developed countries.\n       The severe social and economic impact of infectious \n     diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS, and the infiltration of \n     these diseases into the ruling political and military elites \n     and middle class of developing countries are likely to \n     intensify the struggle for political power to control scarce \n     state resources. This will hamper the development of a civil \n     society and other underpinnings of democracy and will \n     increase pressure on democratic transitions in regions such \n     as the FSU and Sub-Saharan Africa where the infectious \n     disease burden will add to economic misery and political \n     polarization.\n\n  I see another colleague who wishes to speak. I will summarize why I \nhave chosen to read at length from this intelligence report. It is very \nclear. The threat of these HIV/AIDS problems and other infectious \ndiseases is not something that is separate from or different from the \npiece of legislation that we are looking at today. This is titled the \n``African Growth and Opportunity Act.'' It is supposed to hold out the \npromise not only of profit for Americans who want to trade with Africa \nbut also genuine hope in the future for the nations of Africa and the \npeople of the African countries.\n  Without a genuine attempt in this bill to begin to deal, in \nparticular, with the HIV/AIDS problem, as well as other issues, this is \na false promise, it is a hollow statement, and, I am afraid, one that \ncould lead to a cynical response from those in Africa who will see this \nfor what it really is: a one-sided piece of legislation that ignores \none of the greatest human tragedies in human history and certainly a \ntragedy that completely undercuts the notion that we can have a good \ntrading relationship with a continent that is being destroyed by such a \nvicious disease.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I might be \nallowed to proceed as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bennett pertaining to the introduction of S. 2539 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nConference Report on the Trade and Development Act of 2000. It is \nimportant to remind everyone this is the first substantive trade bill \nwe have passed since the Uruguay Round implementation bill in 1994. It \nis about time. We Americans have, by far, the largest and most dynamic \neconomy in the world. We are the world's only superpower. We better act \nlike one. And that means taking leadership on global trade issues and \ntrade policy, not burying our heads in the sand. Completion of this \nbill is a first step. Passage of PNTR for China is another.\n  I would like to make several general comments about this legislation. \nThen I will highlight some of its major sections and explain why they \nare in the best interest of the United States.\n  In two weeks, the House is scheduled to vote on whether to extend \npermanent Normal Trade Relations status to China. The Senate vote will \nfollow. I am confident that it will pass in both houses. These two \npieces of legislation have a common underlying set of principles.\n  First, a market-based economy, the rule of law, and the reduction and \nelimination of barriers to foreign trade. These all lead to greater \ngrowth, both for our trade partners domestically, as well as and for \nthe global economy.\n  Second, greater interchange of goods, services, investment, and \npeople between the United States and developing countries. This leads, \nover the long-run, to domestic stability in those nations, and greater \nglobal stability.\n  Third, if the United States were to turn inward today, we would be \nturning our back on a global trade and economic system that has brought \nus to the greatest height of prosperity in the history of the world.\n  Although the disparities in income around the world are greater than \nin the past, hundreds of millions of people have been raised out of \npoverty over the last two decades. We need to do a lot more to ensure \nthat people in America and people overseas are not passed over by this \ngrowth. But raising trade barriers, reversing trade liberalization, and \nhalting our efforts to open markets around the world is not the answer. \nThat would only worsen income disparities and increase the number of \npeople living in poverty.\n  The outcome of our conference is not perfect. It never is. But the \nresult is absolutely in our national interest.\n  The two major sections of the bill are the Africa Growth and \nOpportunity Act, and the United States-Caribbean Basin Trade \nPartnership Act. The Africa portion is but one step in bringing Africa \ninto the global economic system. And in promoting development on this \nterribly poor continent.\n  Many of the problems of Africa are home grown. Many of the problems \nare the vestige of totally inept and irresponsible colonial rule. We \ncan provide ways, in this case through economic development, industrial \ngrowth, and debt relief, for Africa to begin to emerge from its cycle \nof poverty.\n\n  The Caribbean Basin was put at a competitive disadvantage once NAFTA \ncame into effect. This bill brings the CBI nations up to parity with \nMexico. At the same time, it requires important commitments from those \nnations on intellectual property rights, on WTO obligations, on \nparticipation in negotiations in the free trade area of America, on \nfighting the war against corruption, on respecting internationally \nrecognized worker rights, and on protecting against the worst forms of \nchild labor.\n  Under this bill, a country in Africa or the Caribbean must commit to \nprotect internationally recognized worker rights in order to receive \nbenefits. Congress has debated the issue of the relationship between \ntrade and labor for years. I am very pleased we have acted in support \nof one of the most basic sets of human rights. I hope this is an \nindication that we will start making real progress in reconciling trade \nand labor in future trade legislation.\n  Let me mention several other provisions of the bill that are of \nparticular import. I deeply regret the provision passed by this Senate \nto provide trade adjustment assistance for farmers was not included in \nthe conference report. Our farmers have suffered as much as any sector \nof our economy. Yet they fall between the cracks in our TAA policy, and \nthat was not the intention when trade adjustment assistance was \noriginally conceived.\n  As a compromise, the Secretary of Labor must submit a report \nexamining the applicability to farmers of trade adjustment assistance \nprograms. Further, the Secretary must make recommendations, either to \napprove the operation of those programs as they apply to farmers, or to \nestablish a new program for farmers. These provisions are utterly \ninadequate. I guarantee we will revisit this issue. Farmers suffering \nadversely from the impact of trade should be provided with the means to \nadjust, just as factory workers do today.\n  I strongly support the provision establishing a chief agricultural \nnegotiator at USTR, with the rank of ambassador. Agriculture is at the \ncore of our economy and our society, and our agricultural trade \nnegotiators need this high visibility to represent American interests \nproperly.\n  I might add that agriculture disparities around the world are the \nonly major remaining trade distortion not yet addressed either in GATT \nor WTO. It is agriculture trade distortions which are the major \nremaining significant barrier to trade with which we have not yet \ndealt.\n  I am very pleased this effort includes provisions dealing with the \nways we deal with products made with forced or indentured child labor. \nEvery time I hear that phrase ``forced or indentured child labor,'' I \nget chills down my spine. It bothers all of us when we hear that. This \nconference report also includes provisions to deal with that and it \nincludes new eligibility criteria in the GSP, Generalized System of \nPreferences, regarding the elimination of the worst forms of child \nlabor.\n  I wish to recognize my colleague, Senator Tom Harkin, for his \ntireless efforts on behalf of the rights of children\n\n[[Page S3826]]\n\nglobally. Everyone who is concerned--and we are all--with this problem \nshould remember the name Tom Harkin.\n  As has Senator Harkin, I have traveled to some of the most \ninhospitable places in the world, and I have seen children working and \nliving in conditions that would not be shown in a R-rated movie. I am \nproud to join him in supporting these measures.\n  Finally, wool tariffs. For years, there have been efforts to reduce \nthe tariffs on the finest worsted wool. This is a complex issue \naffecting the manufacturers of wool suits, the manufacturers of wool \nfabric, the yarn spinning industry, wool growers, and retailers. The \nconference report provides for the temporary reduction of tariffs on a \nlimited quantity of certain wool fabrics. It temporarily suspends the \nduty on certain wool yarns, fibers, and tops. And it establishes a $9 \nmillion wool research development promotion trust fund. This fund will \nassist wool producers in improving the quality of wool produced in the \nUnited States and help develop and promote the wool market. I welcome \nthis thoughtful compromise that serves all concerned groups.\n  In sum, I am pleased the House has passed this comprehensive and \nhistoric trade package. I strongly support it. I urge my colleagues to \nvote in favor of it. America is the world leader in promoting a market \neconomy and knocking down trade barriers in order to improve the \nquality of life, both in our country and abroad. We need to continue \nthis, first, by approving this conference report, and then, shortly, by \napproving PNTR for China.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, as the distinguished Majority Leader knows, \nI have made no secret of my opposition to the conference report to \naccompany H.R. 434, the so-called African Growth and Opportunity Act. \nAnd though there's no doubt that the conference report will be adopted \nby the Senate, I am obliged to point out that Congress is on the brink \nof passing legislation that accelerates the loss of a significant part \nof America's manufacturing base and costs numerous jobs in the \nbeleaguered textile and apparel industry.\n  Let me say at the outset that I certainly am not against ``African \ngrowth'' or ``African opportunity'' or economic growth in the Caribbean \nBasin. But I do not believe--and will not be convinced--that U.S. trade \npolicy should aid emerging economies at the expense of an entire \ndomestic industry and thousands of American workers.\n  But make no mistake, Mr. President, that is precisely what is \noccurring this week in the United States Senate. Consider the evidence: \nThe textile industry is already operating under an enormous trade \ndeficit. For every $6 million in apparel and fabric the industry \nexports, $21 million is imported, the vast majority of which streams in \nfrom third-world countries with cheap production costs. I don't suspect \nany Senator will seriously argue that H.R. 434 will do anything but \ndramatically increase this trade deficit.\n  Why is this so? Because American textile companies simply cannot \ncompete on a playing field that isn't a level playing field. As cheap \nimports continue to flood the domestic market, job loss will not only \ncontinue, but increase. The media report news of our booming economy, \nbut this so-called ``boom'' has left the textile and apparel industry \nout in the cold. As the Clinton administration crows about low \nunemployment, the Bureau of Labor Statistics also announced that just \nlast month, 3,000 textile jobs were lost. Since 1994, when Congress \npassed the North American Free Trade Agreement, this industry alone has \nlost 453,000 jobs.\n  That's not just a statistic, Mr. President. That's 453,000 families \nforced to contend with the stress and displacement that accompany job \nloss. That's 453,000 workers forced to find new means to make their \nlivelihood, often at lower-paying, entry level jobs for which they have \nlittle or no training.\n  453,000 Americans lost their job Mr. President, 70,000 of whom are \nNorth Carolinians. Let's try to put that job loss statistic into \nperspective. The distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Roth, knows that there are only 412,000 jobs in the entire \nstate of Delaware. A senior member of his committee, Senator Baucus, \nwho was a conferee on this legislation, surely is aware that there are \nonly 389,000 total jobs in Montana. Alaska has 289,000 jobs, Wyoming \nhas 235,000 jobs, Vermont 296,000, South Dakota 381,000 and North \nDakota 325,000 jobs.\n  Perhaps Senators would feel differently about U.S. trade policy if \nall of the workers instead of their entire states lost their jobs in \nthe last decade. Yet that's the precarious state of textile and apparel \nin America, Mr. President, and Congress continues to promote policies \nthat will further erode the industry.\n\n  In the textile communities of North Carolina, where 18 plants shut \ndown in 1999 alone, you can bet they don't talk much about the booming \neconomy. They're talking about something else.\n  Last April, I held a hearing in the Foreign Relations Committee on \nthe effects of NAFTA five years after it took effect. Among those who \nprovided testimony was a wonderfully unassuming women named Vontella \nDabbs. Ms. Dabbs works at Delta Mills in Maiden, North Carolina, and \nalthough she was seated at the same table with Ambassador Richard \nFischer and Pat Buchanan, she stole the show.\n  I am going to quote extensively from her testimony because it's \nimportant and it bears repeating again and again. She said the \nfollowing:\n\n       I come to you not as an expert in any field, not as a \n     politically motivated person, but simply as an American that \n     is deeply concerned for both my future and the future of my \n     family and friends. I cannot quote you statistics or give you \n     fancy computer-generated data to support some theory about \n     foreign trade. What I can give you are honest and heartfelt \n     feelings about what's going on in our community, as related \n     to the foreign trade agreements and the people who work in \n     textile plants . . .\n       Today . . . modern textile companies and plants are \n     threatened by one thing that I feel can put an end to our \n     entire industry. This threat is that we are not being given a \n     fair opportunity to compete with foreign business on a level \n     playing field. Many of the well-intentioned laws, treaties, \n     and trade agreements enacted during the past few years have \n     made the competition between domestic and foreign textile \n     business unfair, in favor of the foreign producers. These \n     treaties and laws and trade agreements have not really opened \n     up the world to American textiles, as was intended, but \n     instead have opened our borders for foreign manufacturers to \n     flood our country with goods produced with near slave labor \n     in deplorable conditions for workers. These agreements have \n     also created an incentive for American manufacturers to close \n     the door on American manufacturing and go south to Mexico and \n     the Caribbean to invest millions in foreign countries. And by \n     doing this, they are putting thousands of hard-working \n     Americans out of a job.\n\n  It's hard to argue with that, Mr. President, though I have no doubt \nthat many of my colleagues will try to do so. I can hear them now, \nsaying that may comparable new jobs have been created through the \ngrowth of the retail industry. To which the textile communities of \nNorth Carolina say, ``Thanks for nothing.'' Textile jobs pay 63 percent \nmore than retail jobs. While the average mill worker earns wages of \n$440.59 a week, retail workers make only $270.90.\n  Worse, the loss of textile jobs means money is drained from the \neconomies of the hardest-hit communities, making it impossible for \nthese towns to support this highly touted new retail employment. When \nthe mills close, workers can't simply consult the local newspapers to \nget another job. Instead, they are forced to relocate, looking for \nthose elusive retail jobs that pay barely more than half than the job \nthey just lost, and are growing most rapidly in larger cities with a \nhigher cost of living.\n  With this in mind, the last thing Congress needs to do is increase \nthe amount of cheap imports coming into our markets. Yet this is \nexactly what H.R. 434 will do. Even worse, however, the bill provides \nthe perfect loophole for Asian countries to circumvent U.S. import \nrestrictions. No wonder many people around town are starting to refer \nto this legislation as the ``Chinese Transshipment Bill.''\n\n  Here's how Asian companies can easily conduct illegal transshipments \nfrom both African and Caribbean nations, Mr. President. Asian \ncompanies, which currently must comply with U.S. quota and duty \nrequirements, will simply set up shop in the nations that benefit from \nthis legislation. Once they are in operation, it's impossible to know \nwhether garments are actually\n\n[[Page S3827]]\n\nassembled in Africa or the Caribbean or being shipped to these \ncountries from elsewhere. Then, under the bill, they can add another $3 \nbillion to their current agreements with the United States.\n  Mr. President, these illegalities certainly won't benefit American \ntextile companies--and it's hard to see how it does much for the \nAfrican and Caribbean nations that this bill is ostensibly designed to \nhelp. Instead, it merely allows already-established Asian companies to \nuse these nations as simple fronts for their own business. I certainly \nhope that's not what the Senate has in mind.\n  Mr. President, in my view, the decimation of one of America's most \nimportant industries is absolutely unacceptable. I do not quarrel with \nthe contention that economic development in Africa and the Caribbean is \nan important objective and ultimately in America's best interest. Yet I \nfail to see why we must sacrifice an entire domestic industry to this \ninternational goal.\n  Sadly enough, the Senate is now poised to do just that. I am \nrealistic enough to know the ultimate outcome of this debate. But I \nwould be remiss in my duty as a Senator from North Carolina--and as an \nAmerican--if I did not take a stand on behalf of the many thousands of \nworkers who have paid--and will continue to pay--the price for a U.S. \ntrade policy willing to countenance the destruction of the textile \nindustry and the communities it supports.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I welcome the opportunity to call the \nattention of the Senate to neurofibromatosis, or NF, a cruel \nneurological disorder that affects so many of our citizens. In the \npast, groups who come together to fight NF have asked Congress to \ndesignate May as ``World Neurofibromatosis Awareness Month.'' This \nyear, they are directing their energies to more substantive issues. I \ncommend NF Inc. and other advocates across the nation for their \nleadership and their strong commitment to this cause.\n  NF is a genetic disorder of the nervous system that can cause tumors \non nerves anywhere in the body at any time. It is a progressive \ndisorder that affects all ethnic groups and both sexes equally. It is \none of the most common genetic disorders in the United States--\naffecting one in every 4,000 births.\n  There are two genetically distinct forms of this disorder--NF-1 and \nNF-2. The effects are unpredictable and have varying manifestations and \ndegrees of severity.\n  NF-1 is the more common type, occurring in about 1 in 4,000 people in \nthe United States. Symptoms include five or more light brown skin spots \nknown as cafe-au-lait macules, as well as tumors that can grow on the \neyes or spine. In most cases, the symptoms are mild and people can live \nnormal and productive lives. In some cases, however, NF-1 can be \nseverely debilitating.\n  NF-2 is less common, affecting about 1 in 40,000 people, and much \nmore severe. Tumors grow near the auditory nerve and often cause \npressure on other nerves in the head and the body. Tumors also grow on \nthe spine, and attack the central nervous system. People with NF-2 \noften experience deafness, frequent headaches and facial pain, facial \nparalysis, cataracts, and difficulty with balance.\n  There is no known cure for either form of the disorder, even though \nthe genes for both NF-1 and NF-2 have been identified. Currently, NF \nhas no treatment, other than the surgical removal of tumors, which \nsometimes grow back.\n  The disorder is not infectious. Only half of those affected with it \nhave a prior family history of NF. If someone does not have NF, they \ncannot pass it on to their children.\n  Talented researchers across the country are making impressive strides \nin finding a cure for this serious disorder. Thanks in great part to \nthe research sponsored by the National Institute of Neurological \nDisorders and Stroke at NIH, scientists have already identified the two \ngenes that cause NF, and significant progress in developing new \ntreatments is being made.\n  Much of the cutting-edge research on NF is being performed at the NF \nClinic at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, which was founded \nin 1982 by Dr. Robert Martuza. It was one of the first clinics to \nrecognize the unique multi-disciplinary problems that NF patients and \ntheir families face--and the vital role that a dedicated clinic plays \nin the research community. The McLain Hospital in Belmont, \nMassachusetts also has a vital role in supporting important research, \nparticularly for NF-2.\n  One of the most difficult aspects of having NF, or caring for a \npatient with NF, is not knowing what the future will bring. Our lack of \nknowledge about the cause of the tumors associated with the disorder \nalso makes the evaluation of potential therapies difficult. In \nassociation with Children's Hospital of Boston and the House Ear \nInstitute in Los Angles, the NF Clinic at MGH is participating in an \ninternational study to define the types of tumors most commonly \nassociated with NF.\n  Congress has a responsibility to provide these dedicated medical \nprofessionals and researchers with the resources and support necessary \nto continue their lifesaving work. President Clinton has asked for \nincreased funding to fight this disorder and many other neurological \nillnesses.\n  We must also ensure that a person's genetic information cannot be \nused as a basis for discrimination. To receive appropriate care for NF, \npatients must have access to genetic tests, free from the concern that \nthe results of those tests will be used to discriminate against them in \nany way.\n  I commend the dedicated researchers and physicians across the country \nfor their commitment to this important issue, and I commend advocates \nlike NF Inc. for their leadership. I look forward to rapid progress in \nthe years ahead, and I am confident that Congress and the \nAdministration will do as much as possible to support their all-\nimportant efforts. Together, we can cure NF.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/10/senate-section/article/S3827-3", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

SMITH\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the long and \nexemplary service of Washington State University (WSU) President Samuel \nH. Smith and his wife Pat Smith.\n\n[[Page S3828]]\n\n  Samuel Smith has served as President of WSU since July of 1985, and \nhe will be retiring at the end of the month.\n  Under Dr. Smith's leadership, the University has prospered. During \nhis tenure, he strengthened the undergraduate and graduate curricula \nand worked to increase opportunities for women and minorities.\n  As a result of President Smith's work, many programs at WSU have \nreceived national and worldwide recognition.\n  President Smith deserves special honor for expanding the number of \npeople who benefit from the University's educational system and for \nbringing education at WSU into the Information Age.\n  Dr. Smith established branch campuses of WSU in Vancouver, the Tri-\nCities, and in Spokane, opening the doors of higher education to an \neven greater number of Washingtonians.\n  These branch campuses serve transition communities, helping people \nbuild the skills and training they need to succeed in today's \nworkplace. Their lives are improving thanks to Dr. Smith's vision.\n  Dr. Smith was also instrumental in expanding educational \nopportunities to remote areas through WSU's innovative distance-\nlearning programs.\n  One of the clearest examples of the way WSU has grown during Dr. \nSmith's tenure is the fact that more than one-third of all WSU \ngraduates in the University's history were granted degrees by President \nSmith.\n  Dr. Smith has also been a member of and a leader in many national \neducational organizations. He is the Chair of the National Association \nof State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges Board of Directors for \n2000. He is also a member of the Kellogg Commission on the Future of \nState and Land-Grant Universities.\n  He is a member of the Board of Trustees of the Western Governors \nUniversity. He has also served as Chair of the Executive Committee of \nthe National Collegiate Athletic Association. For his exemplary \nservice, Dr. Smith has received many honors and awards for his work in \nthese organizations.\n  President Smith is a native of Salinas, California, and holds \nbachelor's and doctoral degrees in plant pathology from the University \nof California at Berkeley and honorary doctoral degrees from Nihon \nUniversity in Tokyo, Japan, and Far Eastern State University in \nVladivostok, Russia.\n  Mr. President, I also want my colleagues to know that Pat Smith has \nbeen an instrumental figure in the growth of Washington State \nUniversity.\n  From her position on the Washington State Arts Commission, she worked \nto expand the art collection and increase awareness of the WSU Museum \nof Art. She also serves on the boards of the Girl Scouts of the Inland \nNorthwest and the United Way of Pullman, Washington.\n  Mrs. Smith is also from Salinas, California, and is a graduate of \nSalinas Union High School. She studied at Hartnell College in Salinas, \nCalifornia.\n  Mr. President, as a citizen of Washington state and as an alumna of \nWashington State University, I could not be more proud of the great job \nthat President Smith and Pat Smith have done in expanding educational \nopportunities for the people of my state and nation and making my alma \nmater an even brighter beacon of learning and opportunity.\n  Mr. President, in closing I would like to say--on behalf of the \npeople of my state and the many graduates, faculty members and current \nstudents of Washington State University--thank you President and Mrs. \nSmith.\n  Thank you for putting your compassion, energy and leadership to such \ngood use at the helm of Washington State University.\n  Your presence will be missed, but the many gifts you gave us serve as \na constant reminder of your many years of generous service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/10/senate-section/article/S3828-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE HONORABLE NANCI J. GRANT RECEIVES ELEANOR ROOSEVELT HUMANITIES \n                                 AWARD\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, each year, the Attorney Division \nof State of Israel Bonds honors two individuals with the Eleanor \nRoosevelt Humanities Award. Recipients of this award are recognized for \ntheir contributions to the legal profession as well as their \noutstanding service to humanity in the spirit and ideals of Mrs. \nRoosevelt. I rise today to recognize the Honorable Barry M. Grant and \nthe Honorable Nanci J. Grant, who will both receive the Eleanor \nRoosevelt Humanities Award on May 16, 2000, in Southfield, Michigan.\n  The Honorable Nanci J. Grant is the Presiding Judge of General \nJurisdiction for the Oakland County Circuit Court. She was elected to \nthis position in November of 1996 and took office on January 1, 1997. \nJudge Grant is a graduate of the University of Michigan and Wayne State \nUniversity Law School. Prior to joining the bench, she was a trial \nattorney with the law firm of Dickinson, Wright, Moon, VanDusen & \nFreeman, and served as a researcher, Friend of the Court intern, \narbitrator and mediator for the Oakland County Circuit Court.\n  Judge Grant is a member of the Executive Committee of the Michigan \nJudges Association, and co-chairs the Rules Committee. By gubernatorial \nappointment, Judge Grant represents all Michigan circuit court judges \non the State Community Corrections Board. She is an advisory board \nmember of the Michigan Judicial Institute, the teaching arm of the \nMichigan Supreme Court. Judge Grant is also a member of the National \nAssociation of Women Judges, the American Bar Association, the Oakland \nCounty Bar Association, the Women's Bar Association, American Judges \nAssociation, and the University of Michigan Alumni Association.\n  In addition, Judge Grant has dedicated much of her time to the \nimprovement of the Oakland County Community. She is a member of the \nMichigan Cancer Foundation, and has served as a member of Common Ground \nAdvisory Board, the Rotary Club of Birmingham, and Bloomfield Youth \nAssistance. She is a board member of the Women's Survival Center, and a \nDirector of the Women's Officials Network. She also has served on the \nPartners Executive Committee, and was a member of the Citizens Alliance \nof the Probate Court, where she served as chairperson of the \nInformation and Advocacy Committee.\n  Judge Grant has often been awarded for her many endeavors, both \ncharitable and professional. The monthly magazine, Hour Detroit, named \nher as one of the new leaders in the Detroit metropolitan area. She was \nselected by Crain's Detroit Business magazine as one the ``40 under \n40,'' a select group of forty of Metro Detroit's best and brightest \nresidents under the age of forty. In addition, Judge Grant has been \nelected as an ``Outstanding Young Woman of America.''\n  Mr. President, I applaud the Honorable Nanci M. Grant on her many \nachievements, both within the realm of the law and outside of that \nrealm. I am sure that the Eleanor Roosevelt Humanities Award will hold \na special place among her many recognitions. On behalf of the entire \nUnited States Senate, I congratulate Judge Grant on receiving this \naward, and wish her continued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/10/senate-section/article/S3828-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3828-S3829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \n50th anniversary of the National Science Foundation, an institution \nthat has served as a driving force behind the Nation's scientific and \ntechnological development.\n  The National Science Foundation's roots can be found at the close of \nWorld War II, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt requested a report \nfrom the government's wartime Office of Scientific Research and \nDevelopment outlining how the United States should support scientific \nresearch in the postwar era. The resulting report, Science--The Endless \nFrontier, authored by Vannevar Bush, made the case for the \nestablishment of a National Research Foundation and legislation based \nupon his findings was introduced by Senator Warren Magnuson of \nWashington. After five years of deliberation in the Congress, President \nHarry S. Truman signed legislation creating the National Science \nFoundation on May 10, 1950. Since that day, NSF has played a vital role \nin maintaining America's leadership position in scientific discovery \nand the development of new technologies, securing the\n\n[[Page S3829]]\n\nnation's defense and promoting the nation's health and prosperity.\n  Over the past 50 years, NSF-funded research has led to numerous \nscientific breakthroughs that have impacted the lives of every one of \nus. This research has resulted in projects and initiatives that include \nthe development of the Internet, Doppler Radar, the American Sign \nLanguage Dictionary, DNA fingerprinting, MRI technology, barcodes, the \nidentification of the Hanta Virus, and the discovery of the weather \npattern known as El Nino/La Nina. This research has been responsible \nfor creating new industries relating to communications, biotechnology, \nagriculture, and other important sectors of our economy. In turn, these \nindustries have resulted in greater employment opportunities, economic \nprosperity and an improved quality of life for Americans and citizens \naround the world.\n  NSF funds support the work and research of almost 200,000 people, \nincluding teachers, students, researchers, post-doctorates, and \ntrainees. In fact, researchers and educators from each of the 50 states \nand all U.S. territories have been allotted NSF funding in the form of \ncompetitively awarded, grants, contracts and cooperative agreements. \nAlmost 40% of the funding for research grants is awarded to our \nnation's students and researchers, providing support for more than \n61,000 post-doctorates, trainees and graduates and undergraduate \nstudents. These are the individuals who will carry on the critical \nmission of NSF into the 21st century.\n  The work undertaken by NSF researchers has not gone unnoticed. NSF-\nsupported researchers have been the recipients of numerous awards and \nhonors. More than 100 of these researchers have been awarded Nobel \nPrizes in fields that include physics, chemistry, physiology and \neconomics. NSF researchers have also been awarded the National Medal of \nScience, National Medal of Technology, the Waterman, the Draper, the \nPresidential Early Career Awards in Science and Engineering and the \nCareer awards, to name a few.\n  I want to commend the men and women who have worked for NSF and \nreceived support from NSF who have contributed incalculably to the \nefforts that have established the United States as the leader in \nscientific and technological innovation and I want to recognize the \noutstanding leadership of the current Director of the National Science \nFoundation, Dr. Rita Colwell, in this regard. I urge my colleagues to \njoin with me in commending NSF on this important occasion and wishing \nthem continued success in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/10/senate-section/article/S3829-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNITION OF THE INDEX SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR THEIR INNOVATION IN \n                               EDUCATION\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge a very \nunique school district in a forested area of Washington State. The \nIndex School District may be small in size but if measured by the \ncreativity and dedication of its teachers, staff, and parents, it would \nbe one of the largest districts in Washington state.\n  Index School District is one of the smallest in the state, with only \n35 students from preschool to 7th grade. Because of the district's size \nand location in a rural area, the district has constantly struggled to \nfind funding that could boost student achievement. Index's \nSuperintendent and Principal, Martin Boyle, took the funding challenges \nhead on and has worked tirelessly to find money for Index's students \nthrough federal grants and a $298,208 bond levy that was passed in \n1998. After four years of hard work, the Index School District has \nbecome a model for other schools.\n  Improving student reading levels was one of the first goals Boyle and \nhis colleagues accomplished. The district hired a reading specialist \nand with the help of parents and local volunteers, reading levels have \nsoared. Recently, Boyle started a new mentor reading program called, \n``Help One Student to Succeed.'' He hopes it will get parents involved \nin teaching their children to read, as well as a new way to promote and \ninnovate reading skills, advancing student reading levels by an even \ngreater margin.\n  Index School District's includes 20 staff members and 5 board members \nwho work tirelessly for their students and are constantly brainstorming \nnew activities and new programs that will help their students learn. \nThey have even started an after-school program for children who in the \npast, were sitting outside waiting for their parents' workday to end. \nStudents now use this extra time to participate in fun activities that \nreinforce classroom curriculum.\n  In addition, last summer, the district implemented the Index \nElementary Summer School Program where students take part in hands on \nart and cultural activities. Students also visit art museums and \ntheaters, as well as travel to other parts of the state for hiking and \ncamping activities, giving children opportunities to learn and \nchallenge their knowledge outside the classroom.\n  Many students at Index also depend on their school as a home away \nfrom home, relying on the school for three meals a day. While a \nmajority of students qualify for free and reduced lunches, the staff of \nIndex understands the importance of meals for their students and have \nmade it a priority to create and fund a food program which was \nrecognized with a ``Children's Alliance Award.''\n  The innovation and commitment of the Index School District's staff is \ntruly inspiring.

Mr. President, I rise today in honor of the \nSalvation Army in Benton Harbor, Michigan, which on May 20-21, 2000, \nwill celebrate its 75th Anniversary. This event will conclude a very \nspecial week for the organization, as May 15-21, 2000, is also National \nSalvation Army Week, during which Americans have the opportunity to \nsalute an organization that does so many things for so many people \naround the world.\n  Mr. President, the mission of the movement remains the same as it was \nin 1865, when William and Catherine Booth formed an evangical group, \nand preached to people living in poverty on the east side of London: to \npreach the gospel of Jesus Christ and to meet human needs in His name \nwithout discrimination. The organization, officially titled the \nSalvation Army in 1878, and its many adherents, soldiers, officers, and \nvolunteers, remain dedicated to caring for the poor, feeding the \nhungry, clothing the naked, loving the unlovable, and befriending those \nwho have no friends.\n  In its 135 years, the Salvation Army has expanded from this small \ncoalition of individuals in London into a multi-faceted, global \norganization. Its outreach currently extends to over 100 countries, and \nthe Gospel is preached by its officers and soldiers in 160 languages. \nEach year, the organization assists over 27 million individuals. In the \nUnited States alone, there are 1.7 million volunteers, 470,000 \nSalvationists, 5,339 officers, and 43,000 employees serving the \nSalvation Army.\n  Amid such statistics I fear it is easy to overlook the essential fact \nthat the foundation of the Salvation Army lies at the community level. \nIt is an organization based in communities, whose volunteers, officers \nand employees are primarily concerned with helping members of their own \ncommunity in the name of Jesus Christ. Whether it be through summer \ncamps, day care centers, services for senior citizens, shelters for \nbattered wives and children, drug rehabilitation, or family and career \ncounseling, where there is a Salvation Army, there are people working \nhard to improve their community.\n  With this in mind, Mr. President, I applaud the officers, \nSalvationists, volunteers and employees of the Salvation Army in Benton \nHarbor, whose efforts over the years have had made this anniversary \npossible. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I wish the \nSalvation Army in Benton Harbor a happy 75th birthday, and continued \nsuccess in the future.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/10/senate-section/article/S3830-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3830]]\n                       TRIBUTE TO MARY MIDDLETON\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate \nMary Middleton of Covington, Kentucky, for receiving the Friends of \nCovington Award for Outstanding Community Service.\n  Mary is a devoted civic leader and volunteer in Covington and \nthroughout Kenton County. She gives her time and energy to numerous \nactivities at church, and has provided leadership for several Northern \nKentucky organizations. Mary helped found the Northern Kentucky \nInterfaith Commission and was the first president of the area's \nSalvation Army Auxiliary. In her many years of service to the \ncommunity, she also was president of the Covington Art Club, Booth \nHospital Auxiliary, Church Women United, and the Mary Circle of the \nGloria Dei Lutheran Church.\n  Mary's kindness and generosity does not end there--she also has been \ninvolved with the Heritage League, Northern Kentucky Symphony, Women's \nHealth Initiative, American Cancer Society, Florence Women's Club, and \nthe Friends of Covington.\n  Aside from being involved in civic and philanthropic activities, Mary \nhas long been an active member of the Northern Kentucky Republican \nParty and a driving force for Kentucky's Republican women. Back in the \n1960s, Mary helped found the Kenton County Republican Women's Club and \ncontinues her work there today.\n  Mary also deserves credit for the many successes in her personal \nlife. She and Clyde have been happily married for many, many years and \nhave showed enormous strength of character and have a marriage that is \nan example to us all.\n  My colleagues and I join in congratulating you, Mary, on yet another \nfine achievement and we thank you for the time and effort you have put \ninto others lives. I know the people of Northern Kentucky will continue \nto benefit from your generosity for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/10/senate-section/article/S3830-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONGRATULATING WESTMINISTER CHRISTIAN ACADEMY IN THE WE THE PEOPLE . . \n           .

Mr. President, it is my pleasure to congratulate \nthe class from Westminister Christian Academy in St. Louis that \nrepresented the state of Missouri in the We the People--The Citizen and \nthe Constitution national finals in Washington, D.C., during May 6-8, \n2000. These young scholars worked diligently to reach the national \nfinals, where they received honorable mention. Through this experience \nthey have gained a deep knowledge and understanding of the fundamental \nprinciples and values of our constitutional democracy.\n  I would like to recognize Rebekah Baxter, Anna-Grace Claassen, \nSamantha Denny, Jonathan Friz, Joseph Goldkamp, Nick Gustafson, Tim \nIvancic, Aaron Johnson, Melissa Millar, Sarah Munson, John Murphy, \nSteve Ottolini, Nick Pavlenko, Dawn Piehl, Rodney Schnellbacher, \nMichelle Stanford, Lindsey Vehlewald and Kristen Walle and their \nteacher Ken Boesch.\n  The We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution program is \nan extensive educational program developed specifically to educate \nyoung people about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The three-\nday national competition is modeled after hearings in the U.S. \nCongress. These hearings consist of oral presentations by high school \nstudents before a panel of adult judges. The students testify as \nconstitutional experts before a panel of judges representing various \nregions of the country and a variety of appropriate fields. The \nstudents' testimony is followed by a period of questioning by the \nsimulated congressional committee. The judges probe students for their \ndepth of understanding and ability to apply their constitutional \nknowledge.\n  I would like to congratulate the class from Westminister Christian \nAcademy on their exemplary performance at the We the People . . . \nnational finals. I wish these young ``constitutional experts'' from \nMissouri the best of luck in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/10/senate-section/article/S3830-3", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE HONORABLE BARRY M.

A bill to provide funds for the purchase of automatic \nexternal defibrillators and the training of individuals in advanced \ncardiac life support; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n                 rural access to emergency devices act\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my friend from \nWisconsin, Senator Feingold, in introducing the Rural Access to \nEmergency Devices Act of 2000, which is intended to improve access to \nautomated external defibrillators in small communities to boost the \nsurvival rates of individuals who suffer cardiac arrest.\n  We are very pleased to be joined in introducing this legislation by \nthe following cosponsors: Senators Murray, Abraham, Wellstone, \nHutchinson, Dorgan, Grams, Bingaman, Chafee and Enzi.\n  Heart disease is the leading cause of death both in the State of \nMaine and nationwide. According to the American Heart Association, an \nestimated 250,000 Americans die each year from cardiac arrest. Many of \nthese deaths could be prevented if AEDs were more accessible. AEDs are \ncomputerized devices that can shock a heart back into the normal rhythm \nand restore life to a cardiac arrest victim. They must, however, be \nused promptly. For every minute that passes before a victim's normal \nheart rhythm is restored, his or her chance of survival falls by as \nmuch as 10 percent.\n  We have a number of new and improved technologies in our arsenal of \nweapons to fight heart disease, including a new generation of small, \neasy-to-use AEDs that can strengthen the chances of survival. These new \ndevices make it possible not only for emergency medical personnel, but \nalso trained lay rescuers, to deliver defibrillation safely and \neffectively. The new AEDs are safe, effective, lightweight, low \nmaintenance, and relatively inexpensive. Moreover, they are \nspecifically designed so they can be used by nonmedical personnel, such \nas police, firefighters, security guards, and other lay rescuers, \nproviding they have been trained properly.\n  According to the American Heart Association, making AEDs standard \nequipment in police cars, firetrucks--as I know the Presiding Officer \nhas done in his hometown--ambulances, and other emergency vehicles, and \ngetting these devices into more public places could save more than \n50,000 lives a year.\n  Last December, the Bangor Mall installed an AED that is one of the \nfirst of these devices in Maine to be placed in a public setting \noutside the direct control of emergency medical personnel and hospital \nstaff. Both the AED and an oxygen tank are kept inside a customer \nservice booth, which is in an area of the mall where there is a high \nconcentration of traffic and where heart emergencies might occur. Mall \npersonnel have also received special training and, during mall hours, \nthere is always at least one person who has been certified in both CPR \nand defibrillator use.\n  For at least one Bangor woman, this has been a lifesaver. On January \n12th, just weeks after the AED was installed, two shoppers at the Mall \ncollapsed in a single day. One was given oxygen and quickly revived. \nBut the other shopper was unconscious and had stopped breathing. The \ntrained mall staff--Maintenance Supervisor Larry Lee, Security Chief \nDusty Rhodes, and General Manager Roy Daigle--were only able to detect \na faint pulse. They quickly commenced CPR and attached the AED.\n  It is important to note that defibrillation is intended to \nsupplement, not replace standard CPR. These devices, which are almost \ncompletely automated, run frequent self-diagnostics and will not allow \nthe administration of shock unless the victim's recorded heart pattern \nrequires it. When the AED is attached, it automatically analyzes the \nvictim's vital signs. One of two commands will then be voiced and \ndisplayed by the unit: ``Shock advised--charging''; or ``Shock not \nadvised--continue CPR.''\n  In the Bangor Mall case, the shock was not advised, so CPR was \ncontinued until the emergency medical personnel arrived. The EMT's told \nMr. Daigle, the General Manager of the mall, that the woman--who had \nhad a heart attack and subsequently required triple by-pass surgery--\nsimply would not have survived if they had not been so prepared. As Mr. \nDaigle observed, ``Twelve to fifteen minutes is just too long to wait \nfor the emergency services to arrive.''\n  Cities across America have begun to recognize the value of fast \naccess to AEDs and are making them available to emergency responders. \nIn many small and rural communities, however, limited budgets and the \nfact that so many rely on volunteer organizations for emergency \nservices can make acquisition and appropriate training in the use of \nthese life-saving devices problematic.\n  The legislation that Senator Feingold and I are introducing today is \nintended to increase access to AEDs and trained local responders for \nsmaller towns and rural areas in Maine and elsewhere where those first \non the scene may not be paramedics or others who would normally have \nAEDs. Our bill provides $25 million over three years, to be given as \ngrants to community partnerships consisting of local emergency \nresponders, police and fire departments, hospitals, and other community \norganizations. This money could then be used to help purchase AEDs and \ntrain potential responders in their use, as well as in basic CPR and \nfirst aid.\n  I commend the leadership of the Senator from Wisconsin for coming \nforth with this idea. I am very pleased to join him in introducing this \nimportant legislation.\n  The Rural Access to Emergency Devices Act has been endorsed by both \nthe American Heart Association and the American Red Cross as a means of \nexpanding access to these lifesaving devices across rural America. I \nurge all of our colleagues to join us as cosponsors of the bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support from both the \nAmerican Heart Association and their Maine affiliate be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   American Heart Association,\n\n                                         Augusta, ME, May 3, 2000.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: The State Advocacy Committee of the \n     American Heart Association in Maine commends you for your \n     leadership in sponsoring the ``Rural Access to Emergency \n     Devices (AED) Act.'' As volunteer advocates for the American \n     Heart Association, we are pleased that you have recognized \n     that the placement of AEDs with trained, local, first \n     responders, such as fire and rescue departments, paramedics, \n     police departments and community hospitals in rural areas \n     will make a difference in a person's chances of surviving a \n     sudden cardiac arrest. We are also proud that this bill is \n     being sponsored by a Maine Senator.\n       Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the state of \n     Maine, as well as the nation. Early defibrillation is the \n     only known therapy for most cardiac arrests. Each minute of\n\n[[Page S3833]]\n\n     delay in returning the heart to its normal pattern of beating \n     decreases the chance of survival by 7% to 10%. As you well \n     know, Maine's population is dispersed over a large \n     geographical, mostly rural, area. The Emergency Medical \n     Services in our state are excellent, but travel times within \n     rural communities can occasionally be too long to benefit the \n     patient in cardiac arrest. The availability of AEDs and \n     trained local responders should improve the chain of survival \n     for these victims of sudden cardiac arrest. The American \n     Heart Association estimates that the sudden cardiac arrest \n     survival rate can improve from only 5% to 20% when AEDs and \n     trained rescuers are readily available within communities.\n       Thank you, Senator Collins, on behalf of the residents of \n     Maine and our fellow citizens in other rural states.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                           Gayle Russell, RN, BSN,\n     Chair, Maine State Advocacy Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   American Heart Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 27, 2000.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     Hon. Russell Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Collins and Feingold: The American Heart \n     Association applauds your commitment to saving lives and \n     thanks you for your introduction of the ``Rural Access to \n     Emergency Devices (AED) Act.'' The legislation will help \n     improve cardiac arrest survival rates across rural America.\n       As you know, heart disease is the leading cause of death in \n     this country. Cardiac arrest, whereby the electrical rhythms \n     of the heart malfunction, causes the sudden death of more \n     than 250,000 people every year. We are fighting this killer \n     with improved technology, including automated external \n     defibrillators (AEDs). These small, easy-to-use devices can \n     shock a heart back into normal rhythm and restore life to a \n     cardiac arrest victim. But, they must be used promptly. We \n     have to act quickly because for every minute that passes \n     before a victim's normal heart rhythm is restored, his or her \n     chance of survival falls by as much as 10 percent.\n       Cities across America have begun to recognize the value of \n     fast access to these devices and are making them available to \n     emergency responders. The Rural AED Act recognizes that we \n     cannot and should not leave rural communities behind in this \n     fight to improve survival. Because the first emergency \n     responders on the scene of a cardiac arrest may not always be \n     the medical responders, the Rural AED Act makes resources \n     available to rural communities to purchase AEDs for police \n     and fire as well as emergency responder vehicles. In \n     addition, it provides resources to train these responders in \n     the use of the devices. The bill provides $25 million for \n     this effort to expand access to devices that can save lives \n     across rural America.\n       The American Heart Association thanks you for your \n     leadership in the fight against heart disease and looks \n     forward to working with you to ensure the passage of this \n     important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                       Lynn A. Smaha, M.D., Ph.D.,\n                                                        President.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Let me first thank the managers for allowing us the opportunity to \nintroduce our bill at this time. I especially thank my friend, the \nSenator from Maine, for taking the lead on this issue with me. She is a \nvery effective Senator on many issues, and is specially effective, I \nthink, when it comes to the concerns of rural people in Maine and \nthroughout the country about an issue which is incredibly important--\nfirst aid.\n  I also thank the Presiding Officer, the junior Senator from Rhode \nIsland, for joining us and cosponsoring the bill.\n  I rise today with Senator Collins to introduce the Rural Access to \nEmergency Devices Act. This legislation provides a first step to \nhelping save the lives of the more than 250,000 people who die each \nyear from sudden cardiac arrest.\n  Every two minutes, someone in America falls into sudden cardiac \narrest--a medical emergency in which the heart's rhythm becomes so \nerratic it can not pump blood to the brain and other vital organs.\n  According to the American Heart Association, over 250,000 Americans \ndie each year from sudden cardiac arrest. That is 700 deaths each day--\na startlingly large number. Overall heart disease kills more Americans \nthan AIDS, cancer, and diabetes combined.\n  In my home state of Wisconsin, as in many other states, heart disease \nis the number one killer. Ninety-five sudden deaths from cardiac arrest \noccur each day in Wisconsin.\n  These numbers are disturbing by any measure, but they are especially \ntroubling because they don't need to be this high. By taking some \nrelatively simple steps, we can give victims of cardiac arrest a better \nchance of survival, particularly in rural areas. Cardiac arrest victims \nare in a race against time, and today I'm introducing a bill to \nincrease access to defibrillators, that are essential to reviving \ncardiac arrest victims.\n  Cardiac arrest strikes its unwilling victims with no warnings or \nindications. In most cases it's all but impossible to predict who will \nhave a sudden cardiac arrest, or where and when it will happen.\n  Cardiac arrest can strike anyone. When cardiac arrest occurs, the \nvictim loses consciousness, has no pulse and stops breathing normally. \nDeath often occurs within minutes.\n  Cardiac arrest does not discriminate against age, gender, or race. A \nrecent issue of Women's Day magazine detailed a number of cases in \nwhich a variety of people suffered from cardiac arrest.\n  The article tells about a 24-year-old woman, a writer for a Seattle \ncomedy show, who suffered from cardiac arrest after watching her \nfavorite television show. Another victim was a 48-year-old women who \nwas out for a birthday dinner with her husband and friend. Yet another \nindividual, only 31 years of age, suffered cardiac arrest at his \ncomputer programing job in Minnesota.\n\n  What these victims have in common is that all three survived. Each \nwas saved because a properly trained person was there with an automated \nexternal defibrillator (AED). These life saving machines are compact, \nportable, battery-operated versions of the machines that were \ntraditionally only in the hands of emergency medical personnel.\n  Wisconsin's Emergency Medical Services are some of the finest in the \ncountry. They are effectively trained to identify victims and determine \nwhen a shock is needed. There are countless stories of quick EMS \nresponses that have saved so many lives.\n  Unfortunately, for those in many rural areas, Emergency Medical \nServices have simply too far to go to reach people in need and time \nruns out for victims of cardiac arrest. It's simply not possible to \nhave EMS units next to every farm and small town across the nation.\n  Fortunately, recent technological advances have made the newest \ngeneration of AEDs inexpensive--approximately $3,000--and simple to \noperate. Because of these advancements in AED technology, it is now \npractical to train and equip fire department personnel, police \nofficers, and other community organizations--and that's exactly what \nthis legislation would do.\n  But let me be clear, I think they are only one part of the so-called \nchain of survival.\n  This chart indicates the four crucial aspects of the chain of \nsurvival, which is a proven method to save lives.\n  The first link in the chain is simple: it is vitally important that \ncardiac arrest victims have early access to care. When someone suffers \nfrom cardiac arrest, it's crucial that bystanders dial 911 to dispatch \nthe appropriate emergency personnel to the scene.\n  The next link is early CPR--if performed properly, it will at least \nbuy a few minutes to perform defibrillation. Let me be clear though, \neffective CPR does not replace defibrillation in saving lives.\n  The critical link in the chain of survival for victims of cardiac \narrest is early defibrillation. Mr. President, each minute of the delay \nin returning the heart to its normal pattern of beating decreases the \nchance of survival by 10 percent.\n  The final link in the chain is early access to advanced care--it is \nliterally of vital significance. Even after successful defibrillation, \nmany patients require more advanced treatment on the way to the \nhospital.\n  By passing this legislation, and increasing access to defibrillators, \nwe have the chance to strengthen the more important link in the chain \nof survival.\n  Communities across America are in dire need of better access to \ndefibrillators. Making AEDs widely available so that trained laypeople \ncan use them to administer shocks to cardiac arrest victims will go a \nlong way toward saving lives.\n  In fact, the American Heart Association estimates that over 50,000 \nlives could be saved each year if AEDs were more readily accessible.\n\n[[Page S3834]]\n\n  This next chart illustrates a startling statistic I mentioned a \nmoment ago--for every minute that passes a cardiac arrest victim is \ndefibrillated, the chance of survival falls by as much as 10 percent. \nAfter only eight minutes, the victims survival rate drops 60 percent.\n  Our legislation, the Access to Emergency Devices Act of 2000 takes a \ncommon sense approach to strengthen this chain of survival. This \nlegislation provides $25 million to expand access to devices that can \nsave lives across rural America.\n  It also provides for training grants to give people the training they \nneed to learn how to operate defibrillators.\n  And I have learned that training is very important, but also that \nnearly anyone can be taught to make proper use of a defibrillator.\n  Cities across America have begun to recognize the value of fast \naccess to defibrillators and are making them available to emergency \nresponders. This legislation recognizes that rural communities should \nhave the same chance to improve cardiac arrest survival rates.\n  Because the first emergency responders on the scene of a cardiac \narrest may not always be the medical responders, our legislation makes \nresources available to rural communities to purchase AEDs for police \nand fire as well as emergency response vehicles--and our bill also \nprovides funds for the training that will sustain the lifesaving effect \nof these grants.\n  Cardiac arrest can be a killer. But if we give people in rural \ncommunities a chance, they may be able to stop a cardiac arrest before \nit takes another life. Our bill is a simple and effective way to \nincrease the availability of defibrillators, and give rural victims of \ncardiac arrest a better chance of survival, and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to pass this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Allard, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Kennedy, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 2537. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to modify the \ntime for use by members of the Selected Reserve of entitlement to \ncertain educational assistance; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n                national guard and reserve education act\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I strongly believe we owe it to \nAmericans to provide them the best educational opportunities. And as a \nNavy veteran, I feel we owe our military greater access to education by \nproviding maximum flexibility to use the educational benefits they've \nbeen promised. Today, on behalf of Senators Allard, Bingaman, Kennedy, \nLeahy, and myself, I am introducing legislation that will provide more \ntime for our National Guard and Reserves to utilize their current \neducation benefits.\n  Education benefits have proven to be one of the more important \nbenefits offered by the U.S. military, both in terms of recruiting and \nretention, and as a means of upgrading the educational levels of our \nexisting force. Currently, members of our uniformed services receive \neducation assistance primarily through the successful Montgomery GI \nbill.\n  While the Montgomery GI bill goes a long way toward helping to \nfurther the education of our hardworking men and women serving in the \nuniformed services, there is an important gap in the number of years \nthey have to utilize these benefits. While active duty personnel are \nprovided education benefits for up to ten years after they separate \nfrom active duty, National Guard and Reserve personnel are only \nentitled to these benefits for the first ten years of their service and \nnot after they leave the service. Since our active duty servicemembers \ncurrently have up to ten years after they separate from active duty, \nthey are eligible to utilize their education assistance for up to \nthirty years (twenty years service plus ten). Our National Guard and \nReserve servicemembers' benefits currently end ten years from the date \nthey complete basic training.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would allow our National Guard \nand Reserves to use their Montgomery GI bill education benefits for the \nentire time they serve in the Selected Reserve. We are not asking for \nmore benefits, just greater flexibility in the servicemembers' choice \nof when to use the education benefits that are already approved for \nthem.\n  In addition, the Selected Reserve members who become disabled are \ncurrently allowed to use the GI bill education benefits only during the \nfirst ten years of service, regardless of what year they become \ndisabled. For example, if a servicemember becomes disabled during the \nfirst two years of service, he has eight more years of education \nassistance eligibility. But if he becomes disabled after nine years of \nservice, he would have one year of eligibility left. After ten years of \nservice, the National Guard and Reserve have no education benefits if \nthey become disabled.\n  This legislation would allow any unused portion of their 36 months of \nGI bill educational assistance to be utilized through the later of the \noriginal ten-year period of eligibility or a four-year period beginning \non the date the person is involuntarily separated from the Selected \nReserve. This adjustment also pertains to servicemembers whose unit is \ninactivated during a force drawdown if they have any unused months of \neducational assistance remaining.\n  As we have seen, our National Guard and Reserve continue to be tasked \nmore and more as our nation calls on them to support missions around \nthe world. The Selected Reserve makes up almost half of our Uniformed \nServices today. They, too, leave their families behind to meet the call \nof serving our nation. In addition, they leave their full-time \nemployers for months on end to perform their `part-time' jobs. This \nmakes it even more difficult for them to take advantage of employer-\nprovided opportunities to further their education. How can we continue \nto expect them to utilize their current Montgomery GI bill benefits \nwithin the current time limitations while being tasked to work two \njobs, maintain a family and deploy overseas on short notice? They've \nearned the right to have an equitable amoun6t of time to utilize their \nMontgomery GI bill educational assistance. This is the right thing to \ndo. I hope my colleague will join me in cosponsoring this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2537\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nthat will maintain the promised health benefits of a small group of \nretired coalminers and their widows--the\n\n[[Page S3835]]\n\nCoalminers and Widows Health Protection Act of 2000. Retired coalminers \nand their widows were promised lifetime health benefits by the \ncompanies they worked for and by the federal government more than a \nhalf century ago. This commitment goes back to 1946 when President \nTruman guaranteed miners they would have lifetime health benefits in \nexchange for their return to the mines. The promise was well understood \nin the coalfields, and reiterated in successive coal wage agreements \nthroughout the last half century. Congress affirmed that promise when \nit enacted the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefits Act in 1992 (as \npart of the Energy Policy Act) to protect the health benefits of about \n120,000 retirees and avoid a nationwide coal strike. The Coal Act has \nensured that a small group of retirees would continue to get the health \nbenefits that they earned and were promised for eight years now. There \nare now only about 65,000 miners and retirees remaining in the Fund--\n70% of whom are elderly widows of retired miners. Their average age is \n78 years old, and more than 45% of the population is over 80 years old.\n  Once again, in this new century, the health care of this small group \nof retired miners and widows is threatened due to both significantly \nincreased health care costs and a series of adverse court decisions. \nCongress must act this year to prevent a reduction in their health care \nbenefits. Last year, we faced the first shortfall in the trust fund \nthat pays for retired miners health benefits, and Congress responded. \nSenator Byrd and Congressman Rahall's leadership forestalled a health \ncare benefit cut. They included a stop-gap $68 million in last year's \nfinal omnibus Appropriations bill to avert a cut. If Congress fails to \nact this year, retired miners and their widows will be in imminent \ndanger of losing health benefits as early as next Spring.\n  I am glad to report to my colleagues that the Clinton/Gore \nAdministration recognized the need to shore up the retired miners' \nhealth fund and included in its budget a number of provisions that \ntogether secure miners' benefits well into the next decade. The Coal \nAct related provisions in the President's budget are based on one \npremise--these retired miners were promised lifetime health benefits \nand a promise made must be a promise kept. The Administration strongly \nreaffirmed the federal government's commitment to retired miners and \ntheir widows by proposing to transfer $346 million in new monies over \nthe next ten years to the Combined Benefit Fund to ensure there will be \nno benefit cuts. The Administration's budget also clarified a few \nprovisions of the Coal Act to avoid unnecessary litigation about the \nclear meaning of the statute. The Coalminers and Widows Health \nProtection Act does not include all of the Administration's proposed \nsolutions for jurisdictional and practical reasons, but I am very \ngrateful for their comprehensive solution to maintaining promised \nbenefits, and believe each of their proposed remedies deserve serious \nconsideration by Congress.\n  The Coalminers and Widows Health Protection Act does three things. It \nprovides for an annual mandatory transfer of general funds to the \nCombined Benefit Fund to maintain its long term solvency and prevent a \nreduction in miners' health benefits. The annual transfers are set at a \nlevel to avoid any reduction in benefits and amount to $346 million \nover ten years. This bill also clarifies two aspects of the Coal Act to \nresolve disputed or misunderstood provisions of the law. The first \nclarification involves the timing of Social Security Administration's \nassignment of retired miners to the companies that had employed them \nand promised to finance their lifetime health benefits. The second \nclarification involves assignments to successors-in-interest of coal \ncompanies that had agreed to finance lifetime health benefits, as well \nas to the successors-in-interest of persons related to those companies, \nwhich is explicitly provided for in the Act. These clarifications will \navoid further unneeded litigation expenses. These two clarifications do \nnot score for the purposes of determining the cost of enacting them to \nthe federal government.\n  I want to report to my colleagues that there is a bipartisan, \nbicameral process underway to determine how we can best shore up the \nminers' trust fund. Staff are meeting regularly. Chairman Roth has \ninformed me that he is committed to finding a way to preserve these \npromised benefits, and I welcome his strong support, as well as that of \nSenator Moynihan and several other Members of the Finance Committee who \nare actively involved in this process.\n  One hundred thousand coalminers were killed while working in the \nmines last century. Nearly another hundred thousand suffered \ndebilitating job related illnesses. This bill will give retired miners \nand their widows the health security they were promised and deserve. We \nowe them that security. They earned it. And you can rest assured that \nas Congress deals with the priority issues of funding government \nfunctions and operations through the annual budget process, and as \nproposed tax cuts and other legislative items are contemplated, I \nintend to see to it that we meet our responsibilities to retired \ncoalminers.\n  There are about 20,000 thousand retired miners and their widows \nliving in West Virginia--and tens of thousands of more living in \nvirtually every state of the Union. The Coalminers and Widows Health \nProtection Act will tell them that they can count on their health care \nbenefits being there for them when they need them, just as they were \npromised.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2538\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the National Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal\n\n[[Page S3836]]\n\nYear 1998 with respect to export controls on high performance \ncomputers; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n   national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1998 amendments\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bipartisan bill \nthat is critical to maintaining our nation's lead in the high-tech \nsector. In specific, this bill is crucial to the computer industry. \nThis is an issue that I have been very interested in for quite some \ntime, and in particular, have done a lot of work on this session.\n  I first want to talk a little bit about the U.S. computer industry. \nAccording to an article in Computers Today, dated July 19, 1998, \nAmerican computer technology has led the world since the first \ncommercial electronic computer was deployed at the University of \nPennsylvania in 1946.\n  This industry is constantly changing with new companies and new \nproducts emerging every day. A statistic that I find fascinating is \nthat more than 75 percent of the revenues of computer companies come \nfrom products that did not exist two years before. That statistic is \nfrom the CSPP Freedom to Grow.\n  Through research and development, another issue I strongly favor, the \ncomputer industry has been able to remain competitive for all of these \nyears.\n  The challenge that we not face, and frankly a challenge that we \nhaven't lived up to in the past as a Congress, is to allow our export \ncontrol policies to change with the times, and not to overly restrict \nour nation's computer companies.\n  We need to stop trying to control technology that is readily \navailable, as we are doing today. The technology that we are regulating \nis readily available from many foreign companies. Companies from \ncountries like China and other Tier 3 countries.\n  I remember, not too long ago, I was able to secure funding for a \nSuper-Computer for the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. That computer, \nwhich required its own room, is now about as powerful as a laptop \ncomputer. That is exactly the kind of computer that we are still \nregulating.\n  Computers that are now considered Super-Computers operate at more \nthan one million MTOPS, or about 500 times the current level of \nregulation.\n  The bottom line is that by placing artificially low limits on the \nlevel of technology that can be exported, we may be denying market \nrealities and could very quickly cripple America's global \ncompetitiveness for this vital industry. If Congress doesn't act \nquickly, we will substantially disadvantage American companies in an \nextremely competitive global market.\n  Mr. President. On February 1, 2000, at my urging, and the urging of \nothers in this body, President Clinton proposed changes to the United \nStates export controls on high-performance computers. Since that \naccouncement, the President's proposal has been floating around \nCongress for a mandated 180 days, or six month, review period. When the \nPresident made his proposal, the new levels would have been sufficient, \nhowever, we are still regulating under the old levels, and therfore \nhindering American companies from competing in Tier 3 countries with \nother foreign companies.\n  The bill that I am offering today simply reduces the congressional \nreview period from 180 days to 30 days to complement the \nadministration's easing of export restrictions, by amending the \nNational Defense Authorization Act of 1998.\n  I appreciate the recent bipartisan support of this bill and I look \nforward to debating this bill on the Senate floor in the near future.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, today Senator Harry Reid of Nevada and I \nare introducing bipartisan legislation with respect to the review \nperiod for the sale of high-performance computers. Both Senator Reid \nand I were hoping this legislation would not be necessary. We had \nplanned it as an amendment to the Export Administration Act, but that \nact, for a variety of reasons, has been stalled here on the floor, and \nthe issue is so important that we don't want to let it die. We are \nintroducing this legislation in order to keep the issue alive and, if \nnecessary, to provide a vehicle for producing the review that we think \nis necessary.\n  Let me display a chart that demonstrates what is happening in the \nhigh-tech world of business computers. These are not the computers that \nwe carry back and forth on the planes. You and I, as we fly back to our \nhomes, have laptops and those laptops have amazing capabilities in them \nand represent the changes that are occurring in the computer world.\n  If I can be personal for just a moment, at one point in my career, I \nwas the head of a company that was grandly called the American Computer \nCorporation. We produced, among other products, a computer that was \nabout the size of a washing machine. We were very proud of it. It had \n10 megabytes of hard disc memory in it, and it sold for about $35,000. \nIt was literally built in a garage, and we sold every single one we \ncould make.\n  Today, I have in my hand a computer that costs less than $500, which \nhas far more power and capacity than that old machine we were so proud \nof, with its 10 megabytes of hard disc. The laptop I carry with me back \nand forth between here and Utah has more computing power in it today \nthan the computers that controlled the space shuttle.\n  I have been down to Cape Canaveral to the Kennedy Space Center. I \nhave seen the space shuttle. The space shuttle computers that control \nthe flight of that at this time are very highly technical instruments \nand are built throughout the entire airplane. They take up so much room \nthat they are part of the superstructure of the airplane itself. Today, \nthere is more computing power in the laptop that I carry than there is \nin that whole airplane.\n  This is a manifestation of what the people in the computer world call \nMoore's law. Mr. Moore was one of the first CEOs of Intel. He \npropounded over 20 years ago Moore's law which says that every 18 \nmonths, the power of computers doubles for the same price; so that \nevery 18 months, the computer that you had 18 months ago is now \nobsolete and the new one is twice as fast. Then, 18 months later the \nnew one will be twice as fast as that one was. And 18 months later, the \nnext new one will be twice as fast, and so on. Moore's law has held for \nover 20 years. Every 18 months the power of the computer doubles.\n  Moore's law doesn't hold anymore--not because the power of the \ncomputer is not doubling but because the power of the computer is \ndoubling in less than 18 months. It is doubling faster than Moore \nprojected in Moore's law.\n  This chart demonstrates what is happening in the world with what we \ncall ``business computers.'' These are computers that are roughly the \nsize of that old computer we produced that was the size of a washing \nmachine, or a college refrigerator. Only now, these computers have the \npower and capacity that we used to think of in terms of the giant \nsupercomputers that would fill this room.\n  Thereby hangs the issue that has caused me and Senator Reid to join \ntogether and introduce this piece of legislation.\n  When supercomputers, the huge machines that could do an enormous \namount of computation work, were first invented, it was a matter of \nnational security that they be kept out of the hands of America's \nenemies. So it was established by legislation that there would be a \nlimit on the size of computers that could be exported because we wanted \nto make sure the supercomputers stayed in American hands.\n  The limit that was placed on supercomputers was at the level of 8,000 \nMTOPS. I don't mean to be overly technical here, but we need to \nunderstand what we are talking about. MTOPS is an acronym for millions \nof theoretical operations per second.\n  How many theoretical operations or calculations can the computer \nperform in a second? How many millions can it perform in a second?\n  At the time this legislation was put in place, it said anything over \n8 trillion theoretical operations per second constituted a \nsupercomputer, and therefore it had to be protected from export. It had \nto be held in the United States, for national security purposes. We \nwere the only country in the world that had a computer that could \napproach 8 trillion MTOPS, or millions of theoretical operations per \nsecond.\n  That was then. This is now.\n  I hold in my hand a device that is produced here in America by Intel \nthat\n\n[[Page S3837]]\n\ncontains eight chips. And therein lies the tale that I want to talk \nabout today.\n  Just think of this. This, by the way, retails for about $900. It is \npart of the mother board of a traditional business computer today. The \nmother board is about 2 feet square. This fits on the mother board with \nall of the other chips that are in it. But this is the controller of \nall of that. And it has in it eight tiny chips.\n\n  Here is the marketplace for this kind of computer worldwide. We have \nthe figures.\n  In 1997, worldwide, it is a little over 2 million.\n  You see in the blue down below is the market in the United States, \nand the green is overseas. You can see that the market overseas is \nbigger than the market in the United States.\n  The chart marches on with projections made by the Gartner Group out \nof Connecticut to the year 2002. We see, roughly speaking, that in that \n5-year period--from 1997 to 2002--this market will quadruple. We are \ntalking hundreds of billions of dollars per year of market.\n  I want that understood as the matrix of what we are talking about \nhere.\n  This is the size of the market for a product of which this is the \nheart.\n  Now let's talk about it in terms of export control on MTOPS.\n  I hope we can tie all of these together. I realize this is a little \ntechnical. But understand when the legislation was passed, anything \nthat had more than 8,000 MTOPS in it could not be exported, and \ntherefore could not be sold in the green part of that bar.\n  Let's look at what is happening as Moore's law becomes obsolete as \nthe power of computers increases more rapidly.\n  Here is a blowup of this device as it existed in 1999, less than 6 \nmonths ago.\n  A Pentium III chip carries with it 1,283 MTOPS. So if you had one of \nthese with one Pentium III chip in it, you could export it. If you put \ntwo Pentium chips in it, you could export it because it doubles to \n2,383. If you put four Pentium chips in it, doubling it again, you went \nto 4,584. But when you doubled that by putting eight chips in it, it \ncannot be exported now because it is over 8,000 MTOPS.\n  In 1999, this was a product that could be purchased in the United \nStates by anybody, carried out the door, or installed, if you are \nbuying it for your business, by the people who are providing for you. \nBut it cannot be sold overseas without a review of the export license. \nBecause we were so anxious to make sure that these computers didn't get \ninto the wrong hands, the export license time for review of this was \n180 days, or 6 months. That meant that an American manufacturer who \ntook one of these processors from Intel, put eight chips in it, and put \nit in his computer, could sell it anywhere he wanted to in America but \ncould not export it for 180 days.\n  What happened in that 180 days while he was waiting for export \napproval?\n  Let's look at where we are now in the year 2000.\n  In that 180-day period where you are waiting for export approval, the \nItamium chip has been developed and come on the market. It has 6,131 \nMTOPS in one chip. If you are going to export this product, you can \nonly have one chip in it. If you put two in it, you are immediately \nclose to 12,000 MTOPS. If you put in four, you are at 23,000 MTOPS. \nAnd, if you put in the standard eight that this carries, you are at \n47,000 MTOPS.\n  The administration has proposed raising the 8,000 MTOPS level to \n25,000, which clearly doesn't do you any good. The technology is moving \nso rapidly that you can buy 25,000 just as quickly as you can buy \n8,000.\n  This is where we are today.\n  If you had applied for an export license with Pentium chips last year \nand waited 67 months, by the time you got your 6-month approval, you \nwould be facing this kind of competition, and no one would want your \nPentium chip. They would want one with the Itamium chip. You say, all \nright. I will put up with the 6 months, and I will apply for this \ncomputer with eight Itamium 2000 chips.\n  What is ahead of you if you do that? Looking ahead to 2001 with the \nItamium 2001 chip, this is what you are facing. That chip will do 9,198 \nMTOPS all by itself. Even one chip in this one makes it illegal to \nexport without waiting 180 days for approval. Go to the normal eight \nchips, and you are at 70,000 MTOPS.\n\n  To those who say: Good heavens, we are exporting or allowing people \nto buy supercomputers that can do all of the command and control \ndecisions for an entire defense system, we are in terrible trouble, we \nare giving away our secrets; I say in the Defense Department we still \nhave supercomputers that are currently running at the rate of 2 million \nMTOPS. For those supercomputers, these things are child's play. By the \ntime we get to 70,000 MTOPS in a computer of the kind in my hand, the \nsupercomputers will have gone up from 2 million to as high as 30 \nmillion. That is the speed with which all of this is happening.\n  What are we proposing in this legislation? Simply this: We are saying \napproval can be granted within 30 days. We are taking it from 6 months \ndown to 1.\n  Why do I pick 30 days, along with Senator Reid? We look at the export \ncontrols--which, again, are there to protect America's secrets--and we \nfind that 30 days is currently the timeframe for an F-16. If a foreign \ngovernment wants to buy our most sophisticated aircraft, we take 30 \ndays to determine whether or not that particular aircraft in the hands \nof that particular government produces some kind of threat to national \nsecurity. Yet we will take 6 months to decide whether that government \ncan buy a computer that is available in virtually every technology \ncenter anywhere in the United States. They can buy it in the United \nStates, throw it on the airplane, and take it abroad themselves.\n  Somebody could say: Gee, that is illegal to take abroad. What kind of \nsecrecy and control is it when one can buy it on the street in the \nUnited States, any citizen can buy it as easily as they could buy one \nof these, but for some reason we can't allow them to export it?\n  There is another factor to recognize. We are not operating in a \nvacuum. There are Japanese companies that can do this. There are French \ncompanies that can do this. There are German companies that can can do \nthis. If we say American companies can't do this, we just guarantee the \nrest of the world will get this market. Remember those lines on that \nbar chart showing the foreign market is bigger than the American \nmarket? We are guaranteeing the rest of the world will take this market \naway from the United States as we sit here with our 180-day review \nperiod, saying in effect no American company can get into this business \nat all, because in that 180-day period everyone overseas will have \nbought foreign and not bought American.\n  It is vitally important that we recognize the reality of what is \nhappening in the computer world, we bring the date necessary for review \ndown to a reasonable period of time, and we say, if you want to buy one \nof these from Intel with eight Itanium 2001 chips in it, it will not \ntake any more time for you to do that than it will take you to buy an \nF-16. That is the reasonable, intelligent thing to do. That is what the \nlegislation of Senator Reid and myself seeks to establish.\n  I hope it is not necessary for our bill ever to be considered or \npassed. I hope the export administration bill comes back on the floor \nand Senator Reid and I can offer our bill as an amendment to that bill \nand see it adopted by the Senate and sent to the President as rapidly \nas possible. Just in case that does not happen, by introducing this \nbill on behalf of Senator Reid and myself today, I am making clear we \nhave a backup somewhere in the legislative channel to which we can turn \nto try to make it logical and possible for American computer \nmanufacturers and American chip manufacturers to continue America's \nleadership in this market.\n  Make no mistake, we are talking hundreds of billions of dollars where \nAmerica currently has the technological leadership in the world. That \nleadership is now threatened by Government regulations. It is \nimperative we change those regulations on the floor of the Senate, if \npossible, working with the administration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Kerrey, and Mr. Murkowski):\n\n[[Page S3838]]\n\n  S. 2540. A bill to amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to require the \nSecretary of Agriculture to establish a carbon sequestration program to \npermit owners and operators of land to enroll the land in the program \nto increase the sequestration of carbon, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n             Domestic Carbon Storage Incentive Act of 2000\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that I \nthink is going to be a significant issue for U.S. agriculture and the \nenvironment both. It's the Domestic Carbon Storage Incentive Act of \n2000. I am putting forward a concept that is being talked about more \nand more, a concept called carbon farming, where we encourage the \nagriculture industry to farm in such a way that the plant life pulls \nCO2 out of the air, fixes carbon in the ground, releases \noxygen in an ever-increasing amount. There are farming techniques that \ncan fix or sequester more carbon in the ground. What we are doing with \nthis bill is encouraging more of that carbon sequestration, pulling \nmore of the CO2 out of the air thus reducing some of the \ngreenhouse gases that are in the air, whether they are there by natural \nor man-made sources. It is a win for the environment and it is a win \nfor agriculture, I think it is a very positive thing we can do in \nencouraging good agricultural stewardship and good environmentalism.\n  With this bill we are providing financial incentives to landowners \nwho increase conservation practices which, as I describe, help pull \ncarbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and store it as carbon in the \nsoil. This bill seeks to encourage the positive contributions to the \nenvironment made by the agriculture industry. I am joined in this bill \nby my friend, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska and Senator Murkowski of \nAlaska along with a number of others.\n  For some time now I have been looking at a way for a way to approach \nenvironmental issues from an incentive-based proactive stance. I think \nit is important we break away from the regulatory model we have been in \non the environment. We have basically said all sticks on this: If you \ndo this we are going to do this to you on environmental rules and \nissues. It has all been a regulatory approach. I think it is important \nwe engage the markets and create an incentive approach, and that is \nwhat this bill does. I believe we are on the verge of seeing \nagriculture come into a whole new market with this type of approach, an \nenvironmental market where producers will benefit rather than be \nburdened by environmental concerns.\n  U.S. agriculture has long been appreciated for its ability to feed \nthe world. As any good farmer knows, in order to grow good crops you \nmust take care of the land, be a steward of the land. Farmers take this \nrole very seriously. My family farms. My dad and my brother are both \nfull-time farmers. But sometimes markets and economic stress make \nconservation very difficult to pursue. This bill would help offset some \nof the costs to expand conservation practices.\n  It is this sort of eco-agriculture that we should encourage and \nenhance to deal with environmental concerns, rather than resorting to \ngovernmental regulations and mandates to solve our problems. Farmers \nwant to do the right thing. They have more reason than anybody else to \npreserve and protect the land, the land and the water and the air--but \nGovernment and markets do not always make that job very easy.\n  I applaud my colleague, Senator Roberts, for all the work he has done \nin this area. His bill that he has to enhance carbon sequestration \nresearch has called needed attention to a very important area, the \nresearch work that we need to do about what practices fix the most \ncarbon into the ground and what ones are the most helpful to the \natmosphere. These two approaches, working together, the research on how \nwe can do it better and more of it, along with more incentives to put \nthat research into practice, I think are a good tandem.\n\n  Why do we do this? Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas believed to \ncontribute to global warming. While there is debate over the role which \nhuman activity plays in speeding up the warming process, there is broad \nconsensus that there are increased carbon levels in the atmosphere \ntoday. Until now, the only real approach seriously considered to \naddress climate change was an international treaty which calls for \nemission limits on carbon dioxide, which would mean limiting the amount \nthat comes from your car, your business and your farm.\n  The Kyoto treaty also favored exempting developing nations from \nemissions limits, putting the U.S. economy at a distinct disadvantage. \nApproaching the issue of climate change in this fashion would be very \ncostly and would not respond to the global nature of this problem \nbecause they are exempting several countries already.\n  Instead, the approach I am putting forward encourages offsetting \ngreenhouse gases through improved land management and conservation. As \na result, these practices will also lead to better water quality, less \nrunoff pollution, better wildlife habitat, and an additional revenue \nsource for farmers. It truly is one of those win-win propositions for \nthe environment and for agriculture.\n  Specifically, my bill will allow landowners to submit plans detailing \npractices they would be willing to undertake to store additional carbon \nin the soil. These plans would then compete for entrance into the \nprogram, with the best plans achieving funding. Verification of this \nprogram would be similar to current conservation programs, such as the \nEnvironmental Quality Incentives Program where farmers need only comply \nwith the practices they set forth in the contract. The program is \nlimited to 5 million acres and is not a setaside. Rather, this bill \nencourages conservation practices such as no-till farming, buffer \nstrips, and biomass production, to name a few, which are known to \nenhance the soil's ability to store carbon.\n  Under this program, contracts will be for a minimum of 10 years and \nUSDA will be required, in conjunction with other agencies and land \ngrant universities, to finalize criteria for measuring the carbon-\nstoring ability of various conservation practices. This objective will \nbe greatly enhanced by the organizations such as Kansas State \nUniversity in my home State, which have conducted significant research \nalready on ways that various carbon-storing practices occur in \nagriculture.\n\n  Agriculture can play a substantial role in protecting the environment \nif we put these incentives forward. One might ask, is there benefit to \ncarbon storage? Are we talking about significant numbers? Listen to \nsome of these numbers. The total carbon sequestration and fossil fuel \noffset potential of U.S. croplands is currently estimated at 154 \nmillion metric tons of carbon per year, or 133 percent of the total \ngreenhouse gas emissions by all these activities. In other words, even \ncurrent agricultural croplands have the ability to store carbon in the \nsoil. Imagine how much more this process can be enhanced if a focused \neffort is made.\n  Early estimates indicate that the potential for a carbon market for \nU.S. agriculture could reach $5 billion per year for the next 30 to 40 \nyears. Carbon markets are already emerging in the private sector with \nfarmers selling their carbon-storing practices to utilities. There is a \nConsortium for Agriculture Soils Mitigation of Greenhouse Gases that is \nmarketing this already.\n  Farmers are already beginning to look toward carbon sequestration or \ncarbon farming practices as a potential new market. Between 1998 and \n1999, Iowa farmers grew and harvested 4,000 tons of switchgrass for use \nby a utility. These farmers not only benefit from the sale of the \nbiomass commodity itself but are able to sell the additional benefit \nthey are providing in growing the switchgrass, which is carbon \nsequestration. This bill will allow all farmers to progress toward \nverification\n\n[[Page S3839]]\n\nand potential sale of carbon benefits to third parties.\n  The estimated amount of carbon stored in world soils is more than \ntwice the carbon living in vegetation or in the atmosphere. \nApproximately 50 percent of the soil organic carbon has been lost from \nthe soil over a period of 50 to 100 years of cultivation. This loss \nrepresents the potential for storage of carbon in the soil.\n  In the tall grass prairie located in Kansas, Kansas State University \nresearchers have demonstrated an increase of approximately 2 tons of \ncarbon per acre through increased conservation practices--2 tons \nadditional carbon pulled out of the air and put into the ground per \nacre. That demonstrates the potential in rangeland soils, and there are \nalready a number of agricultural practices which enhance carbon \nsequestration.\n  Obviously, carbon sequestration has a lot to offer as an \nenvironmental and agricultural policy. It is something that can provide \na win-win situation for the environment and agriculture as we look \nforward to an era of another income source and a good way the \nenvironment and agriculture can work together.\n  Mr. President, I introduce the bill on behalf of myself, Mr. Kerrey, \nMr. Murkowski, and a number of other cosponsors.\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Domestic \nCarbon Storage Incentive Act of 2000 with Senators Brownback and \nMurkowski. Agriculture must play a major role in any climate change \nplan, since it is an important part of both the cause and the solution. \nWhile the facts about global warming are not all clear, what is clear \nis that global warming is occurring. What is also clear is that human \nactivities are emitting increasingly large volumes of greenhouse gases, \nand that these gases are influencing global warming.\n  Carbon sequestration, that is pulling carbon from the air into the \nsoil, is an important part of fighting global warming, and agriculture \nis one of the largest and most economical carbon ``sinks.'' Farmers and \nranchers can store additional carbon in the soil fairly easily, using \nbest management practices such as no-till farming, increased production \nof high carbon-storing crops, and increased use of winter cover crops. \nStoring carbon in the soil is not only good for the environment, it is \nalso advantageous for soil quality and agriculture production. I am \npleased that farmers and ranchers are beginning to realize that carbon \nsequestration is a win-win situation. Agriculture is sometimes hesitant \nto adopt change, however, and it is important to provide producers with \nthe opportunity to fully utilize carbon-storing techniques.\n  This bill will give agriculture producers added financial incentive \nto adopt these best management practices. Unlike CRP, the land will not \nbe a set-aside, but rather these practices will be used on land in \nproduction. This program will be completely voluntary, with farmers \ncompeting for entrance into the program by proposing specific plans to \nstore more carbon in their land. The best plans will be awarded ten-\nyear contracts with payments no greater than twenty dollars per acre \neach year.\n  Some farmers have expressed concern about using these carbon-storing \ntechniques on their land, however, because current studies only involve \nsmall experimental plots. This legislation will implement carbon \nsequestration practices on whole farms, both to gather more data on \nbeneficial techniques and to set examples for other farmers to follow.\n  While measuring carbon storage is a difficult task, the most direct \nmeans of determining soil carbon sequestration is to measure, over \ntime, sequential changes in the soil. At a recent Senate Agriculture \nSubcommittee hearing, several scientists and policy-makers advocated a \ngreater need for more research and more data. This program will provide \nactual data from different soil types across the nation, furthering our \ncollective knowledge of causes and solutions to global warming.\n  The Domestic Carbon Storage Incentive Act is an important step in \nmoving agriculture's role in fighting climate change forward. Carbon \nsequestration will benefit everyone: farmers, ranchers, the \nenvironment, and society. This bill will serve a public good, valued \nfar above the cost of the program. Congress has the opportunity to take \naction to combat global warming, and I hope that the Senate can begin \nto achieve this goal by acting on this sound legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n        Akaka, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Biden, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \n        Bryan, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Durbin, \n        Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Graham, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hollings, Mr. \n        Inouye, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        Levin, Mrs. Lincoln, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Reed, Mr. \n        Reid, Mr. Robb, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Schumer, and \n        Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 2541. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide a prescription drug benefit for the aged and disabled under the \nMedicare Program, to enhance the preventative benefits covered under \nsuch program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n         medicare expansion for needed drugs (mend) act of 2000\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with 34 of our \nSenate Democratic colleagues in introducing the Medicare Expansion for \nNeeded Drugs Act, a bill to mend Medicare by adding a long overdue \nprescription drug benefit.\n  I want to begin by thanking all the people who have brought us to \nthis point.\n  Senator Dorgan and many of our other colleagues have held numerous \nhearings in Washington, and around the country on the issue of Medicare \nprescription drug coverage. I thank my colleagues and all who came to \nthe hearings.\n  I know that they heard from people at those hearings they would not \nhave otherwise heard from. The testimony they heard was virtually \nunanimous at each of these hearings, that Medicare must now, this year, \nbe expanded to include necessary coverage.\n  I also thank all of the seniors, pharmacists, doctors, and others who \ntook the time to educate us on this important matter. Their wisdom has \nmade this a better bill.\n  In addition, I thank the President--for keeping the issue of Medicare \nprescription drugs on the national agenda, and for providing the \nframework for our proposal.\n  I thank the many organizations representing seniors and consumers who \ntold us about the terrible strain paying for prescription drugs places \non seniors and their families.\n  Most of all, I thank the many seniors from all across America who \ntold us about their struggles to pay for prescription drugs.\n  I want to share with you one example from my State.\n  Fran Novotny is a 70-year-old retired nurse from Hill City, SD. She \ntakes prescription medications every day to control diabetes, \nhypertension, and asthma. She has also had bypass surgery.\n  Every month, she gets a Social Security check for $616.\n  Every month, she spends about $550 on prescriptions.\n  She has a small pension, but it doesn't add up to much. So she is \nquickly depleting her entire life savings. After it is gone, she has no \nidea how she will pay for her medications.\n  Her story, and many others like it, are the reason we must move \nforward and enact a Medicare prescription drug benefit this year. We \nmust make sure that Fran Novotny--and the millions of seniors like \nher--can afford their prescriptions--and their grocery bills and their \nrent and their clothing and their utility bills.\n  The average Medicare beneficiary fills 18 prescriptions a year.\n  Yet three-in-five Medicare beneficiaries lack decent, dependable \ncoverage for prescription drugs. And more than one-third of all \nMedicare beneficiaries--more than 15 million seniors--have no \nprescription drug coverage at all.\n  This is not a problem faced only by the poorest beneficiaries. More \nthan half of all Medicare beneficiaries without coverage have incomes \nabove 150 percent of poverty,\n\n[[Page S3840]]\n\n  That is why two-thirds of the Democratic caucus has joined in \nintroducing this bill to make prescription drug coverage available and \naffordable to all Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Our plan is universal.\n  Every single Medicare beneficiary who wants the coverage has it under \nthis bill.\n  Second, our plan is voluntary.\n  It is not a requirement that you sign up for this legislation. If you \nhave a good plan, use it. If you have a good company, stay with it. If \nyou have a plan that works for you, for whatever reason, this plan \nencourages you to stay right where you are. But if you do not have \ncoverage, if you need coverage and cannot get it anywhere else, this \nbill will make it available to you for the first time.\n  Every Medicare beneficiary can choose to participate, whether he or \nshe is in traditional, fee-for-service Medicare or a Medicare Plus \nChoice plan. Retirees who already have private prescription drug \ncoverage can keep it. It is up to them.\n  We also provide incentives to employers to provide and maintain drug \ncoverage. We do not want to see the people who are now providing it to \ntheir employees or retirees dropping these people once this plan \nbecomes available, so we have encouraged, we have incentivized \nbusinesses to do that.\n  Our plan provides meaningful coverage.\n  Medicare would cover half of beneficiaries' discounted prescription \ndrug bills, up to $5,000 a year. That means that Fran Novotny--who \nspends $550 a month on prescription drugs--would be able to save at \nleast $275 a month. That $275 a month will make a real difference in \nher life.\n  Our plan also provides catastrophic coverage for people who need to \ntake very expensive drugs that can cost $5,000, or $10,000 a year, or \nmore. It is our hope that after a Medicare beneficiary has paid the \nfirst $3,000 or $4,000 in catastrophic care costs, Medicare would pick \nup the balance.\n  Our program is also affordable.\n  Beneficiaries would pay premiums to cover about half the cost of the \nprogram. Medicare would contribute the other half.\n  Seniors with incomes between 135 percent and 150 percent of poverty \nwould receive assistance with their premiums. Those with incomes below \n135 percent of poverty would receive assistance with premiums and \ncopays.\n  Our plan would give seniors bargaining power that they just don't \nhave today.\n  The problem today isn't just that seniors end up paying out-of-pocket \nexpenses for their prescriptions, they also pay a lot more for those \nout-of-pocket costs. On average, seniors pay twice as much for their \nmedications as big insurance companies and HMOs do today.\n  The fact that seniors face the highest prices at the drugstore is, \nfrankly, wrong. Our plan gives seniors the bargaining power that comes \nwith numbers.\n  Another thing our plan does--which is very important to many of us in \nrural areas--is to include special protections to make sure that \nMedicare beneficiaries who live in rural communities have the same \naffordable, timely access to prescription drugs as everyone else.\n  It gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to \noffer pharmacists incentives to cover rural communities and other hard-\nto-serve areas. Every American should be able to get affordable \nprescription drugs--when they need them--whether they live in a big \ncity or a small town.\n  Our plan mirrors the best practices used in the private sector.\n  For beneficiaries in traditional Medicare, prescription drug coverage \nwould be delivered by private entities that negotiate prices with drug \nmanufacturers. This is the same mechanism used by private insurers.\n  Beneficiaries in Medicare Plus Choice plans would get their \nprescription drug coverage through their Plus Choice plan.\n  Finally, the bill recognizes that we need to shift the focus of \nMedicare from simply treating illness, to keeping beneficiaries well.\n  While prescription drug coverage is an important first step in this \neffort, there are likely other changes we should make. So this bill \nsets up a process for Congress to consider further benefit changes--to \nenhance prevention--on an expedited basis. I want to thank Senator \nGraham for his leadership on this important issue.\n  On the issue of broader Medicare reform, I would like to see \nprescription drugs pass as part of a larger package of reforms and \nmodernizations, and I believe this bill and its benefit is consistent \nwith such efforts.\n  I'm also pleased to report that our bill is supported by an array of \nimportant groups: The National Council of Senior Citizens; the \nCommittee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare; National Council on \nthe Aging; the Older Women's League; the AFL-CIO; The National \nCommunity Pharmacists Association; Families USA; Consumers Union; the \nLeadership Council of Aging Organizations; the Association for Homes \nand Services for the Aging; the National Association of Area Agencies \non Aging; and AARP.\n  We hope we will have support from our Republican colleagues, too.\n  Prescription drug coverage for all seniors is an issue on which we \ncannot afford to procrastinate. The cost of delay is too great--in lost \nopportunities, lost health, and lost lives.\n  In 1965, when Medicare was created, it didn't include prescription \ndrug coverage. Neither did most private insurance plans. Today, \nvirtually all private health plans offer some sort of prescription drug \ncoverage--but not Medicare.\n  It is time--it is past time--to close this gap. Prescription drugs \nare an integral part of medicine today. They ought to be an integral \npart of Medicare. Period.\n  Now--before the Baby Boomers retire, and the problems are still \nmanageable--is the time to strengthen Medicare. Now, while our economy \nis strong, and we have a surplus, is the time to add a universal, \nvoluntary, and affordable prescription drug benefit to Medicare.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at this point the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2541\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Prescription drug coverage was not a standard part of \n     health insurance when the medicare program under title XVIII \n     of the\n\n[[Page S3841]]\n\n     Social Security Act was enacted in 1965. Since 1965, however, \n     drug coverage has become a key component of most private and \n     public health insurance coverage, except for the medicare \n     program.\n       (2) At least \\2/3\\ of medicare beneficiaries have \n     unreliable, inadequate, or no drug coverage at all.\n       (3) Seniors who do not have drug coverage typically pay, at \n     a minimum, 15 percent more than people with coverage.\n       (4) Medicare beneficiaries at all income levels lack \n     prescription drug coverage, with more than \\1/2\\ of such \n     beneficiaries having incomes greater than 150 percent of the \n     poverty line.\n       (5) The number of private firms offering retiree health \n     coverage is declining.\n       (6) Medigap premiums for drugs are too expensive for most \n     beneficiaries and are highest for older senior citizens, who \n     need prescription drug coverage the most and typically have \n     the lowest incomes.\n       (7) The management of a medicare prescription drug benefit \n     should mirror the practices employed by private entities in \n     delivering prescription drugs. Discounts should be achieved \n     through competition.\n       (8) All medicare beneficiaries should have access to a \n     voluntary, reliable, affordable outpatient drug benefit as \n     part of the medicare program that assists with the high cost \n     of prescription drugs and protects them against excessive \n     out-of-pocket costs.\n       (9) The addition of a medicare drug benefit should be \n     consistent with an overall plan to strengthen and modernize \n     the medicare program.\n\n               TITLE I--PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT PROGRAM\n\n     SEC. 101.

Medicare is a guarantee of affordable health care for every \nsenior citizen, but that promise is being broken every day because \nMedicare does not cover prescription drugs. The need is urgent. Too \nmany elderly citizens face an impossible choice between food on the \ntable and medicine they need to stay healthy or to treat their \nillnesses. They take half the pills their doctors prescribe, or do not \neven fill a needed prescription at all because they cannot afford the \nhigh cost of the prescription.\n  They pay twice as much for the drugs they need because they pay full \nprice, while almost everyone with private insurance pays less because \nof negotiated discounts. Too many seniors end up in the hospital at \nimmense cost to Medicare because they cannot afford the drugs they \nneed, or can't afford to take them correctly.\n  Opponents say we cannot afford this coverage, in spite of the budget \nsurplus. The issue is priorities. Health care for the elderly is more \nimportant than new tax breaks for the wealthy.\n  Others say this coverage should be available only to the elderly who \nare poor. But senior citizens want Medicare, not welfare. They should \nnot be forced into poverty in order to obtain the medications they \nneed.\n  The ongoing revolution in health care makes this coverage more \nessential now than ever. Coverage of prescription drugs under Medicare \nis as critical today as coverage of hospital and doctor care. Senior \ncitizens need help now. The President knows it, Democrats and the House \nand Senate know it, senior citizens know it, and so do their children \nand grandchildren.\n  Congress should listen to their choices. The time for excuses is \nover. The time for action is now.\n  I will take a few moments of the Senate's time to review where we are \non the issue of Medicare and Medicare coverage. This chart shows the \nnumber of senior citizens who have prescription drug coverage.\n\n       Senior citizens lack affordable, reliable, quality \n     coverage.\n\n  The only group of senior citizens who have coverage today that is \nreliable, affordable, and dependable are the 4 million seniors covered \nunder Medicaid. Today, we have 12 million senior citizens who \neffectively have no coverage at all; that is a third of all of our \nsenior citizens. Eleven million seniors have employer sponsored \ncoverage, and I will come back to that because employer sponsored \ncoverage is disappearing.\n  Three million seniors have coverage under Medicare HMOs, 4 million \nare covered under Medigap--and we will examine that particular \nphenomenon--4 million under Medicaid, and 3 million now switched plans \nduring the year or have other coverage.\n  We have a about a third who have no coverage whatsoever. Another \nthird have employer-sponsored coverage, but we are finding that this \ncoverage is declining rapidly. Medicare HMO coverage is also declining, \nand Medigap coverage is often unaffordable. That is the current \nsituation. Let's look a little further. If we look at the income of \nsenior citizens, what we see is that 57 percent of senior citizens have \nincomes under $15,000; 21 percent have incomes above $15,000 but under \n$25,000. If you add those together, obviously 78 percent are below \n$25,000. Elderly people in our country have very modest means--very, \nvery modest means.\n  The average income for a person over 65 is just above $13,000. The \ncost of coverage is going up. I just showed a chart of the different \ntypes of coverage we had, pointing out one-third of our senior citizens \nhave no coverage, and another third have health coverage that is \nrelated to their former job. The next chart shows firms offering \nretiree health coverage.\n\n  The chart indicates coverage ``drops 25 percent.''\n  There was a 25-percent drop in employers covering prescription drugs \nfor their retirees in the 3 years from 1994 to 1997. This is a dramatic \nreduction in coverage.\n  Remember I showed the other chart that said a third had coverage \nthrough employer sponsored retiree benefits? This shows that the number \nof firms offering retiree health benefits is dropping absolutely \ndramatically.\n  We saw there were a number of our senior citizens, about 4 million, \nwho had coverage through Medicare HMOs. Look at what is happening to \nMedicare HMO coverage. It is inadequate and unreliable.\n  First of all, the drug benefit is offered only at the option of HMOs, \nso some HMOs offer coverage and others do not. More than 325,000 \nMedicare beneficiaries lost their HMO coverage this year. That is \nbecause the HMOs moved out of the areas where those seniors live. \nSeniors lost their coverage. Look at this: 75 percent of Medicare HMOs \nwill limit prescription drug coverage to less than $1,000 this year. \nThat is an increase of 100 percent in the number of HMOs capping \ncoverage since 1998. And 32 percent of Medicare HMOs have imposed caps \nof less than $500 this year. So even though you have 4 million \nAmericans who have prescription drug coverage through Medicare HMOs, \nwhat you find out is there is a cap on the amount of prescription drugs \nthey are able to receive. After that, they pay for all prescription \ndrugs themselves.\n  What the trend is, the dramatic trend, is that the dollar cap is \ngoing down and down, with a third of HMOs having a cap of $500. Many \nseniors in Medicare HMOs will exceed the cap. What we find is that \nMedicare HMO prescription drug coverage is increasingly inadequate and \nincreasingly unreliable.\n  There is a dramatic reduction in the number of employers providing \ncoverage for retirees, and a dramatic increase in the amount of money \nthat individual seniors are paying out-of-pocket, even if they have \nsome coverage under their HMO.\n  The third group I pointed out were those who had Medigap coverage, \ndrug coverage which basically is unaffordable. These are sample Medigap \npremiums for a 75-year-old. In Delaware, just over $2,600; just under \n$2,000 in New York and Iowa; and just under $2,400 in Maine and \nMississippi.\n  Against that background, what has been happening to the cost of \ndrugs? The average seniors income is just above $13,500. A third of all \nof our seniors have no coverage; another third are losing it \ndramatically. We find that 4 million of the remaining have increasingly \nlimited coverage due to caps, so they are paying more and more out of \npocket. Medigap, which is another way they are able to get some \ncoverage, is going right up through the roof. So they are being hard-\npressed, and all at a time that 78 percent of all the elderly people \nhave incomes below $25,000.\n  Let's see what is happening to the cost of prescription drugs. Since \n1995, drug costs have been growing at double-digit rates. On this \nchart: Percent increases in drug costs. Let's look at the increase in \nthe cost of the drugs: almost 10 percent in 1995, 10 percent in 1996, \n14 percent in 1997, almost 16 percent in 1998, 16 percent in 1999.\n  Let's compare that to the Consumer Price Index for all goods. It is \n2.5 percent in 1995, it is 3.3 percent in 1996, 1.7 percent in 1997--\n1.7 percent cost-of-living increase and look at the cost of the \nprescription drugs-- 14 percent. In 1998 it is 1.6, and 2.7 in 1999, \nand look at the cost of these drugs.\n  This is not just a peripheral issue for our seniors. When we passed \nthe Medicare program in 1964, as we heard so eloquently today from both \nour leader on this side, Senator Daschle, and Congressman Gephardt, we \nhad a lot of the same kinds of criticisms that are being made now \nagainst this program: This is the beginning of a takeover by the \nFederal Government; this is the beginning of socialism.\n  Of course, they were wrong then and we were right because the \nMedicare program has worked. But one area we did not take care of was \nprescription drugs because private coverage at that time did not \nprovide for drug coverage.\n\n[[Page S3849]]\n\n I daresay prescription drugs are as necessary for our senior citizens \ntoday as hospital care or doctor care.\n  Prescription drugs coverage is necessary for elderly people. Yet it \nis left out. In a very important way, our Medicare system is not living \nup to its guarantee--for the men and women who fought in the wars and \nbrought this country out of the depths of the Depression and have \neducated their children--to live their golden years with a degree of \nsecurity and peace with respect to their health care needs under \nMedicare. We are now finding now with that major gap--today, more than \n95 percent of the private sector provides prescription drug coverage \nalthough they are dropping it for retirees--that Medicare does not \nprovide prescription drug coverage. It is a major gap.\n  We are saying: Let's fill that gap; let's meet our commitment to our \nseniors; let's include under Medicare a program that is going to be \nworthy of our names and which is absolutely essential if we are going \nto have our seniors--our parents and grandparents--live in the peace, \ndignity, and security they deserve.\n  That is why we believe the program ought to be voluntary, there ought \nto be coverage for all, it ought to provide basic coverage and have \ncatastrophic coverage, and it ought to be affordable.\n  The President has embraced and endorsed the program, and it is \nendorsed by the overwhelming majority of our caucus in the Senate and \nin the House of Representatives, and it is strongly supported by our \nleader and Mr. Gephardt.\n  The President in the Rose Garden today asked our Republican friends \nto join in this effort to pass this legislation this year. We have to \npass something that is going to be meaningful and worthy of our \nefforts. He invited our Republican friends to join us in this effort \nand outlined the program and spelled out the details as well as the \ncost of this program.\n  When we pass this program and send it to the President's desk, we in \nthe Congress will say: Why did it take us so long? Every day we delay \npassing this program, millions of our fellow citizens are being asked \nto make decisions about their very lives which they should not have to \nmake. That is wrong. We ought to respond. We know how to do it. The \nquestion is whether we have the will.\n  We are going to insist this Senate and House of Representatives \naddress this issue in this Congress. We give those assurances to the \nAmerican people, and we invite our friends on the other side of the \naisle to join us in meeting our responsibilities to our senior \ncitizens.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join Senator Daschle \nand 31 of my colleagues in introducing the Medicare Expansion for \nNeeded Drugs Act. This important legislation would expand the Medicare \nprogram to provide outpatient prescription drug coverage for seniors \nand other Medicare beneficiaries.\n  This bill is long overdue, one might say 35 years overdue. When \nMedicare was first crafted in the mid 1960's, life-saving medicine \ntended to be focused on surgical procedures: appendectomy, mastectomy, \nand so forth. Medications were being increasingly used to treat serious \nmedical conditions, such as antibiotics to treat infections. However, \nfor most illnesses, the medicine cabinet contained few options.\n  The advances that have been made in the past 4 decades in the use of \npharmaceuticals are nothing short of phenomenal. Diseases that were \nincurable by any means are now cured by drugs alone. For example, in \n1965, childhood leukemia was inevitably fatal. Now, thanks to new \nmedicines, it is almost always curable.\n  In addition, in many instances new medications have enabled us to \navoid the need for surgical treatment altogether. In 1965, intractable \npain from stomach ulcers was a common indication for surgery. In 2000, \nwe have highly effective medications to cut down on stomach acid, which \nhave virtually eliminated the need for that kind of surgery. Not only \nthat, but since we have discovered that most stomach ulcers are really \ndue to a bacterium, we can cure the condition entirely with \nantibiotics.\n  However, all too often, the elderly and disabled cannot take \nadvantage of these major advances in drug treatment because the \nMedicare program does not pay for outpatient prescription drugs. How \nridiculous is that?: that the group in our society that is the sickest, \nthat could benefit most from these medications, is the one group that \nis denied access to them.\n  You would be hard pressed to name another health program in this \ncountry that doesn't pay for outpatient prescription drugs. Virtually \nall private health plans do. Even looking at the Federal government: \nMedicaid, Tricare, the VA, the Federal Employees Health Benefits \nProgram, they all pay for prescription drugs. Only Medicare, the \nmedical program for the elderly and disabled, is singled out for \nspecial limitations.\n  What is the consequence of this Medicare limitation? Just two weeks \nago, the New York Times had a cover story on the plight of Albert \nRussell, a retiree who lives on an $832 Social Security check. Mr. \nRussell is nearly blind from glaucoma, a condition in which the \npressure inside the eye is too high. When the new drug Xalatan was \nreleased in 1996, Mr. Russell's eye doctor tried it and found that it \nwas just what Mr. Russell needed; it reduced the pressure in his eyes \nbetter than the alternatives. The problem was the cost of the drug: $1 \nper day. After several years on the medicine, Mr. Russell could no \nlonger afford the cost, so he had to stop taking the medicine. Of \ncourse, Medicare would not pay for such an outpatient prescription \ndrug. In an attempt to save Mr. Russell's vision, his eye doctor \nrecommended an alternative: an expensive eye surgery. For Mr. Russell, \nthe surgery would not be as effective as the medication, but there was \none big factor in its favor: Medicare would have no reluctance about \npaying for the surgery. So, as compared to surgery, the medication \nwould be better and easier for Mr. Russell, and probably cheaper in the \nlong run for the taxpayer, but under the current Medicare situation, \nthis common sense solution is out-of-bounds. This situation must be \nchanged.\n  So what's in this bill for consumers? The bill makes prescription \ndrug coverage voluntary and available to all Medicare beneficiaries. \nThere is no deductible required, and there is an out-of-pocket cap that \nputs an absolute maximum limit on how much one person will have to pay \nfor drugs in any given year. Participants pay a monthly premium, and \nthe government splits the cost of drugs 50/50 with the beneficiary (up \nto a gradually increasing limit). There is absolutely no question that \nthis bill is an important improvement for the health of our seniors.\n  I think it is important to keep in mind what this bill is not. First, \nit is not perfect. The coverage for prescription drugs is not in parity \nwith coverage for alternative medical treatments, such as surgery. This \ndifference reflects cost constraints, but I am optimistic that this \naspect can be addressed in future legislation.\n  Second, this bill is not for everyone. Individuals who have better \ncoverage of prescription drugs than is afforded in this bill, perhaps \nthrough an employer-sponsored retiree health plan, can keep that \ncoverage. In fact, employers will be offered subsidies to encourage \nthem to maintain prescription drug coverage for their retirees.\n  Third, this bill is not a prelude to price controls on drugs. The \nlegislation makes no mention of or need for price controls, and it is \nnot our intention to propose or implement price controls. This bill \ndeals primarily with access to pharmaceuticals, not their cost. The \nhigh cost of medications is a concern to many of us in this country, \nbut that is a very complex problem that is not, and should not be, \naddressed in this bill.\n  Finally, this bill is not the comprehensive overhaul of the Medicare \nprogram that we all agree is needed. The 1965 program needs to be \nbrought up to new millennium standards to make it easier for the \nprogram to keep up with rapid future advances in medical technology. \nThe benefit package (including enhanced preventive measures), the \nfinancing of graduate medical education, the provider payment \nmechanisms; these are all items that must be addressed. But not in this \nbill. Seniors need help now with prescription drugs, and they cannot \nwait the months or years that it will take to complete the needed \ncomprehensive revision of Medicare.\n\n[[Page S3850]]\n\n  Mr. President, I encourage all of my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to work together to enact this legislation and to make sure that \nour Medicare beneficiaries aren't relegated to a second class health \ncare system.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I wanted to say a few words about the \nMedicare Expansion for Needed Drugs, or MEND Act, which our leader, \nSenator Daschle introduced today. The MEND Act an important first step \ntoward modernizing Medicare through the creation of a voluntary, \naffordable, universal prescription drug benefit.\n  While the bill has many elements that I support, I am also interested \nin looking at ways that we might create a prescription drug bill that \ndistributes its benefits for senior citizens in a more targeted way. I \nam working with several of my colleagues on the Finance Committee to \ncreate such a bill, and hope to introduce it in the next two weeks. \nWith it, we will have two strong options for giving our seniors the \nhelp they so desperately need with the skyrocketing costs of \nprescription drugs.\n  Mr. President, I applaud the minority leader for his determination in \nworking to help our nation's seniors with the high cost of prescription \ndrugs, and for his efforts in bringing this bill to the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/10/senate-section/article/S3850-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3850-S3851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 s. 345\n\n  At the request of Mr. Gregg, his name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n345, a bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act to remove the limitation \nthat permits interstate movement of live birds, for the purpose of \nfighting, to States in which animal fighting is lawful.\n\n\n                                 s. 515\n\n  At the request of Mr. Akaka, the name of the Senator from Florida \n(Mr. Graham) was added as a cosponsor of S. 515, a bill to amend the \nPackers and Stockyards Act of 1921, to make it unlawful for any \nstockyard owner, market agency, or dealer to transfer or market \nnonambulatory livestock, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 s. 662\n\n  At the request of Mr. L.

Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the conference \nreport on the Trade and Development Act of 2000, the so-called African-\nCaribbean trade bill.\n  When we debated this bill last October, I expressed my concerns about \nit, and what has happened is the fruition of what I was concerned about \nat that time. A bill that was bad when it left the Senate last October \nhas become worse. This bill creates enormous risks for American textile \nbusinesses and American textile workers, with very little in the way of \noffsetting benefits.\n  Let me speak for a couple of minutes about what I think is wrong with \nthis bill and what kind of risk I think it creates for American \nworkers. When we negotiate trade agreements, in my judgment, there are \ncertain fundamental principles that should always be adhered to: First, \nthey must be negotiated and multilateral; that is, both sides give up \nsomething; second, that they create a fair and enforceable system so \nthe trade agreements don't become an empty shell but in fact there is a \nreal and meaningful mechanism for enforcing the trade agreements; \nthird, they must have adequate labor and environmental protections; \nand, fourth, they must have real, tangible, and provable benefits for \nU.S. businesses and U.S. workers.\n  These bills do not meet those basic principles that ought to be \ncomplied with on every single trade agreement.\n  Senator Feingold spoke very eloquently about the lack of adequate \nlabor and environmental protections in these bills.\n  There are two other principles that have been violated in these \nbills. First is the requirement that they be multilateral and \nnegotiated, the simple proposition being that if the American people \nand we as a country are going to lower our barriers, we ought to get \nsomething in return. That ``something'' is that the other countries \nthat are subject to these trade agreements lower their barriers. That \nsimply has not happened here.\n  What is happening is we are lowering our trade barriers while these \nother Caribbean and African nations are keeping their trade barriers \ncompletely in place. Their tariffs remain just as they were. There is \nno set of circumstances under which that kind of arrangement is \nequitable for American business or equitable for American workers.\n  Second, there has to be a real and meaningful mechanism for enforcing \nthese provisions. One of the things that happened to this bill when it \nleft the Senate is there was a complex set of enforcement mechanisms \nand provisions put in place. When the bill left the Senate, we had what \nwas called yarn and fabric forward provisions, which basically said, as \na matter of equity, we would allow the trade barriers to be lowered for \nthose African and Caribbean nations that used yarn and fabric from the \nUnited States so that our workers and our businesses benefited.\n  Well, when the bill got to conference with the House bill, those \nprovisions were changed. Now there are many African nations that are \nnot required to use American yarn or American fabric. Secondly, they \nare allowed to use regional yarn and fabric; that is, yarn and fabric \nfrom that area.\n  So those are two significant changes in the bill since it left the \nfloor of the Senate which have real and meaningful impact on American \nbusiness and American workers.\n\n  Probably the more dangerous situation, though, is that created by the \npotential for transshipment. We talked about this on the floor of the \nSenate when this bill was debated the first time, and my colleagues are \naware of this problem.\n  Transshipment, basically, is a situation where a country, such as \nChina, which I think has the greatest potential for taking advantage of \ntransshipment, ships their fabric and their goods through Africa only \nfor the purpose of having a button sewn on or some other minor change \nin the product, and then the product is shipped to the United States.\n  The antitransshipment provisions of this bill are simply not adequate \nfor a variety of reasons. One of the two most important is that the \nenforcement mechanism relies upon African countries for enforcement. \nThe reality is--and all of us know it--that these African nations are \nnot going to be able to enforce the provisions about transshipment. And \nwe are going to have--at least there is real potential for--a massive \ntransshipment by China and Chinese textile businesses through Africa to \nthe United States. Transshipment has a real and devastating effect on \nAmerican workers and American businesses, and we have seen some of \nthose effects over the last 8 to 10 years.\n  I have some specific examples of this. In North Carolina, my home \nState, during 1999, these were the jobs that were lost as a result of \ncheap textile goods coming into the United States:\n  At Pluma, Inc., a plant located in Eden, NC, a small community, 500 \njobs were lost when the plant was closed. Jasper closed a plant in \nWhiteville, NC, in September and 191 jobs were lost. Whiteville Apparel \nin Whiteville, NC, closed a plant in August and 396 jobs were \nlost. Stonecutter Mills in Rutherford and Polk in western North \nCarolina closed a plant in June--800 jobs lost. Dyersburg in Hamilton, \nNC, closed a plant in May--422 jobs lost. Levi Straus closed a plant in \nMurphy--382 jobs lost.\n\n  Remember that we are only talking about 1999 at this point.\n  Burlington Industries, in January, closed plants in Cramerton, Forest \nCity, Mooresville, Raeford, Oxford, and Statesville--2,600 jobs lost as \na result; all of those occurring in 1999.\n  In 1999 alone, the South lost 55,000 textile and apparel jobs.\n  This is not an abstract position for the families and employees whose \nlives\n\n[[Page S3854]]\n\nare devastated as a result of these cheap goods coming into the United \nStates.\n  A perfect example is Margie Brown. You heard me talk about \nWhiteville, NC, which was one of the areas in eastern North Carolina \nhardest hit by this flow of cheap goods into the United States. Margie \nBrown is 47 years old. She had a good job working at Jasper Textiles in \nWhiteville, NC. She made just under $200 a week. She depended on it. \nHer family depended on the income from that job. It is what she was \ntrained to do; It is what she knew how to do; and she felt good about \nwhat she did.\n  As a result of that plant being closed down, the reality exists all \nover North Carolina. In many cases there is no work for these folks; \nthey have no comparable employment. There is nothing they can do with \nthe education and the job training they have.\n  So she had nowhere to go. Today, instead of having a job she is proud \nof, being able to support her family, feeling good about going to work \nevery day and doing the things that made her productive as an American \ncitizen, she is on unemployment and she gets $51 a week.\n  My point is that these are real people. These are real families, and \nthe impact on them is devastating. We can't turn our heads on this. \nThis is not hypothetical. This is not some theoretical thing we are \ntalking about. It is all well and good for us to talk abstractly on the \nfloor of the Senate about trade being good, about, in this case, this \nhaving some diffuse benefit to our country as a whole, but there are \nreal people whose lives are being devastated by these trade agreements, \nreal people who have nowhere to go to work tomorrow, who have no way of \ntaking care of their families and who have lost all semblance of self-\nesteem.\n  These people, who oftentimes worked in textile mills for 20, 30, or \n40 years--I do have to say at this point my dad worked in a cotton mill \nbasically his whole life. During the summers, in high school and \ncollege, and then in law school, I saw firsthand the people who spent \ntheir whole lives in these textile mills and these cotton mills. They \ndo not know anything else.\n  We can talk about the technological world we now live in and how \nthese people have to make a transition because the world is changing. \nThe reality is, many of them are 50 or 60 years old and have spent \ntheir whole life working in the mill. They have nowhere to go. They \nhave no idea what to do about their families. They are put on the \nstreet after working every day for the last 30 or 40 years. What do \nthey say to their kids? What do they say to their spouses about what \nthey are going to do?\n  My point is that these trade agreements have a real impact on real \npeople's lives, and we all have to recognize it. In fact, this \nparticular agreement is going to do nothing but accelerate the problem. \nThe Margie Browns I just described will be all over North Carolina and \nthe southern United States.\n  The reason is very simple: The average apparel wage in the United \nStates is $8 an hour.\n  Of some of the countries that are covered by this agreement: In \nMexico the average wage is 85 cents an hour; the Dominican Republic, 69 \ncents an hour; El Salvador, 59 cents an hour; Guatemala, 65 cents an \nhour; and, Honduras, 43 cents an hour.\n  You don't have to be a mathematical wizard to figure out that there \nis no way for American workers under these circumstances to compete, \nand there is no way they are going to keep their jobs.\n  What will happen is China is going to ship goods through Africa. In \nall likelihood, there will be massive transshipping with no way to stop \nit, no way to detect it, and no way to enforce the antitransshipment \nprovisions of this bill. As a result, people all over North Carolina \nand the United States are going to lose their jobs.\n  We are playing with fire. I said this when we debated the bill last \nfall. I say it again. The only thing that has changed is the fire has \ngotten hotter. It has gotten more dangerous.\n  There are more American workers whose jobs are going to be lost, and \nthis conference report it does not meet the fundamental principles of \nequity, the principles that ought to apply to every trade agreement, \nthe principles that are needed to protect our businesses and our \ntextile workers in the United States.\n  They are perfectly willing to compete. They just want the chance to \ncompete on a level playing field. The other countries aren't lowering \ntheir barriers. We are. We know there are going to be goods \ntransshipped through Africa from China and other places. And there is \nno way to prepare for that. The net result is this is not an abstract \nthing. Real people, real families, lives and jobs are about to be \nchanged.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, thank you very much.

Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes today to talk \nabout the Department of Interior's recent decision to ban snowmobiling \nin most units of the National Park System.\n  While the Interior Department's recent decision will not ban \nsnowmobiling in Minnesota's Voyageurs National Park, it will impact \nsnowmobiling in at least two units of the Park System in my home \nstate--Grand Portage National Monument and the St. Croix National \nScenic Riverway. In addition, this decision will greatly impact \nMinnesotans who enjoy snowmobiling, not only in Minnesota, but in many \nof our National Parks, particularly in the western part of our country.\n  When I think of snowmobiling in Minnesota, I think of families and \nfriends. I think of people who come together on their free time to \nenjoy the wonders of Minnesota in a way no other form of transportation \nallows them. I also think of the fact that in many instances \nsnowmobiles in Minnesota are used for much more than just recreation. \nFor some, they're a mode of transportation when snow blankets our \nstate. For others, snowmobiles provide a mode of search and rescue \nactivity. Whatever the reason, snowmobiles are an extremely important \naspect of commerce, travel, recreation, and safety in my home state.\n  Minnesota, right now, is home to over 280,000 registered snowmobiles \nand 20,000 miles of snowmobile trails. According to the Minnesota \nUnited Snowmobilers Association, an association with over 51,000 \nindividual members, Minnesota's 311 snowmobile riding clubs raised \n$264,000 for charity in 1998 alone. Snowmobiling creates over 6,600 \njobs and $645 million of economic activity in Minnesota. Minnesota is \nhome to two major snowmobile manufacturers--Arctic Cat and Polaris. And \nyes, I enjoy my own snowmobiles.\n  People who enjoy snowmobiling come from all walks of life. They're \nfarmers, lawyers, nurses, construction workers, loggers, and miners. \nThey're men, women, and young adults. They're people who enjoy the \noutdoors, time with their families, and the recreational opportunities \nour diverse climate offers. These are people who not only enjoy the \nnatural resources through which they ride, but understand the important \nbalance between enjoying and conserving our natural resources.\n  Just three years ago, I took part in a snowmobile ride through a \nnumber of cities and trails in northern Minnesota. While our ride \ndidn't take us through a unit of the National Park Service, it did take \nus through parks, forests, and trails that sustain a diverse amount of \nplant and animal species. I talked with my fellow riders and I learned \na great deal about the work their snowmobile clubs undertake to \nconserve natural resources, respect the integrity of the land upon \nwhich they ride, and educate their members about the need to ride \nresponsibly.\n  The time I spent with these individuals and the time I've spent on my \nown snowmobiles have given me a great respect for both the quality and \nenjoyment of the recreational experience and the need to ride \nresponsibly and safely. They've also given me reason to strongly \ndisagree with the approach the Park Service has chosen in banning \nsnowmobiles from our National Parks.\n\n[[Page S3855]]\n\n  I was stunned to read of the severity of the Park Service's ban and \nthe rhetoric used by Assistant Secretary Donald J. Barry in announcing \nthe ban. In the announcement, Assistant Secretary Barry said, ``The \ntime has come for the National Park Service to pull in its welcome mat \nfor recreational snowmobiling.'' He went on to say that snowmobiles \nwere, ``machines that are no longer welcome in our national parks.'' \nThese are not the words of someone who is approaching a sensitive issue \nin a thoughtful way. These are the words of a bureaucrat whose agenda \nhas been handwritten for him by those opposed to snowmobiling.\n  The last time I checked, Congress is supposed to be setting the \nagenda of the federal agencies. The last time I checked, Congress \nshould be determining who is and is not welcome on our federal lands. \nAnd the last time I checked, the American people own our public-lands--\nnot the Clinton Administration and certainly not Donald J. Barry.\n  In light of such brazenness, it's amazing to me that this \nAdministration, and some of my colleagues in Congress, question our \nobjections to efforts that would allow the federal government to \npurchase even larger tracts of private land. If we were dealing with \nfederal land managers who considered the intent of Congress, who worked \nwith local officials, or who listened to the concerns of those most \nimpacted by federal land-use decisions, we might be more inclined to \nconsider their efforts. But when this Administration, time and again, \nthumbs its nose at Congress and acts repeatedly against the will of \nlocal officials and American citizens, it is little wonder that some in \nCongress might not want to turn over more private land to this \nAdministration.\n  I can't begin to count the rules, regulations, and executive orders \nthis Administration has undertaken without even the most minimal \nconsideration for Congress or local officials. It has happened in state \nafter state, to Democrats and Republicans, and with little or no regard \nfor the rule or the intent of law. I want to quote Interior Secretary \nBruce Babbitt from an article in the National Journal, dated May 22, \n1999. In the article, Secretary Babbitt was quoted as saying:\n\n       When I got to town, what I didn't know was that we didn't \n     need more legislation. But we looked around and saw we had \n     authority to regulate grazing policies. It took 18 months to \n     draft new grazing regulations. On mining, we have also found \n     that we already had authority over, well, probably two-thirds \n     of the issues in contention. We've switched the rules of the \n     game. We're not trying to do anything legislatively.\n\n  In other words, an end run of Congress, which is an end run of the \nAmerican people.\n  That is a remarkable statement by an extremely candid man, and his \nintent to work around Congress is clearly reflected in this most recent \ndecision. Clearly, Secretary Babbitt and his staff felt the rules that \nthey've created allow them to ``pull the welcome mat for recreational \nusers'' to our national parks.\n  As further evidence of this Administration's abuse of Congress--and \ntherefore of the American people--Environmental Protection Agency \nAdministrator Carol Browner was quoted in the same article as saying:\n\n       We completely understand all of the executive tools that \n     are available to us--And boy do we use them.\n\n  So it is handy for them to avoid the legislative route, to avoid \ncoming through Congress; they do it through executive orders and \nmandates.\n  While Ms. Browner's words strongly imply an intent to work around \nCongress, at least she did not join Secretary Babbitt in coming right \nout and admitting it.\n  I for one am getting a little sick and tired of watching this \nAdministration force park users out of their parks, steal land from our \nstates and counties, impose costly new regulations on farmers and \nbusinesses without scientific justification, and force Congress to \nbecome a spectator on many of the most controversial and important \nissues before the American people.\n  It's getting to the point where I'm not sure what to tell my \nconstituents. I've been on the phone with snowmobilers in Minnesota and \nthey ask what can be done. I start to explain that because of the \nfilibuster in the Senate and the President's ability to veto, it will \nbe difficult for Congress to take any action. I've found myself saying \nthat a lot lately. Whether it's regulations on Total Maximum Daily \nLoads, efforts to put 50 million acres of forests in wilderness, or new \nrules to regulate a worker's house should they choose to work at home, \nthis Administration just doesn't respect the legislative process or the \nrole of Congress. Nor does this Administration respect the jobs, \ntraditions, cultures, of lifestyles of millions of Americans. If you're \nan American who has yet to be negatively impacted by the actions of \nthis Administration, just wait your turn because you were evidently at \nthe end of the list. Sooner or later, if they get their way in the next \nfew months, they're going to kill your job, render your private \nproperty unusable, and ban you from accessing public lands that have \nbeen accessible for generations.\n  Regrettably, many of us in Congress are now left with the proposition \nof telling our constituents that we must wait for a new Administration. \nI have to tell them that this Administration is on its way out the door \nand they're employing a scorched earth exit strategy. And I have to \nwarn them that the situation could get worse if a certain Vice \nPresident finds himself residing at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue next year.\n  I have to admit, there's nothing pleasurable about telling your \nconstituents to wait until next year. I think it's important to \nremember that, as Senators, we are the representatives of every one of \nour constituents. When I have to tell a constituent that Congress has \nlost its power to act on this matter, I'm actually telling that \nconstituent that he or she has lost their power on this matter. When I \nhave to tell a snowmobiler that the Administration doesn't care what \nCongress has to say about snowmobiling in national parks, I am really \ntelling him or her that the Administration doesn't care what the \nAmerican people have to say about snowmobiling in national parks. \nCongress did not get a chance to debate it or to represent the people \nback home. I doubt any of us could've said that any better than Donald \nJ. Barry said it himself.\n  When forging public policy, those of us in Congress often have to \nconsider the opinions of the state and local officials who are most \nimpacted. If I'm going to support an action on public land, I usually \ncontact the state and local officials who represent the area to see \nwhat they have to say. I know that if I don't get their perspective, I \nmight miss a detail that could improve my efforts. I also know that the \nlocal officials can tell me if my efforts are necessary or if they're \nmisplaced. They can alert me to areas where I need to forge a broader \nconsensus and of ways in which my efforts might actually hurt the \npeople I represent. I think that is a prudent way to forge public \npolicy and a fair way to deal with state and local officials.\n  I know, however, that no one from the Park Service ever contacted me \nto see how I felt about banning snowmobiling in Park Service units in \nMinnesota. I was never consulted on snowmobile usage in Minnesota or on \nany complaints that I might have received from my constituents. While \nI've not checked with every local official in Minnesota, not one local \nofficial has called me to say that the Park Service contacted them. In \nfact, while I knew the Park Service was considering taking action to \ncurb snowmobile usage in some Parks, I had no idea the Park Service was \nconsidering an action so broad, and so extreme, nor did I think they \nwould issue it this quickly. I do not think any local officials thought \nthis would happen. I know those involved in the snowmobile industry had \nno idea, while talking with this administration, this was going to come \ndown. It was a shot out of the blue.\n\n  I believe this quick overreaching by the Park Service was \nunwarranted. It did not allow time for Federal, State, or local \nofficials to work together on this issue. It did not bring snowmobile \nusers to the table to discuss the impact of this decision on them. It \ndid not allow time for Congress and the administration to look at all \nof the available options or to differentiate between parks with heavy \nsnowmobile usage and those with occasional usage. This decision stands \nas a dramatic example of how not to conduct policy formation and \nformulation. It is an affront to the\n\n[[Page S3856]]\n\nconsideration American citizens deserve from their elected officials.\n  I would like to repeat that. This decision stands as a very dramatic \nexample of how not to conduct policy formulation and is an affront to \nthe consideration that I believe American citizens deserve from their \nelected officials.\n  I hope we take a hard look at this decision and call the \nadministration before Senate committees for hearings. I believe there \nhas been one scheduled. Senator Craig Thomas, I believe, will be \nholding such a hearing on May 25 to try to bring some administration \nofficials before Congress and to ask some very simple questions: Why \nwas this action taken? I have long believed we can have an impact on \nthese matters by holding strong oversight hearings and by forcing the \nadministration to be accountable for their actions. We cannot, however, \nsimply stand by and watch as this administration continues its quest, \nin its final, waning days, for even greater power, power that will come \nat the expense of the deliberative, legislative process envisioned by \nthe founders of this country.\n  Secretary Babbitt, Administrator Browner, and Donald J. Barry may \nbelieve they are above working with this Congress. But only we can make \nsure that they are reminded, and we can do it in the strongest possible \nterms, that when they neglect Congress they are neglecting the American \npeople.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/10/senate-section/article/S3856-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
