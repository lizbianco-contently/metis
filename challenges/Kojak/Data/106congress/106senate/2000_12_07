Mr. President, I rise to honor a truly great Alaskan, \na close personal friend, Elmer Rasmuson, who passed away last Saturday \nat the age of 91. Alaska is a far better place as a consequence of his \nlife of public service, his achievements in business, and his personal \nphilanthropy.\n  Elmer was born in Yakutat, Alaska in 1909, not long after the \nKlondike gold rush. His life spanned Alaska's modern history, history \nthat he had a significant hand in shaping.\n  Elmer served Alaskans in both the public and private realms. He was a \nsuccessful banker who put together Alaska's first system of statewide \nbranch banking. That wasn't any easy thing to do in a wild, far-flung \nterritory like Alaska with four time zones, but he succeeded in doing a \ntremendous job with tremendous imagination and perseverance.\n  Along the way, Elmer amassed a personal fortune, which he had, in \nrecent years, used to benefit libraries, museums, and universities in \nour State. This legacy will live on, as it was Elmer's wish that his \npersonal fortune continue to benefit Alaska long after his death.\n  Elmer also enjoyed a distinguished record of public service. He \nserved on the University of Alaska Board of Regents for nearly twenty \nyears; and he was the mayor of Anchorage from 1964-1967--including the \ndifficult period of time encompassing the Good Friday Earthquake of \n1964 and the rebuilding of Alaska's largest city.\n  Elmer also had a keen interest and expertise in fisheries issues. He \nserved on the International North Pacific Fisheries Commission from \n1969 to 1984; he served as the first Chairman of the North Pacific \nFisheries Management Council. He was instrumental in the creation of \nthe 200-mile fisheries limit, and in rebuilding the State's salmon runs \nafter years of federal neglect.\n  Elmer brought this knowledge of fisheries management to the U.S. \nArctic Research Commission, a position\n\n[[Page S11664]]\n\nthat President Ronald Reagan appointed him to fill in 1988. He served \nin that position with great distinction, to the benefit of Alaska and \nthe entire Nation.\n  We will long remember the benefits from his legacy of continuing \nphilanthropy. Elmer hired me back in 1959, my first job in banking. I \nworked for him as a branch manager at one of the small offices in \nAnchorage and later throughout offices in southeastern Alaska. We \nremained close friends through the 40 years that followed. His son Ed \nand his wife Cathy have shared many memories and good times with both \nNancy and me.\n  Elmer's commitment to Alaska was evident in many ways. In the private \nsector, he was willing to take risks, commit capital to budding \nenterprises in Alaska. In the public realm, he gave of his time and \nfortune. Just last year, Elmer and his wife Mary Louise donated $40 \nmillion to the Rasmuson Foundation so the foundation can provide grants \nto education and social service nonprofit organizations. He also gave \nanother $50 million to the Anchorage Museum of History which Elmer \nhelped start. In fact, on his 90th birthday he gave away $90 million. \nHe also donated the largest single donation to the University of Alaska \nMuseum in Fairbanks.\n  It is important to add that Elmer was generous in many other ways \nother than his wealth. He gave his time and effort to civic groups, \nincluding the Boy Scouts.\n  There is a saying that the true meaning of life is to plant trees \nunder whose shade you do not expect to sit. That is the true test of \ngenerosity. By that measure, Elmer Rasmuson was an extraordinary \nindividual in his generosity. Alaskans will remember him for \ngenerations to come. They, as Nancy and I, will miss him greatly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/07/senate-section/article/S11664-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IVETTE FERNANDEZ--MISS ALASKA USA 2001\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, congratulations are in order for a \n``Royal'' Alaskan on my staff. Staff Assistant Ivette Fernandez was \nrecently crowned Miss Alaska USA 2001 at the state pageant held in \nAnchorage. Ivette was judged in the interview, swimsuit, and evening \ngown competitions. Along with the title of Miss Alaska USA, Ivette also \nwas honored with the Miss Congeniality title.\n  Born and raised in Fairbanks, Alaska, Ivette is the daughter of \nAntonio and Gloria Fernandez of Fairbanks. She is a graduate of Lathrop \nHigh School in Fairbanks and attended the University of Alaska \nFairbanks before transferring to The George Washington University (GWU) \nin Washington, DC. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from \nGWU in the fall of 1999. Her future plans include attending law school \nand working in International Affairs.\n  As the new Miss Alaska USA, Ivette will represent Alaska in the Miss \nUSA pageant which will be held in early February in Gary, Indiana. \nIvette will compete for the title of Miss USA with other young women \nfrom 49 states and the District of Columbia.\n  Upon winning the Miss Alaska USA title, Ivette won scholarship and \nwardrobe money, a free trip to the national pageant, and other generous \nprizes, as well as her crown and sash. However, this is not her first \ntime wearing a crown. In April 1999, Ivette represented Alaska as our \nCherry Blossom Princess for the National Cherry Blossom Festival here \nin Washington, DC.\n  My wife Nancy and I have known Ivette for many years. We are very \nproud of her and her accomplishments, and we know that she will \nrepresent Alaska with poise and distinction. Ivette is a pleasure to be \naround and a great asset to my office staff.\n  Mr. President, my staff and I want to wish Ivette the best of luck \nwhen she competes in the Miss USA pageant this coming February, and we \nagain extend our congratulations to her on winning her title.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/07/senate-section/article/S11664-2", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NATURAL GAS\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I note that the Energy Committee is \ncontemplating a hearing on Tuesday on the spiraling price increases \nassociated with natural gas. We are seeing a situation in existence now \nwhere we have terminated trading, for a portion of yesterday at least, \nin natural gas. I am told that natural gas was selling for about $2.16 \nper thousand cubic feet about 9 months ago. Last month it was $5.40; $7 \nlast week. Yesterday it hit a high of $8.80. We really have a crisis \ndeveloping in this country, not only from the standpoint of the \nadequacy of our natural gas supplies to meet our electric generation \nrequirements but home heating as well, inasmuch as 50 percent of the \nhomes in the United States are heated by gas.\n  I thank my colleague from Washington, Senator Murray, for the time \nshe allotted me. I wish the Chair a good day and my good friend from \nWashington as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as we all know congressional lame duck \nsessions following an election are a rarity. They usually arise when \nCongress is unable to finish its business in a timely fashion, and that \nis true with this year as well.\n  But this session affords me and this Congress an opportunity to \nacknowledge and pay tribute to the service of an esteemed colleague. \nSenator Slade Gorton, the Senior Senator from Washington state, will be \nending his service here after 18 years in the Senate.\n  Washingtonians--regardless of party affiliation--have come up to me \nwith high praise and appreciation for Senator Gorton's long service to \nour state, our country and this proud institution.\n  I want to share with my colleagues a passage from an editorial this \nweek in the Everett Herald. The Herald editorial reads,\n\n       History will rank Gorton with Senator Henry M. ``Scoop'' \n     Jackson and Senator Warren G. Magnuson as an extraordinary \n     leader in D.C. on behalf of the state.\n       Throughout his career in the Senate and state government, \n     Gorton has been a leading force in many major efforts to \n     protect the environment.\n       He also has been a consistent, passionate advocate for \n     individuals with problems dealing with bureaucracy.\n       Within the Senate, Gorton has been a grand force for \n     reasoned bipartisanship, never afraid to take a strong stand \n     but also willing to work graciously and effectively with \n     members of the opposition even at the tensest moments.\n\n  Many of our colleagues are well aware of Slade's history of public \nservice. As a young man, Slade Gorton moved to Washington state from \nChicago almost 50 years ago.\n  He wanted to go West in search of new opportunities. And with $300 \nand a one-way ticket on a Greyhound bus, Slade Gorton moved to \nWashington State.\n  History has shown that this Midwest native fit right into Washington \nState. And like so many immigrants to our great State, Slade Gorton was \nwelcomed and given an opportunity to make the most of his talents.\n  From the very beginning, Slade Gorton went to work on behalf of \nWashington State. First, he married Sally Clark from Selah, Washington. \nThat same year--1958--Slade went into politics and was elected to the \nWashington State House of Representatives where he rose to serve as the \nmajority leader.\n  In 1968, he was elected attorney general of Washington State. On \nnumerous occasions on several historic cases, Slade represented the \npeople of Washington before the Supreme Court.\n  Chief Justice Warren Burger once said that Slade, ``makes the best \narguments before the Supreme Court of any Attorney General in \nAmerica.'' He was also recognized with the prestigious Wyman Award \ngiven to the outstanding attorney general in the United States.\n  By this time, Slade had also become a respected leader throughout \nWashington State.\n  After three terms as the Washington State Attorney General, Slade \nGorton ran for an won a seat in the United States Senate. He was \nelected three times to the United States Senate giving him an \nimpressive record of winning statewide election six times in \nWashington.\n  All of this is offered as a brief history of Slade's many years of \nservice. With time, there will certainly be many public tributes to \nSenator Gorton. But\n\n[[Page S11665]]\n\nwhat I'd like to focus on now is our time together in the United States \nSenate and the work we were able to do together over the last eight \nyears.\n  I am sure all of my colleagues share my own appreciation for the \nsupport, guidance, and sacrifices our families make so that we can \nserve in the Senate. Our successes throughout our careers in public \nservice are shared with our families. We rely on them in so many ways.\n  And that is certainly true for Slade Gorton. Sally and Slade have \nbeen partners for all of his years of service. From Olympia, Washington \nto Washington, D.C., Sally Gorton has been there each and every day. \nShe and Slade have three children and seven grandchildren, who I know \nbring immense pride to the Gorton family.\n  So, as we acknowledge and honor Slade Gorton, I want to pay special \ntribute to Sally Gorton and the entire Gorton Family. We've all had to \nendure some tough things in seeking to represent our States in the \nSenate. We accept that politics can sometimes be rough.\n  Our families--as our biggest defenders--often take it more personally \nthan we do. And, like all political families, the Gorton family has \nbeen instrumental to all of Slade's many successes. Washington State is \nproud and appreciative of all that Sally Gorton has also done.\n  Much has been said in Washington State about the differences between \nSenator Gorton and myself. And while Slade and I have had our \ndifferences, not enough has been said about our ability to work \ntogether on behalf of Washington State.\n  Slade Gorton was a champion for Washington State. When the interests \nof Washington State were at stake, we were a great team.\n  I will miss our ability to work together on a bipartisan basis, \ncombining our strengths, to represent our great State.\n  As my colleagues know, there is also no greater adversary in the \nUnited States Senate than Slade Gorton.\n  When Senator Gorton took on an issue, everyone knew they had better \nprepare for an energetic and spirited fight. Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle know what a challenge it is to take on Senator Gorton.\n\n  Most of you didn't have to take those fights home to your \nconstituencies like I did. But those differences between Senator Gorton \nand I were rare. And they were never personal or vindictive. There were \nno political vendettas, and we were always able to move onto the next \nissue of importance to our constituents.\n  Ask the Clinton administration and the Justice Department what it is \nlike to take on an issue and differ with Slade Gorton. He was a \nchampion for Microsoft in its ongoing legal battles with the Department \nof Justice. I respected his work on behalf of Microsoft and was proud \nto work with him on behalf of our constituents. And certainly, all of \nWashington State appreciated his determined efforts to represent one of \nthe great symbols of Washington State.\n  Ask the Bush administration what it was like to do battle with Slade \nGorton when he fought his own party to save the National Endowment for \nthe Arts.\n  Despite Washington, DC's strong desire to label us all, Slade was \nalways open. And when he took on a cause, he often surprised people. \nThroughout his career in both Washingtons, Slade defied labels.\n  Most recently, Senator Gorton and I worked very closely on the issue \nof pipeline safety. Unfortunately, a tragedy in Bellingham, Washington \nclaimed three young lives and scarred forever a community. Slade was \nright there with me from the very beginning, working to raise the \nprofile of the issue and eventually pass through the Senate the \ntoughest pipeline safety legislation ever adopted by either body of \nCongress. Senator Gorton was instrumental to this effort. Working \ntogether, we took on some very powerful interests and extracted some \ntough compromises.\n  At the Appropriations Committee, Senator Gorton and I teamed up on \nnumerous instances each and every year to advance and protect \nWashington's many interests. From agriculture research programs \nbenefiting apple growers and wheat farmers to export promotion programs \nto land exchanges.\n  Washington was the only State with two appropriators. We were \nfortunate. More so because Slade chaired the Interior Subcommittee \nwhere Washington has so many interests.\n  We worked together to clean up the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. We \nwere partners in the effort to ease the Puget Sound area's very \ndifficult traffic congestion problems at the Transportation \nSubcommittee where we both served.\n  Beyond the Appropriations Committee, there are so many other issues \nthat we worked well together on behalf of Washington State. Commercial \nfisheries is immensely important to our State and we worked closely on \nthe Magnuson-Stevens Act in 1996 and the American Fisheries Act in \n1998. We recently worked together to pay tribute to a Nisei veteran and \nWashington State native William Kenzo Nakamura by naming a courthouse \nafter him in Seattle, Washington.\n  We did work collaboratively on selecting Federal judges in a time \nwhen confirming judges was overly partisan. We succeeded in getting our \njudges through this difficult process by working together.\n  Time and again, we both worked to help Boeing in its relationships \nwith many foreign aircraft customers. Whether working with USTR or a \nforeign government, Slade worked hard for the almost 100,000 Washington \nState families who work at Boeing and rely on aircraft sales.\n  Senator Gorton and I also worked closely on health care issues \nimportant to our constituents. We worked together to boost the growing \nbiotech sector in our State and the promising future that companies \nlike Immunex and others are building in Washington State. From securing \nresearch dollars to representing the UW Medical School, Washington \nState's health care needs were well served by the work of Senator \nGorton. Here, like in so many areas, he had an impact for the \nbetterment of our State and our country. He was a champion on autism \nissues and I regularly worked with him to expand health care for \nchildren.\n  Senator Gorton was always known for tremendous staff work both in \nWashington, DC and throughout the State of Washington. He has served as \na mentor to literally thousands of professionals. The family tree of \nGorton staffers past and present is a truly impressive list of \nWashingtonians.\n  One of Senator Gorton's greatest and lasting contributions to our \nState will be the years of public service his former staffers will give \nto Washington State.\n  My staff and I have worked closely with Senator Gorton's staff. That \nworking relationship was always interrupted by an annual softball game \nthat could be as competitive as any Apple Cup football game between the \nUniversity of Washington and Washington State University. I am proud to \nsay the Murray softball team won its share of games. But so did the \nGorton team. And there were a couple of years where Senator Gorton \nhimself contributed to his team's wins. It was a friendly rivalry but I \nam sure Slade will agree, we both really wanted to win that game.\n  The Gorton staff is as loyal as any on Capitol Hill. And I am sure \nthey will have an opportunity to thank Senator Gorton for all of his \npersonal and professional guidance and assistance.\n  But I am also sure they would want me to say to Senator Gorton that \nthey believed in his work and that they will always be proud to call \nthemselves Gorton staffers.\n  This is certainly a time of change for the country and for the \nSenate. And while Senator Gorton will leave the Senate, we shouldn't \nexpect to see him fade from the public scene. At home, he will continue \nto be a respected leader with perhaps many opportunities ahead to \nfurther shape and influence our State.\n  And, perhaps his service in Washington, DC will continue as well. \nChange may seem uncertain but I am confident--just as he did almost 50 \nyears ago on the Greyhound bus--that Senator Gorton will make the most \nof the new opportunities to come.\n  Senator Gorton, on behalf of all of Washington State, thank you for \nmaking Washington State your home. We have benefited enormously from \nthe decision you made as a young man to settle in Washington State. \nYour service here in the Senate is one proud part of a dedicated and \naccomplished career in public service.\n\n[[Page S11666]]\n\n  I yield the floor to my colleague Senator Gordon Smith from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I thank Mrs. Murray, the Senator from \nWashington, for her kind words on behalf of our colleague and friend, \nSenator Slade Gorton.\n  I am filled with conflicting emotions this morning. It is easy for me \nto come to the floor of the Senate to sing the praises of Slade Gorton. \nIt is hard for me to contemplate this place without him. As Senator \nMurray has detailed his history, I won't repeat it, but I do think it \nis significant that this good man comes from a family from New England \nbut, like a delicious Washington apple, he is a product of Washington \nState.\n  Slade often tells the story of Lewis and Clark coming down the \nColumbia River. They approached the Pacific on the Washington side. The \nfirst election that included minorities of African American, Indian \ndescent, and female gender, took place on the shores of what we now \nknow as Washington State. The decision before the party was whether to \nstay in Washington or whether to move to Oregon on the other side of \nthe river. The vote was to move to Oregon. Slade has always used that \nstory as an example that the voters are not always right.\n  I have never shared the same conclusion with respect to that story, \nand I find it humbling to accede to the will of the majority in \nelections, as I do now, with the defeat of Slade Gorton for another \nterm. It is a hard decision, nevertheless, for me.\n  Slade was also given to say that mountains divide and rivers unite. \nTruly, the Columbia River is one of many marvelous things that \nWashington and Oregon share together. It is the thing which has made of \nWashingtonians and Oregonians good friends for so many years. It is, \nperhaps, the greatest thing that brought Slade Gorton and me together, \na common interest in being good neighbors, a common interest in the \nvalues and uses of the river for both natural and human purposes. \nOregon has lost a great friend at the end of the service of Slade \nGorton.\n  Time and again, I would appeal to Slade in his powerful position on \nAppropriations to help the people of my State with appropriations that \nmattered to farmers, to fishermen, to foresters. He was always there, \nalways anxious to help, always anxious to provide money for salmon \nrestoration and for things that make the lives of all in the Pacific \nNorthwest better.\n  Slade Gorton was the champion of many things, but I think he was the \ngreatest champion for rural people. He knew that our prosperity, our \nstandard of living, ultimately came from the responsible use of natural \nresources. So he stood by farmers. He stood by fishermen. He stood by \nthose who logged. He stood by the miner. He fought for their jobs. He \nfought for them to have a place. But he was not just focused on their \nconcerns. As Senator Murray has reminded us, Microsoft knew no greater \nchampion on the floor of the Senate than Slade Gorton as he battled for \nthis State's great interest in Microsoft's survival and success. So he \nwas both high tech and farmer friendly. He was a man for all seasons \nfor the Pacific Northwest and for his State of Washington.\n  This morning, as I contemplated what I could say about him, a passage \nof scripture from the New Testament came to my mind that seemed to be, \nin my view, the bright way that I see Slade Gorton. After giving the \nSermon on the Mount, Jesus said:\n\n       Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill \n     cannot be hid; neither do men light a candle and put it under \n     a bushel, but on a candlestick, and it giveth light unto all \n     that are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, \n     that they may see your good works and glorify your Father, \n     which is in heaven.\n\n  Slade Gorton's light is very bright. I don't know of a brighter \nperson in the Senate, a smarter person. I have referred to him before \nas the E.F. Hutton of the Senate: When he would speak, we would all \nlisten. I know that is true in the Republican Conference. In his \nhalting way, it was worth stopping whatever you were doing to listen to \nhim, because what was said was worth remembering and to be valued and \nfollowed.\n  So Slade's light, in my view, still burns brightly, and cannot be \nhid; it should still be utilized. I cannot predict how this \nPresidential election will turn out, but I do hope that if it should be \nPresident Bush, he will see that light as brightly as I do and utilize \nSlade in the service of our country still because our country needs him \nand he has so much more yet to give.\n  Like Slade, I have known victory and defeat in running for the \nSenate. I had no greater friend when I first ran for the Senate, and by \na margin nearly the one by which he has now lost, I also lost. I \nremember his letter so vividly because he had worked so hard for me. It \ncame a few days after my defeat. He said how no defeat for a Senator's \nrace had ever affected him as badly as mine, except the time he had \nlost once before. And it was a hard and bitter thing. But he admonished \nme to get up and to try again, as he had tried again. He admonished me \nto serve and to not hide my light under a bushel because he needed me, \nand the farmers, the fishermen, and the foresters of the Northwest \nneeded me. I have the feeling they need me more now than ever with \nSlade's departure.\n  He also said--and I will never forget it--he told me it probably \nupset his law partners in Seattle--that the worst day in the Senate is \nfar better than the best day in the practice of law, which is another \nreason he labored so hard to come back and to serve. And it is a \nmarvelous privilege to be here, to serve the people you love at home.\n  Slade was right. I now know how he felt when he wrote that letter \nbecause I feel a great emptiness inside at the thought of his \ndeparture. But I know, as he knows, that in democracy you do not always \nget to win, but you always get your say. I hope the day will come, in a \ndifferent forum, perhaps, when Slade Gorton will have his say again.\n  Until then, I pray God's choicest blessings for Slade and Sally \nGorton to sustain them in this difficult transition and to help all of \nus who remain behind to fill his very considerable shoe size as a \nSenator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a number of statements regarding Senator Gorton and his \ndistinguished service. I want to take particular note of the statement \nby our colleague, Joe Lieberman, who could not be here today. Senator \nGorton and Senator Lieberman worked on many initiatives over the years. \nI want to read his statement:\n\n       Mr. President, I wish to express my greatest respect and \n     affection for Slade Gorton of Washington with whom I have \n     enjoyed working closely for a number of years. Slade's life \n     is characterized by his commitment to faith, family, service, \n     and law. As he leaves the Senate, I want to reminisce about \n     some of the matters I have been privileged to work with Slade \n     Gorton.\n       Over the years, Senator Slade Gorton has been a great \n     leader on educational reform, striving to raise the \n     performance of our nation's elementary and secondary schools \n     and the quality of education so that all children may reach a \n     high level of academic achievement. The senior Senator for \n     Washington and I have worked together on a number of \n     proposals to improve our educational system. His \n     contributions have led the way for better educational \n     accountability and innovation in the years ahead.\n       Of great importance to our country are Slade Gorton's \n     continued efforts to preserve and honor American history by \n     calling for stronger history curriculum standards and \n     literacy awareness in our colleges and universities. I truly \n     believe such endeavors help to unite our nation by \n     demonstrating the importance of our shared heritage and civic \n     culture as Americans.\n       One of my most memorable experiences with Slade was the \n     work we did together after the House impeached President \n     Clinton. All of us in the Senate knew that how we handled the \n     impeachment trial would test us all--both individually and as \n     an institution. We could either fall into intense \n     partisanship, miring ourselves and the country in lengthy and \n     disruptive proceedings that threatened to leave this \n     institution demeaned and scarred, or we could rise above \n     partisanship and join together in a way that preserved this \n     body's dignity while at the same time ensuring a full airing \n     of the issues before us.\n       Slade took the lead in guiding us to a dignified path, \n     formulating a plan that ultimately formed the basis of the \n     process the Senate adopted. Notwithstanding his personal \n     views, his love for his country and this institution led him \n     to put principle above partisanship and to formulate a plan \n     for resolving the impeachment case before it wreaked more \n     havoc on the Senate and the nation. I was delighted to work \n     on that plan with him, and was impressed again by the \n     civilized, thoughtful, and nonpartisan way in\n\n[[Page S11667]]\n\n     which Slade Gorton proceeded. I truly believe that his \n     leadership was instrumental in seeing the Senate through that \n     difficult time with honor.\n       Slade Gorton leaves the Senate with much to be proud of, \n     and much to look forward to. For my wife and myself, I send \n     Slade and Sally and their wonderful family love and every \n     good wish for the next great chapter of their lives.\n\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record several \neditorials regarding Senator Gorton's long service to our State of \nWashington.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Statement by Senator Murray in Tribute to Senator Slade Gorton\n\n       Mr. President, congressional lame duck sessions following \n     an election are a rarity. They usually arise when Congress is \n     unable to finish its business in a timely fashion and that is \n     true with this year as well. But this session affords me and \n     this Congress an opportunity to acknowledge and pay tribute \n     to the service of an esteemed colleague. Senator Slade \n     Gorton, the senior Senator from Washington state, will be \n     ending his service here after 18 years in the Senate.\n       Washingtonians regardless of party affiliation have come up \n     to me with high praise and appreciation for Senator Gorton's \n     long service to our state, our country and this proud \n     institution. I want to share with my colleagues a passage \n     from an editorial this week in the Everett Herald. The Herald \n     editorial reads, ``History will rank Gorton with Senator \n     Henry M. `Scoop' Jackson and Senator Warren G. Magnuson as an \n     extraordinary leader in D.C. on behalf of the state. \n     Throughout his career in the Senate and state government, \n     Gorton has been a leading force in many major efforts to \n     protect the environment. He also has been a consistent, \n     passionate advocate for individuals with problems dealing \n     with bureaucracy. Within the Senate, Gorton has been a grand \n     force for reasoned bipartisanship, never afraid to take a \n     strong stand but also willing to work graciously and \n     effectively with members of the opposition even at the \n     tensest moments.''\n       Many of our colleagues are well aware of Slade's history of \n     public service. As a young man, Slade Gorton moved to \n     Washington state from Chicago almost 50 years ago. He want to \n     go West in search of new opportunities. And with $300 and a \n     one-way ticket on a Greyhound bus, Slade Gorton moved to \n     Washington state.\n       History has shown that this Midwest native fit right into \n     Washington state. Like so many immigrants to our great state, \n     Slade Gorton was welcomed and given an opportunity to make \n     the most of his talents.\n       From the very beginning, Slade Gorton went to work on \n     behalf of Washington state. First, he married Sally Clark \n     from Selah, Washington. That same year--1958--Slade went into \n     politics and was elected to the Washington State House of \n     Representatives. In the Washington House, Slade rose to serve \n     as the Majority Leader.\n       In 1968, he was elected Attorney General of Washington \n     state. On numerous occasions on several historic cases, Slade \n     represented the people of Washington before the Supreme \n     Court. Chief Justice Warren Burger once said that Slade, \n     ``makes the best arguments before the Supreme Court of any \n     Attorney General in America.'' He was also recognized with \n     the prestigious Wyman Award given to the outstanding Attorney \n     General in the United States.\n       By this time, Slade had also become a respected leader \n     throughout Washington state. After three terms as the \n     Washington state Attorney General, Slade Gorton ran for and \n     won a seat in the United States Senate. He was elected three \n     times to the United States Senate--giving him an impressive \n     record of winning statewide election six times in Washington.\n       All of this is offered as a brief history of Slade's many \n     years of service. With time, there will certainly be many \n     public tributes to Senator Gorton. But what I'd like to focus \n     on now is our time together in the United States Senate and \n     the work we were able to do together over the last eight \n     years.\n       I am sure all of my colleagues share my own appreciation \n     for the support, guidance and sacrifices our families make so \n     that we can serve in the Senate. We rely on them in so many \n     ways. Slade is fortunate to have such a supportive family. \n     Sally and Slade have been partners for all of his years of \n     service. From Olympia, Washington, to Washington, D.C., Sally \n     Gorton has been there each and every day. She and Slade have \n     three children and seven grandchildren, who I know bring \n     immense pride to the Gorton family. So, as we acknowledge and \n     honor Slade Gorton, I want to pay special tribute to Sally \n     Gorton and the entire Gorton family.\n       Much has been said in Washington state about the \n     differences between Senator Gorton and myself. While Slade \n     and I have had our differences, not enough has been said \n     about our ability to work together on behalf of Washington \n     state. He was a champion for Washington state. When the \n     interests of Washington state were at stake, we were a great \n     team. I will miss our ability to work on a bipartisan basis, \n     combining our strengths, to represent our great state.\n       As my colleagues know, there is also no greater adversary \n     in the United States Senate than Slade Gorton. When Senator \n     Gorton took on an issue, everyone knew they had better \n     prepare for an energetic and spirited fight. Senators on both \n     sides of the aisle know what a challenge it is to take on \n     Senator Gorton.\n       Most of you didn't have to take those fights home to your \n     constituencies like I did. But those differences between \n     Senator Gorton and I were rare. And they were never personal \n     or vindictive. There were no political vendettas, and we were \n     always able to move on to the next issue of importance to our \n     constituents.\n       Ask the Clinton Administration and the Justice Department \n     what it is like to take on an issue and differ with Slade \n     Gorton. He was a champion for Microsoft in its ongoing legal \n     battles with the Department of Justice. I respected his work \n     on behalf of Microsoft and was proud to work with him on \n     behalf of our constituents. And certainly, all of Washington \n     state appreciated his determined efforts to represent one of \n     the great symbols of Washington state. Ask the Bush \n     Administration what it was like to do battle with Slade \n     Gorton when he fought his own party to save the National \n     Endowment for the Arts.\n       Slade Gorton also fought for the United States Senate. When \n     the Congress was struggling through a very partisan \n     impeachment process, it was Slade Gorton who along with our \n     colleague Senator Joe Lieberman stepped forward with a plan \n     for the Senate. Senator Gorton, in this instance as well as \n     in many others, had enormous respect for this institution. \n     That respect for the institution is evident in the respect he \n     enjoys among all Senators.\n       Despite Washington D.C.'s strong desire to label us all, \n     Slade was always open. When he took on a cause, he often \n     surprised people. Throughout his career in both Washingtons, \n     Slade defied labels.\n       Most recently, Senator Gorton and I worked very closely on \n     the issue of pipeline safety. Unfortunately, a tragedy in \n     Bellingham, Washington, claimed three young lives and scarred \n     a community forever. Slade was right there with me from the \n     very beginning, working to raise the profile of the issue and \n     eventually to pass through the Senate the toughest pipeline \n     safety legislation ever adopted by either body of Congress. \n     Senator Gorton was instrumental to this effort. Working \n     together, we took on some very powerful interests and \n     extracted tough compromises.\n       At the Appropriations Committee, Senator Gorton and I \n     teamed up in numerous instances each and every year to \n     advance and protect Washington's many interests from \n     agriculture research programs benefitting apple growers and \n     wheat farmers to export promotion programs and land \n     exchanges.\n       Washington was fortunate to be the only state whose two \n     senators both served on the Appropriations Committee. Of \n     course, Slade chaired the Interior Subcommittee where \n     Washington has so many interests. We worked together to clean \n     up the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. We were partners in the \n     effort to ease the Puget Sound area's very difficult traffic \n     congestion problems at the Transportation Subcommittee where \n     we both served.\n       Beyond the Appropriations Committee, there are so many \n     other issues that we worked well together on behalf of \n     Washington state. Commercial fisheries are immensely \n     important to our state and we worked closely on the Magnuson-\n     Stevens Act in 1996 and the American Fisheries Act in 1998. \n     We recently worked together to pay tribute to a Nisei veteran \n     and Washington state native William Kenzo Nakamura by naming \n     a courthouse after him in Seattle, Washington.\n       We worked collaboratively on selecting Federal judges in a \n     time when confirming judges was overly partisan. We succeeded \n     in getting our judges through this difficult process by \n     working together.\n       Time and again, we both worked to help Boeing in its \n     relationships with many foreign aircraft customers. Whether \n     working with USTR or a foreign government, Slade worked hard \n     for the almost 100,000 Washington state families who work at \n     Boeing and rely on aircraft sales.\n       Senator Gorton and I also worked closely on health care \n     issues important to our constituents. We worked together to \n     boost the growing biotech sector in our state and the \n     promising future that companies like Immunex and others are \n     building in Washington state. From securing research dollars \n     to representing the UW Medical School, Washington state's \n     health care needs were well served by the work of Senator \n     Gorton. Here, like in so many areas, he had a significant and \n     positive impact on our state. He was a champion on autism \n     issues, and I regularly worked with him to expand health care \n     for children.\n       Effective leaders attract talented people to their offices \n     and Senator Gorton has always had a very effective staff both \n     in Washington, DC, and throughout the State of Washington. He \n     has served as a mentor to literally thousands of \n     professionals. The family tree of Gorton staffers past and \n     present is a truly impressive list of Washingtonians. One of \n     Senator Gorton's greatest and lasting contributions to our \n     state will be the years of public service his former staffers \n     will give to Washington state.\n       My staff and I have worked closely with Senator Gorton's \n     staff. That working relationship was always interrupted by an \n     annual softball game that could be as competitive as any \n     Apple Cup football game between\n\n[[Page S11668]]\n\n     the University of Washington and Washington State University. \n     I am proud to say the Murray softball team won its share of \n     games. But so did the Gorton team. And there were a couple of \n     years where Senator Gorton himself contributed to his team's \n     wins. It was a friendly rivalry, but I think Slade will tell \n     you, we both really wanted to win that game.\n       The Gorton staff is as loyal as any on Capitol Hill. I am \n     sure they will have an opportunity to thank Senator Gorton \n     for all of his personal and professional guidance and \n     assistance, but I am also sure they would want me to say to \n     Senator Gorton that they believed in his work and that they \n     will always be proud to call themselves Gorton staffers.\n       This is certainly a time of change for the country and for \n     the Senate. And while Senator Gorton will leave the Senate, \n     we shouldn't expect to see him fade from the public scene. At \n     home, he will continue to be a respected leader with perhaps \n     many opportunities ahead to further shape and influence our \n     state.\n       And perhaps his service in Washington, D.C., will continue \n     as well. I am confident--just as he did almost 50 years ago \n     on the Greyhound bus--that Senator Gorton will make the most \n     of the new opportunities to come.\n       Senator Gorton, on behalf of the people of Washington \n     state, thank you for your many years of dedicated service. \n     Thank you for giving your time, your energy, and your wisdom \n     to people of our state and our country. We have benefitted \n     enormously from your work and we are grateful for your \n     service.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Seattle Times, Dec. 5, 2000]\n\n                   Gorton's Noteworthy Public Career\n\n       There is no particular joy in bidding farewell to the \n     state's senior senator, Slade Gorton.\n       This page endorsed his opponent, Maria Cantwell, and we \n     look forward to the changes in style and policy she can bring \n     to the job.\n       But we would be remiss if we failed to pay tribute in this \n     space to Gorton's distinguished public career. He was first \n     elected state legislator, then attorney general and has \n     served three terms as Senator.\n       Legacy is not a notion that comes easily to Gorton. Late in \n     the campaign, when asked what was the legacy of his years in \n     public service, he groped for a response. Perhaps that's \n     because Gorton's career was not a straight line toward clear \n     goals or major accomplishments.\n       As a legislator he was more pragmatist than ideologue. As \n     his Republican party moved to the right, Gorton feigned just \n     enough moves in that direction to stay in office, moves that \n     prompted criticism on this page and elsewhere.\n       A careful look at the sweep of is career reveals Gorton's \n     better impulses. He is credited with helping to save the \n     National Endowment for the Arts and the Forest Legacy \n     Program, a crucial source of funds for the Mountains to Sound \n     Greenway project along I-90.\n       Gorton was one of the saner voices in Congress during the \n     impeachment. He teamed with his friend, Democratic Sen. \n     Joseph Lieberman, to broker a middle-ground solution that \n     would short-circuit a trial. They were unsuccessful, but the \n     effort is a revealing example of Gorton at work during a \n     historic time in the nation's Capitol.\n       Gorton's name is attached to several major accomplishments \n     from the early years of his career. Lawyer and longtime civic \n     activist Jim Ellis credits Gorton with steering through the \n     state legislature the program known as Forward Thrust, a \n     package of major public works in King County.\n       Among his most loyal backers is a small army of women who \n     have worked for Gorton at various stages of his career.\n       Many have gone on to their own careers in public life.\n       Now, facing forced retirement by the narrowest of voter \n     margins, Gorton, 72, can contemplate a life of ongoing \n     service, possibly in a Bush administration, or better yet, as \n     a senior statesman in Washington State and the Northwest \n     where his talents are still welcome and much needed.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Tacoma News Tribune, Dec. 5, 2000]\n\n         Hold a Place for Gorton Among State's Political Giants\n\n                          (By Peter Callaghan)\n\n       It's a journalistic must-do.\n       When a prominent officeholder is defeated, we roll out the \n     retrospective articles--obituaries for the living.\n       We attempt to place our politicians in perspective before \n     we have any.\n       It's Slade Gorton's turn now. The 72-year-old U.S. \n     senator's defeat will become official Wednesday.\n       But he was pretty sure when the first count of votes was \n     released the day before Thanksgiving when he declared himself \n     ``cautiously pessimistic'' that a recount would make a \n     difference.\n       It didn't. Last Friday the county-by-county tally showed \n     that Democrat Maria Cantwell's lead actually grew by a few \n     hundred votes.\n       So Gorton walked in front of the cameras and the newsies to \n     make a very short statement. He took no questions.\n       That left others to pass judgment on a career in politics \n     that began in 1958. He served 10 years in the state House of \n     Representatives, 12 as attorney general and 18 in the U.S. \n     Senate.\n       Longevity is just one of the reasons he should be \n     considered for the same status as Warren Magnuson, Dan Evans, \n     Henry Jackson, Wesley Jones, Julia Butler Hansen and Tom \n     Foley--giants all.\n       Impact is another reason. So is presence. So is the breadth \n     of his legacy.\n       But there's a much different tone to Gorton's postmortem \n     than for the others. Much of the space is devoted not to what \n     he was but to what he wasn't.\n       He wasn't wildly popular. He wasn't able to generate \n     affection among voters. He wasn't one to bring home the bacon \n     in the form of dams and hospitals and military bases.\n       In a phrase, he wasn't Scoop and Maggie.\n       This presumes, of course, that Gorton could have been just \n     like Scoop and Maggie even had he wanted to be. Times had \n     changed. Gorton was elected in the GOP landslide that ushered \n     in the Reagan era.\n       It was a time of lowered expectations of the federal \n     government. It was a time when the ability to win hundreds of \n     millions of federal pork was at an end.\n       Heck, Scoop and Maggie wouldn't be Scoop and Maggie in \n     times such as those.\n       But Slade Gorton did manage to build his own legacy as a \n     smart, savvy politician who was the go-to guy in the \n     Washington state delegation for much of the last two decades.\n       If you want your politicians warm and fuzzy, don't knock on \n     Gorton's door. He was of a generation that didn't believe in \n     public displays of affection--especially the phony kind \n     practiced by some politicians.\n       That he never made an emotional connection with voters hurt \n     him in the two close elections that he lost in 1986 and 2000.\n       But most other times, Washington voters realized we were \n     electing a U.S. senator, not a host for a children's TV show.\n       Gorton did something few other politicians could--he \n     learned from that earlier defeat that he had to listen as \n     well as talk.\n       He learned to say thank you. He admitted that some of his \n     votes in his first term were mistakes and he asked voters for \n     a second chance.\n       They gave it to him.\n       That he lost twice shouldn't be a legacy-killer. We forget \n     how tough it has been for Republicans to win the governor's \n     office or the two U.S. Senate seats in Washington.\n       In fact, since 1954 only three Republicans have--Evans, \n     Gorton and John Spellman.\n       In that same time period, eight different Democrats have \n     won those offices--five men and three women.\n       Gorton overcame that handicap with a strategy that has \n     always drawn criticism--he ran against Seattle and exploited \n     the resentments many have for the state's biggest city. He \n     was accused of using so-called wedge issues that divided the \n     state.\n       But that in itself is a Seattle-centric critique. It's OK--\n     in fact, preferred--to represent Puget Sound to the detriment \n     of the rest of the state. Doing the opposite, however, is \n     divisive.\n       Cantwell won just five of the state's 39 counties. But she \n     is defined as a unifier while Gorton is a divider.\n       The campaign is too recent for liberals to view Gorton's \n     service as anything but a disaster.\n       But as time passes, perhaps they'll be more willing to give \n     him his due and allow him to take his place in state \n     political history with those other giants.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From the HeraldNet, Dec. 5, 2000]\n\n       Our Views--Maria Cantwell Follows a Great Line of Senators\n\n       With a history of outstanding U.S. senators, Washington \n     state is about to embark on what should be a fine new \n     chapter.\n       With time, Maria Cantwell ought to become another fine \n     senator for Washington. Indeed, the likelihood is that the \n     Democrat from Edmonds will become an effective, high-profile \n     member of the Senate early on. It certainly helps Cantwell's \n     visibility that her election appears to have broken the \n     Republican majority and given Democrats a 50-50 tie for the \n     next session.\n       The situation undoubtedly influenced two major networks to \n     interview Cantwell on their morning news shows Monday. As \n     Democrats point out, moreover, the election of the former \n     high-tech executive gives the country its first senator from \n     the new economy. Even in a Senate that includes a freshman \n     well enough known to have won election from New York without \n     using her last name, Cantwell's talents should earn her ample \n     notice.\n       While Cantwell is making a promising entry into the Senate, \n     Washington state certainly will miss the presence of longtime \n     Sen. Slade Gorton. Although Gorton would be an excellent \n     choice for a post in a possible Bush cabinet, the state has \n     lost the clout he carried as a senator with 18 years \n     seniority.\n       History will rank Gorton with Sen. Henry M. ``Scoop'' \n     Jackson and Sen. Warren G. Magnuson as an extraordinary \n     leader in D.C. on behalf of the state. Throughout his career \n     in the Senate and state government, Gorton has been a leading \n     force in many major efforts to protect the environment. He \n     also has been a consistent, passionate advocate for \n     individuals with problems dealing with bureaucracy. Within \n     the Senate, Gorton has been a grand force for reasoned \n     bipartisanship, never afraid to take a strong stand but also \n     willing to work graciously and effectively with members of \n     the opposition even at the tensest moments.\n       Gorton's career was certainly marked by tough fights with \n     opponents and a willingness to criticize liberals from the \n     Puget\n\n[[Page S11669]]\n\n     Sound region. That divisiveness, in fact, may have \n     contributed to his defeat by Cantwell. But he helped ensure \n     that the less urban areas of the state weren't forgotten.\n       To her credit, Cantwell campaigned to become a senator for \n     the entire state. She has promised, in fact, to visit each of \n     the state's 39 counties every year. That will be a \n     challenging but worthwhile task.\n       Cantwell has talked about the need for action on issues \n     that relate directly to people's lives, including \n     prescription drugs and controls on health maintenance \n     organizations. With her incisive understanding for policy \n     issues, demonstrated in both the state Legislature and the \n     U.S. House of Representatives, she could help create answers \n     to such difficult questions.\n       Her lack of seniority, though, deprives the state of the \n     significant influence over appropriations that Gorton \n     wielded, especially for environmental projects. The state, \n     and Cantwell, will have to look to Sen. Patty Murray to fill \n     as much of the gap as possible.\n       Cantwell returns to politics after making a fortune with a \n     high-tech company in just five years. As the careers of \n     Jackson, Magnuson and Gorton have demonstrated, the length of \n     service is a critical factor in making a great senator. \n     Cantwell should keep that in mind as she makes what is likely \n     to be an impressive entrance into the Senate of the United \n     States.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may need to the \nSenator from West Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today on a personal basis to \nreflect a little bit about the Slade Gorton I have known and worked \nwith over a number of years now. Even as I welcome Mary Cantwell into \nthe Senate, I also am very sorry to see Slade Gorton go--just because \nof the very extraordinary character he brought to this institution.\n  I worked with Slade very closely on the Commerce Committee. Our \njurisdictions, so to speak, overlapped a good deal. Our interests \noverlapped a good deal. One of the pieces of legislation where I \nthought you saw Slade working at his best, when he was so effective in \nthe Senate, was the reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Agency. \nThis was actually a very complicated piece of legislation. It was one \nthat was particularly difficult because the Senate as a whole has not \nbothered to engage itself particularly with the whole subject of \naviation and the enormity of the crisis which is facing us and which \nmanifests itself in the summer and tourist season and then is quickly \nforgotten as soon as the tourist season is over and the delays diminish \nsomewhat. One can see, as the industry grows, it also runs into more \nsevere problems, financially and otherwise.\n  Slade Gorton had an innate understanding of aviation, obviously, \nbecause of the State from which he came. But he was also a master \ncraftsman in terms of understanding issues, producing legislation, and \nthen forging a compromise that would lead to a result that, in effect, \nreauthorized the Federal Aviation Administration and put forth money on \nan unprecedented basis to do what needed to be done, both for our air \ntraffic control system and for the infrastructure which our Congress \nand our Nation just blithely ignore--complaining about \nnoise, complaining about delays, and then declining to do anything \nabout it. It is not a problem which fixes itself.\n\n  Slade was, in a sense, kind of a pioneer on this issue which in some \nways is similar to the IT phenomenon, the Internet; it burst upon us. \nBut people have been rather quick to learn about the new economy and \nthe Internet and rather slow to learn about a problem which is just as \nsevere and technical and just as complex as that one. But Slade, \nobviously, as is typical of him, never shirked his duty either to his \nState or to his country.\n  He has a work ethic. A ``work ethic'' simply describes itself, but \nthe way in which Slade Gorton has carried that out over all the years I \nhave worked with him is something which has both given me joy and a \ngreat sense of admiration. I don't know if there are any cartoons \nanywhere, but there are a lot of stories: One always sees Senator \nGorton at his desk--reading. The entire Senate can be engulfed in a \nconflagration of some sort, usually about something which means \nabsolutely nothing, but Slade Gorton understands that and so he simply \nturns to newspapers, journals, things which--again, with his very \nsuperior intellect--are increasing his knowledge, increasing his \nperspective and the depth of his ability, therefore, to be helpful to \nhis people, to his country, and to the Senate.\n  He had a very interesting position, too, in the Senate, in that he \nwas a very close adviser, and may remain so, to the majority leader, \nTrent Lott. He did not do that through the power of politics. He did \nnot lobby in the way that people often do when they run for offices, go \naround trying to pick up votes in that way. It was simply the power of \nhis reasoned, calm intellect, the even temperament of his nature, and \nthe compelling force of his logic and the calmness in which all of this \nevolved and presented itself, which I think--my guess would be--drew \nSenator Lott to understand that to rely on Slade Gorton's judgment and \nunderstanding and advice would be a very wise thing to do.\n  Slade Gorton and I did not necessarily have the same voting records, \nbut we often had the same approach to issues, not all of which I will \ndiscuss here, and we have come to differ on some of those issues. But I \nalways have had this deep sense of respect for him. He never was a \ntypical Senator. He was not a backslapper. Yet when he gave his word, \nyou needed to worry no more because that was it. As they say, his word \nwas his bond--and it really was.\n  He had always an excellent staff about him. Yet you always had the \nfeeling that Slade Gorton made all of the decisions and did, really, \nmost of the basic thinking himself because of the deeply thoughtful \nnature of his mind and his instinct about not just legislating but the \nway he conducted probably all his life.\n  I admire very much the fact that he has been in public life for so \nlong, and at the age of 72 sought to continue that public service. He \nhas expressed a deep belief in public service. There are many honorable \nprofessions, but I think public service is one of the hardest and most \nhonorable of all of them if it is carried out with serious intent and \nserious purpose. Ambition always accompanies public service, but \nambition has to be overruled in the final analysis by this concept of \nserving the public and of trying to make a better situation for the \nState one represents and also our Nation.\n  Slade is a Senator from the State of Washington but also from the \nUnited States of America. He understood that and exercised both of \nthose responsibilities. He argued, I am told, 14 times before the U.S. \nSupreme Court when he was attorney general of his State. That says to \nme that he did not simply, as is the case sometimes, particularly in \nmore recent years, jump for the top office or one of the top offices. \nHe worked his way up through the system. I admire that. It shows a \ndetermined, a very professional, long-term commitment to public service \nat whatever level and also respect for the experience one develops on \nthe way up as one serves in one's State and goes on to a more national \nforum.\n  He is and always will be a superb legislator. He has been a superb \nfriend to me. We have not spent a lot of time engaged in personal \ndiscussion, but there was a constancy in the way our relationship \nevolved and then maintained itself which always made me believe I could \ntrust Slade Gorton and look to Slade Gorton for sound advice and sound \njudgment on virtually any matter.\n  He is firm in his views, and I respect that. We differ often on \nviews, and yet it is never a personal matter. Again, it is a truly \nbrilliant, analytical, ordered mind coming to his conclusions in the \nway he thought best for him and for the people he represents.\n  When we talked personally, it was almost always about his \ngrandchildren; of course, about Sally, his wife, whom I think he \nmarried in 1958. He has seven grandchildren, and when there was \nfrustration about the Senate dragging on too long, he would talk about \nthe joy of being with his grandchildren. He talked at length about \nthat. That was another side of Slade Gorton: Slade Gorton the family \nperson, the tightly disciplined mind, and yet underneath a very warm \nsense of what, in many ways, is an even larger legacy, and that is, \nwhat is the nature of one's family, what is the nature of one's \nrelationship to the members of one's family.\n  I express my respect for him, my affection for him for his constancy \nof purpose and for his superbly honed\n\n[[Page S11670]]\n\nskills. His presence in the Senate is and will be always considered \nunique. He is a unique person, cerebral but effective, highly \nanalytical but deeply effective in the internal combat, whether it be \non the Appropriations Committee, the Budget Committee, the Commerce \nCommittee, the Energy Committee, or any of his various committees. He \nknows how to fight. He knows how to achieve what he wants for the \npeople of his State.\n  As I said at the beginning, I rise to express this respect, to \nexpress this sense of admiration for the nature of his abilities as a \nSenator and his broad expanse as a human being.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry: Is it time for the Senator from \nNew Mexico to speak about the departure of Senator Slade Gorton?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is under the control of the Senator \nfrom Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the Senator from \nNew Mexico whatever time he needs to speak about Senator Gorton.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am very sorry to ask for that. I thought Senators on \nour side had control. I am very pleased Senator Murray yielded to me.\n  Mr. President, I come this morning to speak about my friend, Slade \nGorton, who is leaving the Senate shortly. I thought I better do it \ntoday because, as most things around here, when you can get them done \nyou ought to because time flies and all of a sudden we find Senator \nGorton is out of the Senate and we have to speak before he leaves. \nToday, I want to take a few minutes to share with him and his wife \nSally, whom I hope will have occasion to read the Record, having served \nwith him in each of his 18 years in the Senate, what he has contributed \nand who he is.\n  It will not take me a long time to speak about him, although to tell \nthe truth, he probably is more noteworthy in my life in terms of being \na co-Senator on many things that are very big and important to our \nNation than any other single Senator here.\n  Slade Gorton is a quiet man. Even though he appears on the floor \nregularly to discuss things, he is a very thoughtful person and also a \nvery hard worker.\n  As we sometimes coin phrases, he is certainly a workhorse, not a show \nhorse, and he is a very special and unique person because he is also \nextremely thoughtful and shares willingly his wonderful ideas, \nthoughts, and innovations with us, his fellow Senators.\n  I think everybody knows that while he shares no official leadership \nrole and he works hours on end on a subcommittee called the \nSubcommittee on Appropriations for the Department of Interior, his \ncontributions go well beyond that. Wherever he touches things, either \nby committee work or by being called in by our majority leader to \ndiscuss issues to advise him, he leaves an imprint. It is not that he \nmust get his way all the time, but essentially he is rather compelling \nand does succeed most of the time by power of persuasion to leave his \nimprint in the Halls of the Senate, be it in this Chamber, while we \ndiscuss things seriously and collegially as Republicans or combined \nRepublicans and Democrats, or certainly where small groups of Senators \nmeet because they must meet in their leadership roles. He is almost \nalways among them.\n  From my own standpoint, I have had one major commitment, one major \nuser of my time in my work, and that is to understand and make sense of \nthe U.S. budget. While it is not my only job, it is one of those the \nSenate expects somebody to know a lot about if they are going to come \ndown here and talk about it. I have been privileged to work in that \ncommittee since its origin, believe it or not. It is a rather new \ncommittee, enforcing a rather new part of the Senate. We used to have \njust authorizing and appropriations, and some 26 years ago we had \nbudgeting. He has been on that committee with me through thick and \nthin.\n  Everybody should know that we did a lot of innovative things in that \ncommittee. We rather imaginatively broadened the scope called \nreconciliation where we can insist that things get done without being \nburdened by filibuster and untold amendments. We have done new and \ninnovative things to set aside money for only one purpose and it cannot \nbe used for anything else. These are all unique and different, along \nwith regular routine things.\n  It did not take very long, once these issues were put on the table \nand discussed, for Slade Gorton to understand them and to suggest ways \nof improving them. That is the way he is with everything he does.\n  He does not have to be the kingpin, but I guarantee you, those who \nare and who are forced to lead, if he is around helping them, you can \njust tell; You can see the imprint, the logic, the strength of argument \nthat comes from him being directly involved or indirectly being a \nhelper.\n  I am not sure in the history of the Senate how we are going to rate \nSenators over time, but I suggest that Slade Gorton will certainly be \nrecognized in some very special way for his 18 years because there will \nbe few who trace this history who may just look around and say: Who \nwere the leaders? Who was the majority leader? Who was the minority \nleader? Who was this or that in terms of a formal job? And then \nattribute to them some direct legacy in this 18-year span that he \nserved, being absent 2 years while he sought election again.\n  But if it is looked at carefully, Slade Gorton has to come out near \nthe top of the list of influential Senators in the conduct of \noccurrences of significance in the Senate. I am not sure how that will \nbe picked up because much of it occurs in meetings that are not public \nnot private meetings but meetings that are just not known because they \nare in the leader's office or a committee room.\n  But what I want to say to him is: You will be missed because while \nyou have been here, you have been felt. People have known you were \nhere. They knew your presence, your intellectual presence, your \nhumanity, your loyalty, and, yes, your skill at knowing when things \nought to happen. Slade has a real knack for knowing: Well, it is about \ntime to spring this. He will be there doing that and, sure enough, it \nwill go unnoticed that he was the one who got it done.\n  Individually, from my standpoint, he has been at my side every time \nwe have had major events on the floor that I have had to manage. There \nhave been many, they have been long, and they have been arduous.\n  When I had to test them and tried them on for size with Slade Gorton, \nand he said, ``That's the way to do it,'' no one will really know what \nthat has meant. Nobody will really understand how influential saying \n``that's the way to do it'' from Slade Gordon really is in terms of \nmany of us here.\n  He has a wonderful wife Sally and three great, wonderful children. I \nhope whatever happens in the next few years, since he is so \nknowledgeable about the workings of our Government, not just those \nitems within bills on which he worked so hard called appropriations, \nbut he knows about many things in Government, I close by saying, many \nof us raise our hand and say, yes, we are lawyers, and some of us know \nfull well we are not lawyers any longer; we have been away from the \nprofession for years. We are not what one would call a lawyer's lawyer. \nBut after all these years in public life, Slade Gorton could step into \nthe most significant of legal offices in America and be a great, \nparticipating, achieving modern-day lawyer, even after all these years \nof not being in the legal profession. He must have been a great \nsolicitor. He appeared before the U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of his \nState and made some very interesting law when he was a lawyer for his \nState, either in his attorney general's office or otherwise.\n  So I want to say to him, whatever it is you choose now, Senator \nGorton, and Sally, whatever you choose, I hope you will be around so we \ncan continue to share with you, an occasional opportunity to share a \nmeal, an occasional social event, or, even better, an opportunity from \ntime to time to just listen to you tell us what you think of how it is, \nhow you observe it, and, in a way, continue to bless us with all those \nmarvelous qualities you bring here.\n\n  You have brought from your State a degree of pride to the Senate that \nis very difficult to replace. Far be it from\n\n[[Page S11671]]\n\nme to judge any other Senator from any other State or even his own \nState, but Senator Slade Gorton will be here a long time in memory \nbecause many will know what he thought about the Senate and how he \nthought about us.\n  It is hard to say he will not be down here at that seat, arguing with \nus on important issues. But he will be here because I cannot imagine \nthat people who lived and worked with him all these years--I see one \nhere on the floor, the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, who knows about it very well--will ever forget him, and we \nwill not let the Senate forget.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time is left under my control?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time does the Senator from New Hampshire need?\n  Mr. GREGG. I would like to have about 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire have 5 minutes, the Senator from North Dakota have 3 \nminutes, and that any other Senators who wish to bring their statements \nand have them printed in the Record at this point regarding Senator \nGorton be able to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I temporarily object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Washington for the courtesy of \nrecognition.\n  Mr. President, I join with my colleagues in praising and expressing \nour appreciation for the opportunity to work with and know as a \ncolleague in this body Senator Slade Gorton from Washington. I expect \nto continue to work with and know Senator Slade Gorton for many years. \nBut, unfortunately, he will be leaving this body, which is too bad \nbecause I consider him to be one of the truly extraordinary people I \nhave had a chance to get to know.\n  I would describe him as delightful and extraordinary--delightful as a \nperson, extraordinary as a Senator. He brings to this Senate a \nuniqueness which is special. He has a freshness about him, a way of \napproaching the issues which is always creative and imaginative. He has \ntrue love for this institution. He especially understands its rules and \nthe way it works.\n  He is one of the few senior Members on our side of the aisle who will \nsit in the chair for hours and hours in order to officiate over the \nSenate. In fact, I think every year he has been here he has received \nwhat is known as the Golden Gavel for sitting in the Chair for 100 \nhours, something usually received by junior Members of the Senate, but \nbecause of his interest in and intensity and love for and commitment to \nthis body, he has enjoyed the opportunity to preside. And he has \npresided extraordinarily well.\n  He, however, as the Senator from New Mexico has mentioned, has been \nprobably less visible than many Members of the Senate but has had much \nmore impact than most of us. His actions and effectiveness are really \nin the famous back halls and meeting rooms of the Senate. Very few \npieces of legislation have moved through this body that do not, in some \npart, have the fingerprints of Slade Gorton on them.\n  He is truly an effective tactician, but more importantly, he is an \neffective spokesperson for a philosophy. And he knows how to move that \nphilosophy forward within our institution.\n  As a result, he has had a tremendous impact on the legislative \nactivity of this body over the years. I suppose we shouldn't be \nsurprised at that though. The truly great Senators in this body--I \nsuggest that maybe one of them is Daniel Webster--have come from a \ntradition from which Slade Gorton also comes. He went to school in New \nHampshire. He went to school at Dartmouth, as did the great Daniel \nWebster. Maybe he learned at Dartmouth some of those characteristics \nwhich carried both Webster and him forward so well. Clearly, those \ncharacteristics are unique and special. We take pride in New Hampshire \nin claiming a little bit of Slade Gorton for our own.\n  As I think of him, I think of a friend, somebody to whom I could \nalways go talk to get ideas. We talked about his family that he so \nloved, Sally and his children, his grandchildren, his nieces, nephews. \nHe used to go to hockey league for his niece all the time. She is a \nwonderful hockey player. He is totally committed to his family.\n  It was a pleasure to have the chance to sit down and talk with him on \nany subject, but especially when it came to issues of family and what \neverybody was up to and what everybody was doing. That is the priority \nfor Slade and Sally. At one point, they took a bike ride across the \ncountry, which must have been an amazing experience, the whole family \nriding across the country.\n  He set an example for those of us who came here after him. As we look \naround this institution, we often refer to people: He reminds me of so-\nand-so, he reminds me of some Senator from here or some Senator here at \nsome other date. I must say, I can't think of higher praise than if \nsomeone were to come up to me some day and say: You know, you remind me \na lot of Slade Gorton and the way he worked as a Senator. That, to me, \nwould be the highest praise I could receive because I consider him to \nbe one of the finest, if not the finest, Senator I know.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 3 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I saw the Senator from Washington, Mrs. \nMurray, talking about her colleague, Senator Slade Gorton. I wanted to \ncome over and say a word about Senator Gorton.\n  I know people who perhaps watch the proceedings of the Senate see the \ntug and the pull of debate on public policy and probably think to \nthemselves, gee, those people don't get along very well, or maybe those \npeople don't like each other very much.\n  The fact is, most of us get along well and enjoy each other's \ncompany. Slade Gorton is one of those Senators, a Republican, someone \nwith whom I have severed on the Appropriations and Commerce Committees. \nWe get along well, like each other, and he has been extraordinarily \nhelpful to me. He is a Senator who always did his homework. There are \nsome with whom you visit about the issues, you get kind of a glassy-\neyed stare because you know that this isn't an issue on which they are \nconnecting with you or haven't studied very much. I didn't find that \nwith Slade Gorton. He was always prepared and had always done his \nhomework. And while at times he could be a bit frustrating because he \ntook a position on an issue that you might have felt was the wrong \nposition, he always had an opportunity to explain it because he had \ndone his homework.\n  He was a fellow with an independent and stubborn streak, somebody who \nwas patient and helpful. I enjoyed the opportunity to serve with him in \nthe Senate.\n  He actually was elected to the Senate for the first time the same \nyear I was elected to the U.S. House in 1980. We had an opportunity to \nbe on a panel discussion way back in 1980 and talked about our entry \ninto that Congress.\n  One of the things Slade Gorton told me was that he had bicycled \nacross North Dakota. I was surprised by that, but apparently he and his \nfamily had bicycled all across America. And in doing so, they had \nbicycled across I-94 or highway 2 through the State of North Dakota. We \nhad a chance to talk a little about his acquaintance with North Dakota \nfrom a bicycle.\n  This is not a eulogy. We have a number of Members of the Senate who \nare leaving us, distinguished people who have given immense public \nservice to this country. I have deep admiration and respect for all of \nthem. Because my colleague from the State of Washington was talking \nabout her colleague, Senator Gorton, I wanted to come to say that I \nhave enjoyed serving with him. He has been very helpful to me in a \nrange of ways on both the Commerce Committee and the Appropriations \nCommittee. I wish him well as he leaves his service here in the Senate.\n  I will come to the floor at some point to speak about the other \nSenators who\n\n[[Page S11672]]\n\nhave contributed so much and who are now leaving the Senate Chamber.\n  I thank Senator Murray for doing this. She is a remarkable \nRepresentative from her State, as was Senator Gorton. We will now be \njoined by another Senator, Ms. Cantwell, from the State of Washington, \nand I look forward to working with her as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 3 minutes. Under the \nprevious order, the time until 12 noon is under the control of the \nSenator from Wyoming, Mr. Thomas, or his designee.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, my good friend from Wyoming is here and \nhas consented that I might take up to 5 minutes of his time at this \ntime. I ask unanimous consent I be recognized for that purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I was in a meeting with the joint \nleadership discussing the current problems regarding the last \nappropriations bills and was not able to be here during the time set \nfor comments about our good friend and my southern neighbor, Senator \nGorton.\n  It is with deep sadness that I come to join in the comments \nconcerning Senator Slade Gorton. I think he has been an exemplary \nMember of our Senate and has provided enormous contributions to the \nwell-being of the country in his efforts as a Senator.\n  It is and has been a matter of great pride for me to call Slade and \nSally Gorton personal friends. I have visited with them. We have \ntraveled together to other places in the world. It is highly necessary \nfor Members of the Senate to travel and try to learn firsthand the \nproblems of other continents, such as Antarctica, Australia. I remember \nwe went to eastern Russia, and we have traveled many times into the \nNATO countries together. It is on those trips that we really get to \nknow one another even better than we do in the Senate in Washington.\n  Of course, my friend and I have been able to meet as I have gone \nthrough his State. Alaskans go through either Utah, Illinois, or \nWashington to get home from Washington, D.C. Quite often, I have spent \ntime in Washington State and have visited with Slade Gorton and Sally \nabout the problems of our area. He has been a fierce protector of the \ninterests of the State of Washington in the Senate. As a westerner, he \nand I have shared many issues and faced the problem of finding \nsolutions to some of these difficulties that we face in the Pacific \nNorthwest together. We have worked with our friend, Senator Murray, on \nthese issues. I think we have had a good working team together.\n  We have often, as members of the Pacific Northwest group in the \nSenate, had to go head to head with almost every Member of the Senate \nand the administration to try to protect the interests of the Pacific \nNorthwest. We are an area that many people do not understand. It is an \narea that requires an enormous amount of personal contact with our \nconstituents in order to make certain we are on the right track.\n  Senator Gorton has been to my State quite often, along with me and my \ncolleague, Senator Murkowski, to try and make certain we are reflecting \nthe concerns of our people as we address the concerns of the people of \nthe State of Washington at the same time.\n  When I came to the Senate, an elderly Senator told me that there were \ntwo types of Senators: the workhorses and the show horses. You have to \ndecide which one you are going to be.\n  It is obvious that an Alaskan has only one choice. We are one-fifth \nthe size of the United States. We have more than half the coastline in \nthe United States. And we have about the same number of people as the \nsmaller States in the lower 48, in terms of geography, that are much \ntinier compared to our State.\n  Senator Gorton, with his background, as we heard, coming from the \neast coast originally, very well educated, very well read, and probably \none of the most well-read younger Senators in the Senate, has had the \nproblem of trying to decide what to do. He, too, decided to become a \nSenator and is one whom I would call a workhorse. He has worked \ndoggedly on issues pertaining to his State. His staff is probably one \nof the best staffs I have seen work on issues pertaining to the Pacific \nNorthwest.\n  When we look at the problems of America from the point of view of the \nSenate, we would have to really take into account the people Senators \nrepresent. The State of Washington has given its Senators great \nflexibility in terms of addressing issues that deal with the Pacific \nNorthwest and our Nation. There is no question that in his three terms \nin the Senate, Senator Gorton has been one of the pivotal votes in \ndetermining the policies of that area.\n  I know they will be going back to Washington. And I think we will \nhear a great deal of Slade Gorton and Sally. They have concerns about \nthe country and concerns about our area that are unique. I believe they \nare going to continue to contribute to the solutions to the problems \nthat I mentioned before.\n  I am really here to thank him for his friendship and for the dignity \nhe has brought to the office of United States Senator. I really believe \nhe showed great compassion as he spent 2 years out of the Senate when \nhe was not elected after a second term, and he came back again after 2 \nyears and became even a greater Senator because of that. He has been a \nstrong Senator, a thoughtful Senator, a hard-working Senator, and a \ngreat personal friend.\n  I don't look forward to making statements such as this. I certainly \ndon't look forward to losing the partnership I have had with the \nSenator from Washington, Slade Gorton, in dealing with the problems of \nthe Pacific Northwest.\n  I thank the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we find ourselves in a predicament as old \nfriends. Of course, we are this morning talking about our friend Slade \nGorton from the State of Washington. In a way, we were classmates. We \ncame here in 1988. Of course, it was not his first time here, since he \nwas defeated in 1986 and then came back and won reelection in 1988.\n  We had a lot of things in common--not only representing the \nNorthwestern part of these 48 contiguous States. We also have great \nfriendship and we served on some of the same committees. I took from \nhim great lessons about this body and how to represent our \nconstituencies. He and Sally have been friends with Phyllis and me for \nall these many years while he has been serving in his second and third \nterms.\n  We in Montana have a quality that I think will become more and more \nadmired as this country grows and matures. We are brutally honest with \neach other in that part of the world. I spent my time in business--in \nthe cattle business and the auction business. People will just tell it \nlike it is. If you like it, that is fine. If you don't like it, well, \nthat's the way it is. Slade Gorton is that kind of a person. He is \nprobably the most pragmatic of all of our Members with whom I have had \nan opportunity to serve in this body, and he is brutally honest.\n  I have made speeches before graduating classes and a lot of other \nplaces, and I am always interested in the way people treat the history \nof our country. We have revisionists who like to gloss over some of the \nwarts, the bruises, and the bumps this country has encountered in all \nits history. That is not to say it is not the best country in the \nworld, but we have historians who tend to revise things.\n  As you know, for those who do not study history and have little or no \ninstitutional knowledge of our country and the way it was built, one \nhas to remember that we make decisions based on history and it affects \nall of us in the future. I have often said those folks who tend to \nrevise history also tend to tinker with the compass of our Nation, \nbecause our decisions are still based on history. Slade, being the \nbright and honest man that he is, understands this body and this \ncountry so well. He understands our history as it truly is, not as \nrevisionists would have us believe. And I hope historians pay him the \nsame respect and remember him as the great man and great Senator that \nwe know today.\n  As you know, many years ago when his family was young and he was a \nlittle younger, Slade took a bicycle trip from Olympia, WA, to Boston, \nMA. I\n\n[[Page S11673]]\n\nsaid, ``That is a long trip, Slade.'' He said, ``It was. We spent all \nof it in Montana.'' It is a very long State. In fact, from the Yaak to \nAlzada, MT, it is further than it is from Chicago to Washington, DC, as \nthe crow flies.\n  But that tells you something about the man, and it also tells you \nsomething about the family.\n  Nobody in this body has fought harder for property rights, the \ncornerstone of a free society; fought harder for States' rights; and \nfor what he offered in education to take the money that flows from what \nI call ``17 square miles of logic-free environment'' to the local \ncommunities to let the local communities decide how to use that money. \nIf they need teachers, they could hire teachers. If they need bricks \nand mortar, they could build. But the decisions on how to use those \ndollars at the local level should be made at the local level to fill \ntheir needs. Nobody fought harder for that.\n  The chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Stevens, a while \nago alluded to the fact that in this body there are show horses and \nworkhorses. And all of us know that Slade is a workhorse. I will tell \nyou, you couldn't hook him wrong, and he worked from both sides of the \ntongue. There will be some folks who will figure that out and some \nfolks who never will. But it is a quality that every Senator should \nhave.\n  I remember his fight to keep Mariners baseball in Seattle. They could \nhave lost that ball team had it not been for his efforts to save \nprofessional baseball in Seattle, because it was important to him and \nit was important to his people.\n  He will be missed here. What he leaves with a lot of us will be used \nfor many years to come.\n  We don't say goodbye to our friends, we just say so long, because our \ntrails will cross later on in our lives. The friendship forged between \nthe Gortons and I will never be forgotten. We will miss him, and we \nwish him well. But his influence on this body will be felt for years to \ncome.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I wanted to come over this morning and join \nmy colleagues in talking about our dear friend and colleague, Slade \nGorton. I don't have enough time this morning to list all the things \nthis good man has done for America. It is hard to even contemplate \nlifting all of the times he has provided critical leadership for the \nSenate.\n  The thing that stands out most about Slade is that he is wise. There \nis a difference between intellect and wisdom. Intellect is, in my \nopinion, often overrated. I see intellect as being like the lens on \nyour camera. The better that lens is, the wider your frame can be on \nthe picture and the finer the detail can be on that picture. So if you \nare blessed to have good intellect, you are advantaged. What is \nimportant is the ability to take the information that your lens on the \nworld can see and put that into a perspective where it has meaning. \nThat is where wisdom comes in.\n  Slade Gorton, we would agree by almost acclamation, is one of the \nsmartest Members of the Senate. But he is more than that. He is wise. \nHe has the ability to recognize when something is important and when it \nshould be pushed forward and when it represents a potential consensus; \nbut he has the judgment in knowing, in pushing for the things he is \nfor. In the end, it is seldom good policy and it seldom makes good \npublic policy to run over people.\n  I say to our colleagues, Slade Gorton is one of the most \nextraordinary men who has served in the Senate during my tenure in the \nSenate. He will be missed in the Senate. I believe Slade is the kind of \nperson that we grew up as children reading about in history books. I \nthink even in this age of cynicism about people who serve in public \noffice, Slade Gorton stands out as exactly the kind of person the \nfounders had in mind when they wrote the Senate into the Constitution. \nI think Slade Gorton in his record would stand up in a comparison to \nanyone who has ever served in this body or anyone who has served in any \nlegislative body ever.\n  For those who know and love Slade and who have worked with him in \nWashington, it is hard to understand how people back in the other \nWashington, a continent away, could not reelect Slade Gorton to the \nSenate. I think it is important to remember the final judgment \nultimately comes as people look in perspective at somebody's service.\n  In my State, our greatest hero, our most beloved citizen, was \ndefeated by the voters of Texas not once, but twice. He was defeated \nthe first time after he came close to casting the deciding vote, he was \non the losing side, on the Kansas-Nebraska Act which he saw as \nproducing the Civil War. And it did. And then as Governor, Sam Houston \nrefused to sign the bill taking Texas out of the Union. So he was \nrejected by the voters of Texas twice. Yet he is the most honored of \nour citizens.\n  For those who serve in public office, it is important to remember \nthat it is not personal; that people change their mind; that people \nhave their own will; that people have their own perspective. In the \nend, it is good service, it is dedication, and it is effectiveness on \nbehalf of the people who elect you that makes a great elected public \nofficial.\n  I join my colleagues this morning in thanking Slade Gorton for \nserving. I am confident in the future when names are listed who belong \nin the Senate, names that will be remembered here, Slade Gorton's name \nwill be on the list.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, when I think of my dear friend Slade \nGorton, I am reminded of how many of our colleagues are frequently \nsaying: I wish I were Governor; or, I really ought to be out making \nsome money; or, I am really not satisfied being 1 of 100; or, there \nmust be something better I could be doing with my life.\n  I have heard that from many of our colleagues on both sides of the \naisle. I once asked Slade Gorton: Slade, did you ever think about \nrunning for Governor? And he said: Absolutely not. I wouldn't have that \njob. He said: I love the legislative process.\n  And no one is better at the legislative process than our good friend \nSlade Gorton.\n  I forget which brokerage house it was, but there used to be \ncommercials that said, when so and so spoke, everyone listened. Whether \nit was the Republican conference meetings or on those rare occasions \nwhen all Members met together, Slade Gorton was rarely the first one to \ntalk, but when he spoke, everyone listened.\n  Slade Gorton is one of the great Senators of the 20th century. He had \na sense of the history of this body. I had an opportunity to serve with \nhim recently on a committee that Senator Lott and Senator Daschle \nappointed to select two Senators to be added to the portraits just \noutside the door. For about 40 years, we have had five that were \ndesignated as the five greatest Senators back in the early 1960s or in \nthe mid-1950s. The thought was that we would add two more Senators to \nthe list.\n  Slade sort of led our side, which consisted of the majority leader \nand myself and him, in reaching the conclusion that if we were going to \npick someone of this century it made a lot of sense to pick Arthur \nVandenberg, who had been chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee \nand had really made the Truman policy of containment in the development \nof NATO a bipartisan matter, since there was, in fact, a Republican \nCongress right after World War II. Slade thoughtfully analyzed all of \nthe possibilities and recommended Arthur Vandenberg because he thought \nthe single most important thing of the second half of the 20th century \nwas the winning of the cold war.\n  Out of all the many things that occur here, he was able to sort that \nout and come up concisely with what was, indeed, the biggest challenge \nof the second half of the previous century, the winning of the cold \nwar, and applying that to the Senate and coming up with an individual \non our side of the aisle, which was our charge, who would help make \nthat policy bipartisan. And of course, it lasted until the Berlin Wall \ncame down in 1989. That is the kind of thinker Slade Gorton is.\n  Out of all the maneuvering that occurs here, all of which is \nimportant, all of which has an impact on the ultimate outcome, Slade \nuniquely could look beyond that and see the big picture and\n\n[[Page S11674]]\n\nsort of bring Members out of our contentious decisions in conference \nabout whatever the particular issue was to see a larger picture of what \nwas not only in the best interests of our party, but more importantly, \nwhat was in the best interests of the country.\n  He is an extraordinary legislative strategist. I know he is going to \nmiss being in the Senate because he didn't think there was a better job \nsomewhere else he ought to be doing. Being in the Senate to Slade was \nnever his second choice. It was his first choice. Every one of our \ncolleagues who has been Governor and come to the Senate says a Senator \nwho used to be Governor who tells you they like the Senate better will \nlie to you about other things.\n  That, clearly, was not Slade's view. This was not his second choice. \nThis was where he wanted to be.\n  We are going to miss his friendship. He was one of my best friends in \nthe Senate and, I would say even if he were not on the floor, which he \nis, one of the two brightest guys in the Senate, the other one being \nthe Senator from Texas from whom we just heard.\n  But we are not going to lose contact with Slade, many of us. I know \nthere will be a new challenge for him. He is bright and vigorous and \ncommitted to public service. Someplace, hopefully in the very near \nfuture, there will be an opportunity for him to continue to make a mark \non our wonderful country.\n  So we say goodbye to you, Slade, in the Senate, but look forward to \ncontinuing our friendship in the years to come. The Senate will \ncertainly be a poorer place without your presence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/07/senate-section/article/S11674-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

Mr. President, it is with a sense of deep gratitude \nthat I have this opportunity to speak on the Senate floor for one last \ntime before I conclude my term in the Senate. There are few \ncompensating factors for the lame duck session in which we find \nourselves, but one is the opportunity for one who has lost an election \nto come back and make a few last remarks. This sort of makes this like \nhome. At home I always have the last word--``Yes, dear.'' And to have a \nlast word here is a pleasing thing for me.\n  Obviously, I am deeply grateful, and, as I think about the \nopportunity I have enjoyed to be in the Senate, it is a set of thoughts \nthat are characterized by gratitude. I am grateful to God that we are \ncreated as individuals with the capacity to shape the tomorrows in \nwhich we live. If freedom has a definition, it is that--that we can \nchange things. And, obviously, we want to change things for the better.\n  America respects that understanding of the creation and how we act as \nindividuals with a Government that represents the people as agents of \nchange, making decisions about the kind of community we want to have. \nAny of us who has the opportunity to represent fellow citizens \nobviously is in a position to do great things and to enjoy the ability \nto fulfill what God has destined for us to do, and that is to shape the \ntomorrows in which we live.\n  I want to thank the citizens of Missouri first. It is a community \nthat I love and that I respect. Janet and I live in Missouri, obviously \nbecause I was raised there, but by our choice. I have had the \nopportunity to serve the people of Missouri for 33 years. I began \nteaching in Southwest Missouri State University as a way of serving the \npeople of the State of Missouri. And then, one of the most important \nmentors in my life, and one of the individuals who perhaps represents \nwhat Missouri is and what Missouri stands for more than any other \nsingle individual, the senior Senator of this State, Senator Kit Bond.\n  He accorded me the opportunity to serve as the State auditor of \nMissouri when he vacated that office upon his election as Governor. I \nhad first offered myself to the people of Missouri to serve in the U.S. \nCongress, and they had expressed their profound affection for me, \nindicating that I should stay in Missouri and not go to the Congress. \nKit Bond, recognizing that, appointed me to be the State auditor of \nMissouri.\n  It began a marvelous set of opportunities for me for which I am \ngrateful in every respect. I served as the State auditor for 2 years. I \nlater served as the attorney general of Missouri after a short period \nof time as an assistant attorney general in Missouri, and that was a \nnotable experience. I had the wonderful privilege of sharing an office \nwith a now Justice of the Supreme Court, Clarence Thomas. We were in \nthe same room together for 16 months. That is a historic item that I \ndid not understand the history of at the time, but I certainly do now.\n  I had the chance, after serving 8 years as attorney general, of going \non to be Governor of the State of Missouri for 8 years. What a \nmarvelous opportunity it was to work with the community, to work with \npeople, to shape our community in a way which was constructive and \nreinforced the things in which we believed.\n  This past election obviously was a disappointment for me, but I am \nnot disappointed in the people of Missouri. The tragedy of this \nelection, the death of my opponent and his son in a plane crash of \nunspeakable disaster, was one that the Missouri community responded to \nwith two values and virtues that I cherish about our community--the \nvalue and virtue of compassion. I want America and Missouri to be a \nplace of compassion.\n  What a tremendous and wonderful thing it is when people are \ncompassionate and share the feelings of each other, and the value of \nrespect, particularly respect for those who have gone on and have been \nof service. In expressing those values, the people of Missouri decided \nthey would honor the deceased Governor by voting in his behalf and in \nhis stead in the election rather than voting for me, and I respect them \nfor that and I honor them for that. It is a great community. They are a \ncommunity to be loved and respected, and I profoundly love and respect \nthem.\n  I wish well Mrs. Carnahan who will succeed me in this seat in the \nSenate. I thank her for coming by my office yesterday. I hope she is \ntreated with kindness. I told her yesterday that I was pleased to see \nher and have the opportunity to communicate with her, and I reminded \nher yesterday that 30 days from now she will be my Senator, and I want \nher to do well.\n  I thank, in addition to Missourians, my staff. I am delighted the \nSenate has agreed to allow them all to be here on the floor of the \nSenate during these remarks. When I came to the Senate, my staff and I \ndecided there were values and principles we wanted to honor in \neverything we did. We wanted those values and principles to transcend \ncircumstances. We wanted them to be controlling factors of our conduct. \nSo we spent some time together.\n  Early in my time in the Senate, I came to the floor of the Senate and \nplaced in the Congressional Record this statement of service, \ncommitment, and dedication that each member of my staff joined me in \nformulating. This one hangs near the desk of\n\n[[Page S11675]]\n\nAnnie Billings in my office. I asked each staff member to sign this \ncommitment and then I signed the commitment, too, so each one of these \nitems contains the signature both of the staff, the real workers of the \nSenate, and the Senator, at least in this case, who relied so heavily \non their work.\n\n  I did not want to set the standards for my office absent the staff's \nparticipation because I believed the staff would help me reflect \nprofoundly the values of the people of Missouri--and, indeed, they did. \nEach member of my staff took the pledge, the pledge that is contained \nin this statement of service, commitment, and dedication--high \nstandards of service.\n  Our pledge states, and I will read part of it:\n\n       We dedicate ourselves to principled public policy. We \n     believe that Americans are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable rights, and among these are life, liberty \n     and the pursuit of happiness. The power we exercise is \n     granted by Missourians and the American people; we serve to \n     secure their rights. Our commitment is to respect diverse \n     political views and serve all people by whose consent we \n     govern.\n       As people of liberty reach for opportunity and achieve \n     greatness, our Nation prospers. A government that lives \n     beyond its means and reaches beyond its limits violates our \n     basic liberties, and the Nation suffers. We dedicate \n     ourselves to quality service. America's future will be \n     determined by the character and productivity of our people. \n     In this respect, we seek to lead by our example. We will \n     strive to lead with humility and honesty. We will work with \n     energy and spirit. We will represent the American people with \n     loyalty and integrity. Our standard of productivity is \n     accuracy, courtesy, efficiency, integrity, validity, and \n     timeliness. We hold that these principles are a sacred \n     mandate. We take responsibility for these standards.\n\n  I thank my staff for helping me formulate that format for our \nservice, and I thank them for, in every instance I know, pursuing the \nfulfillment of that format and formulation for public service. It is an \nhonor to serve with individuals who are in pursuit of principle, and my \nstaff has been consistent in that respect.\n  We have literally in the last Congress had over 550,000 constituent \ncontacts with our office, to which we have made millions of responses \nbecause frequently we can acknowledge the contact and then provide \nadditional service or otherwise follow up. There have been 110,000 \nspecific cases in which individuals had dealings with the Federal \nGovernment, and we were able to facilitate those dealings. So I thank \nthe staff. I thank them for their dedication to principle and for \nunderstanding that working with humility and integrity and industry and \ntimeliness is a way of fulfilling a sacred trust in the people of my \nState.\n  I thank the Members of the Senate. This is an institution that is \nunique. The function of the Senate is a very frustrating one, and real \nfulfillment probably is found in the friendships of the Senate more \nthan in the function of this body. I have to say that this opportunity \nfor my service in the Senate has been one that has been a fulfilling \nexperience, in sum because we have been able to achieve things that are \nvery important, in other respects as a result of the relationships that \ncome with the friendships in the Senate.\n  I have the very pleasing opportunity to think of myself as a friend \nof each Member of the Senate, and I am grateful for that. I am \nparticularly grateful for the leadership that has been kind to me. For \nSenator Lott--and, of course, I have had a lot of fun with Senator Lott \nas a Singing Senator. That has ruined more than 1 day for other \npeople--but the leader has been kind to me in every respect. His \ndemeanor in leading this body is one of kindness to every Member.\n  Senator Nickles--I had the privilege of nominating him as assistant \nmajority leader, and I respect greatly his contribution.\n  I see my friends in the Senate today--Senator Gramm, Senator \nMcConnell, in addition, of course, to the senior Senator from Missouri \nabout whose service I have already remarked, and my colleague, Senator \nSantorum, with whom I have had the opportunity to fight for things in \nwhich we believe. These are all very pleasing items.\n  In particular, I thank Members of the Senate for participating in \nvery important legislative achievements that are a part of what I \nbelieve has been important for me to do while I have been here.\n  I had the privilege of filing legislation to protect the Social \nSecurity trust fund, called the Social Security lockbox legislation. I \nbelieve I was the first to do that in the Senate. Senator Abraham, \nSenator Domenici, Senator Santorum, and I worked awfully hard for that \nconcept. It is now part of the Senate rules, and it has guided the way \nin which we have appropriated resources.\n  The Medicare lockbox passed the Senate. I am grateful for that \nopportunity and was grateful that Senator Conrad, on the other side, \nwas interested in making sure we put the right framework around the \nMedicare trust fund so that it was not raided for other purposes.\n  An effort to repeal the Social Security earnings tax--the test on the \nSocial Security earnings--which we were able to achieve in April of \nthis year under the leadership of Chairman Roth, and signed by the \nPresident, I had the privilege of being the Senate sponsor of that \nmeasure. There were about 45 Senators who joined together, but there \nwas even overwhelming help from people on the other side of the aisle, \nsuch as Senators Landrieu, Feinstein, Baucus, Dorgan, Lieberman, and \nLincoln, in addition to members of this caucus.\n  A big problem in the State of Missouri has been methamphetamines. \nOver and over again, I have worked to strengthen the law regarding \nmethamphetamines, both with my colleague, the senior Senator from \nMissouri, Kit Bond, and with others who have also been concerned about \nthis problem.\n  Senator Feinstein's State of California, similarly, has been \nafflicted with the curse of methamphetamines, and she was always \nhelpful in this respect. And we could not have done it without Senator \nHatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, on which I have had the \nprivilege of serving.\n  May I digress for just a second to say I have had the privilege of \nserving under Chairman Hatch. I respect him and am grateful for his \nleadership on the committee. There are a tough set of circumstances \nthat always involves us in the tensions of give-and-take, and he has \nmasterfully negotiated the shoals in that particular arena.\n  Of course, I should mention as well John McCain's leadership on the \nCommerce Committee, on which I have had the privilege of serving, and \nhis graciousness to me and kindness to me and his direction in a \ncommittee which has achieved massive revisions in the kind of \nliberating renovation which has provided tremendous energy to American \nindustry. The revision in the telecommunications law which we were able \nto achieve is a result of excellent leadership. It has changed the \ndynamics of the world's economy, not to mention the United States.\n  But I go back to some of the specific legislation.\n  This year, we enacted legislation to provide funding so that the \nsurvivors of slain law enforcement officers could have the opportunity \nto get education and training so that they could in some way begin to \nundertake an effort on their own behalf, which the law enforcement \nofficer, slain in the line of duty, was otherwise prepared to help them \nwith. I am thankful to Senator Specter and Senator Collins and Senator \nBiden for working and being so helpful to me in that respect.\n  Tougher penalties for gun crimes: When I put the amendment into \nSenator Helms' law, which was moving through this body, for tougher \ncriminal penalties for those who use guns in the commission of a crime, \nit could not have happened without Senator Helms' measure. Of course, \nas the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, on which I have had \nthe opportunity to serve, I have learned to respect Senator Helms, his \ngentlemanly character, and his generous and judicious approach to \nrunning the committee.\n\n  I worked with Bill Frist on curtailing weapons in schools and making \nsure we could provide penalties for those who carried guns into schools \nor maintained guns at schools. It could not have happened without him.\n  I think of the late Senator Paul Coverdell and his efforts on \neducation flexibility, sending resources to the State. I was thrilled \nto have the opportunity to work with him and Senator Wyden and Senator \nFrist on that legislation. It was very important legislation across the \naisle, but it would have an impact across America.\n\n[[Page S11676]]\n\n  Then on the legislation to end food and medicine embargoes, I think \nthis is a major step forward for America--good foreign policy, good \nfarm policy, and expresses the values of the people of this country. \nWorking with Senator Dodd and Senator Dorgan, and on our side, Senator \nHagel and Senator Roberts--and Senator Wellstone joined in that \neffort--the Senate overwhelmingly worked together to get that done. Now \nthat it is a part of the law of this country, I think it is a major \nstep in the right direction.\n  I was pleased to be able to work with Tom Daschle, the minority \nleader of the Senate, to make sure that the U.S. Trade Representative \nhad a full-time, permanent ag ambassador so agricultural interests were \nnot neglected when negotiations were made regarding trade.\n  Over and over again, I think of things that happened this last year, \nsuch as when HCFA, the Health Care Financing Administration, announced \nnew rules for reimbursing cancer care treatments. I thought of the \nmillions of people around the country who lived in rural areas who \nwould find their care curtailed. Senator Mack of Florida worked with me \nto make sure we were able to begin the process of changing the law. And \nthe process was so successful that HCFA changed its rules and \nregulations. Sometimes that is the way we make progress.\n  There are the big things we have done. Some of these are a litany of \nthings that are more incidental. There are the things such as welfare \nreform. I think of Phil Gramm's work, Senator Grassley's work, and \nSenator Roth's work there. This was early during my term. I had the \nopportunity to craft a provision called charitable choice that welcomed \nnongovernmental agencies into the process so that we could begin to \nremediate the pathology of welfare in the country, abusive welfare, by \nmaking sure that we helped all of America address this problem, not \njust America's government.\n  It was a wonderful thing to see its broad bipartisan acceptance. It \nwas very pleasing to see in this last Presidential election that \nGovernor George W. Bush of Texas made this a point of what he would \nprovide in the welfare arena, as did Vice President Gore.\n  I had the privilege of chairing several subcommittees. I am grateful \nfor the opportunity to have done so. In particular, with Senator \nFeingold, I chaired two subcommittees. I chaired the Africa \nSubcommittee of the Foreign Relations Committee and the Constitution \nSubcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  I have to say, I have never had a better working relationship with \nany individual than with Senator Feingold in that respect. Never did he \nask me to do something that I thought was unfair and that I could not \ndo and that I would not do. In each instance, when I offered him an \nopportunity to participate in a broad range of what the subcommittees \nwere doing, he fulfilled his responsibilities with fairness, with \ndignity, with respect, and with the public interest as the uppermost \ncriteria. I am grateful for that.\n  Obviously, I do not want to overstate what it means to have been a \nSinging Senator, but it was a tremendous opportunity to spend time on \nTuesday mornings, before the workday began, rehearsing and seeking \nperfection--elusive perfection--which never attended our efforts. But \nwe never lost our faith for it.\n  I thank the Singing Senators for allowing me to be a part. We did \ntravel over a good bit of the United States from one time to another. \nWe raised, I think, well over a half million dollars for the \nAlzheimer's research effort. It is one of those things that otherwise \nprovided a little squirt of WD-40, where the friction might otherwise \nhave made things less pleasant. It lubricated the relationships and \ngave us a great opportunity.\n  I have recited a lot of important things that went into law. I am \nvery close to concluding my remarks. I just want to say this: I do not \nwant anyone to think the law is the most important thing in \nAmerica. What happens in families, in churches and civic organizations, \nthe values people believe in their hearts, is more important than the \nlaws we write on the books.\n\n  I don't want anyone to ever believe the laws are not important. We do \nhave to have laws that tell us what the baselines are of our culture \nand, if you fall below those, we will punish you, what the framework is \nin which we operate. But no culture ever really achieves greatness by \neveryone just being at the baseline. Cultures achieve greatness not \nwhen people just stay out of jail but when they soar to their very \nhighest and best, not when they just accommodate our threshold of the \nlowest and the least.\n  The greatness of this great Nation is to be found in the hearts of \nthe American people more than in the books of the American Government. \nBut those items of policy and framework that we have put there guard \nthe opportunity for greatness that comes from the heart of the American \npeople. So our law and Constitution and the decisions we make are \nfundamentally important. It has been a great privilege for me to be \ninvolved.\n  I thank one last group of people, and that is my family. If we didn't \nbelieve in these very important principles, I wouldn't have had the \nopportunity to ask them to make the sacrifices they have made. My wife \nJanet has been willing to dislocate her career time after time when \nchanges in my life have moved me from one place to another. She has \ntaught at Howard University in Washington, DC, on the faculty for the \nlast 5 years now. I am grateful for that. My son, when I first came to \nthe Senate, was still in high school, and we divided our family for \nthat year so he could finish. A high school senior generally likes a \ndad around. I am not sure I would say he always wants me around, but \nthere was a little bit of a dislocation of the family.\n  But dislocations are worth our effort. Perhaps the most important \nthing my father taught me was that there were more important things \nthan me, and the ability to make sacrifices to get good things done is \nimportant. When we understand there are some things that are more \nimportant than we are, we have a willingness to make sacrifices. I \nthank my family profoundly--my wife Janet, my sons Jay and Andy, my \ndaughter Martha, my son-in-law Jim, and my grandson Jimmy. I thank them \nfor being willing to understand that when there are things more \nimportant than we are, we can sacrifice those things and recognize in \nour lives our willingness to set aside our personal agenda for the \npublic good.\n  It is my hope that if and when I ever have an opportunity to serve \nagain, I will be able to serve in accordance with those principles, \nwith the values that my staff and I had the privilege of developing, \nalways understanding that the public good is an objective well worth \npursuing, not just pursuing but well worth sacrificing for, because \nwhen we sacrifice for each other, we communicate the most important \nvalues of our culture, that we love and respect one another.\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity. I know he has foregone the \ntime limit on my behalf. I thank each Member of the Senate, this very \nimportant body in preserving liberty, for its courtesy and kindness to \nme and for this last opportunity to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). Under the previous order, the \ntime until 12:30 is under the control of the Senator from Florida, Mr. \nGraham. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, might I ask the indulgence of my good friend \nfrom Florida to take perhaps 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am pleased to yield such time as my \ncolleague and friend from Missouri would like and to add my \naccommodation to the service of Senator Ashcroft and for the remarks he \nhas presented to the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my former gubernatorial colleague. \nThere are far too few of us former Governors in this body, and it was \nmy pleasure to serve with the Governor from Florida, who is now the \nSenator from Florida.\n  It is a very melancholy time for me to rise today to pay my respects \nand honor and to offer sincerest thanks to a friend who is probably my \nclosest colleague in politics. We have been through a lot together. I \nlost a couple races as well as winning some. I can tell you, it is not \nfun. In fact, it is really terrible. I know what it is like.\n\n[[Page S11677]]\n\n  After my last loss, a good friend came up to me and slapped me on the \nshoulder and said: Well, experience is what you get when you are \nexpecting to get something else.\n  I don't know what that proves, but I have had experience, and I know \nJohn has had experience. It hasn't made him bitter. Every time he has \nhad an experience, it has made him better.\n  Last night I had the pleasure of joining him for ceremonies at a \nChristmas celebration to collect toys for tots in the Marine Corps \neffort. Now, there was some singing. And the host who heard both of us \nsing sort of gave me a speaking role and gave John the responsibility \nto lead the singing. There is no question that I will not try to take \nhis place in the Singing Senators. That is going to be a loss.\n  But there are a lot of other ideas, a lot of other fond memories that \ncome back to me. When John Ashcroft followed me in the State auditor's \noffice, he continued the effort to clean up the mess of the State \nauditor's office, something I chided him about frequently. He went on \nto be attorney general, my second term as Governor. During his first \ntime, I had taken an involuntary hiatus from the Governor's office. I \nhad one of my experiences.\n\n  I came back and he was my counsel, my lawyer, kept me out of trouble \nfor 4 years. Then he served 8 great years as a very effective and \nfarsighted Governor of the State of Missouri. I will not impose on the \nSenate's time to go down the list of accomplishments.\n  One of my favorite programs is Parents as Teachers. This is a \nwonderful early childhood program that has revolutionized early \nchildhood education in Missouri. We managed to get it on the books and \nkind of bring it to life. But John Ashcroft was the one who funded it, \nnurtured it, encouraged it, made it flourish to become a national model \nand even an international model. It has gone to six or seven other \ncountries, last time I heard, because it works. And because of his \nstrong leadership, it was successful.\n  With his long experience in Missouri, it is no surprise that when he \ncame to Washington he said he was going to Washington not to bring \nWashington ideas back to Missouri but to bring Missouri values, views, \nand good ideas to Washington. He has clearly done that.\n  There are many accomplishments we could cite about his service. He \nhas mentioned a few of them. The methamphetamine problem became a very \nserious problem in Missouri in the early 1990s. We worked together, he \non the Judiciary Committee, fashioning laws. He helped me secure \nappropriations to deal with this scourge. It was a terrible tragedy for \ntoo many Missourians. His work on behalf of ending the food and \nmedicine embargo was just one more step in opening the markets that our \nfarmers and, indeed, our entire world economy needs so they can be \nhealthy from the export markets.\n  Working together at the staff level, we had great staff efforts. I \nexpress my thanks to his staff as well because we worked jointly \ntogether and managed to do a lot of good. We sincerely appreciate the \nservice the staff has provided.\n  We fought the battles. I should note for our colleagues who are not \nsoon going to forget our efforts on behalf of the Missouri River, we \nappreciate their indulgence. That issue of controlled flooding on the \nMissouri River was very important to our State, and we fought that \nbattle. We appreciate the suffering of our fellow Senators.\n  There is no better measure of a man than how he handles adversity. It \nis something you don't want to experience but when you do, how do you \nreact? Do you get bitter or do you get better? John Ashcroft showed the \nnobility, the character, and the honor that has been his trademark \nthroughout.\n  When he conceded the election and there were those who wished to \nmount a legal challenge, he wasn't going to stand for it. He would not \ntolerate it. The people of Missouri had spoken. He views his job as one \nof service to the people of Missouri--not one of using legal challenges \nand court challenges to try to win what the polls had shown.\n  I can tell you that as I have traveled around the State there is one \noverwhelming message Missourians have; that is, thank you, John \nAshcroft. Their esteem for you has grown. People shake their heads, and \nsay: Why didn't he fight? Why didn't he do something? I said: Look. He \nwants service to go forward. They are very proud of the nobility he \nshowed. But they are confident, as I am, that new opportunities will be \narising for him. They wish him well--with his experience, commitment, \nand his solid faith.\n  There will be many areas where John Ashcroft will serve. He has too \nmuch to offer. And I look forward too--I admit--with awfully mixed \nemotions to seeing him take a new role and new responsibilities.\n  On behalf of my fellow citizens of Missouri, I say thanks for the \nfirst 33 years of service to the State. We are not finished with you \nyet. There is a lot more to be done, and you are the one to do it.\n  For me personally, I know what you and Janet have gone through. And I \nam very proud of the way you have handled it. Your friendship will \nalways mean a great deal to me, and the shared time that we have had \ntogether in this body is particularly special.\n  When they close the service and the benediction at my church in \nMissouri, the minister says: The service is over, and now it is time \nfor the work to begin. For John, the service is over for now right \nhere. But let the work begin.\n  John, thank you from the bottom of my heart, and very best wishes to \nyou, Janet, and your family.\n  I thank the Chair. I particularly thank my colleague from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nFlorida, Mr. Graham, is recognized for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield such time as he would use to my \nfriend and colleague from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me, for 1 minute, add my voice to \nthose today who paid tribute to Senator Ashcroft for his service in the \nSenate.\n  As I indicated earlier, some think because we are engaged in heavy \ndebate from time to time that we are not friends. Across the aisle, \nSenator Ashcroft and I worked on a piece of legislation, one which we \npassed early on when he came to the Senate dealing with Federal funding \nof physician-assisted suicide. We worked together, and it was passed. \nIt is now law.\n  We worked a great deal for a long period of time on lifting sanctions \nwith respect to the sale of food and medicine. It is a fight that will \ncontinue even after Senator Ashcroft leaves the service of the Senate.\n  Also, a couple of times, I joined Senator Ashcroft and the quartet on \nthe Republican side with the Singing Senators, along with my \ncolleagues, Senator Daschle and Senator Boxer. I think on one other \noccasion I joined Senator Ashcroft and the quartet. I have seen Senator \nAshcroft in action in a number of ways.\n  My expectation of his public service is that it is not at an end. I \nappreciate the service he has given to this country and to the Senate. \nI appreciate having had the opportunity to work with him. I know him to \nbe smart and tough and tenacious on the issues about which he cares \ndeeply. I wish him well.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, my primary purpose this morning is to make \nsome remarks relative to my retiring colleague, Connie Mack. But while \nhe is still here, I would like to also express my admiration for \nSenator Ashcroft.\n  Senator Dorgan talked about some of the times they worked together. \nThose are always rewarding, and they help build relationships. I have \nhad some of those times with Senator Ashcroft. I have also had some \ntimes when we disagreed--such as on the same issue that Senator Dorgan \nreferred to as the wisdom of our policy towards Cuba. In those times of \ndisagreement, you also learn something about the character of the \nperson. I found Senator Ashcroft to be a person who listens to what the \nother side thinks is the proper course. He wouldn't necessarily agree \nwith it, but he would take it into account and would try to use that as \nthe basis of finding a broader common ground.\n  Those are important qualities which I think our colleague, Connie \nMack, also represents and which I will discuss in a few moments. But I \nwish to extend my best wishes to Senator Ashcroft who I did not have \nthe opportunity to serve with as a Governor, but I admire his service \nto the State of Missouri and to America in many ways. I wish him well \nfor a happy, rewarding future.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/07/senate-section/article/S11678-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11678-S11679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11678]]\n                          SENATOR CONNIE MACK\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the Constitution of the United States \nprovides that each State, regardless of other circumstances, will have \ntwo Members in the Senate. It says nothing about how those two Senators \nwill get along. Sometimes they don't.\n  I think we had a good demonstration a few moments ago with the very \nheartfelt comments of Senator Bond to his colleague, Senator Ashcroft. \nThey are two Senators who have a very close, constructive relationship \nfor the people of their State.\n  It is my pleasure and my honor to be able to say the same \nrelationship has existed for the last 12 years between myself and \nSenator Connie Mack. I am proud to call Connie a friend, and I am proud \nto have served with him as a colleague.\n  There are a number of reasons that may have led to this good \nrelationship--one of which is that we have a great deal in common.\n  We both grew up in a Florida which was undergoing massive change. \nWhen Senator Mack and I were born in the late 1930s, the State of \nFlorida had a population of about 1.5 million. As we start the 21st \ncentury, Florida has a population of over 15 million. That demographic \nchange has brought a floodtide of other economic, cultural, social, and \npolitical changes to our State. They have affected both Senator Mack \nand myself as we have seen and participated in those changes.\n  We went to the same college. We are both graduates of the University \nof Florida, and we share a deep, abiding interest in that institution. \nIt is my hope that there will be a very appropriate tribute to Senator \nMack, and that there will be an institute at our alma mater which will \nsymbolize and continue his deep commitment to the work of science and \nhealth.\n  Our personal lives have also overlapped. We both had the good fortune \nof marrying substantially above ourselves. Adele, Priscilla, Connie, \nand myself have grown to be not only neighbors living across the street \non Capitol Hill but also very close personal friends.\n  We are about the same age. We have now been blessed with a growing \nnumber of what is one of life's greatest gifts--grandchildren. I \nbelieve if you ask either of us what our favorite title is, it would \nprobably be the title of grandfather.\n  But we have also had some differences. Lest we try to ignore the big \nwhite elephant in the living room of relationships between myself and \nConnie; indeed Connie is a Republican. He is very proud and loyal to \nhis party. In fact, recently Connie told me a story which indicates the \nrisk he was willing to take in support of his party. At the early age \nof seven in what was clearly a foreshadowing of what was to come, young \nConnie Mack was invited to the Democratic National Convention which was \nbeing held in Philadelphia. He was not just being invited; he was being \ninvited by his step grandfather, a Democratic Senator from Texas, Tom \nConnally, one of the most prestigious Members of this body, \nparticularly in the period of World War II.\n\n  While attending this Democratic luncheon at the national convention, \nyoung 7-year-old Connie stood up and began yelling ``I'm a Republican; \nI'm a Republican.'' That behavior, needless to say, earned him the \nwrath of his step grandfather who threatened to call the police if the \ndisplay was not terminated.\n  Now, despite this highly partisan launch to Connie's political \ncareer, Senator Mack and I have been working together in the closest \nmanner for what is best for Florida and for the Nation.\n  Just a few of the items on which we both take considerable pride, in \nour joint efforts we have battled against offshore drilling in Florida. \nWe battled for a highway funding formula that takes into account States \nwith rapidly growing populations. As a team, we worked to help rebuild \nDade County after the devastation of Hurricane Andrew in 1992.\n  We are particularly proud of our success in filling Federal judicial \nvacancies, which is a direct result of cooperation of working together \nto put quality judges on the Federal bench, not judges of a particular \npolitical party. We interviewed applicants together. We made joint \nrecommendations to the Judiciary Committee. We cointroduced the \nnominees to the committee. And we applauded, together, when they were \nconfirmed on the Senate floor. I am very pleased in the last 4 years \nthe Senate has confirmed 15 Federal judges from Florida.\n  Our close cooperation isn't limited to just the two of us. Our staffs \nhave worked closely together on issues of mutual importance. And most \nrecently, in fact, the last act of the Congress before it recessed for \nthe election period, we helped participate in legislation that will \nforever cement Senator Mack's legacy, the restoration of America's \nEverglades.\n  Connie should be justifiably proud of each one of these and many \nother accomplishments. But I suggest he would be most proud of the fact \nthat he worked hard at, and made it look easy, bipartisanship. Connie \nis a consummate gentleman, a man of unwavering civility in a body that \noften yearns for more of that quality. This is no small matter.\n  In today's political world, we shrug off a notion of being polite, as \nif it is a relic from a world that no longer exists. But being polite \nis far more than knowing your table manners. Civility, collegiality, \nand respect are the building blocks of political bipartisanship. And \nbipartisanship, in turn, is the foundation of constructive legislation.\n  When funding for the National Institutes of Health advances, many \nMembers on both sides of the aisle will be able to claim a small \nmeasure of credit, but none more so than Senator Mack. No Member of \nthis body has worked harder to build the coalitions based on \nunderstanding of the importance of the issue and the opportunity which \nwe had as a nation to roll back the barriers of disease than Senator \nMack.\n  In the future, when science beats cancer, we will look back and thank \nSenator Mack who worked with many others, particularly Senator \nRockefeller, to allow Medicare payments for clinical cancer trials. \nThese are major achievements and they required the support and hard \nwork of both parties.\n  It is no secret that this Congress has had few such serious \nlegislative accomplishments. How can we enact any \ninnovative legislation when we can't even agree on the future bills \nsuch as the remaining appropriations bills that we must pass to keep \nour Government running? We are now 10 weeks beyond the beginning of the \nfiscal year and still have much necessary work to be done. Certainly \nthere is plenty of blame to go around for this overly long session, and \nit is hardly a surprise that the American people are tuning out while \nwe battle inside the beltway over issues that seem to affect no one \nother than ourselves.\n\n  Senator Mack has always said it doesn't have to be that way. And he \nhas lived up to that creed. He was a founding member of the Centrist \nCoalition when it came together in 1997 to stop the hemorrhaging of \nannual fiscal deficits.\n  One of the other areas in which he should justifiably take great \npride is his contribution to bringing America from an era of \naccumulated national debt to one in which we are starting to pay down \nthe debt. To a lesser degree, we will be asking Connie's grandchildren \nto be paying our credit card bills.\n  Maybe we have heard too many times that nice guys finish last. I \nsubmit Senator Mack proves that adage to be dead wrong. Nice guys, in \nfact, get results. Those who can't get along with their colleagues get \ngridlock. And the American public pays for their posturing.\n  There is another danger in the culture of swagger that has too often \ncharacterized this Congress. That danger is arrogance. Somehow, many \nMembers have convinced ourselves that the reason we can't reach an \naccommodation is not that we haven't really tried and not because we \nare playing politics; instead, the problem is simply that we are \ncompletely, totally, right, and the other side is wholly and utterly \nwrong.\n  Now, clearly that attitude is not conducive to getting much done on a \nbipartisan basis. The easy excuse for arrogance is that we were elected \nfor our opinion and to change them would be a betrayal to our \nconstituents. But Senator Mack has found a better way, a\n\n[[Page S11679]]\n\nway that I describe as nonarrogant self-confidence. That is not an \noxymoron despite how it may occasionally appear when this room is \nfilled with enough hot air to melt the polar ice cap. Nonarrogant self-\nconfidence is, in fact, a foundation for public service. Nonarrogant \nself-confidence is the product of sustained and diverse life \nexperiences prior to and during a political career. It is the ability \nto look beyond one's world, to reach out to people of different \nbeliefs, different values, different backgrounds. It is not a person \nwho wakes up every morning and puts his proverbial finger in the wind \nto see which way it is blowing and decides what his position will be \nthat day. It is the quality of having the strength to hold well-\ngrounded opinions and values, and yet to be open and persuadable in the \nface of new information and logical arguments. Nonarrogant self-\nconfidence is the ability to be a leader in your party, but not \nnecessarily a follower of the party line.\n  This is how Connie Mack has worked throughout his tenure in the \nCongress, and it is a model to which we should all aspire. It could be \nthat confidence convinced Connie Mack of the importance of playing by \nthe rules which we have so carelessly shunted aside in this session of \nthe Congress. Connie is a leader of his party, a key member of the \nBanking and Finance Committees, and has served as chairman of the Joint \nEconomic Committee. In all of these positions, he has had a respect for \nthe process of senatorial decisionmaking. He has been confident enough \nto let what he believes is right to be in full view of the American \npeople.\n  Now, few would argue that the process we have is cumbersome and, \nfrankly, often dull. We rarely hear of someone setting up a VCR or \nrushing home after work to catch our latest pontifications on C-SPAN. \nBut the seriousness of this process has added purpose. Time and public \ndebate are the key ingredients that go into solid, sustainable public \npolicy. Legislating behind closed doors is breaking our promise to the \nAmerican public, the promise that if they, the American people, made \nthe effort, their voice would be heard and would influence public \npolicy on Capitol Hill. The rules of this body rely on keeping promises \nin an informal way as well as formally.\n  We must all be able to trust that our colleagues will do as they say \nand vote as they claim to do. Connie Mack is a man of his word. He \nkeeps his promise to his colleagues. He keeps his promise to the people \nof Florida.\n  Connie's strength of character, his respect for this institution, and \nhis ability to reach across party lines became apparent to me early in \nour time together in the Senate. Our service in the Senate overlapped \nwith his last term in the House in 1987 and 1988. I got to know Connie \nwhen he came to the Senate after the 1988 election, when he won the \nseat that had previously been vacated by Senator, later Governor, \nLawton Chiles. When the campaign was over, we vowed to work together. \nThis has been an easy commitment to fulfill because Connie Mack is a \nfine person, as he is a fine representative of his State.\n  He is blessed with a sense of humor. He understands that the business \nwe conduct is serious, but he does not take himself too seriously. He \nis hard working, an always reliable coworker. I have walked out of \nmeetings with pages of notes and reams of paper. Connie generally \nwrites down little. But when we divide assignments, without fail he \ncompletes his homework, generally before I do. He not only remembers \nthe names of various members of my staff, he recollects the schools \nthey went to and the football teams they support.\n  Senator Mack is devoted to his family. In fact, I have said that \nConnie and Priscilla Mack are the living embodiment of family values. \nAdele and I have been honored to call the Macks friends now for well \nover a decade. We have compared notes on our children and \ngrandchildren. We have watched our families grow and grow up.\n  For his legislative and personal qualities, Senator Mack will be \nsorely missed. I call on my colleagues, colleagues from both sides of \nthe aisle, to join me in tribute to our friend Senator Connie Mack, his \nwife Priscilla, and the Mack family.\n  Connie, while they call what you are doing retirement, I prefer to \nthink it is more like you are being traded to another team, a practice \nin which your grandfather participated on a regular basis, or maybe \nplaying another position. I have no doubt you will continue to work \nhard for the people of Florida and America. We will all be a better and \nespecially a healthier nation because of your commitment and \nPriscilla's commitment. May your next step bring you as much personal \nand professional satisfaction as your days in the Senate have brought \nto all of us.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am delighted today to join my \ncolleagues in paying tribute to a truly outstanding United States \nSenator, and that is Slade Gorton.\n  During Slade's recent campaign, I had the privilege of going to \nSeattle to speak at a luncheon organized for him by women who had once \nworked for him in the Senate and in his capacity as attorney general. I \nwas not at all surprised to see so many women who felt so strongly \nabout Slade's reelection. He is, and always has been, an oasis of \ninclusion, encouragement, and support for women in the workplace. He is \none of those people who know how to encourage, how to mentor, and how \nto help women and men reach their full potential.\n  That certainly has been true in my own case. Even before I was sworn \nin as a new Senator some 4 years ago, Slade took me under his wing with \nadvice on everything from choosing my committee assignments, to \nselecting my office space, to hiring my staff. He has continued to give \nme invaluable advice on a host of issues ranging from what our policy \nshould be in Colombia and Kosovo, to how to take a different approach \nto education spending, to how to succeed in a tricky procedural \nsituation.\n  Slade has always been someone to whom I could turn for advice, for \nanswers, for good counsel. It has also been my pleasure to work with \nSlade Gorton on a host of issues such as education, children's health \ncare, and the cost of prescription drugs. What I admire most about \nSlade is his intellectually rigorous, challenging, and creative \napproach to public policy. He simply does not go along with the \nconventional wisdom; he challenges it, constantly seeking new ideas and \ninnovative approaches to solve thorny problems.\n  A perfect example of Slade's innovative style was his development of \nan entirely new approach to Federal education policy, one that \nrecognized that local school boards, parents, and teachers know best \nwhat their children need.\n  As the architect of the Straight A's bill, Slade has been a leader in \neducation in the Senate. I was very proud to cosponsor his innovative \neffort to bring academic achievement and accountability to our public \nschools.\n  Slade realized that when the Federal Government gives money to local \nschools, it should not come with dictates from D.C. on how it should be \nspent. He understood that it should, however, come with an expectation \nof results, and that is why he worked so hard to give local school \nboards, parents, teachers, and administrators, the freedom to decide \nhow best to spend Federal money in exchange for holding them \naccountable for improving their schools. He changed the entire focus of \nFederal education policy from being focused on paperwork and process, \nto instead being focused on how much our students were learning, to a \nfocus on student achievement and results.\n  Slade has also been an advocate for children's health. Not only was \nhe an early supporter of the Children's Health Insurance Program, the \nS-CHIP program, but he has also worked for years to increase Federal \nresearch dollars toward autism. That hard work is about to pay off \nbecause his autism bill was included this year in the omnibus \nchildren's health bill which was signed into law last month. It will \ndirect more\n\n[[Page S11680]]\n\nFederal dollars toward finding a cure and treatment for autism.\n  Slade Gorton has had an impact on this Senate in so many ways. \nWhether it is serving as a valued mentor to more junior Senators, such \nas myself, or being the architect of very important legislation or \nshepherding appropriations bills through an incredibly difficult \nprocedural morass, Slade has been front and center in every debate in \nthis Senate.\n  He has not only been a brilliant legislator; he has also been a \nwonderful friend. I will deeply miss serving with him, and I appreciate \nthis opportunity today to pay tribute to a man who has not only been an \noutstanding Senator but a wonderful friend.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 5640, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5640) to expand homeownership in the United \n     States, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President. I am pleased to see that we are passing \nthis bipartisan piece of housing legislation today. While there are \nprovisions that were not included in the bill, which I thought were \nworthy of passage, on the whole, the ``American Homeownership and \nEconomic Opportunity Act of 2000'' is a bill that should become law. I \nwould like to highlight just a few parts of this legislation that we \nworked particularly hard on over the last two years.\n  First is the manufactured housing bill, that has been incorporated \ninto this legislation. This bill establishes a national minimum \ninstallation standard for manufactured homes, ensuring that the home as \ninstalled performs as advertised. We have created a dispute resolution \nprogram, so that owners, many of whom are lower-income, are not \nmistreated when they are trying to have a defect in their home \ncorrected. This bill also updates the safety standard setting process \nfor the manufactured housing industry, which will allow new innovations \nin technology to be incorporated into homes more quickly, making them \nsafer, more efficient, and cheaper for homeowners. Passage of this \nportion of the bill would not have been possible without the help of \nSenators Kerry, Edwards, Bayh, and Shelby, and their respective staff, \nnamely Lendell Porterfield and Josh Stein. I would like to thank all of \nthese individuals for their contributions throughout the process of \nwriting, negotiating, and passing this legislation.\n  I also want to associate myself with the remarks made by Chairman \nLeach and Congressman Frank in the House of Representatives on October \n24, 2000 regarding the contracting language in this bill. Their \ncolloquy clarified the intention of this section.\n  The legislation includes language taken from S. 2733 designed to \nincrease the supply of low-income elderly and disabled housing by \nexpanding available capital for such projects. We allow service \nproviders in federally assisted elderly and disabled facilities to \ninclude eligible residents in the surrounding neighborhood in their \nprograms, expanding their service to the community as a whole.\n  In addition, there are provisions which will allow Rural Housing \nService to refinance guaranteed loans, reducing costs for low income \nrural homeowners, and a new program to expand housing opportunities to \nNative Hawaiians and Native Americans. Both of these changes will make \na big difference in the lives of low income families.\n  Finally, the legislation reauthorizes a number of agency reports \nunder the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee which would otherwise \nhave expired this year. These reports include the Federal Reserve's \nSemiannual Report on Monetary Policy, the Economic Report of the \nPresident, the annual reports of the federal financial regulatory \nagencies, and a number of other significant reports in the area of \nconsumer protection. These reports are vital to the exercise of the \nBanking Committee's oversight function, and I am very pleased that the \nHouse and the Senate were able to reach agreement on their \nreauthorization.\n  I reiterate my approval for the substance of this bill. I am glad to \nsee us pass these portions of different pieces of legislation this \nsession, though I regret that a low-income housing production program \nwas not included.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, there is much to applaud in the bill we are \ntaking up today, H.R. 5640, ``The American Homeownership and Economic \nOpportunity Act.'' I note that this legislation is identical to \nlegislation I have cosponsored, S. 3274.\n  Some of the provisions of H.R. 5640 are contained in bipartisan \nlegislation, S. 2733, which I have introduced with my colleagues \nSenator Santorum, Senator Sarbanes, and others. These are designed to \nincrease the stock of affordable housing for elderly and disabled \nAmericans by expanding the pool of available capital. It will also \nexpand the availability of services to help improve the quality of life \nfor elderly and residents of HUD-assisted properties and other eligible \npeople in the neighborhood.\n  The legislation also includes important reforms to the manufactured \nhousing statute. These reforms provide significant new consumer \nprotections for owners of manufactured homes. For example, the bill \ncreates national minimum installation standards to make sure \nmanufactured homes are not just manufactured correctly--an area that \nhas long been under federal control--but that they are installed \nproperly and perform as advertised to provide high quality, safe, \ndurable, and affordable housing for their occupants.\n  In addition, the new law establishes a dispute resolution process \nwhich, for the first time, will enable a consumer determine whether a \nproblem with a manufactured home is due to a manufacturing or \ninstallation defect, and then get the defect corrected.\n  Overall, the manufactured housing title of this bill will modernize \nthe regulatory structure for the industry in a way that gives consumers \na full and equal voice. Such modernization will help the industry \nincorporate new technologies more quickly, making this housing more \nefficient, more attractive, safer, and cheaper. Manufactured housing \ncan and should be a bigger part of this nation's effort to address the \nrising need for affordable housing. This legislation will help make \nthis a reality.\n  I also concur with remarks made in the House of Representatives by \nChairman Leach and Representatives LaFalce and Frank in the House on \nOctober 24, 2000, regarding the issue of contracting out certain \nmonitoring and oversight functions required by the legislation. HUD \nneeds to be able to manage these contracts in a way that allows them to \nget the work done.\n  Finally, I thank Senator Shelby for his leadership on this issue. \nSenator Shelby deserves great credit for making this legislation \npossible. He worked through every issue and concern raised by the \nvarious parties to make this day possible. I also thank Lendell \nPorterfield from the staff of Senator Shelby. Mr. Porterfield was \nhighly professional and extremely knowledgeable. He provided the \nleadership at a staff level that enabled this bill to become law. In \naddition, Senator Edwards and his staff, Josh Stein, were instrumental \nin negotiating the final compromise. They ensured that the interests of \nconsumers were balanced with the needs of industry. Likewise, the \nleadership of Senator Sarbanes and his staff helped ensure that this \nprocess would continue to be bipartisan and productive. Senator Bayh \nalso played an important role. I want to make a special note of the \nwork of Christen Schaefer of the Banking Committee staff, without whose \nhard work and dedication this legislation could not become law.\n\n[[Page S11681]]\n\n  There are many other solid achievements in this legislation that will \nimprove housing opportunities for many Americans.\n  However, as much as there is to welcome in this bill, it is as \nnotable for what is missing. Most importantly, this bill does not \ninclude any of the numerous bipartisan proposals, some of which passed \nthe House with overwhelming majorities, that would provide for the \npreservation of existing affordable housing that is fast being lost; \nnor does it include any of the bipartisan proposals to facilitate the \nconstruction of new affordable housing. In particular, I very much \nregret the exclusion of the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund \nlegislation that I introduced with a number of my colleagues from both \nsides of the aisle. Finally, it does not include some important \nprovisions that would encourage and support homeownership, such as low \ndownpayment FHA loans for teachers, police officers, and other \nmunicipal employees.\n  Everyone who has looked at the issue of housing with an open mind, or \nhas tried to purchase or rent a home, understands that we face an \naffordable housing crisis. A recent study issued by the National Low \nIncome Housing Coalition highlights the fact that there is no city, \ncounty, or state where a minimum wage job is adequate to enable a \nworking person to afford the typical rent on 2 bedroom home. In tight \nmarkets such as Boston, New York, Denver, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Austin, \nSan Francisco, and many others around the country, affordable housing \nis out of reach to average working families.\n  The Federal Government has an important role to play here, and I will \nbe working very hard in the upcoming Congress to make sure that we pass \nnew legislation, such as my trust fund legislation, that will get the \nGovernment back in the business of encouraging the production of new \naffordable housing.\n  I support the legislation before us, and I hope that my colleagues \nwill join me in the coming Congress to complete the effort we have \nbegun here today.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, today the Senate is taking up H.R. 5640, \nthe American Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act, which was \npassed by the House of Representatives on December 5, 2000. Companion \nlegislation, sponsored by Senator Allard and myself, together with \nSenators Sarbanes, Santorum, Grams, Shelby, Campbell, and Kerry, was \nintroduced on December 5. This legislation is the product of bipartisan \nwork and negotiations in both bodies, and I urge the Senate to pass \nthis bill today.\n  As Chairman of the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, I \nhave had the privilege of working closely with Housing and \nTransportation Subcommittee Chairman Allard and want to express my \nappreciation for his strong leadership and commend him for the \nsuccessful stewardship of this legislation.\n  The legislation we are considering today will improve and modernize a \nvariety of federal housing programs. The proposed changes to our \nnation's housing laws will increase the efficiencies of subsidized \nhousing programs and provide that a greater number of truly needy \nAmericans may be assisted at no greater cost to the American taxpayer.\n  I am particularly pleased that this legislation includes the \nManufactured Housing Improvement Act--signifying a cooperative product \ninvolving input from industry and other interested parties that \nsuccessfully ends a 10-year legislative stalemate. The bill modernizes \nthe requirements of the National Manufactured Housing Construction and \nSafety Standards Act of 1974, a 26 year-old statute in serious need of \nrevision. Manufactured housing reform is of great importance to the \nState of Texas, which leads the Nation in the production and sale of \nmanufactured homes. Across America, manufactured homes are a \nsignificant source of affordable housing--representing 25 percent of \nall new single-family housing starts. I also want to give special \nthanks to Senator Shelby, the original lead sponsor of the manufactured \nhousing bill, who has worked tirelessly over the years for its passage. \nWithout Senator Shelby's dedication and perseverance, the Manufactured \nHousing Improvement Act title of this bill would not be before the \nSenate for consideration today.\n  The American Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act contains many \nother significant housing provisions, including modernization of the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development's, HUD, Section 202 elderly \nhousing and Section 811 disabled housing programs; the Department of \nAgriculture's rural housing programs; HUD Native American housing \nprograms; and the HUD home equity conversion mortgage program, which \nallows our cash-poor but house-rich senior citizens the opportunity to \nutilize their home equity for needed expenses.\n  This legislation also renews some 45 reporting requirements of \nExecutive Branch and regulatory agencies, including the report of the \nFederal Reserve Board on the conduct of monetary policy.\n  H.R. 5640 directs that the Chairman of the Federal Reserve appear \nbefore the Congress twice annually, once in February and again in July, \nto report on the Federal Reserve's activities with respect to the \nconduct of monetary policy and its outlook regarding economic \ndevelopments and prospects in the future. This legislation eliminates \nthe requirement of the Federal Reserve to report on many of the \noutdated economic indicators required in the past, such as measures of \nmoney supply that are no longer useful.\n  Among other reports reinstated in this legislation are the Annual \nEconomic Report of the President and annual reports from numerous \nbanking and housing agencies, including the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the \nComptroller of the Currency, Office of Thrift Supervision, Federal \nHousing Finance Board, and National Credit Union Administration. All of \nthese reports are important in helping Congress conduct its \nconstitutional oversight responsibilities and ensuring that agencies \nand departments are ultimately accountable to the American taxpayer.\n  Mr. President, these are but a few of the highlights of the important \nprovisions in H.R. 5640. I am grateful to my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle, both in the Senate and the House, in crafting this \ncompromise legislation. In particular, I would like to note the \nextensive cooperation of Senators Sarbanes and Kerry in working out \nmany of the provisions of this bill. I urge adoption of the bill by the \nSenate.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 5640) was read the third time and passed.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/07/senate-section/article/S11681-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11681-S11683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO DEPARTING SENATORS AND NEW SENATORS\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, in the days and hours that remain in \nthis session, many of us on each side of our respective aisles will say \na great deal about the colleagues we have worked with and admire from \nour own political parties. Indeed, I am no exception. For years, the \ncontributions of the Moynihans, or the Bob Kerreys, or the Dick Bryans, \nor the Frank Lautenbergs have been extraordinary in the life of our \ncountry and in the workings of this Senate. I will join those voices in \npraising each of them. But at this moment I wish to say a word as well \nabout our colleagues from the Republican Party who are leaving this \ninstitution.\n  Having chaired the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee for these \nyears, I have known some of these Senators as friends and colleagues \nbut also as adversaries. It is a peculiar and even awkward thing in the \nAmerican political process that with people you like and admire, you \ncan nevertheless have philosophical differences; you can have a \npolitical contest but nevertheless deal with them civilly.\n  I admire many of these men and rise today to praise their \ncontributions to\n\n[[Page S11682]]\n\nthe Senate and the country; and, as many other Americans, to thank them \nfor their service even though it was my responsibility to help wage \ncampaigns against them. That is our system. It is not personal. It is \nborne only in the struggle of ideas, the competition of proposals, and \nthe free market of American politics that have served our country so \nwell.\n  I would like to say a word about several Members of the Senate who \nare not of the Democratic Party.\n  Senator Abraham of Michigan, with whom I worked on the Judiciary \nCommittee, is a respected Member of the institution, a very fine \nSenator who has left his mark on the great issues of law enforcement, \nwho I have come to know and admire.\n\n  Senator Roth of Delaware, who I did not know well personally but who \ncleverly served this institution with distinction for a long time, \nchanged many of our laws and much for the better.\n  Senator Ashcroft, who as well served with me on the Judiciary \nCommittee, is a gentleman, is a fierce advocate for his point of view, \nand is a skilled man who dealt in a campaign in extraordinary \ncircumstances, I believe with considerable distinction.\n  Senator Grams of Minnesota, I believe, too, worked hard gaining the \nrespect of his colleagues.\n  Senator Gorton of Washington State, who served his State for so very \nlong and so ably, I believe, was a tremendous Member of this \ninstitution. Although he did lose an election and is also leaving this \ninstitution, he is one of my favorite members of the other party.\n  Connie Mack, who I served with in the House of Representatives, is an \nextraordinary Senator and a great gentleman who has made enormous \ncontributions to the Congress and to the United States.\n  People who I have also come to meet as adversaries through the \nelectorate process I want to join in welcoming to the Senate. They are \nboth fierce advocates and great campaigners, who defeated my party in \nthe fields of political contest.\n  Former Congressman Ensign, who joins us as a Senator from Nevada, \nwill be a fine Senator. He is a great advocate for his State, and is an \nimpressive individual who I believe will serve with distinction in the \nSenate.\n  Governor Allen, who was engaged in one of the most competitive Senate \ncontests in the country, has served with distinction as a Governor, and \nI believe he will be an extraordinary Senator.\n  I welcome them to the institution. Despite an evenly divided Senate, \nthere are real differences on fundamental issues as to how the Nation \nshould approach education and health care, gun safety, and the use of \nthe budget surplus. These issues are real. Our differences have \nmeaning. Sometimes differences are deep. But our objectives are common; \nthat is, to serve the country, to have the Senate act with distinction, \nand ultimately--simply the most obvious goal of all--to help ordinary \npeople in our country who live sometimes quiet lives, usually content \nto have the Government not be a part of all that they do but every so \noften look for help, guidance, or certainly the simple need to be able \nto look upon their Government with pride.\n  I welcome these individuals to the Senate, and I say farewell for the \nmoment to those who are leaving. I congratulate those who won and those \nwho lost on having done what our Nation is dependent upon; that is, \npeople of good meaning and integrity going out every day saying the \nthings they believe in, fighting for the causes they hold dear, and \nasking the public to render judgment.\n  Senators Abraham, Roth, Ashcroft, Grams, and Gorton did just that. \nSenator Mack did for a long time. Now Senators Ensign and Allen have \njoined them.\n  We will have a chance in the coming days to welcome each of our \nDemocratic colleagues, as well as thank those who are leaving.\n\n  There are few who are finer or served with more distinction than \nSenator Bob Kerrey. Indeed, in so many avenues of American life, he has \nserved our country with distinction. There are probably few who have \nserved here for which it can genuinely be said this is a better Senate. \nWe are all the better having been in the Senate in his presence. That \nis certainly true with Senator Kerrey.\n  Senator Moynihan as well contributed to our country in so many \ndifferent endeavors--a giant of the institution, who in his wake \nclearly made it a better place. There is not a finer or more revered \nSenator.\n  But equal in their contributions in their own way are Senator Bryan, \nSenator Lautenberg, and Senator Robb--all of whom tirelessly worked for \nour country and devoted themselves to the Senate. We can all feel the \nbetter because they were here.\n  Thank you for allowing me to share these words. I hope when the years \npass we can all remember the distinction with which they served, but \nalso the grace with which some of our colleagues accepted the voters' \njudgment and their defeat. They did so humbly, and they did so civilly; \nand, how some of the victors have also come here humbly as well \nunderstanding they have a lot to contribute and a great deal to learn \nwith the grace of the public having given them the opportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with the \nremarks of the Senator from New Jersey, paying tribute to colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle who for a variety of reasons are leaving this \ninstitution.\n  I think it goes without saying that those of us who have been \ninvolved in putting ourselves in battles for elections understand that \nit takes some courage and maybe some foolhardiness to put your name on \na ballot and submit your fate to the neighbors and friends with whom \nyou live. Those leaving this institution have done that time and again. \nI respect them. Although we disagree on issues and on philosophy, we \nrespect them so much for the courage they have shown and for their \ndedication to public service.\n  One of the most important lessons I ever learned in politics was my \nfirst one. I was a college intern on Capitol Hill working in the office \nof the U.S. Senator, Paul Douglas. I had no sooner met the man in \nFebruary than I fell in love with this life and decided to work in \nGovernment. A few short months later, he lost his election in an effort \nto be reelected to the State of Illinois.\n  It really came crashing down on me--that a man who served for 18 \nyears, because of the decision of the electorate, could see his \npolitical career come to an end that bluntly.\n  A constant reminder in my public life is the fact that this is a \nfickle business, and no one can ever take for granted the next \nelection. But I believe that the men and women who have served have \ndone so honorably, and I salute those on both sides who will not be \nwith us in the next Congress.\n  I say on a positive note that we had our organizational caucus of the \nDemocratic Senators a few days ago in the Old Senate Chamber. We had a \nchance for each of the 10 new Democratic Senators to stand and speak \nfor a moment about their feelings concerning their elections and \nservice in the Senate. One word that was used most frequently by these \nnew Senators was ``humility''--how humbled they were to be part of this \ninstitution.\n  I have always felt that. I think it is such an exceptional \nresponsibility but also an exceptional privilege to serve in this great \nbody. I have believed that representing a State as diverse and \ninteresting as Illinois gives a special meaning.\n\n  The new Senators coming on both sides of the aisle will add something \nto this Chamber, as each new class of Senators does. I hope before we \nbegin anticipating the next Congress and what it might mean, we take \ncare of the business of this Congress.\n\n\n                      Passing Appropriations Bills\n\n  Mr. President, we are required by law, as of each October 1st, to \npass spending bills, appropriations bills for the function of \ngovernment. Most Congresses fail to meet the deadline of October 1st. \nSome miss it by a few days, some by a few weeks. Sadly, this Congress \nwill miss it by a few months.\n  We still have major spending bills which have not been passed by this \nCongress. Frankly, we have run out of\n\n[[Page S11683]]\n\nexcuses. It is time to pass those bills which will continue the \nfunctions of government. The Labor-HHS bill is one that deals with \neducation and health and labor standards in America. Is there any \ngreater responsibility? How can we explain the fact that we still \nhaven't done it? There is no excuse left. We need to pass that \nlegislation and do it quickly.\n  Secondly, the bill related to the Commerce, Justice, and State \nDepartments not only deals with the administration of justice and law \nenforcement but the representation of the American Government overseas, \nthe representation of American business in an effort to create new jobs \nin this country. Yet we haven't passed that legislation.\n  I hope we won't fall on the easy solution suggested by some that we \nsomehow postpone this for months or another year. That would truly be \nhumiliating to this Congress, if it should fall into that trap. It is \nbetter to face four square our responsibility. I hope leaders on both \nsides of the aisle and the White House can come to an agreement as \nquickly as possible.\n  There is one special issue, though, that I hope we can address before \nwe leave. It affects my State and the State of the Presiding Officer, \nthe State of Illinois, the question of hospital care and reimbursement \nfrom the Federal Government. More and more, our hospitals across \nIllinois and around the Nation depend on the Medicare and Medicaid \nprograms to adequately reimburse them for quality health care which \nAmerican families expect. In an effort to balance the budget, we made \ncuts in reimbursement under the Medicare program. We had hoped to save \na little over $100 billion over some years. We cut too deeply, and now \nwe know unless we reverse that policy, the actual savings or cost \ncutting will be well over $200 billion.\n  On its face, it may sound like a good reason, that we are reducing \nthe deficit even more, and that is a very valuable thing. But the price \nwe are paying is too high because in hospital after hospital, in \nnursing homes and those agencies providing home health care services, \nthey are inadequately reimbursed by the Federal Government and they are \nforced to cut back time and again on the services the people have come \nto expect.\n  Yesterday we had an interesting informal hearing on the Senate side. \nI hope it is a portent of good things to come. A bipartisan hearing \nwith Senator Specter, Senator Hutchison, as well as Senator Collins on \nthe Republican side, joined with Senators Kennedy, Rockefeller, \nWellstone, and myself to talk about this issue and to say that before \nCongress adjourns, we need to address what is known as the Balanced \nBudget Act reform as it relates to Medicare and Medicaid. I believe \nthere is a genuine sentiment on the floor of the Senate, a \nstrong bipartisan Senate, that we do this before we go home.\n\n  In my conversations with hospital administrators and doctors, those \nwho are managing nursing homes, those who are providing valuable health \ncare services, there is nothing more important to them than getting \nthis done before we leave. No excuse will do. It was part of the \ngeneral tax relief bill that was pending before Congress, a \ncontroversial bill that involved over $250 billion in tax relief over \nthe next 10 years. That bill is caught up in controversy and is going \nnowhere. The President has said he would have to veto it. The provision \nin there relative to Medicare and Medicaid would be lost in that \nprocess.\n  It has been reported in the newspapers, and I think it is probably \naccurate, that the leadership has pulled away from that tax bill now \nand believes it cannot pass. But we would make a serious mistake if we \nbacked off from our commitment to deal with Medicare and Medicaid \nbefore we adjourn this Congress. I think there is a will and there is a \nway.\n  I have spoken with the representative from the White House, Mr. Lew, \nwho heads up the Office of Management and Budget, and my colleague and \nfriend, the Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert, who understands the \nimportance of this issue to the State of Illinois. I have talked to my \ncolleagues on this floor. We clearly can achieve this. In achieving it, \nwe can send back a message not only to rural hospitals, which frankly \nare facing the ruin of declining revenues at a time when they are \ntrying to keep their doors open, but also hospitals in the inner cities \nand hospitals across America, teaching hospitals, and others that rely \non these reimbursements.\n  I urge my colleagues, as we consider the next Congress, let's not \nforget the remaining agenda of this Congress. It is not enough to pack \nour bags, wish everyone a happy holiday, and head home. There are \nimportant items still to be resolved. We were elected and took an oath \nof office to resolve this. No excuse will do at this point. Let us pass \nthose pending appropriations bills, make the compromises necessary to \ndo so, and not forget our responsibility under Medicare and Medicaid \nacross the United States to seniors, the disabled, and the \ndisadvantaged, who rely on those programs for quality health care.\n  I think it can be done. I hope my colleagues join me in making \ncertain we make that effort as we close this session of the Congress.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/07/senate-section/article/S11683-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 2415, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Conference report to accompany the bill (H.R. 2415) to \n     enhance security of United States missions and personnel \n     overseas, to authorize appropriations for the Department of \n     State for fiscal year 2000, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we are now \nin debate on the bankruptcy bill; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself, from Senator Leahy's time, 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am sorry, I have my own time.\n  Mr. President, The proponents of this bill argue that people file \nbecause they want to get out of their obligations, because they're \nuntrustworthy, because they're dishonest, because there is no stigma in \nfiling for bankruptcy.\n\n  But any look at the data tells you otherwise. We know that in the \nvast majority of cases it is a drastic step taken by families in \ndesperate financial circumstances and overburdened by debt. The main \nincome earner may have lost his or her job. There may be sudden illness \nor a terrible accident requiring medical care.\n  Specifically we know that nearly half of all debtors report that high \nmedical costs forced them into bankruptcy--this is an especially \nserious problem for the elderly. But when you think about it, a medical \ncrisis can be a double financial whammy for any family. First there are \nthe high costs associated with treatment of serious health problem. \nCosts that may not be fully covered by insurance, and certainly the \nover 30 million Americans without health insurance are especially \nvulnerable. But a serious accident or illness may disable--at least for \na time--the primary wage earner in the household. Even if it isn't the \nperson who draws the income, a parent may have to take significant time \nto care for a sick or disabled child. Or a son or daughter may need to \ncare for an elderly parent. This means a loss in income. It means more \ndebt and the inability to pay that debt.\n  Are people overwhelmed with medical debt or sidelined by illness \ndeadbeats? This bill assumes they are. For example, it would force them \ninto credit counseling before they could file--as if a serious illness \nor disability is something that can be counseled away.\n\n[[Page S11684]]\n\n  Women single filers are now the largest group in bankruptcy, and are \none third of all filers. They are also the fastest growing. Since 1981, \nthe number of women filing alone increased by more than 700 percent. A \nwoman single parent has a 500 percent greater likelihood of filing for \nbankruptcy than the population generally. Single women with children \noften earn far less than single men aside for the difficulties and \ncosts of raising children alone. Divorce is also a major factor in \nbankruptcy. Income drops, women, again, are especially hard hit. They \nmay not have worked prior to the divorce, and now have custody of the \nchildren.\n  Are single women with children deadbeats? This bill assumes they are. \nThe new nondischargeability of credit card debt will hit hard those \nwomen who use the cards to tide them over after a divorce until their \nincome stabilizes. And the ``safe harbor'' in the conference report \nwhich proponents argue will shield low and moderate income debtors from \nthe means test will not benefit many single mothers who need help the \nmost because it is based on the combined income of the debtor and the \ndebtor's spouse, even if they are separated, the spouse is not filing \nfor bankruptcy, and the spouse is providing no support for the debtor \nand her children. In other words, a single mother who is being deprived \nof needed support from a well-off spouse is further harmed by this \nbill, which will deem the full income of that spouse available to pay \ndebts for determination of whether the safe harbor and means test \napplies.\n  Mr. President, you will hear my colleagues talk about high economic \ngrowth and low unemployment and wonder how so many people could be in \ncircumstances that would require them to file for bankruptcy. Well, the \nrosy statistics mask what has been modest real wage growth at the same \ntime the debt burden on many families has skyrocketed. And it also \nmasks what has been real pain in certain industries and certain \ncommunities as the economies restructure. Even temporary job loss may \nbe enough to overwhelm a family that carries significant loans and \noften the reality is that a new job may be at a lower wage level--\nmaking a previously manageable debt burden unworkable.\n  So what does this bill do to keep people who undergo these wrenching \nexperiences out of bankruptcy? Nothing. Zero. Tough luck. Instead, this \nconference report just makes the fresh start of bankruptcy harder to \nachieve. But this doesn't change anyone's circumstances, this doesn't \nchange the fact that these folks no longer earn enough to sustain their \ndebt. Mr. President, there is not one thing in this so called \nbankruptcy reform bill that would promote economic security in working \nfamilies.\n  When you push the rhetoric aside, one thing becomes clear: The \nbankruptcy system is a critical safety net for working families in this \ncountry. It is a difficult demoralizing process, but for nearly all who \ndecide to file, it means the difference between a financial disaster \nbeing temporary or permanent. The repercussions of tearing that safety \nnet asunder will be tremendous, but the authors of the bill remain deaf \nto the chorus of protest and indignation that is beginning to swell as \nordinary Americans and members of Congress begin to understand that \nbankrupt Americans are much like themselves--are exactly like \nthemselves--and that they are only one layoff, one medical bill, one \npredatory loan away from joining the ranks.\n\n  For the debtor and his family the benefit of bankruptcy--despite the \nembarrassment, despite the humiliation of acknowledging financial \nfailure--is obvious, to get out from crushing debt, to be able to once \nagain attempt to live within one's means, to concentrate one's income \non clear priorities such as food, housing and transportation. But it is \nalso the fundamental principles of a just society to ensure that \nfinancial mistakes or unexpected circumstances do not mean banishment \nforever from productive society.\n  The ``fresh start'' that is under attack here in the Senate today is \nnothing less than a critical safety net that protects America's working \nfamilies. As Sullivan Warren and Westbrook put it in ``The Fragile \nMiddle Class'':\n\n       Bankruptcy is a handhold for middle class debtors on the \n     way down. These families have suffered economic dislocation, \n     but the ones that file for bankruptcy have not given up. They \n     have not uprooted their families and drifted from town to \n     town in search of work. They have not gone to the underground \n     economy, working for cash and saying off the books. Instead, \n     these are middle class people fighting to stay where they \n     are, trying to find a way to cope with their declining \n     economic fortunes. Most have come to realize that their \n     incomes will never be the same as they once were. As their \n     comments show, they realize they can live on $30,000 or \n     $20,000 or even $10,000. But they cannot do that and meet the \n     obligations that they ran up while they were making much \n     more. When put to a choice between paying credit card debt \n     and mortgage debt, between dealing with a dunning notice from \n     Sears and putting groceries on the table, they will go to the \n     bankruptcy courts, declare themselves failures, and save \n     their future income for their mortgage and their groceries.\n\n  I say to my colleagues, there may be many different standards that \ndifferent members have for bringing legislation to the floor of the \nUnited States Senate. We come from different backgrounds, we come from \ndifferent states, we have different philosophies about the role of \ngovernment in society. We have differing priorities. But for God's \nsake, there should be one principle that all of us can get behind and \nthat is that we should do no harm here in our work in America's working \nfamilies.\n  That's what is at stake here. This is a debate about priorities. This \nis a debate about what side you're on. This is a debate about who you \nstand with. Will you stand with the big banks and the credit card \ncompanies or will you stand with working families, with seniors, with \nsingle women with children, with African Americans and hispanics.\n  But I would say to my colleagues on the floor of the United States \nSenate today that this is not a debate about winners and losers. \nBecause we all lose if we erode the middle class in this country. We \nall lose if we take away some of the critical underpinnings that shore \nup our working families. Sure, in the short run big banks and credit \ncard companies may pad their profits, but in the long run our families \nwill be less secure, our entrepreneurs will become more risk adverse \nand less entrepreneurial.\n  How so? Well this how a Georgia Congressman described the issue in \n1841:\n\n       Many of those who become a victim to the reverses are among \n     the most high-spirited and liberal-minded men of the \n     country--men who build up your cities, sustain your \n     benevolent institutions, open up new avenues to trade, and \n     pour into channels before unfilled the tide of capital.\n\n  This is still true today.\n  This isn't a debate about reducing the high number of bankruptcies. \nNo way will this legislation do that. Indeed, by rewarding the reckless \nlending that got us here in the first place we will see more consumers \noverburdened with debt.\n  No, this is a debate about punishing failure. Whether self inflicted \nor uncontrolled and unexpected. This is a debate about punishing \nfailure. And if there is one that this country has learned, punishing \nfailure doesn't work. You need to correct mistakes, prevent abuse. But \nyou also need to lift people up when they've stumbled, not beat them \ndown.\n  Of course, what the Congress is poised to do here with this bill is \neven worse within the context of this Congress. This is a Congress that \nhas failed to address skyrocketing drug costs for seniors, this is a \nCongress that has failed to enact a Patients' Bill of Rights much less \ngive all Americans access to affordable health care. This is a Congress \nthat does not invest in education, that does not invest in affordable \nchild care. This a Congress that has yet to raise the minimum wage.\n  But instead, we declare war on America's working families with this \nbill.\n  What is clear is that this bill will be a death of a thousand cuts \nfor all debtors regardless of whether the means test applies. There are \nnumerous provisions in the bankruptcy reform bill designed to raise \nthe cost of bankruptcy, to delay its protection, to reduce the \nopportunity for a fresh start. But rather than falling the heaviest on \nthe supposed rash of wealthy abusers of the code, they will fall \nhardest on low and middle income families who desperately need the \nsafety net of bankruptcy.\n\n  I want to take some time to talk about the effect this bill will have \non low and middle class debtors. Remember, nearly all debtors who file \nfor bankruptcy are not wealthy scofflaws,\n\n[[Page S11685]]\n\nbut rather people in desperate economic circumstances who file as a \nlast resort to try and rebuild their finances, and, in many cases, end \nharassment by their creditors. And in particular I want to remind my \ncolleagues of the May 15, 2000 issue of Time magazine whose cover story \non this so-called bankruptcy reform legislation was entitled ``Soaked \nby Congress.''\n  The article, written by reporters Don Bartlett and Jim Steele, is a \ndetailed look at the true picture of who files for bankruptcy in \nAmerica. You will find it far different from the skewed version being \nused to justify this legislation. The article carefully documents how \nlow and middle income families--increasingly households headed by \nsingle women--will be denied the opportunity of a ``fresh start'' if \nthis punitive legislation is enacted. As Brady Williamson, the Chairman \nof the National Bankruptcy Review Commission, notes in the article, the \nbankruptcy bill would condemn many working families to ``what \nessentially is a life term in debtor's prison.''\n  Now proponents of this legislation have tried to refute the Time \nmagazine article. Indeed during these final days of debate you will \nhear the bill's supporters claim that low and moderate income debtors \nwill be unaffected by this legislation. But colleagues, if you listen \ncarefully to their statements you will hear that they only claim that \nsuch debtors will not be affected by the bill's means tests. Not only \nis that claim demonstrably false--the means test and the safe harbor \nhave been written in a way that will capture many working families who \nare filing for Chapter 7 relief in good faith--but it ignores the vast \nmajority of this legislation which will impose needless hurdles and \npunitive costs on all families who file for bankruptcy regardless of \ntheir income. Nor does the safe harbor apply to any of these \nprovisions!\n  You might ask why the Congress has chosen to come down so hard on \nordinary working folk down on their luck. How is it that this bill is \nso skewed against their interests and in favor of big banks and credit \ncard companies? Maybe that's because these families don't have million-\ndollar lobbyists representing them before Congress. They don't give \nhundreds of thousands of dollars in soft money to the Democratic and \nRepublican parties. They don't spend their days hanging outside the \nSenate chamber waiting to bend a Member's ear. Unfortunately it looks \nlike the industry got to us first.\n  They may have lost a job, they may be struggling with a divorce, \nmaybe there are unexpected medical bills. But you know what? They are \nbusy trying to turn their lives around. And I think it is shameful that \nat the same time this story is unfolding for a million families across \nAmerica, Congress is poised to make it harder for them to turn it \naround. Who do we represent?\n  I want to take a few minutes to explain exactly what the effects of \nthis bill will be on real life debtors--the folks profiled in the Time \narticle. I hope the authors of the bill will come to the floor to \ndebate on these points. There could be the opportunity for some real \nprogress on an issue that has yet to be addressed by the bill's \nsupporters. Specifically, I challenge them to come to the floor and \nexplain to their colleagues how making bankruptcy relief harder and \nmuch more costly to achieve will benefit working families.\n  Charles and Lisa Trapp were forced into bankruptcy by medical \nproblems. Their daughter's medical treatment left them with medical \ndebts well over $100,000, as well as a number of credit card debts. \nBecause of her daughter's degenerative condition, Ms. Trapp had to \nleave her job as a letter carrier about two months before the \nbankruptcy case was filed to manage her daughter's care. Before she \nleft her job, the family's annual income was about $83,000, or about \n$6900 per month, so under the bill, close to that amount, about $6200, \nthe average monthly income for the previous six months, would be deemed \nto be their current monthly income, even though their gross monthly \nincome at the time of filing was only $4800. Based on this fictitious \ndeemed income, the Trapps would have been presumed to be abusing the \nBankruptcy Code, since their allowed expenses under the IRS guidelines \nand secured debt payments amounted to $5339. The difference of about \n$850 per month would have been deemed available to pay unsecured debts \nand was over the $167 per month triggering a presumption of abuse. The \nTrapps would have had to submit detailed documentation to rebut this \npresumption, trying to show that their income should be adjusted \ndownward because of special circumstances and that there was no \nreasonable alternative to Ms. Trapp leaving her job.\n  Because their ``current monthly income,'' although fictitious, was \nover the median income, the family would have been subject to motions \nfor ``abuse'' filed by creditors, who might argue that Ms. Trapp should \nnot have left her job, and that the Trapps should have tried to pay \ntheir debts in chapter 13. They also would not have been protected by \nthe safe harbor. The Trapps would have had to pay their attorney to \ndefend such motions and if they could not have afforded the thousand \ndollars or more that this would have cost, their case would have been \ndismissed and they would have received no bankruptcy relief. If they \nprevailed on the motion, it is very unlikely they could recover \nattorney's fees from a creditor who brought the motion, since recovery \nof fees is permitted only if the creditor's motion was frivolous and \ncould not arguably be supported by any reasonable interpretation of the \nlaw (a much weaker standard than the original Senate bill.) Because the \nmeans test is so vague and ambiguous, and creditor could argue that it \nwas simply making a good faith attempt to apply the means test, which \nafter all created a presumption of abuse.\n\n  Of course, young Annelise Trapp's medical problems continue and are \nonly getting worse. Under current law, if the Trapps again amass \nmedical and other debts they can't pay, they could seek refuge in \nchapter 13 where they would be required to pay all that they could \nafford. Under the new bill, the Trapps could not file a chapter 13 case \nfor five years. Even then, their payments would be determined by the \nIRS expense standards and they would have to stay in their plan for 5 \nyears, rather than the 3 years required by current law. The time for \nfiling a new chapter 7 would also be increased by the bill, from 6 \nyears to 8 years.\n  Not only does the majority leader want to ram through bankruptcy \nlegislation on the State Department authorization conference report, \nwhich he has literally hijacked for that purpose, there is no question \nthat this is a significantly worse legislation than what passed the \nSenate. In fact, there is no pretending that this is a bill designed to \ncurb real abuse of the bankruptcy code.\n  Does this bill take on wealthy debtors who file frivolous claims and \nshield their assets in multi million dollar mansions? No, it guts the \ncap on the homestead exemption adopted by the Senate. I ask my \ncolleagues who support this bill: how can you claim that this bill is \ndesigned to crack down on wealthy scoff laws without closing the \nmassive homestead loophole that exists in five states, and in a bill \nthat falls so harshly on the backs of low and moderate income \nindividuals?\n  I wonder how my colleagues who vote for this conference report will \nexplain this back home. How will they explain that they supported \nletting wealthy debtors shield their assets from creditors at the same \ntime that voted to end the practice under current law of stopping \neviction proceedings against tenants who are behind on rent who file \nfor bankruptcy. With one hand we gut tenants rights, with the other we \nshield wealthy homeowners.\n  Nor does this bill contain another amendment offered by Senator \nSchumer and adopted by the Senate that would prevent violators of the \nFair Access to Clinic entrances Act--which protects women's health \nclinics--from using the bankruptcy system to walk away from their \npunishment. Again, I thought the sponsors of the measure wanted to \ncrack down on people who game the system. What could be a bigger misuse \nof the system then to use the bankruptcy code to get out of damages \nimposed because you committed an act of violence against a women's \nhealth clinic?\n  And yet the secret conferees on his bill simply walked away. They \nwalked away from the real opportunity to prohibit an abuse that all \nsides recognize exist, but they also walked away from an opportunity to \nprotect women from\n\n[[Page S11686]]\n\nharassment. They walked away from the opportunity to protect women from \nviolence.\n  So why shouldn't people be cynical about this process? Ever since \nbankruptcy reform was passed by the Senate this bill has gotten less \nbalanced, less fair, and more punitive--but only for low and moderate \nincome debtors. So again, I would say to my colleagues, this bill is a \nquestion of our priorities. Will we stand with wealthy dead beats or \nwill we take a stand to protect women seeking reproductive health \nservices from harassment?\n  But unfortunately, these were not the only areas where the shadow \nconferees beat a retreat from balance and fairness.\n  You know, a lot of folks must be watching the progress of this \nbankruptcy bill over the course of this year with awe and envy. Can my \ncolleagues name one other bill that the leadership has worked so hard \nand with such determination to move by any and all means necessary? \nCertainly not an increase in the minimum wage. Certainly not a \nmeaningful prescription drug benefit for seniors, certainly not the \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. On many \nissues, on most issues, this has been a do nothing Congress. But on so-\ncalled bankruptcy reform, the Senate and House leadership can't seem to \ndo enough!\n  One can only wonder what we could have accomplished for working \nfamilies if the leadership had the same determination on other issues. \nUnfortunately those other issues did have the financial services \nindustry behind it. And you have to give them credit--no pun intended--\nover the past couple of years they have played the Congress like a \nviolin. And what do you know, here we are trying to ram through this \nbankruptcy bill in the 11th hour as the 106th Congress draws to a \nclose.\n  In reading the consumer credit industry's propaganda one would think \nthe story of bankruptcy in America is one of large numbers of \nirresponsible, high income borrowers and their conniving attorney using \nthe law to take advantage of naive and overly trusting lenders.\n  As it turns out, that picture of debtors is almost completely \ninaccurate. The number of bankruptcies has fallen steadily over the \npast months, charge offs (defaults on credit cards) are down and \ndelinquencies have fallen to the lowest levels since 1995, and now all \nsides agree that nearly all debtors resort to bankruptcy not to game \nthe system but rather as a desperate measure of economic survival.\n  It also turns out that the innocence of lenders in the admittedly \nstill high numbers of bankruptcies has also been--to be charitable--\noverstated.\n  As high cost debt, credit cards, retail charge cards, and financing \nplans for consumer goods have skyrocketed in recent years, so have the \nnumber of bankruptcy filings. As the consumer credit industry has begun \nto aggressively court the poor and the vulnerable, bankruptcies have \nrisen. Credit card companies brazenly dangle literally billions of card \noffers to high debt families every year. They encourage card holders to \nmake low payments toward their card balances, guaranteeing that a few \nhundred dollars in clothing or food will take years to pay off. The \nlengths that companies go to keep their customers in debt is \nridiculous.\n  In the interest of full disclosure--something that the industry \nitself isn't very good at--I would like my colleagues to be aware of \nwhat the consumer credit industry is practicing even as it preaches the \nsermon of responsible borrowing. After all, debt involves a borrower \nand a lender; poor choices or irresponsible behavior by either party \ncan make the transaction go sour.\n  So how responsible has the industry been? I suppose that it depends \non how you look at it. On the one hand, consumer lending is \nterrifically profitable, with high cost credit card lending the most \nprofitable of all (except perhaps for even higher costs credit like \npayday loans). So I guess by the standard of responsibility to the \nbottom line they have done a good job.\n  On the other hand, if you define responsibility as promoting fiscal \nhealth among families, educating on judicious use of credit, ensuring \nthat borrowers do not go beyond their means, then it is hard to imagine \nhow the financial services industry could be bigger deadbeats.\n  According the Office of the Comptroller of Currency, the amount of \nrevolving credit outstanding--i.e. the amount of open ended credit \n(like credit cards) being extended--increased seven times during 1980 \nand 1995. And between 1993 and 1997, during the sharpest increases in \nthe bankruptcy filings, the amount of credit card debt doubled. Doesn't \nsound like lenders were too concerned about the high number of \nbankruptcies--at least it didn't stop them from pushing high cost \ncredit like candy.\n  Indeed, what do credit card companies do in response to ``danger \nsignals'' from a customer that they may be in over their head. \nAccording to ``The Fragile Middle Class'' an in depth study of who \nfiles for bankruptcy and why, the company's reaction isn't what you \nwould think.\n  In other words, those folks who may have come into your office this \nyear or last year talking about how they needed protection from \ncustomers who walked away from debts, who thought Congress should \nmandate credit counseling--to promote responsible money management--as \na requirement for seeking bankruptcy protection, who argued that reform \nof the bankruptcy code is needed because of decline in the stigma of \nbankruptcy have been pouring gasoline on the flames the whole time. Of \ncourse, in the end, if this bill passes, it's working families who get \nburned.\n\n  But guess what? It gets even worse, because the consumer finance \nindustry isn't just reckless in its lending habits, big name lenders \nall too often break or skirt the law in both marketing and collection.\n  For example:\n  In June of this year the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency \nreached a settlement with Providian Financial Corporation in which \nProvidian agreed to pay at least $300 million to its customers to \ncompensate them for using deceptive marketing tactics. Among these were \nbaiting customers with ``no annual fees'' but then charging an annual \nfee unless the customer accepted the $156 credit protection program \n(coverage which was itself deceptively marketed). The company also \nmisrepresented the savings their customers would get from transferring \naccount balances from another card.\n  In 1999, Sears, Roebuck & Co. paid $498 million in settlement damages \nand $60 million in fines for illegally coercing reaffirmations--\nagreements with borrowers to repay debt--from its cardholders. But \napparently this is just the cost of doing business: Bankruptcy judges \nin California, Vermont, and New York have claimed that Sears is still \nup to its old strong arm tactics, but is now using legal loopholes to \navoid disclosure. Now colleagues, Sears is a creditor in one third of \nall personal bankruptcies. And by the way, this legislation contains \nprovisions that would have protected Sears from paying back any monies \nthat customers were tricked into paying under these plans.\n  This July, North American Capital Corp., a subsidiary of GE, agreed \nto pay a $250,000 fine to settle charges brought by the Federal Trade \nCommission that the company had violated the Fair Debt Collection \nPractices Act by lying to and harassing customers during collections.\n  In October 1998, the Department of Justice brought an antitrust suit \nagainst VISA and Mastercard, the two largest credit card associations, \ncharging them with illegal collusion that reduced competition and made \ncredit cards more expensive for borrowers.\n  These are just a few examples, I could go on and on. At a minimum, \nthese illegal and unscrupulous practices rob honest creditors who play \nby the rules of repayment. And the cost to debtors and other creditors \nalike are tremendous.\n  But other practices are not illegal, merely unsavory.\n  Let me repeat myself in case my colleagues somehow missed the blatant \nhypocrisy of what's going on here: The big banks and credit card \ncompanies are pushing to rig the system so that you cannot file for \nbankruptcy unless you perform credit counseling at the same time that \nthey are jeopardizing the health the credit counseling industry and \nmaking it significantly more costly for debtors.\n\n[[Page S11687]]\n\n  That is pretty brazen, but as my colleagues will hear over and over \nin this debate, this isn't just an industry that wants to have it both \nways, it wants to have it several different ways.\n  Of course, these are mild abuses compared to predatory lending. \nSchemes such as payday loans, car title pawns, and home equity \nloan scams harm tens of thousands of more Americans on top of those \nshaken down by the mainstream creditors. Such operators often target \nthose on the economic fringe like the working poor and the recently \nbankrupt. They even claim to be performing a public service: providing \nloans to the uncreditworthy. It just also happens to be obscenely \nprofitable to overwhelm vulnerable borrowers with debt at usurious \nrates of interest. Hey, who said good deeds don't get rewarded?\n\n  Reading this conference report makes it clear who has the clout in \nWashington. There is not one provision in this bill that holds the \nconsumer credit industry truly responsible for their lending habits. My \ncolleagues talk about the message they want to send to deadbeat \ndebtors, that bankruptcy will no longer be a ``free ride'' to a clean \nslate. Well what message does this bill send to the banks, and the \ncredit card companies? The message is clear: make risky loans, \ndiscourage savings, promote excess, and Congress will bail you out by \nletting you be more coercive in your collections, by putting barriers \nin between your customers and bankruptcy relief, and by ensuring that \nthe debtor will emerge from bankruptcy with his vassalage to you \nintact. This is in stark contrast to the numerous punitive provisions \nof the bill aimed at borrowers.\n  The record is clear: lenders routinely discourage healthy borrowing \npractices, encourage excessive indebtedness and impose barriers to \npaying of debt all in the name of padding their profits. It would be a \nbitter irony if Congress were to reward big banks, credit card \ncompanies, retailers and other lenders for their bad behavior, but that \nexactly what passage of bankruptcy reform legislation would do.\n  I would characterize the debate like this and make it very simple for \nmy colleagues. This is fundamentally a referendum on Congress' \npriorities and you simply need to ask yourself: whose side am I on? Am \nI on the side of the working families who need a financial fresh start \nbecause they are overburdened with debt? Am I for preserving this \ncritical safety net for the middle class? Will I stand with the civil \nrights community, and religious community, and the women's community, \nand consumer groups and the labor unions who fight for ordinary \nAmericans and who oppose this bill?\n  Or will you stand with the credit card companies, and the big banks, \nand the auto lenders who desperately want this bill to pad their \nprofits? I hope the choice will be clear to colleagues.\n  Let me say a few words about the process on this legislation, which \nis terrible. The House and Senate Republicans have taken a secretly \nnegotiated bankruptcy bill and stuffed it into the State Department \nauthorization bill in which not one provision of the original bill \nremains. Of course, State Department authorization is the last of many \ntargets. The majority leader has talked about doing this on an \nappropriations bill, on a crop insurance bill, on the electronic \nsignatures bill, on the Violence Against Women Act. So disparate are we \nto serve the big banks and credit card companies that no bill has been \nsafe from this controversial baggage.\n  We are again making a mockery of scope of conference. We are \nabdicating our right to amend legislation. We are abdicating our right \nto debate legislation. And for what? Expediency. Convenience.\n  However, I am not sure that we have ever been so brazen in the past. \nYes we have combined unrelated, extraneous measures into conference \nreports. Usually because the majority wishes to pass one bill using the \npopularity of another. Putting it into a conference report makes it \nprivileged. Putting into a conference report makes it unamenable. So \nthey piggy back legislation. Fine. But this may be the first time in \nthe Senate's history where the majority has hollowed out a piece of \nlegislation in conference--left nothing behind but the bill number--and \ninserted a completely unrelated measure.\n  I challenge my colleagues to walk into any high school civics class \nroom in America and explain this process. Explain this new way that a \nbill becomes law. What the majority has essentially done is started \ndown the road toward a virtual tricameral legislature--House, Senate, \nand conference committee. But at least the House and the Senate have \nthe power under the constitution to amend legislation passed by the \nother house--measures adopted by the all-powerful conference committee \nare not amendable.\n  Is bankruptcy reform so important that we should weaken the integrity \nof the Senate itself? It is not. I question whether any legislation is \nthat important, but to make such a blatant mockery of the legislative \nprocess on a bill that is going to be vetoed anyway? That is \neffectively dead? Just to make a political point? What have we come to?\n  This is a game to the majority. The game is how to move legislation \nthrough the Senate with as little interference as possible from actual \nSenators.\n  I remind my colleagues of what Senator Kennedy said 4 years ago when \nthe Senate voted to gut rule XXVIII, the Senate rule limiting the scope \nof conference which we are violating with this conference report. \nSpeaking very prophetically he said:\n\n       The rule that a conference committee cannot include \n     extraneous matter is central to the way that the Senate \n     conducts its business. When we send a bill to conference we \n     do so knowing that the conference committee's work is \n     likely to become law. Conference reports are privileged. \n     Motions to proceed to them cannot be debated, and such \n     reports cannot be amended. So conference committees are \n     already very powerful. But if conference committees are \n     permitted to add completely extraneous matters in \n     conference, that is, if the point of order against such \n     conduct becomes a dead letter, conferees will acquire \n     unprecedented power. They will acquire the power to \n     legislate in a privileged, unreviewable fashion on \n     virtually any subject. They will be able to completely \n     bypass the deliberative process of the Senate. Mr. \n     President, this is a highly dangerous situation. It will \n     make all of us less willing to send bills to conference \n     and leave all of us vulnerable to passage of \n     controversial, extraneous legislation any time a bill goes \n     to conference. I hope the Senate will not go down this \n     road. Today the narrow issue is the status of one \n     corporation under the labor laws. But tomorrow the issue \n     might be civil rights, States' rights, health care, \n     education, or anything else. It might be a matter much \n     more sweeping than the labor law issue that is before us \n     today.\n\n  He was absolutely right. We are headed down that slippery slope he \ndescribed. For the last three years we have handled appropriations in \nthis manner. We have combined bills, the text is written by a small \ngroup of Senators and Congressmen and these bills have been presented \nto the Senate as an up or down proposition. And now we're doing it with \nso-called bankruptcy reform.\n  Conference reports are privileged. It is very difficult for a \nminority in the Senate to stop a conference report as they can with \nother legislation. That is why these conference reports are being used \nin this way, and that is why the rules are supposed to restrict their \nscope.\n  Last year, Senator Daschle attempted to reinstate rule 28 on the \nSenate floor. He was voted down, and he spoke specifically about how we \nhave corrupted the legislative process in the Senate:\n\n       I wish this had been a one time event. Unfortunately, it \n     happens over and over and over. It is a complete emasculation \n     of the process that the Founding Fathers had set up. It has \n     nothing to do with the legislative process. If you were to \n     write a book on how a bill becomes a law, you would need \n     several volumes. In fact, if the consequences were not so \n     profound, some could say that you would need a comic book \n     because it is hilarious to look at the lengths we have gone \n     to thwart and undermine and, in an extraordinary way, destroy \n     a process that has worked so well for 220 years.\n\n  So where does it stop? As long as the majority want to avoid debate, \nas long as the majority wants to avoid amendments and as long as \nSenators will go along to get along we will find ourselves forced to \ncast up or down votes on legislation--a rubber stamp yes or no--with no \nability to actually legislate.\n  Each Senator who today votes for this conference report should know \nthey may find themselves in the majority today, they may be OK with \nletting this bill go because they are not offended by what it contains, \nbut be forewarned, the day will come when you\n\n[[Page S11688]]\n\nwill be on the other side of this tactic. Today it is bankruptcy \nreform, but someday you will be the one protesting the inclusion of a \nprovision that you believe is outrageous.\n  Regardless of the merits of bankruptcy reform, this is a terrible \nprocess. I would urge my colleagues to vote no to send a message to the \nleadership. Send a message that you want your rights as Senators back.\n  Finally, I end on this note. I think many in this body believe that a \nsociety is judged by its treatment of its most vulnerable members. By \nthat standard, this is an exceptionally rough bill in what has been a \nvery rough Congress. All the consumer groups oppose this bill, 31 \norganizations devoted to women and children's issues oppose this \nlegislation.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that this is a bad bill. It punishes the \nvulnerable and rewards the big banks and credit card companies for \ntheir own poor practices. And this legislation has only gotten worse in \nthe sham conference.\n  Earlier, I used the word ``injustice'' to describe this bill--and \nthat is exactly right. It will be a bitter irony if creditors are able \nto use a crisis--largely of their own making--to convince Congress to \ndecrease borrower's access to bankruptcy relief. I hope my colleagues \nreject this scheme and reject this bill.\n  Mr. President, I will not repeat what I said yesterday at the \nbeginning of this debate. I will respond to some comments that were \nmade on the floor dealing with chapter 12.\n  Some of my colleagues have talked about chapter 12 farmers' \nbankruptcy relief, and they have made the argument that opposition to \nthis bankruptcy bill has really held up chapter 12, which is very \nimportant for protection of family farmers. I point out to colleagues \nthat it is precisely the opposite case.\n  A year ago when it first became clear that this bankruptcy bill, for \nvery good reasons, was not going to move forward, under the able \nleadership of Senators and Representatives--Senators such as Senator \nGrassley--legislation was introduced and passed which extended chapter \n12 bankruptcy protection for farmers. Within about 20 days, it was \nsigned by the White House and passed. No problem.\n  This past summer, in June, the House passed an extension, but for \nsome reason the majority leader took no action over here. Then in \nOctober, the House passed a 1-year extension for chapter 12 for family \nfarmers. Again, the majority leader took no action over here.\n  This can pass within 24 hours. What we have here is a bit of a game \ngoing on where chapter 12 becomes held hostage to a bankruptcy bill \nwith many harsh features which will be vetoed by the President and, in \nmy view, either the veto will be sustained or we will not be here and \nit will be pocket vetoed and it will not become law and should not \nbecome law.\n  But let me be clear. Chapter 12, the bankruptcy relief for family \nfarmers, can be passed separately within a day or two. It is not a \nproblem. So no one from any ag State should believe that somehow you \nhave to vote for a harsh piece of legislation, that targets the most \nvulnerable citizens, that is completely one sided, that calls for no \naccountability from credit card companies or larger banks, in order to \nget bankruptcy relief for family farmers. It is just simply not true.\n  The proponents of this bill have argued--they have been pretty \nexplicit about this--that often the people who are filing for chapter 7 \ndo so because they want to get out of their obligations, because they \nare untrustworthy, because they are dishonest, and because they sort of \nfeel no stigma in filing for bankruptcy.\n  I would, one more time, like to point out on the floor of the Senate \nthat about 50 percent of the people who file for chapter 7 do so \nbecause of major medical bills that have put them under. Quite often, \nit becomes a double whammy: Either you not only are faced with a major \nmedical bill that puts your family under--we have not done anything to \nhelp our families afford health care--or, which is the double whammy, \nyou cannot work because you are the one who is ill, in which case you \nlose your income, or it can be a loved one who is faced with a serious \nillness or disabling injury and you are the one who takes care of them, \nin which case, again, you can lose your job and your income.\n  So I do not really think we ought to be viewing families who file \nchapter 7 because of major medical bills as dishonest or untrustworthy.\n  Now the largest single group of those citizens who file for \nbankruptcy are women. They are one-third of all the filers. They are \nthe fastest growing group. Since 1981, the number of women filing alone \nincreased by more than 700 percent.\n  It is not so surprising that single parents--women with children--are \namong the largest or disproportionate number of people who file for \nbankruptcy. Because, in addition to medical costs, divorce is a major \nfactor in bankruptcy--income drops--women again are especially hard \nhit. Many of them have not worked prior to divorce, and now they have \ncustody of the children and find themselves in very difficult financial \ncircumstances.\n  Are single women with children deadbeats? All too much of this bill \nassumes they are. The new nondischargeability of credit card debt will \nhit hard those women who use the cards to tide them over after divorce \nuntil their income stabilizes. The safe harbor in the conference \nreport, which proponents argue will shield low- and moderate-income \ndebtors from the means test, will not benefit many single mothers who \nneed the help the most because it is based upon the combined income of \nthe debtor and the debtor's spouse, even if they are separated. The \nspouse is not filing for bankruptcy, and the spouse is providing no \nsupport for the debtor or children, but that spouse's income is \nconsidered.\n  This piece of legislation does not provide a whole lot of help to \nmany hard-pressed single parents, most of whom are women.\n  I have heard some of my colleagues out here on the floor talking \nabout economic growth, low unemployment, saying: Given this economic \nperformance, how can you have people filing for bankruptcy? Surely, it \nmust be, again, that these are people who feel no stigma.\n\n  You know what. This rosy picture masks the fact that there is real \npain in certain industries, and there are certain communities and \ncertain families under siege.\n  This is a news release from the LTV Corporation, Hoyt Lakes, MN, \nwhich had previously announced on May 24, 2000, its intention to close \nthe local mining operation. They were going to close at the end of the \nsummer. Now they have said, in this release, that they are going to \ncease permanently on February 24, 2001. This is some holiday gift from \nthis company to--I don't know--1,300 or 1,400 miners. These miners and \ntheir families wonder what is going to happen to them. These are the \nkinds of families who all too often find themselves in these difficult \neconomic circumstances, even with this booming economy, and quite often \nhave to file for chapter 7.\n  Are we going to make the argument that these families are without a \nsense of responsibility? Are we going to make the argument that these \nfamilies are loafers and they feel no stigma?\n  What does this piece of legislation do to help keep people from \nhaving to undergo these wrenching experiences that force them into \nbankruptcy? Nothing. Zero. Tough luck. The only thing this piece of \nlegislation does is make it harder for people to file bankruptcy, to \nfile chapter 7, to rebuild their lives.\n  We do not do anything to help on health care costs. We do not do \nanything in terms of dealing with the unfair dumping of steel with a \nfair trade policy. We do not do anything in terms of passing an \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. We do not do anything on \naffordable housing. We do not raise the minimum wage. We do not do \nanything to make these families more economically secure. But instead, \nwhat we do is we make it difficult for people to rebuild their lives.\n  This is sham reform. When you push the rhetoric aside, one thing \nbecomes clear: The bankruptcy system is a critical safety net for many \nmiddle-class, working-class, low-income families. It is a difficult, \ndemoralizing process, but it is a critical safety net for families. And \nwe are tearing up that safety net.\n  I say to my colleagues, there may be many different standards that \ndifferent Members have when they bring legislation to the floor of the \nSenate. We\n\n[[Page S11689]]\n\ncome from different backgrounds. We come from different States. We have \ndifferent philosophies about the role of Government in society. We have \ndifferent priorities. But, for God's sake, there should be one \nprinciple that all of us can get behind, and that is that we should do \nno harm to the most vulnerable people and most vulnerable families in \nthis country.\n  I believe strongly--and I have argued yesterday and today--that that \nis exactly what we are doing. That is what is at stake here. This is a \ndebate about priorities. This is a debate about what side you are on. \nThis is a debate about with whom you stand. Will you stand with the big \nbanks and credit card companies or will you stand with hard-pressed \nfamilies, with seniors, with single women with children, with African \nAmericans, with Hispanics, with people of color, with consumers?\n  What the Congress is poised to do here with this bill is worse within \nthe context of this Congress because this is a Congress that has failed \nto address skyrocketing drug costs for seniors; this is a Congress that \nhas failed to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights; this is a Congress that \nhas failed to make sure that Americans have access to affordable health \ncare; this is a Congress that has failed to invest in education; this \nis a Congress that has failed to invest in affordable child care; this \nis a Congress that has failed to raise the minimum wage. But instead, \nwith this bill we declare war on working families.\n  What is clear is that this piece of legislation will be a death of a \nthousand cuts for all debtors regardless of whether the means test \napplies.\n  There are numerous provisions in the bankruptcy reform bill designed \nto raise the cost of bankruptcy, to delay its protection, to reduce the \nopportunity for a fresh start. But rather than falling heaviest on the \nsupposed rash of wealthy abusers of the Code, they will fall hardest on \nlow- and middle-income families who desperately need this safety net of \nbankruptcy.\n  I commend to my colleagues, but I will not take a lot of time on it, \nthe May 15, 2000, issue of Time magazine whose cover story on so-called \nbankruptcy reform legislation was entitled ``Soaked by Congress.'' I \nhope they will read it.\n  I will quote from Brady Williamson, Chairman of the National \nBankruptcy Commission. Please remember, 116 law professors in this \ncountry who teach bankruptcy law, who do their scholarship in this \narea, have said this bill is harsh and one-sided, without balance, and \nshould not pass.\n  Brady Williamson, Chairman of the National Bankruptcy Review \nCommission, notes in the article from Time magazine: The bankruptcy \nbill would condemn many working families to ``what essentially is a \nlife term in debtors' prison.\n  I will talk a little bit about this piece of legislation in relation \nto what the Senate passed before. Not only does the majority leader \nwant to ram through bankruptcy legislation on the State Department \nauthorization conference report, which he has literally hijacked for \nthis purpose, there is no question that this is a significantly worse \npiece of legislation--I heard colleagues yesterday say ``better''--than \npassed by the Senate. Does this piece of legislation take on wealthy \ndebtors who file frivolous claims and shield their assets in \nmultimillion-dollar mansions? No. It guts the cap on the homestead \nexemption which was adopted by the Senate. It was taken out in \nconference.\n  I ask my colleagues who support this bill, how can you claim that \nthis bill is designed to crack down on wealthy scoff laws without \nclosing the massive homestead loophole that exists in five States? And \nin a bill that falls so harshly on the backs of low- and moderate-\nincome individuals, you have a huge exemption for people who can go buy \nmillion-dollar plus mansions. How do you explain that back home? How \nwill you explain that you supported letting wealthy debtors shield \ntheir assets from creditors at the same time you voted to end the \npractice under current law of stopping eviction proceedings against \ntenants who were behind on rent and who filed for bankruptcy? Poor \ntenants are evicted. Wealthy people can shield their assets and go buy \nmultimillion-dollar homes. On the one hand, we gut tenants' rights, \nwhile on the other hand we shield wealthy homeowners. That is what this \npiece of legislation is about.\n  Nor does this bill contain another amendment offered by Senator \nSchumer and adopted by the Senate that would prevent violators of the \nFair Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which protects women's health \nclinics, from using the bankruptcy system to walk away from their \npunishment.\n  Some folks are watching the progress of this bill and they are \nwatching the way this bill has developed over the last year with a \nconsiderable amount of awe and envy. Can my colleagues name one other \nbill on which the leadership has worked so hard and with such \ndetermination to move by any and all means necessary? Certainly not an \nincrease in the minimum wage; that is not a priority. Certainly not a \nmeaningful prescription drug benefit for seniors; that is not a \npriority. Certainly not reauthorization of the Elementary Secondary \nEducation Act. On many issues, on most issues, there has been nothing \ndone in this do-nothing Congress. But on the so-called bankruptcy \nreform, the Senate and House leadership can't seem to get enough. One \ncan only wonder what we could have accomplished for working families if \nthe leadership had the same determination on these other issues. \nUnfortunately, those other issues did not have the financial services \nindustry behind them.\n\n  You have to give them credit, no pun intended. Over the past couple \nof years, the financial services industry has played this Congress like \na violin. And what do you know, we are trying to ram through this \nbankruptcy bill in the 11th hour as the 106th Congress comes to a \nclose.\n  In reading the consumer credit industry's propaganda, you would think \nthe story of bankruptcy in America is one of large numbers of \nirresponsible, high-income borrowers and their conniving attorneys \nusing the law to take advantage of naive and overly trusting lenders. \nAs it turns out, that picture of the debtors is almost completely \ninaccurate. The number of bankruptcies has fallen steadily over the \npast several months. It turns out that the people about whom we are \ntalking are vulnerable citizens. The major reason is major medical \ncosts. I have made that argument.\n  As high-cost debt, credit cards, retail charge cards and financing \nplans for consumer goods have skyrocketed in recent years, so have the \nnumber of bankruptcy filings. As the consumer credit industry has begun \nto aggressively court the poor and the vulnerable, bankruptcies have \nrisen. Credit card companies brazenly dangle literally billions of \ncredit card offers to high-debt families every year. There is no \naccountability for them. They encourage credit card holders to make low \npayments toward the card balances, guaranteeing that a few $100 in \nclothing or food will take years to pay off. The lengths these \ncompanies go to keep their consumers in debt is ridiculous.\n  So in the interest of full disclosure, something that the industry \nitself is not very good at, I would like my colleagues to be aware of \nwhat the credit card industry is practicing even as it preaches the \nsermon of responsible borrowing. After all, debt involves a borrower \nand a lender. Poor choice, irresponsible behavior by either party can \nmake the transaction go sour. So how responsible has the industry been? \nIt depends upon how you look at it.\n  On the one hand, consumer lending is terrifically profitable, with \nhigh-cost credit card lending the most profitable of all, except for \nperhaps even higher cost credit such as payday loans. So I guess by the \nstandard of responsibility to the bottom line, this industry is doing \ngreat.\n  On the other hand, if you define responsibility as promoting fiscal \nhealth among families, educating on judicious use of credit, ensuring \nthat borrowers do not go beyond their means, then it is hard to imagine \nhow the financial services industry could be bigger deadbeats.\n  From studies from the Office of the Comptroller of Currency, some of \nthe settlements that have been reached with Providian Financial \nCorporation, Sears & Roebuck, American Capital Corporation, a \nsubsidiary of GE, the Department of Justice brought an antitrust suit \nagainst Visa and Mastercard. We have example after example after \nexample of abuses by this industry but\n\n[[Page S11690]]\n\nnot one word in this piece of legislation that calls for any \naccountability.\n  In case my colleagues miss the blatant hypocrisy of what is going on \nhere, the big banks and credit card companies are pushing to rig the \nsystem so you cannot file for bankruptcy unless you perform credit \ncounseling, at the same time that they are jeopardizing the health of \nthe credit counseling industry by pumping credit cards, by themselves \nabusing the system, and hardly making it easier for people, only making \nit more difficult.\n  To make it simple for my colleagues, this debate is fundamentally a \nreferendum on Congress's priorities. You simply need to ask yourself \nagain: Whose side am I on?\n  Are you on the side of working families who need a financially fresh \nstart because they are overburdened with debt? Fifty percent of \nbankruptcies are because of major medical bills. Are you for preserving \nthis critical safety net for the middle class? Will you stand with the \ncivil rights community and the religious community and the women's \ncommunity and consumer groups and labor unions who fight for ordinary \nAmericans who oppose this bill or will you stand with the credit card \ncompanies and the big banks and the auto lenders who desperately want \nthis bill to pad their profits?\n  I hope there is a clear choice for Senators.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  First of all, in response to the Senator from Minnesota, I was a \nlittle bit amused at the use of the words ``blatant hypocrisy.'' I \ndon't question his use of those words at all. But the fact is that this \nbill passed with 83 Senators voting for it. It passed the Senate and \nwent to conference. Three-fourths of the members of his caucus voted \nfor this legislation. If there is blatant hypocrisy, it is very \nbipartisan hypocrisy.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I sure will, only for the purpose of a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. My understanding is that the bill passed with the \nSchumer provision in it, and it also dealt with the homestead \nexemption. That is a different bill from the one we are considering \nright now. Am I not correct?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator is correct, but his reference was in regard \nto the credit card industry--not the Schumer amendment and not the \nprovision on homestead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, second, the interest in this legislation \nand the reason this is such an important piece of legislation is that \nthere is a lot of understanding at the grassroots of America that it is \nimmoral and unethical for people with the ability and the means to \nrepay some of their debt to go into bankruptcy court and be discharged \nof that debt.\n  It is particularly wrong when it hurts the very same low-income and \nmiddle-income people about whom the Senator from Minnesota talks. They \nhave to pay $400 more per family per year for goods and services. They \npay a higher fee or price because somebody else isn't paying their \nbills. That is not going to be absorbed by the business in most cases; \nit is going to be passed on to the consumer.\n  On the basis of ability to pay, particularly for the necessities of \nlife of food and clothing and things of that nature, it is going to \nhurt the low-income people and middle-income people of America \ndisproportionately because somebody else isn't paying their bills. \nThere is an understanding at the grassroots of America that this just \nisn't right. That is why this legislation has such overwhelming \nsupport.\n  I refer to this chart because it has letters from my constituents. I \nbet the Senators from Minnesota and other States are getting letters \nfrom their constituents saying the same thing.\n  We have a letter from a constituent of mine in Des Moines who says:\n\n       It is insane that such practice has been allowed to \n     continue causing higher prices to consumers. Debtors should \n     be required to pay their debts.\n\n  A constituent from Keokuk, IA:\n\n       Bankruptcies are out of hand. It is time to make people \n     responsible for their actions. Do we need to say this?\n  In other words, it is unconscionable to that constituent that we \nwould have a situation with 1.4 million bankruptcies in America, with \nthe number doubling in 5 or 6 years, at a time when we have the best \neconomic growth in our Nation.\n  Another constituent:\n\n       We need to make more people responsible for their savings \n     while at the same time protecting those who fall on hard \n     times. I realize this is a delicate balance. But the way it \n     is now, there is very little change going this route.\n\n  This bill is a very delicate balance. That is why it passed with 83 \nvotes. It also preserves what this constituent said in the letter. She \nunderstands that there are some people who go into debt through no \nfault of their own. And for the 100-year history of the bankruptcy code \nof the United States, we have recognized that certain people may be in \nhard times through no fault of their own and they are entitled to a \nfresh start. This allows that fresh start. But, at the same time for \nthose who have the ability to repay, it sends a clear signal to not go \ninto bankruptcy court because you are not going to get off scot-free \nanymore.\n  Another constituent from Fontanelle, IA, says:\n\n       People need to be more responsible for their debts. As a \n     small business owner, I have had to withstand several large \n     bills people have left with me due to their poor management \n     and bankruptcy.\n\n  That may be a small business person who, unlike a lot of \ncorporations, cannot pass on this $400 per family in additional costs \nfor goods and services because somebody else isn't paying their bills. \nThis person may be so small that they have to absorb those costs \nunfairly and may be putting their own business in jeopardy.\n  Another constituent from Cedar Rapids:\n\n       Bankruptcy reform will force the American people to become \n     more responsible for their actions. Bankruptcy does not seem \n     to carry any degree of shame. It is almost regarded as a \n     right or entitlement.\n\n  If it has become a right or entitlement, the statistics of the last 6 \nor 7 years show an increase of about 700,000 to 1.4 million. It is an \nexample maybe of some additional people in America seeing it as a way \nto manage their finances. It becomes a financial management tool for \nsome.\n  Another constituent from Waverly, IA:\n\n       Many don't think the business is who loses. We make it too \n     easy now.\n\n  A constituent from Washington, IA:\n\n       The present bankruptcy laws are a joke. One local man has \n     declared bankruptcy at least four times at the expense of \n     suppliers to him. He just laughs at it.\n\n  There is a person who quite obviously figured out the ease of using \nbankruptcy as a financial planning tool.\n  A Cedar Falls constituent:\n\n       It is way too easy to avoid responsibility.\n\n  From Indiana, IA:\n\n       If one assumes debt, they need to pay it off. We have got \n     to take responsibility for our purchases.\n\n  That reminds me of the President in his speeches during his second \nterm, and maybe even at the ending of his first term. He always talked \nabout the importance of individual responsibility and individuals have \nto be responsible.\n  As we hopefully present this bill to the President of the United \nStates today, I want to remind President Clinton of how often he talked \nabout the necessity of individual responsibility. If he believes that--\nand I believe he does believe it--then signing this bill is very \nimportant to fulfill his own statement that government ought to promote \nindividual responsibility.\n  A constituent from Harlan, IA:\n\n       Too many people use bankruptcy as a way out. We need to \n     make sure people are held accountable for all of their debts.\n\n  From Fort Madison:\n\n       Personal responsibility is a must in our country. Sickness \n     or loss of a job is one thing, but the majority of people \n     just do not pay and spend their money elsewhere knowing they \n     can unload the debt with the help of the courts.\n\n  That is a person who understands the basic principles of bankruptcy: \nNo. 1, sickness, loss of a job, something beyond the control of an \nindividual, there ought to be, and there has been for 100 years under a \nbankruptcy code, the right for a fresh start.\n\n[[Page S11691]]\n\n  The other side of that is whether there is an ability to repay. \nPeople should pay what they can according to the ability to pay the \ndebt. It also recognizes there are some people, again, who use this as \na financial planning tool.\n  One of my constituents I quote is from Cedar Rapids:\n\n       I think people taking bankruptcy should have to pay the \n     money back. . . . They should have learned to work for and \n     pay for what they get.\n\n  Maybe that statement is not quite as sympathetic to those people who \nare in bankruptcy through no fault of their own. I don't know for sure. \nBut I am happy to tell that constituent the principle behind this bill, \nthe principle behind the bankruptcy code of the last 100 years, that \nthere is a social policy in this country that some people are in debt \nthrough no fault of their own and they are entitled to a fresh start. \nShe thought there should never be a bankruptcy or nobody should be able \nto go to bankruptcy court.\n  That is the balance of this legislation. This is a balance that has \nbeen recognized by the vast majority of this body with those 83 votes \nwe had for original passage. There are things about this legislation I \ndon't like. There are some things that even the Senator from Minnesota \nsaid should be tightened up. I won't go into what those are, but I \nagree with him.\n  In legislation, particularly as this legislation is, with varying \ninterests--some not wanting any and some wanting a lot more--compromise \nis the name of the game. There hasn't been a compromise of basic \nprinciple here. There may be a compromise of degree, and I am not going \nto give up just because this bill passes and it is not as much in the \ndirection he wants or I happen to agree with him on a couple of points \nand perhaps I might move in that direction in the future.\n  But we have had 20 years without bankruptcy reform. We have gone from \n300,000 bankruptcies filed per year in the early 1980s to 1.4 per \nmillion now, and we have had studies showing it will go up another 15 \npercent. These are in good times. What about bad times, if we have a \nrecession in the future? There are indications of a Clinton recession \ncoming on now with the indices turning down and confidence in the \neconomy turning down and the manufacturing sector being in recession. \nMaybe we are starting in this administration with a recession. Then if \nwe are at 1.4 million when times are good, how many hundred thousands \nmore are we going to have when we do have bad times?\n  When we have bad economic times, high interest rates are not good for \nthe economy. We had testimony from Secretary Summers that bankruptcies \nwill drive up interest rates.\n  I appreciate very much my friend from Minnesota and his strong \nposition against this bill, even though I disagree with it. Hopefully, \nin the very next couple of hours he will not be successful in what he \nhas been so successful doing for the last year and a half, not wanting \nthis bill to pass. He has been a tough competitor and one I enjoy \ncompeting against. But I think he is very much wrong as he approaches \nthis bill. The evidence is the wide bipartisan support it has had not \nonly in this body, but it passed originally by a veto-proof margin in \nthe House of Representatives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. First of all, let me say I like my colleague from Iowa \nso much that I will let his comment about the Clinton recession pass \nand not respond to that.\n  I also want to make it clear that my use of the word ``hypocrisy'' of \ncourse was not aimed at any Senator and certainly not the Senator from \nIowa, who I actually really love working with even though we don't \nagree on all policies.\n  I have to say one more time that there is a lot of hypocrisy in a \npiece of legislation that on the one hand goes after this percentage \nand on the other hand in conference committee knocks out an amendment, \nso that now we have millionaires in a position to be able to shield \ntheir money and go buy multimillion-dollar homes in other States.\n  If that is not hypocrisy, I don't know what is. If that doesn't tell \nyou about how lopsided a piece of legislation this is, I don't know \nwhat does.\n  I also think it is more than just a little hypocritical to have a \npiece of legislation that in the main targets the most vulnerable \ncitizens--I have made that point over and over again--with study after \nstudy saying that the highest percentage would be 12 percent, probably \n3 percent of the people at most ``gaming'' this.\n  People who file for chapter 7 do so because they are in difficult \ncircumstances. Major medical illness puts them under, a divorce, loss \nof job.\n  But at the same time that we are now going to make it virtually \nimpossible for many families who find themselves in difficult economic \ncircumstances to rebuild their lives, we don't have one word to say by \nway of demanding some accountability for these credit card companies \nthat push this debt on to people, that send these cards to our kids, \nthat do all the solicitation, that charge exorbitant interest rates, \nthat are reckless in their lending policies. Not a word. Not a word.\n  Could it be these are the people with more clout in the Congress? I \nfear that is part of the problem.\n  I say to my colleague from Iowa and other Senators, it is simply not \nthe case that most of the people who file for bankruptcy are gaming the \nsystem. Let me give a case study which goes to why this bill is so \nprofoundly wrong. LTV is going to shut down. Miners up on the Iron \nRange are going to be without a job.\n  I know the way this bill works. It is an honest disagreement, but it \nis a wrong disagreement. If one of these families 2 months from now has \na major illness--now they are going to have trouble paying their \nmortgage--do you know what this bill does? This bill doesn't figure \ntheir income in February, after they have been laid off. This bill \nfigures their average income over the prior 6 months, during all the \ntimes they were gainfully employed.\n  That is not going to work for these miners, that is not going to work \nfor these hard-pressed working families, and you had better believe I \nam going to be out here on the Senate floor raising Cain in behalf of \nthese Minnesotans.\n  Finally, let me one more time, before my colleague from Vermont takes \nthe floor, remind all Senators, but especially Democrats: This is the \nmajority leader, I believe, who has made a mockery of the legislative \nprocess. We have taken a State Department embassy bill and gutted it. \nThere is not a word left; there is only a number. Instead, you had a \nbankruptcy bill put in, completely unrelated--never mind rule XXVIII--\nwithout the deliberation, without the debate, without the ability offer \nan amendment. This is not the way we legislate. This is the Senate at \nits very worst.\n  There may be a different majority 2 years from now. We can do the \nsame thing to the minority. Frankly, it should not be done by anyone. I \ncertainly hope Democrats will vote against this. The minority leader \nyesterday said he is going to vote against this bill because, he said, \nit does not meet the standard of fairness. And it does not--not on \nsubstance and not on process, not on the basic standard of what the \nSenate should be about. I hope Senators will vote against this piece of \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time is \navailable to the Senator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 29 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. I like to see him back. I wish we were \nnot still in session, but I suspect the Presiding Officer probably had \nthings he might have planned to be doing during this time, as did my \ndistinguished friend from Iowa.\n  My distinguished friend from Iowa and I have been here for numerous \nlame duck sessions. After 26 years here, I have yet to see what good \nwas ever accomplished in one of these lame duck sessions. I think the \nstatement made by my distinguished friend from Minnesota just now \nemphasizes the kind of mischief that sometimes happens in lame duck \nsessions, when people want to leave, yet we have, as in this case, a\n\n[[Page S11692]]\n\nbankruptcy bill that none of the Democrats had a chance, really, to do \nmuch about. It gets put in--what was it, I ask my friend from \nMinnesota, a bill on embassies?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield on my time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. My colleague is correct. That is right. Though there \nis not a word about that. There is nothing left except for the bill \nnumber.\n  Mr. LEAHY. This was not a case where there was a concern the \nembassies were all going bankrupt? The embassy in London or in Moscow \nor, heaven forbid, in Dublin, might be in bankruptcy court in the \nSouthern District of New York? That is not the case?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Vermont that argument has \nnot been made. So far, that argument has not been made.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank my friend from Minnesota. I appreciate his \npointing this out. I just want students who might look at this \nafterward and wonder what bankruptcy has to do with embassies to go \nback and read what the distinguished Senator from Minnesota says, which \nis, of course, that it has absolutely nothing to do with embassies. It \nis a parliamentary trick to get a piece of special interest legislation \nthrough.\n  It is unfortunate this kind of trick had to be carried out because \nthe Republican majority could have worked with the President, they \ncould have worked with the Democrats, to pass bankruptcy legislation \nthat is more balanced and more fair. We did this 2 or 3 years ago. I \nremember Senator Grassley, Senator Durbin, others, worked together and \nwe passed a piece of bankruptcy legislation that was here in the \nSenate. It was strongly backed by both Democrats and Republicans. I \nthink we passed it by 97 or 98 votes. There was only one vote against \nit. It was overwhelmingly passed. It shows what happens when \nRepublicans and Democrats work together.\n  Mr. President, I am disappointed that the majority refuses to work \nwith the President and us to pass bankruptcy legislation that is better \nbalanced and more fair. Despite the President's repeated attempts to \noffer reasonable compromises for the last six months, the majority is \ncontinuing to push this unfair and unbalanced bill. It appears that the \nsame mistakes that killed a chance for passage of the bipartisan \nbalanced bankruptcy reform 2 years ago, in the last Congress, are being \nrepeated in this Congress. We should work together to finish the work \nof the 106th Congress. Instead, there seems to be this effort to pass \nflawed legislation that virtually guarantees a Presidential veto.\n  I had hoped we would have acted on the administration's four letters \non the resolution of key issues needed for the President to sign a fair \nand balanced bill, that we could have at least met to discuss them so \nwe could have a bill the President could sign.\n  I am the ranking Democrat currently on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. I was not a conferee of the conference report. \nInstead, the Republican leadership created a sham conference to create \nand file this flawed bankruptcy bill to make sure the Democrats would \nnot have any say over it. It might be a nice exercise. It might look \ngood in fundraising letters. But when you have a Democratic President, \nit is obvious we are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars of time, \neffort, and taxpayer money up here to pass something that is not going \nto be signed into law. It may help for the next fundraiser, but it does \nnot help bringing about the kind of bankruptcy reform we actually need \nin this country.\n\n  The Senate had requested a conference in August 1999 on legislation \nto enhance security of U.S. missions and the security of personnel \noverseas and to authorize appropriations for the State Department, what \nthe distinguished Senator from Minnesota was just talking about. That \ndid not proceed.\n  On October 11, 2000, the House appointed conferees not from the \ncommittee with jurisdiction over any embassy security issues, but from \nthe House Judiciary Committee. Then a few hours later, out of nowhere, \nthe leadership filed a conference report that strikes every aspect of \nthe underlying legislation on which the two Houses had gone to \nconference and put in this wholly unrelated matter with reference to a \nbankruptcy bill that had not even passed. It had only been introduced \nthat day. There was no debate, nothing. It is like: Whoops, open the \ncloset door, let the special interests out, slam it down, and please \npass it.\n  We Americans are great at telling other countries how to run \ndemocracies. We each tell them how to run elections. I hope in the last \ncouple of years those countries that get lectures from us about how to \nrun their democracies have not been watching how matters have slipped \nbefore the U.S. Senate. Matters of great consequence are slipped before \nthe U.S. Senate without any votes, with the hope they will slip through \nin the dark of night. I hope those countries, when we tell them how to \nrun elections, are not watching--I don't know--Presidential elections \nor anything like that in our country.\n  I look at Canada. I come from the State of Vermont. I think of Canada \nas that giant to the north. I look at Canada. The whole country votes \nwith paper ballots. Two hours later, they have them all hand counted \nwith no mistakes and the country accepts the result. I hope we won't \nlecture them as we often do.\n  But I hope we will not tell people this is the way to pass \nlegislation. I hope we will not tell countries how to do it based on \nthis bill. It is an autocratic, behind-closed-doors, undemocratic \nprocess, and it makes a mockery of the legislative process.\n  This is unfortunate, since both Democrats and the administration have \nbeen trying to negotiate in good faith with the Republicans to achieve \nfair and balanced bankruptcy legislation. Everyone in this Chamber \nknows we have to have some bankruptcy reform legislation. But it cannot \nbe one sided to any one special interest, it has to be balanced.\n  There was not even a meeting of the sham conference committee, as far \nas I can tell. And the House had passed--talk about a CYA; that means \n``carefully you're allowed,''--but, in an effort to make sure nobody \nquestions them about this sham process that has slipped through behind \nclosed doors, the House passed a 398-1 vote to instruct conferees to \ninsist on a public meeting of the conference with open debate. By God, \nwe are for government in the sunshine, 398-to-1. Are we not virtuous \npeople in the other body? And the press releases went out. Of course, 2 \nhours later, the sham conference report was filed, the one that was \ndone behind closed doors, not done in the open. But everybody could \nsay: Why, I voted to have that open, 398-1.\n\n  The bipartisan informal process that produced many improvements to \nthe Senate-passed bill with respect to its bankruptcy provisions was \nfor nought in the end. We worked in an informal bipartisan conference \nand made these improvements. We dropped the controversial nonrelevant \namendments on the 3-year minimum wage increase, regressive tax cuts, \nmandatory minimum sentences for certain drug offenses, and private \nschool vouchers.\n  We added a new provision to include a $6,000 floor in the means test \nto protect low-income debtors.\n  We added a new provision to take into account up to 10 percent of the \ndebtor's administrative expenses in the means test calculations.\n  We added a new provision to allow for adjustments of up to 5 percent \nfrom the IRS standards for reasonable food and clothing expenses in the \nmeans test calculations to take into account the regional difference in \ncosts.\n  We struck the provision that exempted creditors with small claims \nfrom sanctions against creditors who file abusive motions, and, thus, \nwe made all creditors subject to these sanctions for coercive behavior.\n  We expanded the eligibility for the waiver of filing fees to debtors \nwith income less than 150 percent of the poverty line.\n  All of these things we did with Democrats and Republicans working \ntogether, each side giving some things, each side adding things. We had \na better bill. We even added a new temporary bankruptcy judgeship for \nthe following courts: the District of Delaware, the Southern District \nof Georgia, the Eastern District of North Carolina, and the District of \nPuerto Rico.\n  Finally, we added privacy protections for the financial information \nof debtors to protect patient medical records in\n\n[[Page S11693]]\n\nbankruptcy health care businesses, to destroy all debtors' tax returns \nafter 3 years of the close of the case, to provide Congress with the \nauthority to add appropriate privacy safeguards to protect electronic \nbankruptcy data, and to add safeguards for the collection of bankruptcy \ndata.\n  That was a good bipartisan start with Republicans and Democrats \nworking together. We could have a fair and balanced final bankruptcy \nreform bill. It was something people on all sides of the issue were \napplauding. They were saying: Finally, Republicans and Democrats are \nworking together.\n  Do you know what happened? Some in the Republican majority found this \nwas going on and said: We can't have it; we can't have that balance; it \nhas to be one sided; it has to be our way or no way, and they stopped \nthose meetings.\n  We actually resolved most of the issues between the two bills. There \nwere two key issues outstanding. We could have brought it back for a \nvote. One was discharge of penalties for violence against family \nplanning clinics, medical clinics, and the other was a problem with \nwealthy debtors who used overly broad homestead exemptions to shield \nassets from creditors by putting money into multimillion-dollar houses, \ndeclaring bankruptcy, and thumbing their nose at their creditors.\n  Everything I heard told me we could have reached bipartisan agreement \non these matters, too. Now this backdoor conference report does not \nadequately address either of these two abuses currently in the \nbankruptcy system.\n  The Senate passed the Schumer amendment to prevent the discharge of \npenalties for violence against family planning clinics. This was not a \npartisan vote. It was 80-17. People said, no matter how you feel about \nabortion, no matter how you feel about medical matters or family \nplanning, we are not going to condone violence against legitimate \nmedical clinics.\n\n  Does the conference report reflect this? No. There is not a single \nprovision to end abusive bankruptcy filings used to avoid the legal \nconsequences of violence, vandalism, and harassment to deny access to \nlegal health services. As a result, we could have all kinds of clinic \nviolence. If you are sued for it, just declare bankruptcy and get away \nwith it. That is wrong.\n  The administration made it crystal clear in four letters to \ncongressional leaders that an end to this abuse of the current \nbankruptcy system was needed to gain the President's signature. Four \ntimes they said they were not going to allow people to firebomb \nclinics, harass people, assault people, and if they are sued, to simply \nsay: We will declare bankruptcy. Four times.\n  The OMB Director Jack Lew wrote to Congressional leaders on May 12, \n2000:\n\n       The abuses of the bankruptcy system must be stemmed, \n     including abuse by those who would use bankruptcy to avoid \n     penalties for violence against family planning clinics.\n\n  The President wrote congressional leaders on June 9:\n\n       I am deeply disturbed that some in Congress still object to \n     a reasonable provision that would end demonstrated abuse of \n     the bankruptcy system. We cannot tolerate abusive bankruptcy \n     filings to avoid the legal consequences of violence, \n     vandalism, and harassment used to deny access to legal health \n     services. An effective approach, such as the one offered by \n     Senator Schumer's amendment, should be included in the final \n     legislation.\n\n  A few weeks later the President again wrote to congressional leaders \nto reiterate his position saying:\n\n       I cannot support a bankruptcy bill that fails to require \n     accountability and responsibility from those who use \n     violence, vandalism, intimidation, and harassment to deny \n     others access to legal health services. . . . The final \n     legislation must include an effective approach to this \n     problem, such as the one contained in the amendment by \n     Senator Schumer, which passed the Senate by a vote of 80-17.\n\n  This is a no-brainer. We already debated it and voted on it 80-17. We \nhave a hard time getting an 80-17 vote here to support the bean soup in \nthe Senate cafeteria.\n  Gene Sperling, national economic adviser to the President, in his \nletter of September 22, made it clear that President Clinton would veto \nany bankruptcy reform legislation that did not end this abuse of \nbankruptcy law. He said:\n\n       Our society should not tolerate those who develop a \n     strategy to first threaten and intimidate doctors, health \n     care professionals, or their patients and then turn to the \n     bankruptcy courts to avoid legal liability for their actions. \n     I reiterate that the President will not sign any legislation \n     that does not contain effective means to ensure \n     accountability and responsibility of perpetrators of clinic \n     violence.\n\n  Mr. President, how much time is still available to the Senator from \nVermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Just under 13 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  We should not use the bankruptcy law to shield purveyors of violence. \nWe should close this loophole.\n  Six defendants in the Nuremberg files web site case filed bankruptcy \nto avoid their debts under the law. This web site depicted murder \nweapons with dripping blood and advocated the killing of pro-choice \nphysicians and public figures. Indeed, as some of these people were \nkilled, their names were crossed out on the web site. Why should \nsomebody who is sued for this kind of violence, purveying this kind of \nviolence, be allowed to go to bankruptcy court and say, ``See ya, I'm \nhome free''?\n  Dr. Barnett Slepian, who was murdered 2 years ago in Buffalo on \nOctober 23, 1998, was on this heinous Internet site. After he was \nmurdered, his name was crossed out.\n  If I can make a personal note, when Dr. Slepian was murdered in \nupstate New York because his name was on the Nuremberg files web site, \nwithin days they determined the chief suspect was a man from Vermont. \nIn fact, there is now an arrest warrant out for him.\n  I mention that also not just because I am from Vermont, but when I \nchecked the Internet file, I found that along with this man's name, my \nname was there. I was listed as one of the people who should be shot \nand killed. I take that a little bit personally, especially when the \nFBI are now looking for a man from my State who is suspected of \nshooting and killing one of the people whose name was on that list with \nmine. Dr. Slepian's name has been crossed out. Mine has been left on \nthe list of those who should be shot and killed.\n  Frankly, I find it a little bit difficult to think, when these people \nare sued for this kind of thing, and judgments are rendered against \nthem, that they can just go into bankruptcy court and say: See ya.\n  So nobody will think that there is any kind of conflict of interest, \nI am not part of any suit against them. I am not going to do that. But \nfor those who have, they ought to at least get their settlement or \nother judgment, win or lose, in the courts. But we should not let \nanybody walk into our Federal bankruptcy court--because of a huge \nloophole that this Congress does not have the guts to close--and just \nwalk home scot-free.\n  It is hypocrisy at the worst, when we voted 80-17 in this body to \nclose the loophole, and when all but one Member of the other body voted \nto have an open conference on this, that both bodies ignored that. That \nis hypocrisy. It is wrong.\n  If anybody thinks they do not know the reason why some people in this \ncountry look at the Congress and ask what is going on, there is one of \nyour reasons right there. Maybe we ought to look at some of the \nelections this year and say: Our people are saying they are fed up with \nthis.\n  In fact, this suspect is still at large, and with a reward of $1 \nmillion for his arrest.\n  You tell me--anybody in this body--you tell me--anybody who is \nlistening to this debate--that somehow it is fair to let people such as \nthat escape because of a loophole that we do not have the guts to close \nin our bankruptcy law.\n  Clearly, the perpetrators of violence and illegal intimidation should \nnot be able to abuse the bankruptcy laws to avoid responsibility for \ntheir actions. Bankruptcy should not be used to avoid the legal \nconsequence of clinic violence, harassment, and intimidation.\n  If we do not want to do something against violence, apparently we do \nnot want to do anything in bankruptcy to offend those who have \nmultimillion-dollar estates in the right States.\n  In the Senate, we passed, by a vote of 76-22, an amendment to create \na $100,000 nationwide cap on any homestead exemption. Again, we could \nsay we are only concerned about the little people. We are concerned \nabout people paying the debt. All people--we want\n\n[[Page S11694]]\n\neverybody to pay their bills. Whether they are rich or poor, we want \nthem to pay their bills. We are equal to everybody.\n  Of course, that would have eliminated one of the most flagrant abuses \nin bankruptcy laws--debtors moving to expensive homes in a handful of \nStates with unlimited exemptions, declaring bankruptcy, and then \nkeeping their millions of dollars in the homes that they have in those \nStates.\n  Senator Kohl, along with Senator Sessions, put together an amendment \nthat the Senate overwhelmingly adopted. I am beginning to see why \neverybody voted for it. Some must have gotten word that it would be \ngutted as soon as it got off the floor, gutted behind closed doors, \nwhere nobody votes and nobody's fingerprints are on them. Even to talk \nabout: OK, you want to raise it to $100,000? Raise it to $500,000. Then \nall of a sudden we find it is gutted. It is going to build a lot of \nhomes in Texas and Florida. It is an amazing coincidence those two \nStates are going to have the advantage of not having that provision. If \nyou want to declare bankruptcy, just put your millions of dollars in a \nhouse in Texas or Florida, and under this you are safe.\n  Again, the Administration made it crystal clear in four letters to \ncongressional leaders that the President would not sign any bankruptcy \nreform bill that did not end the abuse of unlimited homestead \nexemptions. In fact, the Republican leadership reached an agreement \nwith Democrats and the Administration to include a nationwide $500,000 \ncap on homestead exemptions in bankruptcy, but then the majority \nchanged its mind. Why? I do not understand why the majority then \nreverted to a flawed homestead provision in this conference report.\n\n  As early as May 12, 2000, OMB Director Jack Lew made clear the \nAdministration's position. Director Lew wrote to Congressional leaders: \nIt is fundamentally unfair to ask low- and moderate-income debtors to \ndevote future income to repay the debts that they can, while leaving \nloopholes that allow the wealthy to shield income and assets from their \ncreditors. High or unlimited homestead exemptions allow people with \nexpensive homes to avoid their responsibility to repay a significant \nportion of their debts.\n  On June 9, 2000, the President, himself, wrote to congressional \nleaders about the need to end abusive homestead exemptions in any final \nbankruptcy reform bill. President Clinton wrote: I am concerned, for \nexample, that the final bill may not adequately address the problem of \nwealthy debtors who use overly broad homestead exemptions to shield \nassets from their creditors.\n  Again, a few weeks later on June 29th, the President reiterated his \nposition by writing to congressional leaders: The proposed limitation \non State homestead exemptions will address, for the first time, those \nwho move their residence shortly before bankruptcy to take advantage of \nlarge State exemptions to shield assets from their creditors. But the \nproposal does not address a more fundamental concern: unlimited \nhomestead exemptions that allow wealthy debtors in some States to \ncontinue to live in lavish homes. In light of how other provisions \ndesigned to stem abuse will affect moderate-income debtors, it is \nunfair to leave this loophole for the wealthy in place.\n  A few weeks ago, it appeared the majority was finally beginning to \nunderstand and accept the President's commonsense approach by agreeing \nto a federal cap on homestead exemptions. On September 22, Gene \nSperling, National Economic Advisor to the President, wrote to Majority \nLeader Lott: The President appreciates your significant movement on the \nhomestead issue. We realize that the offer goes against strongly held \nviews of some members of your caucus, and we are grateful for the \neffort. While we had proposed placing a cap of $250,000 on the size of \nstate homestead exemptions, we could accept a homestead cap of \n$500,000, were we to reach agreement on other issues.\n  It does not take a rocket scientist to understand that the President \nwould veto a bankruptcy conference report that did not adequately \naddress the discharge of penalties for violence against family planning \nclinics and the problem of wealthy debtors who use overly broad \nhomestead exemptions to shield assets from their creditors. Four times \nthe Administration wrote to congressional leaders about the need to \naddress these two areas of bankruptcy abuse. Four times.\n  But this conference report fails adequately to address either of \nthese two abuses of the current bankruptcy system.\n  Unfortunately, the majority is repeating the same mistakes that \nkilled bankruptcy reform in the last Congress. Instead of keeping on \nthe track of bipartisan compromise that was headed toward enacting a \nfair and balanced bill, the majority veered off course on behalf of \nspecial interests. The result is an unfair and unbalanced bankruptcy \nconference report.\n  Fortunately, bankruptcy filings have been declining for the last \ncouple of years. In 1999, the per capita personal bankruptcy rate \ndropped by more than 9 percent. In the 2000 fiscal year, the decline \ncontinued. According to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, \nbankruptcy filings for fiscal year 2000 are down 6.8 percent for \npersonal filings, down 6.6 percent for business filings and down 9.2 \npercent for chapter 7 filings. Over the last two years, Chapter 7 \nfilings have dropped 15 percent and personal bankruptcy filings overall \nhave declined by 12 percent.\n  In my home state of Vermont, the recent decline in personal \nbankruptcy filings is even more dramatic. In 1999 consumer bankruptcy \nfilings in the District of Vermont dropped 11 percent compared to 1998 \nand fell an additional 20 percent so far this year as compared to last \nyear that is approximately a one-third decrease over the last two \nyears.\n\n  Clearly, the justification that we must pass this flawed measure now \nbecause of a bankruptcy crisis rings hollow given the latest bankruptcy \nfiling facts across the nation. There is no need to rush a bad bill \ninto law.\n  On June 9, 2000, President Clinton wrote to congressional leaders \nthat: I have long made clear my support for legislation that would \nencourage responsibility and reduce abuses of the bankruptcy system on \nthe part of debtors and creditors alike. We also must ensure that a \nreasonable fresh start is available for those who turn to bankruptcy as \na last resort when facing divorce, unemployment, illness, and uninsured \nmedical expenses. Bankruptcy reform legislation should strike the right \nbalance.\n  Unfortunately, this conference report fails to strike that right \nbalance. The President will and should veto it.\n  The administration has helped to make the economy a lot better. We \ncan take a moment. Let us wait until next year and pass a good bill. \nLet us take care of those problems that are in there, but let's not \nallow the haters, the crime inciters, the murderers, and the \nfirebombers to go free. For Pete's sake, let's not let somebody who has \namassed millions of dollars of assets, and even more millions of debt, \nto say: I will go buy a house in Texas or Florida because then I can \nescape my creditors.\n  Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from Vermont have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four and one-half minutes.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We are waiting for the Senator from Alabama to come and \nspeak. Before he gets here, I will take a moment, so I yield myself \nsuch time as I might consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am glad the Senator from Vermont pointed out the many \ncompromises that were made to accommodate the President and to \naccommodate Democrats in the Senate. He did not say this, but there \nwere also a lot of changes made to accommodate Republicans. But he \npointed out that we have two issues on which we disagree. That is what \nthe Senator from Vermont said. I do not think that Senators should vote \nagainst this bill over two issues which are not central to the concept \nof bankruptcy reform.\n  I was disappointed, however, in his comments on the process. He \nreferred to a very unusual process. I confess that it was a very \nunusual process by\n\n[[Page S11695]]\n\nwhich this bill was conferenced and got to the Senate floor. But I \nthink I heard him say something about Democrats not being consulted. \nThere was a 3-3 ratio on this conference. Normally there would not be a \n3-3 ratio; there would probably be one more Republican than Democrat. \nBut because of Senator Coverdell's death, it ended up on this \nconference there were three Republicans and three Democrats. So the \npoint is, we would not be here today if it were not for help from \nDemocrats, even in conference.\n  I only say that because the Senator from Vermont is a friend of mine. \nHe is very strongly opposed to this legislation. But I thought I ought \nto point out the fact that there are those small, insignificant \nmodifications of his comments that I thought I ought to make. Whether \nhe would consider those clarifications or not, that is his judgment. \nBut I want them on the record for my point of view.\n  I also address an issue raised by Senator Leahy. Some have stated \nthat the bankruptcy conference report should be opposed on the grounds \nthat it does not contain a provision that would prevent abortion \nprotesters from using bankruptcy as a way to get out of paying debt \narising as a result of violence or intimidation at abortion clinics.\n  On this issue, I draw my Senator's attention--in other words, the \nattention of the Senator from Vermont--to a memo prepared by the \nnonpartisan Congressional Research Service.\n  This memo--which I will provide to any Senator who wants to see it, \nand I will include it in the Record--concludes that not one single \nabortion protester has ever used bankruptcy in this way. I repeat, \naccording to the Congressional Research Service, a truly nonpartisan \nresource, no one has ever used bankruptcy to skip out on debts arising \nfrom violence or intimidation at an abortion clinic.\n  This issue, of course, is a red herring. It has been put forth by \npeople who flat out oppose needed bankruptcy reform as a way of \ndefeating this legislation. There is absolutely no merit to their \nargument.\n  I hope people will see it for what it is--an empty political ploy. I \nhope Senators will see through this political ploy and support the \nbankruptcy conference report.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the memo from the \nCongressional Research Office.\n  There being no objection, the memo was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   Congressional Research Service,\n\n\n                                          Library of Congress,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 26, 2000.\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n     To: Hon. Charles Grassley.\n     From: Robin Jeweler, Legislative Attorney, American Law \n         Division.\n     Subject: Westlaw/LEXIS survey of bankruptcy cases under 11 \n         U.S.C. Sec. 523.\n       This confirms our phone conversation of October 25, 2000. \n     You requested a comprehensive online survey of reported \n     decisions considering the dischargeability of liability \n     incurred in connection with violence at reproductive health \n     clinics by abortion protesters. Our search did not reveal any \n     reported decisions where such liability was discharged under \n     the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\n       The only reported decision identified by the search is \n     Buffalo Gyn Womenservices, Inc. v. Behn (In re Behn), 242 \n     B.R. 229 (Bankr. W.D.N.Y. 1999). In this case, the bankruptcy \n     court held that a debtor's previously incurred civil \n     sanctions for violation of a temporary restraining order \n     (TRO) creating a buffer zone outside the premises of an \n     abortion service provider was nondischargeable under 11 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 523(a)(6), which excepts claims for ``willful and \n     malicious'' injury. The court surveyed the extant and \n     somewhat discrepant standards for finding ``willful and \n     malicious'' conduct articulated by three federal circuit \n     courts of appeals. It granted the plaintiff's motion for \n     summary judgment and denied the debtor/defendant's motion to \n     retry the matter before the bankruptcy court. Specifically, \n     the court held:\n       ``[W]hen a court of the United States issues an injunction \n     or other protective order telling a specific individual what \n     actions will cross the line into injury to others, then \n     damages resulting from an intentional violation of that order \n     (as is proven either in the bankruptcy court or (so long as \n     there was a full and fair opportunity to litigate the \n     question of volition and violation) in the issuing court) are \n     ipso facto the result of a `willful and malicious injury.' \n     ''--242 B.R. at 238.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this consumer bankruptcy reform legislation \nis one of the most important legislative efforts to reform the \nbankruptcy laws in decades. I thank my distinguished friend and \ncolleague from Iowa for his hard work on this, of course, the \ndistinguished Senator from New Jersey, and so many others, Senator \nBiden from Delaware. There are many others as well.\n  This is important. Before talking about the substance of the \nlegislation, I personally thank the majority leader who has worked hard \nand tirelessly to keep this legislation on track despite the many \nobstacles that it has faced--I have to say phony obstacles at that.\n  Thanks to the majority leaders's commitment to moving this \nlegislation, we now find ourselves in a position to weed out many of \nthe abuses in the bankruptcy system and also to enhance consumer \nprotection.\n  I also acknowledge and thank the ranking member of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, who has worked with me and Senator \nGrassley and others to reach agreement on many of the bill's \nprovisions.\n  Most of all, I commend the original authors of the legislation, \nSenators Grassley and Torricelli, chairman and ranking minority member \nof the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, \nrespectively, for their hard work in crafting this much needed \nlegislation and for their unrelenting commitment to making the \ndevelopment and passage of this bill a bipartisan process.\n  As I have mentioned, my praise also goes to Senator Sessions and \nSenator Biden, who have shown unwavering dedication to accomplishing \nthe important reforms in this bill, and to the many other Members of \nthe Senate for their hard work and cooperation.\n  I was deeply troubled by a comment made on the floor yesterday by a \ncolleague from the other side of the aisle to the effect that this bill \nwas written by Republicans and is being forced upon Senate Democrats. \nNothing could be further from the truth. I am compelled to set the \nrecord straight on that point. The entire development of this bill has \ntaken place in a bipartisan manner. In fact, throughout the entire \nprocess of consideration of this bill, beginning as long ago as the \ndrafting stage, numerous changes suggested by the minority have been \nmade.\n  It is no secret that in the informal conference process, we worked \ntogether with Senate Democrats. And with rare exception, the provisions \nthat are contained in the final conference product were agreed to and \nwere done with the full bipartisan cooperation and support of the \nSenate negotiators. Furthermore, in an effort to reach a bipartisan \nagreement and address concerns of the White House, we took issues that \nwere important to many of us on the Republican side off the table.\n  For example, I agreed to remove from consideration a provision I had \nsought which would have prevented criminal check kiters and \ncounterfeiters from collecting attorney's fees in lawsuits that they \nbring against debt collectors--I might add, multiple lawsuits that \nreally don't make sense. Many others in the majority also made \nconcessions and a good faith effort to resolve differences and move \nforward with the long overdue comprehensive bankruptcy reform.\n  Here on the Senate floor, the assertion was made that not a single \norganization that advocates for kids supported this bill. I simply \ncannot allow that kind of misrepresentation to stand uncorrected. In \nfact, there is tremendous support for this legislation from child \nadvocates.\n  Let me give some illustrations. A letter from Laura Kadwell, \nPresident of the National Child Support Enforcement Association, \nrepresenting over 60,000 child support professionals across America:\n\n       I'm writing to urge you to support the Bankruptcy Reform \n     Act of 2000. NCSEA is committed to ensuring that both parents \n     fulfill their responsibilities to provide emotional and \n     financial support to their children--including honoring \n     legally-owed child support obligations. The pending \n     legislation will forward this goal significantly.\n\n  In a letter from Howard Baldwin, President of the Western Interstate \nChild Support Enforcement Council, an organization comprised of child \nsupport professionals from the private and public sectors west of the \nMississippi River:\n\n       I would like to express our membership's unqualified \n     support.\n\n  The resolution of the California Family Support Council, consisting \nof approximately 2,500 persons employed by\n\n[[Page S11696]]\n\ncounty and State agencies which administer the Federal child support \nprogram in California:\n\n       Now therefore be it resolved that the California Family \n     Support Council * * * directs the president of the California \n     Family Support Council to convey to the California \n     congressional delegation and to the President its \n     enthusiastic endorsement of the Bankruptcy Reform Bills.\n\n  How about a letter from Betty D. Montgomery, attorney general of the \nState of Ohio:\n\n       As the chief law enforcement officer for [Ohio], I stand \n     committed to protecting our most vulnerable citizens [and \n     this legislation] will further promote the objectives of our \n     state and national child support enforcement program and \n     further ensure that those families in need are protected.\n\n  A vote for this conference report will mean a vote to stop letting \ndeadbeat parents use bankruptcy to avoid paying child support. It will \nmean a vote to stop paying lawyers ahead of children who rely on child \nsupport. I have worked with Senator Torricelli, the National \nAssociation of Attorney Generals, and the National Women's Law Center \nto improve current bankruptcy law with respect to child support and \nalimony. Currently bankruptcy law is simply not adequate. Frankly, I \nwas outraged to learn of the many ways deadbeat parents were \nmanipulating and abusing the current bankruptcy system in order to get \nout of paying their domestic support obligations. I am proud of the \nimprovements we are making in this legislation over current law in \nterms of ensuring that parents meet their child support and other \ndomestic support obligations in bankruptcy.\n  I have worked tirelessly, as others have--those I have mentioned--\nprovision by provision, both last year and this year, to make this \nconference report one that dramatically improves the position of \nchildren and ex-spouses who are entitled to domestic support. No one \nwho actually looks at what the conference report says can in good \nconscience say that this bill is not a tremendous improvement for \nchildren and families over current law.\n  This bill for women and children gives child support first priority \nstatus, up from seventh in line, meaning they will be paid ahead of the \nlawyers, if you can imagine that. It is about time. It makes staying \ncurrent on child support a condition of discharge. It makes debt \ndischarge in bankruptcy conditional upon full payment of past due child \nsupport and alimony. It makes domestic support obligations \nautomatically nondischargeable without the cost of litigation. It \nprevents bankruptcy from holding up child custody, visitation and \ndomestic violence cases. And it helps avoid administrative roadblocks \nto get kids the support they need.\n  It is a very important set of changes, without which we are going to \nbe abusing children in the law.\n  That is not all. The conference report makes more improvements over \ncurrent law for women and children. This chart shows that. It makes the \npayment of child support arrears a condition of plan confirmation. It \nprovides better notice and more information for easier child support \ncollection. It provides help in tracking down deadbeats. It allows for \nclaims against a deadbeat parent's properties. It allows for the \npayment of child support with interest by those with means. And it \nfacilitates wage withholding to collect child support from deadbeat \nparents. It does all of that.\n  I am also happy to say that the conference report prevents deadbeats \nfrom using the automatic stay in bankruptcy to avoid paying their \nsupport obligations. The bankruptcy reform stops deadbeat parents from \nabusing the automatic stay.\n  The conference report prevents deadbeats from using bankruptcy's \nautomatic stay to avoiding child support with this legislation.\n  The automatic stay cannot be used to put a hold on the interception \nof a deadbeat parent's tax refund to pay support.\n  The automatic stay cannot be used to prevent the reporting of overdue \nsupport owed by deadbeat parents to any consumer reporting agency.\n  The automatic stay cannot be used to prevent the withholding, \nsuspension, or restriction of driver's licenses, professional and \noccupational licenses, and recreational licenses when deadbeats default \non domestic support obligations.\n  And suspending the driver's license of the deadbeat parent can be a \nvery effective way of getting them to pay the child support they owe.\n  This is important stuff. It has taken lot of time to get this done. \nWe will pass this bill. But if the administration doesn't accept this \nbill and it winds up vetoing it, it will be a tragedy.\n  These are just a few of the many improvements the conference report \nmakes in this area as compared with current law.\n  I have had a long history of advocating for children and families in \nCongress and throughout my legal career. I support a conference report \nthat puts child support first in line ahead of the lawyer's fees and \nthat doesn't let debtors who owe child support turn their backs on \nchildren when they file for bankruptcy.\n  In another provision I authored, the conference report protects for \nthe first time in bankruptcy education savings accounts set up by \nparents and grandparents for their children and grandchildren.\n  All things considered, it is pretty simple. A vote for this \nconference report is a vote for our Nation's kids.\n  Just look at the bankruptcy consumer provisions. A vote for this \nconference report is a vote for consumers. The legislation includes a \nwhole host of new consumer protections that do not exist under current \nlaw, such as:\n  New disclosure by creditors and more judicial oversight of \nreaffirmation of agreements to protect people from being pressured into \nonerous agreements;\n  A debtors' bill of rights to prevent the bankruptcy mills from \npreying upon those who are uninformed of their rights;\n  New consumer protections under the Truth in Lending Act, such as \nrequired disclosure regarding minimum monthly payments and introductory \nrates for credit carts;\n  Penalties on creditors who refuse to negotiate reasonable payment \nschedules outside of bankruptcy;\n  Penalties on creditors who fail to properly credit plan payments in \nbankruptcy;\n  Credit counseling programs to help avoid the cycle of indebtedness;\n  Protection of educational savings accounts; and\n  Equal protection for retirement savings in bankruptcy.\n  You can't look at this bill and what it means to people in this \ncountry without realizing that this is a step forward.\n  A vote for this legislation is also a vote for families by preventing \nwealthy people from continuing to abuse the system at the expense of \neveryone else.\n  Under the current system, people with high incomes can run up massive \ndebts and then use bankruptcy to get out of honoring them. All of us \nend up paying for the unscrupulous who abuse the system. In fact, it \nhas been estimated that every American family pays $550 a year in a \nhidden taxes as a result of these abusers. This legislation helps \neliminate this hidden tax by implementing a means test to make wealthy \npeople who can repay their debts honor them.\n\n  Let me make one thing absolutely clear. The poor are not affected by \nthe means test. In fact, the legislation provides a safe harbor for \nthose who fall below the median income. So they are not subjected to \nthe means test at all. Again, only those above the median income are \naffected, and the means test could not deny anyone bankruptcy relief. \nIt just requires those who have the means to repay their debts, based \non their income, to do so. It is that simple.\n  A vote for the conference report also is a vote to stop allowing a \nfew wealthy individuals to abuse the homestead exemption. The \nconference report tackles the problem of the homestead exemption. \nAlthough rare, that problem is offensive to those of us who work hard \nto make good on our debts.\n  The conference report reaches a compromise which targets the major \nabuse of bankruptcy by those who move to States with generous homestead \nexemptions purely in order to file bankruptcy and keep an expensive \nhome. Although this reform provision does not go as far as some of us \nwould like, without it we are back to business as usual with no \nimprovement to current law at all.\n  A vote for this conference report is also a vote for families who \nwork to\n\n[[Page S11697]]\n\nsave for retirement. I mentioned earlier that the conference report \ncontains my provision to provide equal treatment for retirement savings \nplans in bankruptcy. For example, the retirement savings of teachers \nand church workers are clearly given the protection in bankruptcy as \nmuch as everyone else. They deserve nothing less.\n  A vote for the conference report is a vote for our country farmers \nand the men and women who work hard every day in the face of many \nchallenges. Without this reform package, family farmers lose out on the \nspecial bankruptcy protections they need in chapter 12.\n  I urge my colleagues to think for a moment about the children, the \nconsumers, families, and farmers who will end up getting hurt if \ncomprehensive bankruptcy reform is not enacted this year. I urge my \ncolleagues to support and cast a vote for them and to support this \nbankruptcy reform.\n  I also urge the President of the United States to sign this \nbankruptcy reform into law.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Hatch for his leadership \non this bankruptcy bill and for shepherding it through the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  I remember distinctly when we first began to discuss the problems of \nchildren, alimony and child support, the leadership and the firm \nposition Senator Hatch took to guarantee that children and alimony \npayments would have an enhanced position in bankruptcy, much higher \nthan it had ever been before. That was the goal of Senator Hatch, who \nhas worked on this bill and previous bankruptcy bills and studied this.\n  I am looking at a letter from some professors who don't seem to get \nit. But the Senator has studied and sponsored the amendment that made \nsome of the historic changes.\n  Is there any doubt in your mind, Senator, that the children will \nbenefit from those child support payments, and women will have more \nprotections for alimony payments under this bill that we are about to \npass than if the bill does not pass?\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator for his very intelligent question. \nThere is no question that this bill will make dramatic changes in \nbankruptcy laws to the benefit of children, parents, families, \nfarmers--just name them--in large measure because of the work of the \ndistinguished Senators, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Torricelli, and others, \nincluding our ranking member Senator Leahy, and especially the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama.\n  The distinguished Senator from Alabama has been here just long enough \nto show how effective he is and what a perfect job he has done on the \nJudiciary Committee. I personally compliment the Senator. He has played \na significant and noble role in this bill, as have others, but, in \nparticular, I consider him one of the best lawyers, one of the best \nlegal practitioners in this whole body. I am very proud of the work the \nSenator and so many others have done on this bill, without which it \nwould have been much tougher for me as chairman of the committee. This \nbill has made a true difference in the lives of the children of this \ncountry.\n  If we don't have this bill put on the law books of this country, \nfamilies, children, farmers, consumers, and others are going to be \ndrastically hurt. Yes, no bill is absolutely perfect, but we have too \nmany people at cross-purposes. But we have worked every day this bill \nhas been in existence with our colleagues on the other side. That is \nwhy we have a number of them who are willing to support this bill, not \nonly willing but enthusiastically do so.\n  We couldn't have come this far without the work of the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama. I have great respect for the Senator and I am \ngrateful he is on the floor today. I am grateful the Senator is one of \nthe people who is helping to make the case for this bill. There are \ngood people on both sides of the aisle, good people who understand \nthese important matters, good people who know that children are a focal \npoint of much of this bill.\n  I thank the Senator for his question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Alabama?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield such time as he shall need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we have had quoted on the floor a letter \nfrom a group of professors that expressed opposition to this bankruptcy \nbill. I think we owe it to those who quoted from it to treat the letter \nseriously and analyze item by item the complaints they have made and \ndiscuss it on the floor. I must say that after examining the letter \ncarefully, I must take issue with the professors' conclusions. I intend \nto try to go over the points that they raise fairly and honestly, and \nto state the situation as I see it. In fact, I think it is quite plain. \nThe professors are wrong and they are making misleading statements \nabout it.\n\n  For example, the letter from the professors says:\n\n       Women and children will have to compete with powerful \n     creditors to collect their claims after bankruptcy.\n\n  The fact is, the bill makes currently exempt assets--that is, \nhomestead, household effects, tools of the trade--those kinds of things \nthat normally today cannot be made to be sold to pay alimony or child \nsupport--non-exempt. Thus, wives and mothers will not have to compete \nwith anyone before, during, or after bankruptcy for these key assets. \nIn fact, a mother, for child support, can take the home--the homestead \nnotwithstanding--of a deadbeat dad and take other assets that he has \nthat otherwise under current law would be exempt. It is a major step \nforward for the rights of children.\n  The letter from the professors further says:\n\n       Credit card claims increasingly will be excepted from \n     discharge and remain a legal obligation after bankruptcy.\n\n  The fact is, the bill makes only credit card debt incurred by fraud \nnondischargeable, just like taxes and child support are \nnondischargeable. Debtors who defraud creditors should not be able to \ndischarge their debts in bankruptcy and not pay them. They only ought \nto be able to discharge the debts they lawfully incurred. That is the \ncurrent law. That is the law today. You cannot discharge fraudulent \ndebts. In addition, of course, credit card debt is at the end of the \nline if you have to pay anything. It is a non-secured debt. It is the \nlast priority to be paid in the list of priorities.\n  This letter goes on to say:\n\n       Large retailers will have an easier time obtaining \n     reaffirmations of debt that legally could be discharged.\n\n  That is absolutely false. I was charged by Senator Grassley to meet \nwith Senator Reid and the representatives from the White House to \ndevelop reaffirmation language that would strengthen protections for \npeople who were asked to reaffirm debts.\n  Frankly, reaffirmations are not all that bad. Many times, people have \nevery reason to want to reaffirm their debts and keep their washing \nmachine, their TV, their furniture, their automobile they use to get to \nand from work. They want to keep it. They reaffirm their debt and they \ndo not lose it. So we worked out language to which the White House \nagreed. It strengthens the protections provided to those debtors. It \nwas language agreed-upon in a bipartisan way.\n  The letter further says:\n\n       Giving first priority to domestic support obligations--\n\n  Which is in the bill, giving them first priority of payment--\n\n     does not address the problem, and that 95 percent of \n     bankruptcy cases make no distributions to any creditors \n     because there are no assets to distribute.\n\n  First, the money is going to the bankruptcy court and to lawyers. In \nour rule, children would be above the courts and the lawyers. \n``Granting women and children a first priority permits them to stand \nfirst in line to collect nothing,'' the professors say. But the fact \nis, the means test will place above-median-income-deadbeat-dads into \nChapter 13 if they can repay some of their debt--median income for a \nfamily of four, by the way, is about $45,000. So, to reiterate, \ndeadbeat dads who are above median income, will be forced into chapter \n13 (instead of being able to file Chapter 7) if they can afford to pay \nback some of the debts they owe--maybe it is 20 percent, maybe it is 30 \npercent--but they will be put into chapter 13 to pay that. And for 5 \nyears the judge can order them to pay on those debts what percentage he \nor she believes the debtor is financially able to pay and maintain a \ndecent standard of living.\n\n[[Page S11698]]\n\n  But what is first? What is first paid by that deadbeat dad? His \nalimony and child support. He would be under court-monitored \nsupervision and direction to pay the first fruits of his income \ndirectly in the form of child support and alimony. In effect, you have \na bankruptcy judge helping ensure, for 5 years, the full payment of \nchild support and alimony. I believe that is going to be a historic \nstep forward. In fact, this will place children and women in a higher \nlevel than they have ever been before.\n  The letter further says:\n\n       Under current law, child support and alimony share a \n     protected post-bankruptcy position with only two other \n     recurrent collectors of debt--taxes and student loans. The \n     bill would allow credit card debt and other consumer credit \n     to share that position, thus elbowing aside women trying to \n     collect on their own behalf.\n\n  That is not true. I can understand why some of our Senators are \nconcerned about the bill after they read this letter. It has a bunch of \nprofessors' names on it. They think it is true--but it is not true. The \nfact is, the bill allows only consumer debt that was incurred by fraud \nto be nondischargeable, which is fundamentally the law today. Even so, \nonly alimony and child support claimants will be able to levee on any \nof these assets. No one else can levee or get ahead of a parent or a \nchild to claim these exempt assets. Thus, mothers will not have to \ncompete with the IRS, the student loan companies, credit card \ncompanies, or anyone else, to attach exempt assets after bankruptcy.\n  Further, I believe the bill will provide more assets for distribution \nto women and children than before, during, and after bankruptcy. Before \nbankruptcy, debtors will receive credit counseling information which \nwill help keep fathers on a budget, teach them how to maintain a \nbudget, and out of bankruptcy and paying their alimony and child \nsupport in the first place. During bankruptcy, deadbeat dads will be \nrequired to pay all past due alimony and child support and to undergo \ncourt supervision for up to 5 years under chapter 13, as they pay their \nNo. 1 priority, child support claims.\n  After bankruptcy it is much more likely that a father who has \nundergone credit counseling, who has been subjected to 5 years of court \nsupervision of his finances, and where alimony and child support were \nthe first things he was required to pay and where he knows that he \ncannot shield his exempt assets from alimony and child support, will be \nup to date on all his payments if he has gone through that process--\nmuch more so than today.\n  I see Chairman Grassley is here. I had a number of matters, but I \nknow he would like to wrap up at this time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. No, I do not want to wrap up. I would like to have \npermission to interrupt the Senator, and for him not to lose the right \nto the floor. I would like to say something for 30 seconds on the bill, \nif I could.\n  There has been a report since early today about the White House, or \npersonnel at the White House, calling Democrats who have always \nsupported this bill to vote against it. I am not sure I know exactly \nwhy the White House is calling and saying that, but I presume it is \nbecause they would like to have fewer folks than the two-thirds we had \non the cloture to override a veto, if the President would veto this \nbill. I don't know that the President would veto it. I know there are a \nlot of people at the White House who would like to have him veto it.\n  I say to those Democrats who have voted and supported this \nlegislation so much over the last 3 years, particularly on that 83-14 \nvote by which it passed, I hope they will not respond to that kind of \npressure from the White House. I hope they know Chuck Grassley well \nenough to know that if I had voted for a bill in the Reagan \nadministration or the Bush administration, three or four times, and a \nPresident Reagan or his staff, or a President Bush or his staff, called \nme up and asked me to change my mind just to protect the President, if \nI would do it--I would not do it. I hope they would not do it.\n  I return the floor to the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. President, what is the time situation? Are we still set for a \nvote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are set for a vote at 3:45. The Senator has \n1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have at least six or seven more items \nthat I could refer to from the professors' letter that I believe are \nbased on complaints about an early version of the bill, matters that \nare not even in the bill today, and other items that are completely \ndistorted in how it affects the poor people in America today.\n  Let me simply say this: We need bankruptcy reform. We have shown a \ndoubling of bankruptcy filings in the last decade.\n  It is time for us to move this bill forward to create a body of law \nthat is less subject to abuse than current law, to close many of the \nloopholes or at least partially close them.\n  The fact we have not been able to do everything is not a basis to \nobject, in my view. The perfect is the enemy of the good. This is a \ngood bill. I would like to see all the homestead exemptions removed, at \nleast as we agreed earlier. Senator Grassley supported that. The House \nwould not agree. We got half the problems of homestead eliminated in \nthis bill.\n  If we do not pass the bill, we will have the current law which has a \nhost of problems and none of them fixed.\n  That is where we are. We have a good piece of legislation. Chairman \nGrassley has done a magnificent job of listening to everybody and \nworking out an agreement that is acceptable. Chairman Hatch has \nlikewise been tough in trying to complete this bill. I believe we have \na good piece of legislation, and I hope the vote will be overwhelming \nagain today.\n  Mr. HATCH. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I have a \nquestion for the chairman of the Subcommittee and principal author of \nH.R. 2415. Because we were forced to proceed in an unconventional \nprocedural manner with respect to this legislation, can you provide any \nguidance for courts and practitioners on this legislation?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Certainly. The following is what H.R. 2415 does:\n\n                               H.R. 2415\n\n                Background and Need for the Legislation\n\n       The bankruptcy system is currently in a state of crisis. In \n     recent years, America has witnessed a dramatic explosion in \n     the number of bankruptcy filings. According to statistics \n     from the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, \n     bankruptcies have exploded from 331,000 in 1980 to just under \n     1.4 million in 1999. It is a matter of serious concern to \n     Congress that the explosion in bankruptcy comes at a time of \n     unprecedented prosperity, with low unemployment and high \n     wages. Unemployment is at an all-time low. Consumer \n     confidence has been high and the Dow Jones Industrial Average \n     at one point rose above the 10,000 mark. Thus, the high rate \n     of bankruptcy filings cannot reasonably be attributed to a \n     slow economy.\n       This state of crisis has a significant negative impact on \n     the American economy. According to the Department of Justice, \n     creditors lose 3.22 billion dollars annually as a result of \n     Chapter 7 bankruptcies filed by individuals who could repay \n     their debts. Obviously, the existence of multi-billion dollar \n     losses attributable to high levels of bankruptcy filings is a \n     clarion call for Congress to reform our bankruptcies laws to \n     require bankrupts who could repay some portion of their debts \n     to do so.\n       Given the strong performance of the economy, many feel that \n     the recent explosion in personal bankruptcy filings is at \n     least partly attributable to the decreased moral stigma \n     associated with declaring bankruptcy. See Testimony of \n     Professor Todd Zywicki, Joint Hearing of the Subcommittee on \n     Administrative Oversight and the Courts and the Subcommittee \n     on Commercial and Administrative Law, March 11, 1999; \n     Testimony of Tahira Hira, Subcommittee on Administrative \n     Oversight and the Courts Hearing, ``S. 1301, The Consumer \n     Bankruptcy Reform Act: Seeking Fair and Practical Solutions \n     to the Consumer Bankruptcy Crisis'' (March 11, 1998); \n     Testimony of Kenneth R. Crone, Subcommittee on Administrative \n     Oversight and the Courts Hearing, ``The Increase in Personal \n     Bankruptcy and the Crisis in Consumer Credit,'' (April 11, \n     1997); Lee Flint, ``Bankruptcy Policy: Toward a Moral \n     Justification for Financial Rehabilitation of Consumer \n     Debt,'' 48 Wash. & Lee L. Rev. 515 (1991); David Gross and \n     Nicholas Souleses, ``Explaining the Increase in Bankruptcy \n     and Delinquency: Stigma Versus Risk-Competition'' \n     (Preliminary, 1998); F.H. Buckley and Margaret F. Brinig, \n     ``The Bankruptcy Puzzle,'' 27 J. Legal Stud. (1998).\n       In the view of many in Congress, a decreased moral stigma \n     associated with bankruptcy means that filing for bankruptcy \n     is no longer viewed as a last resort reserved for financially \n     troubled Americans who have no other option but to seek debt \n     forgiveness. As Americans become accustomed to high levels of \n     consumer bankruptcy, it is only natural that declaring \n     bankruptcy has lost much of the shame previously associated \n     with it. Individuals who would have struggled to meet\n\n[[Page S11699]]\n\n     their financial obligations in the past are filing bankruptcy \n     today in record numbers. See Judge Edith H. Jones and Todd J. \n     Zywicki, ``It's Time for Means Testing,'' 1999 B.Y.U. L. Rev. \n     177. For example, recent studies suggest that almost half of \n     filers learned about their option to file for bankruptcy from \n     friends or family. See, e.g., Vern McKinley, ``Ballooning \n     Bankruptcies: Issuing Blame for the Explosive Growth,'' \n     Regulation, Fall 1997, at 38. At the same time, there have \n     been strong expressions of concern from the Federal Trade \n     Commission that attorney advertising is leading consumers to \n     file bankruptcy without being fully informed.\n       It is the strong view of the Congress that the Bankruptcy \n     Code's generous, no-questions-asked policy of providing \n     complete debt forgiveness under Chapter 7 without serious \n     consideration of a bankrupt's ability to repay is deeply \n     flawed and encourages a lack of personal responsibility.\n       Both H.R. 833 and its Senate counterpart S. 625 proposed \n     amendments to section 707(b) of the Bankruptcy Code to \n     require bankruptcy judges to dismiss a Chapter 7 case, or \n     convert a Chapter 7 case to another chapter if a bankrupt has \n     a demonstrable capacity to repay his or her debts. HR 2415 \n     maintains the section 707(b) structure. In general, the \n     agreement embodied in HR 2415 used S. 625 as the base for the \n     means test. Like S. 625, a presumption arises that a Chapter \n     7 bankrupt should be dismissed from bankruptcy or converted \n     to another chapter if, after taking into account secured \n     debts and priority debts as well as living expenses, the \n     bankrupt can repay over 5 years the lesser of 25 percent or \n     more of his or her general nonpriority unsecured debts (but \n     at least $6,000), or $10,000. This test requires those with \n     greater debts to pay proportionately more than those with \n     smaller debts. For example, the cases of debtors whose \n     unsecured, nonpriority debts are over $100,000 will be \n     dismissed under the means test (absent ``special \n     circumstances'' discussed later) if their projected ability \n     to pay over 5 years is over $10,000, even though that is \n     considerably less than 25% of their debt. Conversely, the \n     cases of debtors whose debts in that category are less than \n     $36,000 will only be dismissed under the means test if their \n     projected ability to repay over 5 years is over $6,000, \n     permitting debtors in this category to remain in chapter 7 \n     even though they have the ability to repay a percentage of \n     their unsecured, nonpriority debts considerably greater than \n     25%. The debtor can rebut this presumption only by \n     demonstrating ``special circumstances'' that would clearly \n     demonstrate that the bankrupt in fact does not have a \n     meaningful ability to repay his or her debts. It is \n     not intended that the ``special circumstances'' category \n     will be interpreted broadly to allow bankrupts to avoid \n     repayment of financial obligations for reasons unrelated \n     to finances, income or expenses. Therefore, the \n     presumption of abuse may only be rebutted, first on a \n     demonstration that the increases in spending or decreases \n     in income arise directly from ``special circumstances'' \n     and are justified by those circumstances, second, that \n     they are reasonable and necessary, and, third, that there \n     is no reasonable alternative to the expense or income \n     adjustment. For example, if a loss of income occurred \n     because a debtor voluntarily elected to waive a bequest or \n     otherwise reduce income, there would be a reasonable \n     alternative to the reduction because the debtor could have \n     not elected, even though there may have been good reasons \n     to do so. Moreover, the kind of ``special circumstances'' \n     Congress intended would not be present to justify the \n     adjustment, nor would it be reasonable and necessary. \n     Therefore, the additional adjustment to income would not \n     be allowed. Proof that the debtor permitted the reduction \n     in an attempt to avoid payment of creditors or other \n     inappropriate intent is not necessary, and a significant \n     burden is on the debtor to justify the adjustment.\n       On the other hand, if the debtor was a well paid medical \n     doctor who prior to bankruptcy changed from a demanding \n     private practice requiring 80 hours a week to a significantly \n     less well-paid research staff position with regular nine to \n     five hours in order to have more time to assist in the care \n     of a seriously disabled child, there would clearly be \n     ``special circumstances'' which justified the adjustment, the \n     income reduction would be reasonable and necessary, and the \n     special relationship of parent and child would clearly lead \n     to the conclusion that there was no reasonable alternative to \n     the adjustment.\n\n       General Overview of the Current Consumer Bankruptcy System\n\n       Under current law, individuals considering bankruptcy often \n     proceed under Chapter 7, where the bankrupt will surrender \n     all assets which do not qualify for an exemption to a \n     bankruptcy trustee. The bankruptcy trustee then sells the \n     bankrupt's property and distributes the proceeds to the \n     creditors. Any deficiency which remains after the sale of \n     these assets is simply erased (or ``discharged''), and the \n     bankrupt cannot be required to repay debts which have been \n     erased during bankruptcy. Chapter 7, often referred to as \n     ``straight bankruptcy,'' is the oldest and most commonly used \n     type of bankruptcy proceeding.\n       Individuals may also declare bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of \n     the Bankruptcy Code. Chapter 13 provides for the development \n     of a repayment plan that allows a debtor to repay some \n     portion of his or her debts. At the end of the repayment \n     period, the unpaid portion of debt is erased, and a debtor \n     cannot be required to repay the unpaid portion of the \n     discharged debt. Unlike Chapter 7, the purpose of Chapter 13 \n     is to rehabilitate financially-troubled consumers by using \n     future earnings to repay debts in exchange for a discharge of \n     the unpaid portions of those debts. Two other chapters are \n     also available to individual debtors, but are only rarely \n     used by consumers. Chapter 11, usually used by those with \n     significant assets, permits a debtor to negotiate a plan of \n     reorganization of the debtor's financial affairs with \n     creditors, and in some instances force that plan or unwilling \n     creditors. A discharge is available when the plan is \n     confirmed. Chapter 12 is available for family farmers.\n\n       Earlier Reform Efforts To Reduce Consumer Bankruptcy Abuse\n\n       The idea of requiring bankrupts to repay their debts when \n     they have the ability to do so is not new. This topic has \n     been the subject of many proposed amendments, from the early \n     1930s to the current Congress. S. 625 is merely an extension \n     of this longstanding effort to ensure that bankruptcy is \n     reserved for those truly in need of debt forgiveness. See \n     Oversight Hearing on Personal Bankruptcy, Committee on the \n     Judiciary, Subcommittee on Monopolies and Commercial Law, \n     97th Cong. 2nd Sess., (1982).\n       The general structure of the present federal Bankruptcy \n     Code is the result of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, Pub. \n     L. 95-598. The 1978 Act was the first major overhaul and \n     attempt to update comprehensively the bankruptcy law since \n     passage of the Chandler Act in 1938. 52 Stat. 840 (1938). \n     Prior to the Chandler Act, individuals in serious financial \n     trouble usually had no choice but to file for ``straight \n     bankruptcy'' under Chapter VII, a proceeding similar to \n     present Chapter 7 under the Bankruptcy Code. However, the \n     Chandler Act provided small debtors a new, alternative \n     procedure, the Chapter XIII Wage Earner's Plan, which allowed \n     an individual to retain nonexempt assets by proposing a plan \n     to pay his or her existing debts from future income, after \n     which the wage earner would receive a discharge of any unpaid \n     balances of his debts. See generally, Dvoret, ``Federal \n     Legislation, Bankruptcy Under the Chandler Act: Background,'' \n     27 Geo. L.J. 194 (1938).\n       The debate over Chapter XIII occurred years earlier in \n     joint hearings before the House and Senate Judiciary \n     Committees in 1932, during the Seventy-Second Congress. By \n     the time it was enacted in 1938, Chapter XIII codified \n     informal practices which had developed without explicit \n     statutory authorization. In the mid 1930's in Birmingham, \n     Alabama a former special referee in bankruptcy, Valentine \n     Nesbitt, first developed a ``repayment option'' which was the \n     model for Chapter XIII. See Weinstein, The Bankruptcy Law of \n     1938 (1938).\n       In 1932, Congress conducted hearings on S. 3866. Section 75 \n     of this bill would have established a repayment plan for wage \n     earners. Section 75 provided a method for an indebted wage \n     earner to come into court without being labeled ``a \n     bankrupt,'' and get the benefit of a court injunction to fend \n     off creditors while the wage earner arranged to repay his \n     pre-bankruptcy debts in installments. Section 75, with \n     certain modifications, eventually became Chapter XIII, \n     enacted in 1938 as part of the Chandler Act.\n       Since the 1938 amendments, there have been several \n     proposals to limit bankruptcy relief to those who lack \n     genuine repayment capacity. In the 1960s, Congress considered \n     several such proposals. See H.R. 12784, 88th Cong., 2d Sess. \n     (1964); H.R. 292, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. (1965); S. 613, 89th \n     Cong., 1st Sess. (1965); H.R. 1057 & H.R. 5771, 90th Cong., \n     1st Sess. (1967). Under these proposals, an individual debtor \n     seeking relief under the liquidation provisions of the \n     bankruptcy laws would be denied relief if the court concluded \n     that he or she could pay substantial amounts of debt out of \n     future earnings under a Chapter XIII plan.\n       Importantly, one of these proposals, S. 613, was introduced \n     by Senator Albert Gore, Sr., the father of the current Vice \n     President. When he introduced S. 613, Senator Gore indicated \n     that Chapter 7 resembled a special interest tax loophole, \n     which the wealthy could use to avoid paying their fair share. \n     Senator Gore, Sr. also commented on the moral consequences of \n     a lax bankruptcy system:\n       ``I realize that we cannot legislate morals, but we, as \n     responsible legislators, must bear the responsibility of \n     writing laws which discourage immorality and encourage \n     morality; which encourage honesty and discourage deadbeating; \n     which make the path of the social malingerer and shirker \n     sufficiently unpleasant to persuade him at least to \n     investigate the way of the honest man.''--Cong. Rec. 905, \n     January 19, 1965.\n       Given the current bankruptcy crisis, Senator Gore's words \n     from over 30 years ago seem prescient.\n       Following the 1978 amendments, in the early 1980s, Senator \n     Dole introduced S. 2000 during in the 97th Congress. In the \n     House of Representatives, Congressman Evans introduced H.R. \n     4786, which eventually garnered 269 co-sponsors. Congress did \n     not pass either proposal in the 97th Congress, so these \n     measure were reintroduced in the 98th Congress as H.R. 1169 \n     and S. 445. As a result of these efforts, Congress created \n     Section 707(b) of the Bankruptcy Code in 1984 to allow judges \n     to dismiss Chapter 7 cases if granting relief would \n     constitute a ``substantial abuse'' of the Bankruptcy Code. \n     Pub. Law 105-165. The focus of the effort was to require \n     bankrupts who had the ability to pay a significant percentage \n     of their debts ``without difficulty''\n\n[[Page S11700]]\n\n     to proceed under Chapter 13 instead of Chapter 7. However, \n     the term ``substantial abuse'' was not defined and creditors \n     and trustees were expressly forbidden from presenting \n     evidence to a judge that granting relief in a particular case \n     would result in a ``substantial abuse.''\n       Despite Congress' intent that section 707(b) would control \n     inappropriate use of chapter 7 by those with ability to pay, \n     that section has not been effective. Although many factors \n     are at work, much of the reason for this ineffectiveness has \n     been the ingrained point of view that ``honest'' debtors have \n     a ``right'' to a chapter 7 discharge even when they have \n     ability to pay. To illustrate, the Fourth Circuit has taken a \n     ``totality of the circumstances'' approach to determining \n     whether there is substantial abuse. In re Green, 934 F.2d 568 \n     (4th Cir. 1991)(a ``totality of circumstances'' test is \n     appropriate when deciding section 707(b) cases in which \n     ability to repay can be outweighed by other factors, like the \n     debtor's good faith or honesty). Some bankruptcy judges have \n     taken the totality of the circumstances approach suggested by \n     In re Green as a justification for either ignoring ability to \n     pay completely, or doing so in effect. See In re Adams, 209 \n     B.R. 874 (Bankr. M.D. Tenn. 1997)(Paine, J.)(honest debtor \n     with ability to repay cannot be dismissed from chapter 7); In \n     re Braley, 103 B.R. 758 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1989)(Bonney, J.). \n     Other Circuit Courts have disagreed and insisted that debtors \n     with ability to pay must do so. In re Kelley, 841 F.2d 908 \n     (9th Cir. 1988); In re Walton, 866 F. 2d 981 (8th Cir. 1989); \n     United States Trustee v. Harris, 960 F.2d 74 (8th Cir. 1992); \n     In re Koch, 109 F. 3d 1285 (8th Cir. 1997); In re Lamanna, \n     153 F. 3d 1 (1st Cir. 1998). A few bankruptcy courts have \n     followed the direction of these Circuit Courts, In re \n     Shelley, 231 B.R. 317 (Bankr. D. Neb. 1999)(Minahan, Jr. J.); \n     In re Cox, 2000 Bankr. Lexis 571 (Bankr. N.D. Fla., May 16, \n     2000).\n       It was this evidence which led Congress to conclude that \n     the complete overhaul of section 707(b) was necessary, with \n     clear, non-discretionary requirements imposed on the \n     bankruptcy court to reject the notion that debtors were \n     entitled to a discharge as a matter of right without regard \n     to their ability to pay and to assure that in practice those \n     with ability to pay would not be entitled to chapter 7 \n     relief. In the 105th Congress, the House passed HR 3150 and \n     the Senate passed S. 1301, two bills which would have \n     inserted means-testing in section 707(b). A Conference \n     Committee reconciled the two bills and produced a Conference \n     Report (H. Rep. 105-794) which passed the House at the end of \n     the 105th Congress but was never voted on in the Senate. \n     Senate Report 105-253 provides the legislative history of S. \n     1301. House Report 105-540 provides the legislative History \n     of HR 3150.\n\n                        The Current Legislation\n\n       HR 2415 is the culmination of these efforts and is intended \n     to both remove unequivocally the bankruptcy court's \n     discretion with regard to whether a debtor with ability to \n     pay should be dismissed from chapter 7, and to restrict as \n     much as possible reliance upon judicial discretion to \n     determine the debtor's ability to pay. Limited judicial \n     discretion remains to deal with the hardship case, but that \n     discretion is not to be abused by lax enforcement of the \n     standards in HR 2415.\n       Section 102 of HR 2415 provides that a Chapter 7 case will \n     be presumed to be an ``abuse'' of Chapter 7 if the debtor has \n     the ability to repay, in a 5-year repayment plan, 25% of the \n     debtor's nonpriority unsecured claims (but not less than \n     $6,000), or $10,000, whichever is less. For purposes of \n     determining the debtor's repayment ability, section 102 \n     provides that the debtor's monthly expenses shall be \n     applicable monthly expenses under standards issued by the \n     Internal Revenue Service (``IRS'') for the area in which the \n     debtor resides. The IRS standards applicable under section \n     102 are the IRS ``National Standards,'' ``Local Standards,'' \n     and certain categories of ``Other Necessary Expenses'' which \n     are specifically listed in the Standards. These Internal \n     Revenue Service standards are currently used to determine \n     appropriate living expenses for taxpayers who are required to \n     repay delinquent taxes. These standards have been developed \n     by the Treasury Department to assist the Department in the \n     collection of taxes and, of course, can be revised from time \n     to time, as needed. These expense categories allow \n     expenses for housing, food, transportation, and, for \n     purposes of the means test, certain specified ``other \n     necessary expenses.''\n       In order to provide flexibility in appropriate cases of \n     hardship, Section 102 also provides that in some cases where \n     the presumption applies the debtor may be able to demonstrate \n     ``special circumstances'' that ``justify'' additional \n     expenses or an adjustment to the debtor's income for which \n     there is no reasonable alternative. In addition, the debtor \n     must demonstrate that the adjustments are reasonable and \n     necessary and there is no reasonable alternative to the \n     expense or income adjustment. If the debtor can make this \n     showing, the presumption is rebutted. It is not intended that \n     the ``special circumstances'' test will allow the presumption \n     of abuse to be rebutted by relying on factors other than \n     ability to pay.\n       The presumption of abuse arises due to a financial \n     calculation assessing a Chapter 7 debtor's ability to pay. \n     Thus, the presumption of abuse under Section 707(b) may only \n     be rebutted if the debtor shows changes to expenses or \n     changes to income not otherwise accounted for in the means \n     test and that meet all of the requirements of the ``special \n     circumstances'' test. Other factors are not relevant.\n       In applying the ``special circumstances'' test, it is \n     important to note that a debtor who requests a ``special \n     circumstances'' adjustment is requesting preferential \n     treatment when compared to other consumers, and it is those \n     other consumers who, by paying their debts, must assume the \n     cost of the debts discharged by the debtors seeking the \n     preferential treatment. It also is important to note that, \n     because of the protections established for debtors whose \n     income falls below the median income level, the preferential \n     treatment provided under the ``special circumstances'' \n     standard primarily benefits higher income individuals.\n       As indicated earlier, in order to ensure fairness with \n     respect to the consumers who must pay the cost when others \n     discharge debts in bankruptcy, it is essential that the \n     ``special circumstances'' test establish a significant, \n     meaningful threshold which a debtor must satisfy in order to \n     receive the preferential treatment. The House/Senate \n     agreement incorporated in HR 2415 is premised upon the belief \n     that the relief sought by a debtor who files for bankruptcy \n     is financial in nature and the debtor's right to obtain \n     preferential relief under the ``special circumstances'' \n     provision should be assessed based on financial \n     considerations only. Thus, the agreement is not intended to \n     allow debtors to continue expenses unless they clearly \n     demonstrate that they meet the ``special circumstances'' test \n     for such adjustments.\n       Under this bankruptcy reform package, the Office of United \n     States Trustee or bankruptcy administrator is required to \n     file a motion to dismiss or convert a Chapter 7 case if the \n     bankrupt's current monthly income equals or exceeds the state \n     median income and the presumption of abuse applies. If the \n     Office of United States Trustee or bankruptcy administrator \n     determines after investigation that such a motion is not \n     warranted because the presumption of abuse can be rebutted, \n     then it must file an explanatory statement with the \n     bankruptcy court detailing why a motion to dismiss or convert \n     is not appropriate. If private trustees or creditors \n     disagree, they can commence a motion under 707(b).\n       Importantly, creditors are now explicitly given the power \n     to bring 707(b) motions before the bankruptcy court, although \n     creditors' and private trustees' motions are restricted to \n     cases in which the debtor's current monthly income exceeds \n     the applicable state median income. Moreover, HR 2415 gives \n     Chapter 7 trustees important new financial incentives for \n     ferreting out bankrupts who have repayment capacity and \n     provides for appropriate penalties for bankruptcy attorneys \n     who recklessly steer individuals with repayment capacity to \n     Chapter 7 bankruptcy, or file schedules which misstate \n     income, expenses or assets. HR 2415 also contains penalties \n     for creditors who file inappropriate motions under section \n     707(b). Thus, contrary to the assertions of some, there are \n     real and meaningful reasons why creditors will not improperly \n     use their right to file 707(b) motions.\n       The new section 707(b) also provides that in addition to \n     the means test, Chapter 7 debtors' cases may be dismissed if \n     the filing is not in good faith or the ``totality of the \n     circumstances'' indicate that granting relief under Chapter 7 \n     would constitute abuse. No inference should be drawn, however \n     that by referencing the ``totality of the circumstances'' \n     Congress intended to approve the result in In re Green, 934 \n     F.2d 568 (4th Cir. 1991) or similar cases. Such cases are \n     rejected by the means test reforms and the change in the \n     standard from ``substantial abuse'' to ``abuse'' in HR 2415. \n     However, situations in which courts dismiss debtors from \n     Chapter 7 today clearly continue to be grounds for dismissal \n     under HR 2415, including such cases as In re Lamanna, 153 F. \n     3d 1 (1st Cir. 1998). In addition, since the standard for \n     dismissal is revised to require ``abuse'' rather than \n     ``substantial abuse'', the courts are clearly given \n     additional discretion to control abusive use of chapter 7 \n     when that is appropriate.\n       Congress thus intends that the new section 707(b) provide a \n     tightly-focused mechanism for identifying bankrupts who have \n     repayment capacity and sorting them out of Chapter 7, as well \n     as dealing with other forms of abuse. At the same time, the \n     new section 707(b) means test contains procedural safeguards \n     which ensure that any special financial circumstances of a \n     debtor will be appropriately considered before he or she is \n     dismissed from bankruptcy or converted to another chapter.\n\n       Enhanced Consumer Protections and Credit Card Disclosures\n\n       Importantly, HR 2415 retains Title XIX of the Senate bill. \n     This title amends the Truth in Lending Act (``TILA'') to \n     require significant new minimum payment disclosures in \n     connection with open-end credit plans. Among other things, HR \n     2415 requires credit card companies, on the front of each \n     monthly statement, to provide:\n       --a statement that making only minimum payments will \n     increase the interest costs and the time it takes to repay \n     the account balance;\n       --an example showing the length of time it would take to \n     repay a specified amount if making minimum payments only; and\n       --a toll-free telephone number which cardholders could call \n     to receive additional repayment information.\n\n[[Page S11701]]\n\n       HR 2415 requires the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate a \n     table that would set forth information for use by credit card \n     issuers in responding to cardholders who make inquiries \n     through the toll-free telephone number. Finally, the Federal \n     Reserve Board is authorized to study the types of information \n     available to consumers regarding factors qualifying potential \n     borrowers for credit, repayment requirements, and the \n     consequences of default, including information related to \n     minimum payments. The study would include consideration of \n     the extent to which the availability of low minimum payment \n     options is a cause of consumers experiencing financial \n     difficulty.\n       HR 2415 also amends TILA to require certain applications or \n     solicitations for credit cards that include an introductory \n     rate of less than one year, and all promotional materials \n     accompanying such an application or solicitation, to include \n     the following relating to introductory rates:\n       --use the term ``introductory'' in immediate proximity to \n     each listing of the introductory rate; and\n       --disclose when the introductory period will end and the \n     annual percentage rate that will apply at the end of the \n     introductory period.\n       In addition, HR 2415 requires a clear and conspicuous \n     disclosure, in a prominent manner on or with an application \n     or solicitation, of the rate, if any, that will apply if the \n     introductory rate is revoked, and a general description of \n     the circumstances or events that would result in such a rate.\n       HR 2415 also requires a credit card issuer to clearly and \n     conspicuously provide disclosures regarding the key features \n     of the credit plan, such as interest rate and basic fees, \n     with Internet-based credit card applications and \n     solicitations. These disclosures must be readily accessible \n     to consumers in close proximity to the solicitations and \n     these disclosures must be updated regularly to reflect the \n     current policies, terms, and fee amounts applicable to the \n     credit card account. HR 2415 also provides that, if a lender \n     imposes a late fee for failing to make payment by the payment \n     due date, the lender must state on each periodic statement \n     the payment due date (or, if the card issuer contractually \n     establishes a different date, the earliest date on which a \n     late fee may be imposed). The lender also must state the \n     amount of the fee that will be assessed if payment is \n     received after that date.\n       Importantly, HR 2415 amends TILA to provide that an open-\n     end creditor cannot terminate an account prior to its \n     expiration date solely because the consumer has not incurred \n     finance charges on the account.\n       New disclosures are now required in connection with \n     consumer credit plans secured by the consumer's principal \n     dwelling in which the extension of credit may exceed the fair \n     market value of the dwelling. Under the amendment, a creditor \n     must disclose at the time the creditor distributes an \n     application to the consumer for such a plan that interest on \n     the portion of the credit extension that is greater than the \n     fair market value of the dwelling is not tax deductible for \n     federal income tax purposes.\n       The Congress also directs that the Federal Reserve Board \n     study the existing protections limiting consumer liability \n     for unauthorized use of debit cards. In addition, the Board \n     is directed to study the impact that extensions of credit to \n     college students have on the rate of bankruptcy cases filed.\n       In addition to these new credit card disclosures, HR 2415 \n     contains several important reforms which will protect \n     individuals and help them better understand their rights and \n     remedies. Reaffirmations occur when a debtor agrees to pay a \n     debt which would otherwise be wiped away in bankruptcy. \n     Section 524 of the Bankruptcy Code sets the conditions which \n     must be met before such agreements will be considered legally \n     binding. The bankruptcy reform package retains the Senate-\n     passed amendments related to the reaffirmation agreements, \n     with slight changes affecting only credit union debt.\n       HR 2415 also requires the Attorney General to designate \n     prosecutors and investigators to enforce current criminal \n     statutes designed to protect debtors in bankruptcy court from \n     deceptive or coercive collection practices as well as \n     enforcing those same statutes against debtors in appropriate \n     cases. By committing substantial new resources to fighting \n     abusive creditor and debtor practices and bankruptcy fraud, \n     it is intended that the Department of Justice step up \n     enforcement of these under-used statutes.\n       The bankruptcy reform package contains a provision which \n     penalizes creditors who refuse to negotiate reasonable \n     repayment schedules outside of bankruptcy. Under this \n     provision, the amount that a creditor may collect in \n     bankruptcy can be reduced if an approved credit counseling \n     agency approved under the credit counseling provision of HR \n     2415 for the judicial district in which the debtor's case is \n     pending makes a reasonable offer of repayment at least 60 \n     days prior to declaring bankruptcy and the creditor \n     unreasonably rejects this offer. During Senate consideration \n     of S. 625, the Department of Justice indicated support for \n     promoting alternative dispute resolution in this way but then \n     suggested that the provision be ``clarified'' in such a way \n     that it will not apply to governmental creditors. See Letter \n     to The Honorable Orrin G. Hatch, Chairman, Committee on the \n     Judiciary, April 9, 1999. Thus, if the Congress were to \n     accept the suggestions of the Department of Justice, non-\n     governmental creditors would be subject to a tougher standard \n     than currently contained in the bankruptcy reform package, \n     but the Internal Revenue Service would be free to avoid \n     alternative dispute resolution. Given its history in dealing \n     with taxpayers, it was considered inappropriate to create \n     such a special exemption for the Internal Revenue Service.\n\n              Reducing Abusive Uses of the Bankruptcy Code\n\n       As the National Bankruptcy Review Commission correctly \n     noted, many of the worst abuses of the bankruptcy system \n     involve individuals who repeatedly file for bankruptcy with \n     the sole intention of using the automatic stay (i.e., a court \n     injunction which arises whenever a bankruptcy case is filed). \n     National Bankruptcy Rev. Comm. Rep., ``Bankruptcy the Next \n     Twenty Years,'' October 20, 1997 vol. 1, at 262. Accordingly, \n     HR 2415 contains restrictions on repeat filers and on \n     multiple owners who serially file. It is expected that these \n     changes will dramatically reduce the number of inappropriate \n     bankruptcy filings.\n       HR 2415 also requires random audits of bankruptcy petitions \n     to verify the accuracy of information contained in bankruptcy \n     petitions, and makes debtor attorney's responsible to \n     diligently inquire into the accuracy of the information \n     provided on the schedules. Many Members of Congress are \n     concerned that there is little incentive for individuals to \n     list all of their assets or fully and accurately disclose \n     their financial affairs, including their income and living \n     expenses, when they file for bankruptcy. Of course, such \n     laxity fosters an environment in which the overall financial \n     condition of the bankrupt is likely to be inaccurate, with \n     the result that creditors may receive less than they could \n     when a bankrupt's financial affairs are accurately disclosed. \n     Accordingly, the random audit procedures will restore some \n     integrity to the system, since material misstatements are \n     required to be reported to the appropriate authorities.\n\n                 Enhanced Protections for Child Support\n\n       Balanced bankruptcy reform must protect the status of child \n     support. According to some estimates, more than one-third of \n     bankruptcies involve spousal and child support orders. And in \n     about half of those cases, women were creditors trying to \n     collect court-ordered support from their former husbands. \n     These support orders are a lifeline for thousands of families \n     struggling to maintain self-sufficiency.\n       HR 2415 contains all of the child support provisions of the \n     Senate-passed version of bankruptcy reform (S. 625), \n     including provisions closing various serious loopholes which \n     allowed those who owed child support, alimony and in some \n     instances other marital dissolution obligations to use the \n     bankruptcy laws to delay and sometimes defeat payment of \n     those obligations. HR 2415 also contains a new provision \n     which requires bankruptcy trustees to notify child support \n     creditors of their right to use state child support \n     enforcement agencies to collect outstanding amounts due. In \n     addition, HR 2415 permits general creditors to disclose the \n     last known billing address of a debtor who owes child support \n     or alimony to child support claimants. Taken together, these \n     changes place child support and alimony claimants in a far \n     better position under HR 2415 than under current law.\n\n                          Business Provisions\n\n       HR 2415 contains the small business reform measures from \n     the Senate passed version of HR 833. Although business \n     bankruptcy filings are low at this time, several changes to \n     Chapter 11 are warranted. HR 2415 contains provisions \n     intended to speed up Chapter 11 for small business debtors, \n     enact recommendations of the United Nations Commission on \n     Internal Trade Law regarding transnational bankruptcy and \n     clarify the treatment of tax claims in bankruptcy.\n       Importantly, HR 2415 provides new deadlines on tenants \n     under non-residential leases to decide whether to reject or \n     assume leases under section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code. Under \n     current law, once a tenant under a non-residential real \n     property lease has filed for Chapter 11 relief, it has 60 \n     days to decide whether to accept or reject its lease, with \n     extensions for cause. Unfortunately, bankruptcy judges have \n     allowed the exception for cause to swallow the rule. Today, \n     bankruptcy judges routinely extend the time within which \n     retail debtors must assume or reject the lease for years, \n     including until confirmation of the plan. Moreover, while \n     these tenant-debtors are supposed to pay their rent while the \n     proceedings continue, they do not always do so and bankruptcy \n     judges have not always compelled them to do so.\n       Thus, landlords are often left with significant uncertainty \n     since they may have no clear indication as to whether a \n     tenant will continue in a lease and the tenant may not be \n     current on post-petition rents. It is hoped that the \n     provisions contained in the current bankruptcy reform \n     agreement will mitigate the unfairness confronting landlords \n     of non-residential leases. The House bill provided that an \n     unexpired lease of nonresidential property will be deemed \n     rejected if the trustee has not assumed or rejected it by the \n     earlier of the date of confirmation of a plan or a date that \n     is no more than 120 days after the date of the order for \n     relief, with an additional 120 days if granted by the court \n     for cause. The court, under the House bill, could then grant \n     an extension beyond 240 days after the date of the order for \n     relief ``only\n\n[[Page S11702]]\n\n     upon prior written consent of the lessor.'' The Senate bill \n     provided that such a lease would be deemed rejected if the \n     trustee has not acted by the earlier of the date of \n     confirmation of a plan or the date which is 120 days after \n     the date of the order for relief. No additional extension is \n     permitted except ``upon motion of the lessor.'' Both bills, \n     then, were quite similar, especially in denying bankruptcy \n     judges discretion in extending the deadline for assuming or \n     rejecting a lease after an absolute period following the \n     order for relief--240 days in the former and 120 days in the \n     latter. Both the Departments of Justice and the Interior \n     favored a 120 day deadline, with no discretion in the \n     bankruptcy judge.\n       HR 2415 provides that an unexpired non-residential real \n     property lease is deemed rejected if the trustee has not \n     acted by the earlier of the date of confirmation of a plan or \n     the date which is 120 days after the date of the order for \n     relief. The court may extend the 120 day period for an \n     additional 90 days, prior to the expiration of the 120 day \n     period, upon motion of either the trustee or the lessor for \n     cause, for a total of 210 days after the date of the order \n     for relief. If the court has granted such 90 day extension, \n     the court may grant a subsequent extension only upon prior \n     written consent of the lessor. This can be in the form of (1) \n     a motion of the lessor or (2) a motion of the trustee, \n     provided that the trustee has a prior written consent of the \n     lessor. Importantly, HR 2415 clearly retains both bills' \n     denial of bankruptcy judges' discretion in extending this \n     date: in no circumstance may the time to assume or reject \n     unexpired nonresidential real property leases extend beyond \n     the earlier of (1) the time of confirmation or (2) 210 days \n     from the time of entry of the order for relief, without the \n     prior written consent of the lessor--either in the form of a \n     lessor's motion, or in the form of a prior written consent to \n     a trustee's motion, to extend the time. Moreover, a lessor's \n     written consent to one extension beyond the 210 period does \n     not constitute such consent for a subsequent extension: each \n     such extension beyond 210 days requires the separate written \n     consent of the lessor.\n       Finally, HR 2415 adds language to Section 365 (f)(1) of the \n     Bankruptcy Code for the purpose of assuring that section \n     365(f) does not override any part of Section 365(b). HR 2415 \n     provides that section 365(f) is not only subject to Section \n     365(c), but also to Section 365(b), which is to be given full \n     effect. Contrary legal interpretations in case law are \n     overturned.\n\n                     Section by Section Explanation\n\n\n                    Title I--Needs Based Bankruptcy\n\n     Sections 101-103: Dismissal for Abuse and the Means Test\n       These three sections expand present 707(b) of the \n     Bankruptcy Code to require a court to dismiss a chapter 7 \n     petition filed by an individual debtor whose debts are \n     primarily consumer debts (or with the debtor's consent, \n     convert to another bankruptcy chapter) if the debtor's case \n     meets certain standards. Present law already requires that an \n     individual debtor's case be dismissed if it is a \n     ``substantial abuse'' and the debtor's debts are primarily \n     consumer debts, but also creates a presumption against \n     dismissal and prevents anyone other than the court or the \n     United States Trustee from raising the issue. There has been \n     concern that present 707(b) is not effective to prevent \n     inappropriate use of chapter 7, and in particular debtors who \n     have ability to repay their debts from using chapter 7 to \n     obtain a discharge without repaying creditors what they can \n     afford, needlessly costing consumers who pay their bills in \n     higher credit prices.\n       These sections reorganize present section 707(b) to change \n     the standard for dismissal from ``substantial abuse'' to \n     ``abuse'' in order to provide strengthened controls against \n     abusive use of chapter 7. They also replace the presumption \n     against dismissal from chapter 7 with a presumption of \n     dismissal if the debtor has ability to pay as determined by a \n     new means test. The changes are intended to broaden rather \n     than limit controls on improper use of chapter 7.\n       The means test.--Section 102 establishes a means test \n     enforced by required dismissal from chapter 7. To apply the \n     means test, the debtor must complete revised schedules of \n     income and expense similar to those now required, but revised \n     to show net income determined in a particular way and a \n     calculation of how much the debtor can afford to pay under \n     the new means test. The means test should for the most part \n     be self-enforcing. It should be infrequent that a debtor will \n     fill out the schedule of income and expenses which show that \n     the debtor has ability to pay, and still file in chapter 7. \n     Forms should be developed for these revised schedules which \n     are clear and understandable, and promote accurate and \n     efficient administration of the means test. The schedules \n     should be filed with the debtor's petition. It is intended \n     that the anti-fraud provisions of the bankruptcy and other \n     laws be applied vigorously by the bankruptcy courts and \n     others whenever fraudulent completion of the schedules is \n     apparent.\n       The means test initially focuses upon the debtor's net \n     income determined according to standards set forth in these \n     sections. The debtor's current monthly income is first \n     determined by averaging the debtor's monthly income for the \n     prior six months and excluding social security or certain war \n     reparations income. Next, the debtor's monthly expenses are \n     determined. These include monthly expenses as specified under \n     the National Standards and Local Standards issued by the \n     Internal Revenue Service for the area in which the debtor \n     resides, and the debtor's actual monthly expenses for the \n     categories specified as Other Necessary Expenses under those \n     same standards. The categories specified as Other Necessary \n     Expenses means only those categories of expense specifically \n     listed in the Internal Revenue Service Manual at 5323.423(1), \n     (3) and (4).\n       It is not intended that additional expenses will be \n     deductible except as otherwise specified in section 707(b). \n     For example, an additional allowance is available if \n     demonstrated to be reasonable and necessary up to 5% of the \n     monthly allowances for food and clothing categories as \n     specified by the National Standards. Moreover, actual monthly \n     expense allowances are specified for certain reasonably \n     necessary family violence expenses and for reasonable and \n     necessary continued expenses of supporting an elderly, \n     chronically ill or disabled family member. The debtor's \n     monthly expenses for priority debts and secured debts \n     (including the averaged cost of curing arrearages with \n     respect to secured debts as permitted in chapter 13) are also \n     deductible. They are determined based on the average of those \n     expenses over a 60 month period.\n       Also allowed are deductions for actual average monthly \n     expenses that are entitled to administrative expense priority \n     under the Bankruptcy Code, but never more than 10% of \n     projected plan payments, as determined under a schedule to be \n     issued from time to time as necessary by the Executive Office \n     of United States Trustees. This schedule is to be based on \n     the standing chapter 13 trustee's fee as allowed from time to \n     time in each district and should not include other amounts. \n     Other fee schedules may be provided for cases when a debtor \n     qualifies for chapter 12 or would have to use chapter 11 \n     because excluded from chapter 13. In applying the 10% cap, \n     only projected plan payments which are reasonable and \n     necessary should be considered. Generally, plan payments to \n     pay secured debt should be excluded from projected plan \n     payments when calculating administrative expenses, unless \n     there is a compelling reason for concluding that payment of \n     the secured debt would be included in the debtor's plan. \n     Although the administrative expenses may be otherwise \n     entitled to priority, it is intended that they be accounted \n     for under this specific administrative expense provision and \n     not also allowed under the provision for priority expenses.\n       Actual expenses for private elementary or secondary private \n     school tuition not exceeding $1,500 per child per year are \n     also deductible.\n       Once the monthly expense allowances are determined, they \n     are then subtracted from current total monthly income to \n     obtain the debtor's net monthly income. Net income is then \n     multiplied by 60. If the result is greater than the lesser of \n     a threshold amount of (1) $10,000 or (2) 25% of the \n     nonpriority unsecured claims in the debtor's case but not \n     less than $6,000, there is a presumption that the debtor's \n     case must be dismissed from chapter 7.\n       This presumption may be rebutted if there are special \n     circumstances that justify adjustments to income or expenses \n     for which there is no reasonable alternative. To claim such \n     additional expense or income adjustment, the debtor must \n     itemize, explain and document why the expense or income \n     adjustment is reasonable and necessary in addition to \n     meeting the special circumstances test and demonstrates \n     there is no reasonable alternative to the expenses or \n     income adjustment. If it is determined that special \n     circumstances as described do exist, the debtor may \n     recalculate income and expenses based on the adjustments \n     and apply the threshold to the resulting net income. The \n     presumption can only be rebutted by demonstrating that an \n     expense or income adjustment appropriate under the special \n     circumstances test causes the debtor's net income to be \n     below the applicable threshold amount.\n       An important additional feature of the means test is the \n     ``safe harbor.'' If the debtor's current monthly income is \n     less than the appropriate state median income as determined \n     by current statistical information supplied by the Bureau of \n     the Census, then only the judge, United States trustee, \n     bankruptcy administrator, or trustee may bring a motion under \n     section 707(b). The safe harbor provides further limits \n     motions against debtors whose current monthly income is less \n     than the appropriate state median income as determined by \n     current statistical information supplied by the Bureau of the \n     Census, in that for such debtors, neither the judge, the \n     United States Trustee, the bankruptcy administrator, a \n     private trustee nor a party in interest can bring a motion to \n     dismiss under the presumed abuse provisions of the means \n     test. It is expected that the Bureau of the Census will \n     promptly make available state median income information by \n     family size for households of 1-4 members based upon \n     information it collects. For these purposes, a family or \n     household consists of the debtor and the debtor's dependents, \n     and in a joint case, the debtor's spouse. The median income \n     for families larger than 4 persons is determined by taking \n     the monthly median income for a family of 4 and adding $525 \n     to that figure for each additional family member.\n       Under subsection (e) of section 102 of HR 2415, creditors \n     are permitted to report information concerning a debtor's \n     failure to satisfy the means test or other abuse to the \n     United States Trustee, bankruptcy administrator, case trustee \n     or judge assigned the\n\n[[Page S11703]]\n\n     case, and participate with them in the preparation and \n     presentation of a motion to dismiss, as in Kornfield v. \n     Schwartz, 164 F. 3d 778 (2d Cir. 1999). Contacts with the \n     judge, however, cannot be ex parte.\n       The bill provides that the Internal Revenue Service \n     standards relied upon for the means test will be studied by \n     the Executive Office of United States Trustees, with a report \n     to the respective Judiciary Committees of both Houses of \n     Congress within 2 years of the effective date.\n       Disposable income test.--This section also amends section \n     1325(b)(2) to define disposable income for cases of debtors \n     with current monthly income over median income, using the \n     same basic concepts, to the extent they are applicable, that \n     are used in applying the means test. It is intended that \n     there be a uniform, nationwide standard to determine \n     disposable income used in chapter 13 cases, based upon means \n     test calculations.\n       Present law requires that in a chapter 13 plan, all of the \n     debtor's disposable income be used to pay creditors under the \n     plan, but does not define the term. This section both \n     requires (1) that all of the debtor's disposable income be \n     applied to pay unsecured creditors, and (2) that for debtors \n     whose current monthly income is in excess of the applicable \n     median income level, their disposable income be determined \n     using basic means test concepts which define current monthly \n     income (section 101(10A)), and allowable expenses (section \n     707(b)(2)(A)(ii), (iii) and (B)).\n       To determine disposable income for those over the \n     applicable median income level, first, current monthly income \n     as defined in HR 2415 is determined. From that amount, \n     amounts reasonably necessary to be expended for the \n     maintenance and support of the debtor or a dependent of the \n     debtor are deducted. The deductions for the expenses of \n     providing support and maintenance are to be determined in \n     accordance with the standards of section 707(b)(2)(A) and \n     (B). Thus, the debtor is allowed the amounts permitted for \n     food and housing under National Standards and Local Standards \n     issued by the Internal Revenue Service. Actual expenses for \n     other amounts in categories specified as Other Necessary \n     Expenses are also allowed, just as when applying the means \n     test. Expenses for secured debts which are paid outside of \n     the plan should be accounted for as required under \n     707(b)(2)(A)(iii), and payments for secured debt paid under \n     the plan should be what is provided in the plan as long as it \n     is not more than the amount permitted under that same \n     provision. Priority debt payments under the plan are not \n     reasonably necessary to be expended and should not be \n     included in the calculation, since under this provision, \n     disposable income is determined for the purposes of setting \n     the amount which must be paid to both nonpriority and \n     priority unsecured creditors. The means test only determines \n     the projected amount available to pay nonpriority unsecured \n     creditors.\n       The provision also provides for the adjustment of the \n     determination of disposable income if the debtor has \n     obligations to pay child support, foster care payments or \n     disability payments for a dependent child, and for certain \n     continuing charitable contributions as allowed under present \n     law. As with the means test, adjustments are also permitted \n     to income or expenses based on the ``special circumstances'' \n     provisions of the means test.\n       Once net monthly income is determined, it is then \n     multiplied by the applicable commitment period to determine \n     the total amount which the plan must apply over its duration \n     to pay unsecured creditors. If the plan does not apply all of \n     disposable income to pay unsecured creditors, the plan is not \n     confirmable.\n       Administration of the means test.--Several important \n     additional provisions assist in the efficient administration \n     of the means test. Enforcement of the means test is in the \n     first instance the responsibility of the United States \n     trustee or bankruptcy administrator for the district in which \n     the chapter 7 case is pending. The United States trustee or \n     bankruptcy administrator will be involved in determining \n     whether debtors have accurately disclosed their income and \n     expenses, and in preliminarily reviewing debtor's claims that \n     ``special circumstances'' exist which justify adjustments to \n     otherwise allowed monthly income and expense amounts. Case \n     trustees, judges and creditors are also entitled to \n     investigate means test issues and raise them by motions to \n     dismiss, or by bringing them to the attention of others \n     involved in the enforcement process.\n       When the debtor's chapter 7 petition is first filed, the \n     court is to review the debtor's income and expense schedule \n     and determine whether this is a case in which the presumption \n     in favor of dismissal applies. That will be determinable on \n     the face of the schedules, since debtors are required to do \n     the necessary calculations of the means test threshold. If \n     the presumptions arises, the court is to notify creditors \n     within ten days after the case is filed that this is a \n     presumption case.\n       Next, the United States trustee or bankruptcy administrator \n     is required to review the debtor's filing to evaluate whether \n     there should be a motion to dismiss filed. The United Sates \n     Trustee or bankruptcy administrator is to file with the court \n     a statement whether the debtor's case would or would not be \n     presumed to be an abuse under the means test of section \n     707(b) not later than 10 days after the date of the first \n     meeting of creditors. Moreover, if the debtor's current \n     monthly income is over the median income level and the \n     debtor's net income is more than the means test threshold, \n     the trustee or administrator must also either file with the \n     court a motion to dismiss, or a statement why no motion is \n     being filed. However, if the debtor's gross income is between \n     100% and 150% of median income, and the debtor's net income \n     determined in a special short-hand calculation based on core \n     expenses is under the threshold, the trustee is relieved of \n     any obligation to file a motion to dismiss. This ``mini \n     screen'' does not change the substantive requirements of the \n     means test. Its application is limited and is intended only \n     to permit the United States trustee or bankruptcy \n     administrator to use a short-hand method of calculating the \n     debtor's income available to pay creditors. If the short-hand \n     calculation of net income indicates that the debtor does not \n     meet ability to pay criteria, further administration of the \n     means test is not required. Otherwise, the full means test \n     calculation will be made to determine whether dismissal or \n     conversion is appropriate. In other cases, a similar \n     calculation can be made since the short-hand method of \n     calculation is one stage of the full means test calculation.\n       To ensure that debtors and creditors and their respective \n     counsel do not abuse the process, they are specifically \n     subjected to the standards of Bankruptcy Rule 9011 with \n     respect to the claims and defenses debtors and creditors and \n     their counsel assert in section 707(b) motions. Certain small \n     businesses with less than 25 employees are exempted from this \n     requirement. In addition, the accuracy of the schedules the \n     debtor must file with the petition, and particularly the \n     statements of assets, debts and income, expenses and means \n     test calculations, is enforced by a requirement that debtor's \n     counsel have no knowledge that the schedules are incorrect \n     after appropriate inquiry. An attorney's inquiry is expected \n     to be more than a cursory acceptance of the debtor's word and \n     must be sufficient to verify or disprove any knowledge, \n     information or belief which would lead a diligent attorney to \n     doubt the accuracy of the schedules.\n       Dismissal for abuse.--Dismissal under 707(b) is also \n     authorized when there is ``abuse''. It is intended that by \n     changing the standard for dismissal from ``substantial \n     abuse'' to ``abuse'', stronger controls will be available to \n     the courts, the United States trustee or bankruptcy \n     administrator, private trustees and creditors to limit the \n     abusive use of chapter 7 based on a wide range of \n     circumstances. The ``bad faith'' and ``totality of the \n     circumstances'' of the debtor's situation is adopted as an \n     appropriate standard. It is intended that all forms of \n     inappropriate and abusive debtor use of chapter 7 will be \n     covered by this standard, whether because of the debtor's \n     conduct or the debtor's ability to pay. If a debtor's case \n     would be dismissed today for ``substantial abuse'' as in In \n     re Lamanna, 153 F. 3d 1 (1st Cir. 1998), it is intended that \n     the case should be subject to dismissal under H.R. 2415. \n     Cases which have decided that a debtor's ability to pay \n     should not be considered when determining abuse, or can be \n     outweighed if the debtor is otherwise acting in good faith, \n     are intended to be overruled. In dealing with ability to pay \n     cases which are abusive, the presumption of abuse and the \n     safe harbor protecting debtors from application of the \n     presumption will not be relevant.\n       In addition, the standard of abusive conduct is \n     specifically intended to include consideration of whether a \n     chapter 7 filing is being used without justification to \n     secure rejection of a personal service contract.\n     Section 104. Notice of alternatives\n       This provision amends Bankruptcy Code section 342(b) to \n     expand on the contents of the notice which an individual \n     debtor whose debts are primarily consumer debts must receive \n     before filing a bankruptcy petition. The content and form of \n     the notice is to be prescribed by the United States trustee \n     or bankruptcy administrator for the district in which the \n     petition is filed, and must contain a description of chapters \n     7, 11, 12 and 13, review the benefits and costs of each \n     chapter, the services that are available from a nonprofit \n     credit counseling agency, and a disclosure of the debtor's \n     responsibilities in completing a petition with respect to the \n     accuracy of the schedules and other information provided. It \n     is intended that this notice will be in an easily understood \n     form, designed to assist debtors in better understanding the \n     alternatives for debt adjustment offered by the Bankruptcy \n     Code, the debtor's responsibilities in seeking such relief, \n     and as uniform as possible throughout the country.\n     Section 105. Debtor Financial Management Training Test \n         Program\n       The Executive Office of United States Trustees is directed \n     to develop financial management training curricula and \n     materials to educate individual debtors in personal financial \n     management. The materials are to be developed after \n     consultation with experts. The materials are to be tested in \n     6 judicial districts over 18 months. At the end of the test, \n     a report on the results is to be provided to the Speaker of \n     the House and the President pro tem of the Senate.\n     Section 106. Credit counseling\n       Credit counseling is an alternative to filing bankruptcy \n     for some debtors. It is intended that debtors be fully \n     informed before they file bankruptcy about this less drastic \n     alternative to bankruptcy in all instances, but particularly \n     when they have only received information about their \n     alternatives from petition preparers or attorneys.\n\n[[Page S11704]]\n\n       This provision establishes the requirement that before \n     individual debtors file for bankruptcy, they must be made \n     aware that credit counseling services are available. Debtors \n     are not required to actually undergo credit counseling, but \n     they must be made aware that such alternatives to bankruptcy \n     do exist. The case of a debtor must be dismissed if it is \n     filed without meeting that requirement unless the debtor can \n     demonstrate exigent circumstances which temporarily excuse \n     satisfying the requirement. It is expected that when courts \n     do not enforce this requirement sua sponte, the United States \n     trustee or bankruptcy administrator will bring the matter to \n     the court's attention by appropriate motion, but any trustee \n     or other party in interest could do so.\n       Concern has been expressed that the bankruptcy relief \n     debtors obtain under present law stops at the discharge, \n     failing to educate debtors about basic budget management so \n     they can avoid financial difficulties in the future. Under \n     this section, individual debtors will be required to attend a \n     course of instruction in personal financial management \n     approved by the United States trustee or bankruptcy \n     administrator for the district in which the petition is \n     filed. It is intended that the United States trustees and \n     bankruptcy administrators will strongly promote the \n     development of effective courses, both through the formal \n     approval process and informally. If the debtor fails to \n     attend a required course, the debtor will not be able to \n     obtain a discharge in either chapter 7 or 13. Provisions \n     similar to those applicable to credit counseling allow the \n     United States trustee or bankruptcy administrator to excuse \n     all filers in a district from the requirement if the trustee \n     or administrator finds that there are not enough providers of \n     the courses in the district. Congress intends that this \n     exemption will not be lightly imposed, and that the trustee \n     or administrator will use every reasonable effort to see that \n     there are adequate credit counseling and courses of \n     instruction available.\n       Credit counseling agencies and courses of instruction \n     concerning financial management included in the program must \n     be approved by the United States trustee or bankruptcy \n     administrator for the district. This section sets standards \n     which the United States trustee or bankruptcy administrator \n     must apply in deciding whether to approve a particular agency \n     or course. Prior to approval, the qualifications of the \n     agency or course are to be carefully reviewed by the United \n     States trustee or bankruptcy administrator. It is intended \n     that they will require applicants to provide adequate \n     information about qualifications and programs for this \n     purpose. Agencies and courses will be initially approved only \n     for a probationary period of no more than 6 months. After \n     that, their qualifications and performance will be reviewed \n     each year by the United States Trustee or bankruptcy \n     administrator. Review of the United States trustee or \n     bankruptcy administrator's decision to renew approval for the \n     first full year term after the probationary period and every \n     2 years thereafter is available in the United States district \n     court at the request of any party in interest. In addition, \n     at any time the district court sitting as a bankruptcy court \n     can review and disapprove an agency or course of instruction.\n     Section 107. Schedule of reasonable and necessary expenses\n       This provision directs the Director of the Executive Office \n     of United States Trustees to issue schedules of reasonable \n     and necessary administrative expenses for each judicial \n     district not later than 180 days after enactment. It is \n     intended that the administrative expenses for these purposes \n     include only the chapter 13 trustee's fee as allowed in the \n     district from time to time, and that the schedules will be \n     revised as necessary to reflect changes in that fee. Since \n     the trustee's fee is determined as a percentage of payments \n     made to creditors, the Director may determine that \n     the appropriate way to state the schedule is by providing \n     percentage amounts and a method for determining projected \n     plan payments. These will generally just be unsecured \n     debts unless there is a compelling reason to conclude \n     otherwise.\n\n\n                title ii--enhanced consumer protections\n\n     Section 201. Promotion of alternate dispute resolution\n       This section permits the court, on motion of the debtor and \n     after a hearing, to reduce a claim based in whole on \n     unsecured consumer debts by not more than 20% if (1) the \n     claim was filed by a creditor who unreasonably refused to \n     negotiate a reasonable alternative repayment system proposed \n     by an approved credit counseling agency acting on behalf of \n     the debtor; (2) the debtor's offer was made at least 60 days \n     before the filing of the bankruptcy petition and provided for \n     payment of at least 60% of the debt over the repayment period \n     of the loan, or a reasonable extension thereof; and (3) no \n     part of the debt under the alternative repayment schedule is \n     nondischargeable. An approved credit counseling agency means \n     one approved under the credit counseling provisions of this \n     Act.\n       This section applies only to claims which are based on \n     debts which are wholly unsecured consumer debts. The \n     provision is also carefully drafted so as only to require \n     creditors to negotiate, when reasonable, alternative \n     repayment systems so long as they are reasonable. It does not \n     require creditors to accept any alternative repayment \n     proposal, although it is expected that negotiations could \n     result in reasonable alternative plans being adopted. \n     Furthermore, the debtor's proposal must provide for at least \n     60% repayment to the creditor. The debtor's proposal should \n     not be considered reasonable if it is unlikely the debtor \n     will be able to make the repayments as proposed.\n     Section 202. Effect of discharge\n       A creditor's willful failure to credit plan payments in the \n     manner required by the plan is a violation of the post-\n     discharge injunction under section 524(a)(2) if the \n     creditor's acts to collect and failure to credit payments in \n     the manner required by the plan causes material injury to the \n     debtor. However, if a plan has been dismissed, is in default, \n     or the creditor has not received payments required under the \n     plan, the failure to credit the payments is not a violation \n     of the injunction.\n       This provision also clarifies that it is not a violation of \n     the post-discharge injunction for a creditor that holds a \n     claim secured in whole or in part by real property that is \n     the debtor's principal residence to take actions in the \n     ordinary course of business to seek or obtain periodic \n     payments associated with a valid security interest in lieu of \n     a mortgage foreclosure or other enforcement proceeding not \n     barred by the injunction. Congress intends this provision to \n     clarify the law in this area so as to provide a safe harbor \n     for mortgage lending, but the existence of this clarifying \n     provision is not intended to suggest that similar action \n     taken by creditors whose debt is not secured or is secured by \n     other types of property would be a violation of the post-\n     discharge injunction.\n     Section 203. Discouraging abuse of reaffirmation practices\n       This provision amends section 524(c)(2) of the Code to \n     provide a clearly understandable disclosure form to explain \n     the debtor's rights and obligations in the reaffirmation \n     process. It is intended that a single nationwide form as set \n     out in the statute will be used for all reaffirmations in all \n     bankruptcy courts, and that it will be the only disclosure \n     required in the reaffirmation process. It is expected that \n     the nationwide form will assist those who teach budgeting and \n     financial management in secondary schools, provide credit \n     counseling, or assist those in financial difficulty in \n     educating consumers about the benefits and disadvantages of \n     reaffirmations so that debtors who do reaffirm will be better \n     informed about what they are doing. The provision is also \n     intended to create a nationwide method of processing \n     reaffirmations so that companies who must administer \n     reaffirmations in several areas are freed from special \n     requirements in particular localities.\n       The statutory form, in addition to clearly explaining to \n     debtors what they are doing when they reaffirm, also provides \n     a form which may be used as the reaffirmation agreement and a \n     form for the debtor's attorney's certification when the \n     debtor is represented. Debtors must also fill out a Part D in \n     which they state their ability to pay the amount being \n     reaffirmed based upon their income and expenses, including \n     other reaffirmed debts. If debtors cannot complete the form \n     showing they have ability to pay the reaffirmed amount, there \n     is a presumption of undue hardship for a period of 60 days, \n     and the reaffirmation must be submitted for review by the \n     court even when the debtor's attorney certifies that the \n     reaffirmation is in the debtor's best interest. Since income \n     and expenses for these purposes are those the debtor will \n     have post-discharge, the standards of income and expense \n     under section 102 of HR 2415 are not relevant. The debtor's \n     actual post-discharge income and expenses as the debtor \n     determines them will control.\n       Credit unions are permitted to change the form to reflect \n     that the debtor may fill out a simpler Part D when a credit \n     union member is reaffirming a debt. The credit union member \n     only needs to indicate that will pay the reaffirmed \n     obligation, and there is no presumption of undue hardship or \n     requirement of review by the judge.\n       Creditors and debtors must make good faith efforts to \n     comply with the requirements imposed by this section. \n     However, there is no intention that errors in completing or \n     using the disclosure forms or complying with the procedural \n     requirements of this section will be construed as a violation \n     when those errors occur in good faith. Under present law, \n     violations of the reaffirmation requirements are enforceable \n     only as violations of the post-discharge injunction. \n     Enforcement of the injunction is an equitable proceeding in \n     which the equities are weighed, courts take into account the \n     good faith of the creditor. Under this section, creditors may \n     accept payments from debtors before and after the filing of a \n     reaffirmation agreement, and may accept and retain payments \n     under a reaffirmation agreement which the creditor believes \n     in good faith to be effective, even though subsequently it is \n     determined that the reaffirmation agreement is not in fact \n     effective. For example, if the creditor and debtor agree \n     that the debtor is responsible to file the reaffirmation \n     agreement, and the debtor does not do so, the creditor \n     should be able to accept and retain payments from the \n     debtor unless it knew the debtor had not in fact filed the \n     agreement with the court. Likewise, if a debtor indicates \n     that he or she has ability to pay in Part D, a creditor \n     can rely upon that statement. Moreover, the requirements \n     of subsection (c)(2) and those added by this section are \n     satisfied if the disclosures required under those \n     provisions are given in good faith. For the purposes of \n     this section, ``good faith'' is\n\n[[Page S11705]]\n\n     to be broadly construed as honesty in fact under the \n     circumstances. The narrow standard of good faith under the \n     Truth in Lending Act is not intended.\n       The requirements of present law are continued that debtors \n     who do not have counsel who will certify that a reaffirmation \n     is in the debtor's best interest must have the reaffirmation \n     approved by the court before it can be effective. Otherwise, \n     a reaffirmation is effective upon filing the completed and \n     signed statutory form and reaffirmation agreement with the \n     court.\n       The provision also directs that United States attorneys in \n     each district will designate a specific person within their \n     offices to address violations of criminal law relating to \n     bankruptcy crimes when they involve abusive reaffirmations or \n     materially fraudulent statements on schedules.\n     Subtitle B--Priority Child Support\n       Bankruptcy law has long recognized the legal and moral \n     importance of the payment of obligations incurred by a debtor \n     for the support of his or her spouse and children. As such, \n     it has striven to avoid having bankruptcy become a haven for \n     those who would avoid such obligations or an inadvertent \n     impediment for those who wish to comply with those \n     obligations. However, the treatment of domestic support in \n     bankruptcy had developed somewhat haphazardly over time as \n     new issues and concerns have been raised and addressed \n     piecemeal. Moreover, the Code had lagged behind in dealing \n     with the changing legal status of payments made to \n     governmental entities for such obligations, specifically \n     whether such payments were to be paid directly to support the \n     child or family of the debtor, or were to be retained by the \n     government because the parent or child was receiving public \n     assistance.\n       Under current nonbankruptcy law the status of a support \n     obligation may change rapidly as the recipient moves on or \n     off government assistance even though the underlying \n     responsibility to support the child or family is unaltered. \n     Thus, there is little reason for payments of domestic support \n     obligations to governmental entities not to be treated \n     equally with payments of such obligations directly to a \n     parent or child, or for a debtor to have a lesser duty to \n     satisfy those debts.\n       Prior to HR 2415 the principle of favored treatment for all \n     domestic support obligations had only been partially \n     recognized in the Code, and there were a number of areas in \n     which bankruptcy filings impacted domestic matters which were \n     not dealt with at all.\n       Accordingly, Congress undertook a comprehensive review of \n     all aspects of the treatment of domestic support obligations \n     under the Code to determine how to create a coherent and \n     consistent structure to deal with such obligations in \n     bankruptcy.\n       The following basic principles were employed in the support \n     amendments contained in these provisions:\n       1. Bankruptcy should interfere as little as possible with \n     the establishment and collection of on-going obligations for \n     support, as allowed in State family law courts.\n       2. The Bankruptcy Code should provide a broad and \n     comprehensive definition of support, which should then \n     receive favored treatment in the bankruptcy process.\n       3. The bankruptcy process should insure the continued \n     payment of on-going support and support arrearages with \n     minimal need for participation in the process by support \n     creditors.\n       4. The bankruptcy process should be structured to allow a \n     debtor to liquidate nondischargeable debt to the greatest \n     extent possible within the context of a bankruptcy case and \n     emerge from the process with the freshest start feasible.\n       There were a number of areas under former law where these \n     goals were not met. Support and debts in the nature of \n     support were not treated uniformly in the Bankruptcy Code or \n     by bankruptcy courts. Conspicuously, debts owed to the \n     government and based upon the payment of government funds for \n     the maintenance and support of the children or family of the \n     debtor were not given the advantages which the Code affords \n     to debts payable directly to the family of the debtor. \n     Specifically, support debts assigned or owed to the \n     government on the petition date have not been entitled to any \n     priority under section 507(a), have not been protected from \n     loss of their secured status under section 522(f)(1)(A), and \n     have been recoverable by the trustee as a preference under \n     section 547(c)(7)(A). Conversely, support debts which were \n     not assigned on the petition date were entitled to superior \n     treatment as provided in sections 507(a)(7), 522(f)(1)(A), \n     and 547(c)(7)(A).\n       Because support debts which are assigned to a governmental \n     entity when a petition is filed may become unassigned during \n     the course of a Chapter 12 or 13 bankruptcy plan, and vice \n     versa, the disparate treatment of these debts in the \n     Bankruptcy Code makes little sense. A family which is in need \n     of support after assistance terminates certainly should not \n     lose the advantages the Code gives unassigned support simply \n     because the support was assigned on the petition date. The \n     contrary was also true. Governmental entities under former \n     law received the advantages given to the creditor of \n     unassigned support when the support became assigned during \n     bankruptcy. An overriding purpose of Subtitle B is to \n     eliminate substantially such distinctions in the treatment of \n     support obligations.\n       In addition to the disparate treatment of support debts \n     found in the Code, the courts also drew distinctions with \n     respect to the dischargeability of support debts owed to the \n     government and support debts owed to the parent or child of \n     the debtor. These distinctions were often arcane and \n     technical. To illustrate, if the debts were owed to the \n     government and based upon the payment of public \n     assistance, the dischargeability of such debts turned on \n     the irrelevant circumstance of when the aid was paid. As a \n     result, judgment debts for support based upon the payment \n     of public assistance prior to the date a petition for on-\n     going support was entered could be discharged while an \n     arrearage accrued under an on-going order could not, even \n     when the support debts were based on identical criteria. \n     And contributing to a lack of uniformity, the decisional \n     law was not consistent. Moreover, many debts which were \n     incurred by a debtor based upon the responsibility of a \n     governmental entity to provide for the support and \n     maintenance of a child, but which debts were never owed to \n     the child or family of the debtor directly, could be \n     discharged. In particular the following were found to be \n     dischargeable: debts incurred for the costs of maintenance \n     of a child in a juvenile detention facility; debts \n     incurred to support a child who was made a ward of the \n     state; debts for support which had not been reduced to a \n     judgment at the time the bankruptcy petition was filed; \n     and debts for child support and maintenance resulting from \n     the placement of the debtor's children in shelter care \n     facilities. In all of these situations debtors have the \n     same legal, equitable, and moral obligations to provide \n     for the support of their children, but under the \n     peculiarities of former law they could transfer that \n     burden to the taxpayers. The domestic support enforcement \n     provisions of HR 2415 is designed to insure compliance \n     with those obligations, during and after bankruptcy.\n     Section 211. Definition of domestic support obligation\n       To ensure that all debts relating to the support of a \n     debtor's spouse, former spouse, family or child are given a \n     similar treatment in bankruptcy, section 211 of HR 2415 \n     provides a sweeping definition for the concept of a \n     ``domestic support obligation.'' This definition is intended \n     to clarify the following:\n       1. The domestic support obligation includes interest on \n     that obligation as provided under applicable nonbankruptcy \n     law. Thus, if a State provides for prejudgment or \n     postjudgment interest on support, such interest is included \n     in the definition of a domestic support obligation.\n       2. To be nondischargeable support, the obligation must be \n     owed to or recoverable by a ``spouse, former spouse, or child \n     of the debtor or such child's parent, legal guardian, or \n     responsible relative'' or the debt must be owed to a \n     governmental unit. As distinguished from former law as \n     interpreted by the courts, the debt no longer need be owed to \n     the person or entity filing the claim. It need only be \n     recoverable by such entity. This definition is meant to \n     preserve present statutory or decisional law affecting the \n     dischargeability of debts in the nature of support owed to \n     attorneys or other persons or entities providing assistance \n     to the creditor spouse and children in a domestic proceeding. \n     Nor is there any remaining requirement that the debt be \n     assigned to a government or recoverable under Title IV-D of \n     the Social Security Act for the debt to be excepted from \n     discharge. The debt need only be owed to or recoverable by a \n     governmental unit. Likewise, the debt does not become \n     dischargeable simply because the support was ordered to be \n     paid to the government or a nonparent. Support ordered to be \n     paid to a legal guardian or responsible relative is also not \n     dischargeable.\n       3. As under the former law, to be excepted from discharge \n     the debt must be ``in the nature of support.'' Unlike the \n     former law, however, a debt based upon assistance provided by \n     a governmental unit for the benefit of a spouse, former \n     spouse or child of the debtor, is now specifically included \n     as a debt in the nature of support. This classification \n     applies whether or not the debt incurred by the debtor is \n     specifically designated as support and whether or not the \n     spouse, former spouse or child has a separate legal right to \n     establish a support obligation.\n       4. Under former law the support debt had to made ``in \n     connection with a separation agreement, divorce decree, or \n     other order of a court of record.'' Therefore, it was \n     arguable that if the debt had not been reduced to an \n     agreement, decree or order on the date a petition for relief \n     was filed, it was not excepted from discharge. The new \n     definition of a domestic support obligation specifies to the \n     contrary that the debt may be established ``or subject to \n     establishment before or after an order for relief'' to \n     qualify as a nondischargeable debt.\n       5. Finally the definition of a domestic support obligation \n     continues to exclude support which has been assigned to a \n     nongovernmental entity, unless the assignment is merely made \n     for the purpose of collecting the debt. This definition \n     codifies existing case law.\n       Having created this definition of a ``domestic support \n     obligation,'' HR 2415 uses it in twenty specific places. In \n     so doing, HR 2415 generally treats support related debts \n     similarly, no matter how the debt arose or to whom the debt \n     is owed.\n     Section. 212. Priorities for claims for domestic support \n         obligations\n       All domestic support obligation debts are given a first \n     priority. Within that priority\n\n[[Page S11706]]\n\n     two categories of support debts are established. Support \n     debts owed directly to support recipients, as of the date of \n     the bankruptcy petition, are paid prior to debts owed or \n     assigned to the government. Therefore all claims filed as \n     priority 1(A) must be paid prior to claims filed as priority \n     1(B).\n       When, however, such claims are filed by a governmental unit \n     and that unit receives payments on the claim, the subsequent \n     application and distribution of moneys are governed not by \n     the claim as it existed on the petition date, but by \n     nonbankruptcy law applicable to such governmental units. \n     Thus, receipt of money claimed as a priority 1(A) debt may be \n     distributed by the government to reimburse itself for the \n     payment of public assistance if the creditor assigns that \n     debt to the government postpetition. Likewise, debts which \n     are assigned to the government prepetition and claimed as \n     priority 1(B) debts will be distributed directly to the \n     support obligee if the debt is no longer assigned as of the \n     date the government received the funds.\n       Other changes in distribution may also occur. If the \n     trustee pays a governmental entity on a claim in one month, \n     and the debtor owes but has not paid a support order accruing \n     in that month, the governmental unit may credit the payment \n     to the current month's obligation, not to the claim. The \n     governmental unit may also credit any payment received on \n     the claim against newly accrued postpetition judgment \n     interest, rather than against the principal portion of the \n     claim. The purpose of these rules relating to governmental \n     support claims is to allow the distribution of money \n     received as support in the same manner it would be \n     distributed if the debtor had not filed a bankruptcy \n     petition.\n     Section 213. Requirements to obtain confirmation and \n         discharge in cases involving domestic support obligations\n       Section 213 sets up four check points to ensure that \n     debtors are complying with their domestic support obligations \n     when they have filed a bankruptcy case under Chapters 11, 12, \n     and 13.\n       1. A case can be converted or dismissed at any time if the \n     debtor does not remain current in the payment of an on-going \n     support obligation. Under former law the Code did not \n     explicitly require such payments or mandate an early \n     termination of a plan when a debtor was not in compliance \n     with an on-going support order, although some courts used \n     their discretion to dismiss such cases for ``cause.'' HR 2415 \n     allows the court to convert or dismiss a Chapter 12 or 13 \n     plan for failure of the debtor to pay postpetition on-going \n     support.\n       2. To be confirmed a plan must provide for payment of all \n     past due priority claims for domestic support obligations. \n     The Code does, however, provide two exceptions. It allows a \n     creditor the option of accepting less than full payment under \n     the plan. It also allows a debtor to ``cram down'' a less \n     than full payment plan for priority support debts which are \n     assigned to a governmental entity, so long as the plan \n     provides for payment of all disposable income of the debtor \n     for the maximum five year period allowed for a plan in \n     Chapters 12 and 13. However, since these debts will not be \n     discharged in any event, the debtor will be given a \n     substantial incentive to propose and complete such a plan.\n       3. A plan under Chapters 11, 12, and 13 may not be \n     confirmed unless the debtor has remained current in the \n     payment of all support first becoming due postpetition. Nor \n     can a debtor in a Chapter 12 or 13 case obtain a discharge \n     unless all support becoming due postpetition has been paid. \n     These provisions are designed to be self-executing, at least \n     to the extent they do not require affirmative action on the \n     part of a support creditor to implement them. Payment of \n     domestic support obligation arrears, in order to receive a \n     discharge, is required only to the extent ``provided for by \n     the plan.'' Thus, agreements made at the time of confirmation \n     to accept less than full payment or the use of ``cram down'' \n     rights possessed by the debtor may allow the debtor to \n     receive a discharge without full payment of all prepetition \n     domestic support obligations. Of course, completion of such a \n     plan would not discharge any remaining domestic support \n     obligations, but would allow the debtor to be relieved from \n     other debts covered by the general discharge under the \n     relevant chapter.\n       4. HR 2415 allows, but does not require, the debtor to \n     include in a plan the payment of postpetition interest on a \n     nondischargeable debt if the debtor is able to do so after \n     paying other debts. This provision is a departure from former \n     law which did not allow a claim for interest, unless the \n     claim was secured, even though interest continued to accrue \n     on nondischargeable debts. As a result, even if the debtor \n     provided for full payment of the prepetition support debt, \n     this debtor would be left at the end of the plan with a \n     remaining debt for interest. Accordingly, while a debtor will \n     often not have sufficient income to make postpetition \n     interest payments, the debtor may wish, if feasible, to make \n     such payments in order to obtain a fresh start at the \n     completion of the plan.\n     Section 214. Exceptions to automatic stay in domestic support \n         obligation proceedings\n       HR 2415 also adds additional exceptions to the automatic \n     stay. Under section 362(a) various activities of creditors \n     are stayed once a bankruptcy petition has been filed. Under \n     former law there were exceptions to the automatic stay which \n     permitted the establishment of paternity, and the \n     establishment or modification of a support order but they did \n     not deal with a number of other domestic issues. In addition, \n     under former law the automatic stay did not apply to the \n     collection of support so long as it was collected from \n     property which was not property of the bankruptcy estate. \n     Since property of the estate included debtor's income in \n     Chapter 12 and 13 cases, at least until confirmation of the \n     plan, a support creditor had no way of obtaining either on-\n     going support or prepetition support arrearages, unless the \n     obligor/debtor paid these debts voluntarily or the creditor \n     obtained relief from the stay. These amendments deal with \n     both issues. They include the following:\n       1. The existing exceptions are amended to refer to the new \n     definition of a domestic support obligation. Additional \n     language is added to clarify that certain other family-\n     related matters such as custody, divorce, and domestic \n     violence proceedings may continue to be pursued without \n     obtaining relief from the automatic stay except to the extent \n     a divorce proceeding seeks to deal with the division of \n     estate property. Property division issues in a divorce are \n     not intended to impinge on the exclusive jurisdiction of the \n     bankruptcy court over estate assets.\n       2. Section 362(b)(2)(C) is added to provide for the \n     withholding of income from property of the debtor or from \n     property of the estate for the payment of a domestic support \n     obligation. In this provision Congress has divested the \n     bankruptcy court of exclusive jurisdiction over the \n     bankruptcy estate to the extent a debtor's wages are estate \n     property. Under prior law such withholding would have been \n     allowed only if it were determined that the debtor's income \n     was no longer property of the estate. This section \n     specifically allows the use of estate property to pay support \n     through the wage withholding process without any bankruptcy \n     imposed limitation. The purpose of this provision is to allow \n     income withholding to be implemented or to continue after a \n     Chapter 11, 12 or 13 petition is filed, just as it would if a \n     Chapter 7 petition were filed. The income withholding \n     provisions were enacted to allow compliance with procedures \n     mandated in the Child Support Enforcement Program, Social \n     Security Act, Title IV-D. Income withholding applies to the \n     collection of on-going support and support arrearages. It may \n     be implemented by court order or through an administrative \n     process.\n       3. Use of other support enforcement techniques are also \n     excepted from the reach of the automatic stay. Under the \n     amendment, the withholding, suspension, or restriction of \n     drivers' licenses, professional and occupational licenses, \n     and recreational licenses under state law as provided in the \n     Social Security Act is not stayed. Likewise, the automatic \n     stay does not bar the reporting of overdue support to a \n     consumer reporting agency as required by the Social Security \n     Act. Also excepted from the automatic stay is the \n     interception of tax refunds as required by the Social \n     Security Act. Thus, refunds which are payable to the debtor \n     by the State taxing authorities or the IRS, and even refunds \n     which the debtor intends to include or includes in his or her \n     bankruptcy estate, may be seized to satisfy support \n     obligations as required or allowed under State and federal \n     law without requiring relief from the automatic stay. \n     Finally, under the enforcement of medical support obligations \n     as mandated by the Social Security Act is not stayed.\n     Section. 215. Nondischargeability of certain debts for \n         alimony, maintenance, and support\n       This section makes all domestic support obligations non-\n     dischargeable. The most significant effect of this change is \n     that all debts owed to a governmental entity which are \n     derived from payments by the government to meet needs of the \n     debtor's family for support and maintenance are excepted from \n     discharge. This change will nullify the holdings cited in \n     footnotes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7. By amending 523(a)(5) and (15), \n     all ``domestic support obligations'' as broadly defined in \n     new section 101(14A) of the Bankruptcy Code are excepted from \n     discharge.\n       Section 215 also makes nondischargeable all non-support \n     debts incurred in connection with a divorce or separation. \n     Previously such debts may have been determined to be \n     nondischargeable only if the support creditor brought a \n     timely proceeding to determine the dischargeability of the \n     debt and proved not only that the debtor had the ability to \n     pay the debt but that discharging the debt would result in a \n     benefit to the creditor which outweighed the detriment to the \n     debtor. This provision gives debts resulting from the \n     division of property the same protection from discharge as \n     support debts.\n     Section. 216. Continued liability of property\n       Section 522(c)(1) of the Code, as amended by this section, \n     incorporates the new definition of a domestic support \n     obligation into the existing provision which subjects \n     otherwise exempt assets to debts for nondischargeable taxes \n     and support obligations. This section expands this principle \n     to preempt state law and specifically provides that under \n     federal law such exempt property must be made available to \n     satisfy a domestic support obligation, notwithstanding state \n     law to the contrary. The purpose of this provision is to \n     nullify the Fifth Circuit en banc holding in Matter of Davis, \n     170 F.3d 475 (5th Cir. 1999), and to reinstate the holding of \n     the original Fifth Circuit panel.\n\n[[Page S11707]]\n\n       Section 522(f)(1) allows a debtor to avoid judicial liens \n     on exempt property, but contains an exception for liens which \n     secured unassigned child support. This section extends this \n     exception to domestic support obligations. Therefore, any \n     judicial lien placed on the debtor's property which secures a \n     support related obligation, whether assigned or not, may not \n     be avoided even though the lien impairs the exemption to \n     which the debtor would otherwise have been entitled.\n     Section 217. Protection of domestic support claims against \n         preferential transfer motions\n       Section 547(c)(7) previously barred the trustee from \n     recovering, as a preferential transfer, bona fide payments of \n     an unassigned support obligations. This section extends this \n     exception to all domestic support obligations.\n     Section 218. Disposable income defined\n       This section adds language to the disposable income test \n     under chapters 12 and 13. The language added to chapter 13 \n     simply repeats language already added by section 102 of this \n     Act.\n     Section 219. Collection of child support\n       This section improves the information available to child \n     support and alimony claimants when the person who owes \n     support or alimony files for bankruptcy. In those cases, the \n     chapter 7, 11, 12 or 13 trustee is to provide both the \n     support claimant and the State child support collection \n     agency with information about the filing, and inform the \n     claimant about the availability of free or low cost \n     collection services through the State agency. Additionally, \n     when the debtor is discharged, the trustee is to notify the \n     claimant and the State agency of the fact of the discharge \n     and certain information about the location of the debtor. If \n     a debt has been determined to be nondischargeable or is \n     reaffirmed, the trustee is also to notify the claimant and \n     the State agency of the name of the creditor affected. \n     Creditors whose names are the subject of a notification are \n     required, when asked, to provide the last known address of \n     the debtor.\n     Section 220. Nondischargeability of certain educational \n         benefits and loans\n       This provision makes certain student loans offered by non-\n     governmental creditors nondischargeable.\n     Section 221. Amendment to discourage abusive bankruptcy \n         filings\n       This provision inserts strong new regulation of bankruptcy \n     petition preparers. It is intended that this regulation be \n     strongly enforced.\n     Section 222. Sense of Congress\n       The sense of Congress is expressed that States should \n     develop courses on personal finances for use in primary and \n     secondary education. Consumer credit has become widely \n     available in our economy. Congress considers it to be of the \n     greatest importance that educational programs like those \n     sponsored and promoted by the Jump Start Coalition of \n     governmental and private entities be encouraged. By educating \n     children when they are young in the basics of personal \n     financial management, inappropriate use of consumer credit \n     can be reduced, and better ability of average citizens to \n     manage financial crises can be promoted.\n     Section 223. Additional amendments\n       This section provides a new 10th priority under section 507 \n     of the Bankruptcy Code for claims based on driving while \n     intoxicated under influence of drugs.\n     Section 224. Protection of retirement savings\n       This provision broadens the exemptions for retirement \n     savings available under present law to cover all forms of \n     pensions and savings plans allowed to be exempt from current \n     income taxation under the Internal Revenue Code. It provides \n     protection from creditors' claims for tax-favored retirement \n     plans or arrangements which are not already protected from \n     creditors' claims under current law. The section carries no \n     implication that the protection from the bankruptcy estate \n     afforded to plans by virtue of section 541 of the Bankruptcy \n     Code as applied in the Shumate decision, and the line of \n     cases following that decision, or by any provision of the \n     Bankruptcy Code or other state or federal law that protect \n     plan assets from creditors, is in anyway reduced. This \n     amendment to the Bankruptcy Code is in accordance with \n     longstanding Congressional policy of conserving and \n     preserving plan assets for use as retirement security for \n     participants in their retirement years. As such, it is \n     intended to be in addition to the protections provided by \n     current law and is not in any way intended to supplant or \n     supercede protections which exist in current law.\n       Section 224 covers plans that have received determination \n     letters from the Internal Revenue Service as well as plans, \n     such as public plans, that have not received such letters but \n     are intended to be operated in accordance with ERISA and or \n     Internal Revenue Code, as applicable. It also covers plan \n     assets in transit such as when they are directly transferred \n     by a plan administrator to a plan sponsored by another \n     employer or to an Individual Retirement Account. The same \n     protection is provided when the plan assets are distributed \n     directly to an employee upon termination of employment and \n     within 60 days of the distribution of the employee transfers \n     the distributed amount in another qualified retirement plan \n     or into an Individual Retirement Account.\n       In addition, the Section provides that if there is an \n     outstanding pension plan loan to a participant at the time of \n     bankruptcy filing such loan is not to be discharged or a stay \n     issued on any withholdings from the wages of the debtor that \n     are being used to make level repayments of the loan. A stay \n     of the withholding would result in a default and under the \n     ERISA rules cause the amount of the unpaid balance to become \n     taxable income. The ensuing tax liability would take \n     precedence over unsecured creditors' claims. A plan loan is \n     actually a special nontaxable distribution which the \n     participant is expected to return to the plan.\n       Under the asset limitation provision of this section, the \n     maximum amount exempt for bankruptcy purposes in an IRA or \n     Roth/IRA, other than a simplified employee pension under \n     section 408(k) of the Internal Revenue Code or a simple \n     retirement account under 408(p) of the Internal Revenue Code, \n     is limited to $1,000,000, excluding rollover contributions \n     under 402(c), 402(e)(6), 403(a)(4), and 403(a)(5) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code, as well as earnings thereon. The \n     $1,000,000 maximum amount is subject to adjustment under \n     section 104 of the Code. In addition, the $1,000,000 maximum \n     amount is subject to increase if the interests of justice so \n     require.\n     Section 225. Protection of Education Savings\n       Section 225 protects certain educational savings in the \n     event of bankruptcy. Qualified State Tuition Programs \n     represent a joint effort by the federal government and the \n     states to encourage saving for post-secondary education. \n     Congress has expressed a clear interest in encouraging the \n     post-secondary education of children by permitting \n     individuals to save exclusively to cover the expenses of \n     higher education through Qualified State Tuition Programs on \n     a tax-favored basis. However, Congressional interest in \n     promoting saving for post-secondary education would be \n     frustrated if accounts in Qualified State Tuition Programs \n     are pulled into the bankruptcy estate of the debtor because \n     of certain rights of the donor.\n       Therefore, with certain exceptions, section 225 excludes \n     from a debtor's bankruptcy estate funds and earnings on such \n     funds contributed to an account established pursuant to a \n     qualified state tuition program under Section 529 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (``IRC''). The \n     funds in these accounts may be used for qualified higher \n     education expenses (including tuition, fees, books, supplies \n     and room and board) of a designated beneficiary of the debtor \n     and cannot be transferred to any person other than a \n     qualified family member without adverse federal tax and other \n     consequences. Section 225 would only permit exclusion from \n     the bankruptcy estate funds in qualified state tuition \n     programs for a restricted group of designated beneficiaries, \n     limited to children and grandchildren (including step-\n     children and step-grandchildren). The provision recognizes \n     that adopted and foster children fall into this category and \n     that ``step-grandchild'' is intended to include both the \n     stepchild of the debtor's child as well as the child of the \n     debtor's stepchild.\n       This provision makes clear that, subject to certain \n     requirements, contributions to these accounts are not to be \n     pulled into the debtor's estate for bankruptcy purposes. All \n     contributions and earnings thereon are thus protected except: \n     (1) contributions made to a program less than 365 days before \n     the date of filing the bankruptcy petition; or (2) \n     contributions in excess of $5000 made to a program less than \n     720 days before filing the bankruptcy petition.\n       Section 225 includes similar provisions extending \n     protection to funds placed in education individual retirement \n     accounts, as defined in Section 530 of the Internal \n     Revenue Code.\n     Sections 226-229. Debtor's bill of rights\n       These four sections, derived from federal law regulating \n     credit repair agencies, provide for new disclosures and \n     restrictions on practices with which bankruptcy petition \n     preparers, attorneys and anyone else who meets the definition \n     of a debt relief agency must comply. Congress was concerned \n     that debtors who file bankruptcy be better informed about the \n     nature and scope of bankruptcy, the different remedies that \n     are available, and the significance of the step they are \n     taking, so that they can both better evaluate it, better \n     understand what is going to happen, and better protect \n     themselves. It is also the intent that debtors be better able \n     to negotiate with their attorneys about fees and services \n     provided. For example, provisions require that debtors be \n     clearly informed about what services an attorney will provide \n     the debtor and for what fee.\n       Bankruptcy petition preparers must comply with these \n     provisions as well as those imposed under the Code and \n     section 221 of HR 2415.\n       Section 226. Definitions\n       This section defines various terms, including who is an \n     ``assisted person'', what is ``bankruptcy assistance'', and \n     who is a ``debt relief agency''. It is intended that these \n     provisions be broadly interpreted since they define the scope \n     of the protections which debtors receive under the related \n     provisions. Authors, publishers, distributors or sellers of \n     works subject to copyright protection when acting solely as \n     such an author, publisher, distributor or seller are excluded \n     from the definition. Thus an attorney who writes a book on \n     how to file bankruptcy is not a debt relief agency when \n     promoting or selling the copyrighted book. But when that same \n     attorney represents debtors filing petitions, the attorney is \n     a debt relief agency because no\n\n[[Page S11708]]\n\n     longer acting in the capacity of an author, even if he gives \n     his clients a copy of the book.\n       Section 227. Restrictions on Debt Relief Agencies\n       This section creates a new section 526 of the Code which \n     proscribes certain practices by debt relief agencies and \n     provides for enforcement of violations of this section and \n     new Code sections 527 and 528.\n       Enforcement is provided for any violations of new Code \n     section 526, 527 or 528. Intentional or negligent failures to \n     comply with any requirements of the three sections permit the \n     debtor to obtain restitution of any fees or charges made by \n     the agency, as well as actual damages and reasonable \n     attorneys fees. The same damages are available for \n     intentional or negligent disregard of the material \n     requirements of the Bankruptcy Code or Rules. Any contract \n     for bankruptcy assistance that does not comply with the \n     material requirements imposed is void, except that the \n     assisted person can enforce it. State attorney generals are \n     also empowered to enforce the provisions of these sections, \n     and the United States District Court are granted concurrent \n     jurisdiction of any such enforcement proceeding. The court, \n     the United States Trustee or the debtor may also seek \n     injunctive relief or civil penalties against intentional \n     violators or those with a clear and consistent pattern or \n     practice of violation of any of these sections.\n       The section also provides that its requirements in new \n     sections 527 and 528 do not excuse any person from complying \n     with State laws unless the State law is inconsistent with \n     those sections. Also specifically preserved from preemption \n     are any practice of law requirements under State or federal \n     law if they conflict with the requirements of sections 526, \n     527 or 528 added to the Code. It is not expected that any of \n     these new sections will impose upon debt relief agencies \n     requirements that would force them to violate applicable \n     unauthorized practice of law restrictions. For example, \n     providing the disclosures under section 527 should not be the \n     practice of law, since the content of the disclosure is set \n     by federal law and does not involve giving a debtor advice. \n     For similar reasons, the additional information debt relief \n     agencies are required by section 527(c) with respect to \n     valuation of assets, completion of the list of creditors and \n     exempt property should not involve giving legal advice. \n     However, in the event applicable unauthorized practice rules \n     proscribe non-lawyers from providing such information, the \n     provision states that it is only required to the extent \n     permitted by nonbankruptcy law.\n       Section 228. Disclosures\n       This section creates new Bankruptcy Code section 527 which \n     requires a debt relief agency to deliver to an assisted \n     person required disclosures either described or set forth in \n     the section. Within 3 business days after the agency first \n     offers to provide bankruptcy assistance in a written, face to \n     face, telephone, internet or similar solicitation or contact, \n     the agency must provide, the agency must provide a clear and \n     conspicuous written notice which states that the information \n     the assisted person provides in the bankruptcy proceeding \n     must be complete, accurate and truthful, assets and \n     liabilities must be completely and accurately disclosed and \n     assets must be valued and income and expenses stated after \n     reasonable inquiry, and that information provided may be \n     audited. Before the commencement of the case, the agency must \n     provide the debtor with the notice required under section \n     342(b)(1) (as amended by this Act) and an additional \n     disclosure set forth in the section which explains the \n     bankruptcy process and relief and what the debtor can expect. \n     The agency must also instruct the debtor in how to value \n     assets, how to complete the list of creditors, and how to \n     determine exempt property. Record keeping requirements are \n     imposed upon the agency to keep copies of the notices \n     required under this section for a period of 2 years after \n     delivery. It is expected that the Bankruptcy Rules will \n     provide model forms of disclosure and specify further the \n     time and manner in which these disclosures will be made.\n       Section 229. Requirements for debt relief agencies.\n       This section creates a new section 528 of the Code that \n     regulates agencies' contracting and advertising. The agency \n     is required to execute a written contract with the assisted \n     person within 5 business days (but before the petition is \n     filed) of providing any bankruptcy assistance, and provide \n     the person with an executed copy. If the agency does not \n     execute a contract within that period of time, it must \n     terminate its relationship with the assisted person.\n       The agency must also disclose in any advertisement that the \n     services or benefits are with respect to bankruptcy relief. \n     Congress is specifically concerned that debtors understand \n     the services they are being offered involve bankruptcy. This \n     section is intended to prevent agencies from describing their \n     services ambiguously so as to obscure that the assisted \n     person will be obtaining bankruptcy relief. A standard form \n     of disclosure that the services are with respect to \n     bankruptcy relief is set forth in the section.\n\n\n                Title III--Discouraging Bankruptcy Abuse\n\n     Section 301. Reinforcement of the fresh start\n       Present law makes nondischargeable any fee or charge \n     imposed by a court for filing a case, motion, complaint or \n     appeal or related costs or expenses. This section restricts \n     the provision so that it applies only to matters filed by a \n     prisoner.\n     Section 302. Discouraging bad faith repeat filings\n       This section is intended to strongly limit the practice of \n     using bankruptcy filings and the automatic stay that arises \n     under section 362 to abuse the bankruptcy process. Debtors \n     who file bankruptcy only once in a one year period will not \n     be affected. However, upon a second filing within one year, \n     the automatic stay will terminate with respect to the debtor \n     or the debtor's property on the 30th day after the second \n     filing. The debtor can seek to have the automatic stay \n     continued by filing a motion and demonstrating that the \n     second filing is in good faith, but there is a presumption \n     that under certain circumstances the second filing is not in \n     good faith.\n       Upon the third or an additional filing within a one year \n     period, the automatic stay does not go into effect at all. On \n     motion made within 30 days of the third filing, the court may \n     order the stay to take effect as to some or all creditors. \n     The party in interest must demonstrate that the third filing \n     is in good faith, and there is a presumption that under \n     certain circumstances the third filing is not in good faith.\n       Clear and convincing evidence must be presented in order to \n     rebut the presumptions which arise both with respect to the \n     second and third or later filings.\n       Conduct covered by this section may also provide an \n     appropriate ground to dismiss a chapter 7 under section \n     707(b) as revised by HR 2415.\n     Section 303. Curbing abusive filings\n       This provision authorizes in rem orders to prevent abusive \n     use of bankruptcy filings. The bankruptcy court is authorized \n     to order that the automatic stay be lifted as to a secured \n     creditor with respect to the current and all subsequent cases \n     to which the automatic stay would otherwise apply if the \n     court finds that the filing of a bankruptcy was either part \n     of a scheme to delay, hinder, and defraud creditors by means \n     of transferring all or part of an interest in real property \n     without the secured creditor's consent or court approval, or \n     involved multiple bankruptcy filings affecting real property.\n       Once such an order is issued, it can be recorded by anyone \n     in the real property records affecting the real property \n     involved, and recording agencies must accept for recording \n     and record and index any such order so that it will be notice \n     to third parties. Such a recorded order is notice to third \n     parties for 2 years after recording. The court can reimpose \n     the automatic stay in a subsequent case after appropriate \n     notice and hearing if good cause or changed circumstances are \n     shown.\n       In addition, the automatic stay does not apply at all to \n     prevent acts to enforce security interests in real property \n     if the debtor is ineligible for bankruptcy under section \n     109(g) or the filing violates a court order in a previous \n     case baring the debtor from refiling.\n     Section 304. Debtor retention of personal property security\n       This provision is intended to prevent ``ride through'' in \n     the situations to which it applies. A ``ride through'' is the \n     debtor's retention of collateral and maintenance of current \n     payment obligations over the creditor's objection without \n     reaffirming. This section and section 305, taken together, \n     are intended to reverse the results of such cases as Capital \n     Communications Fed. Credit Union v. Boodrow, 126 F. 3d 43 (2d \n     Cir. 1997) cert denied, 522 U.S. 1117 (1998).\n       Under this provision, an individual debtor is not permitted \n     to retain possession of personal property subject to a \n     security interest securing the purchase price of that \n     personal property unless the debtor enters into a \n     reaffirmation agreement which becomes effective under section \n     524(c) of the Code, or redeems the property under section 722 \n     of the Code. The debtor is given 45 days after the first \n     meeting a creditors to take one of those two steps or to \n     relinquish possession of the personal property to the \n     creditor. If the debtor fails to complete one of the steps \n     within the prescribed period, the automatic stay is \n     terminated with respect to the property whether it is \n     property of the estate or not, and the creditor may take \n     whatever action as to the property as is permitted by \n     applicable nonbankruptcy law. Although the automatic stay \n     ends upon the expiration of the 45 day period, a creditor is \n     free to allow a debtor to retain possession of collateral and \n     accept continued payments by not taking any actions to \n     collect, since this provision is for the creditor's benefit.\n       However, the trustee can bring a motion before the end of \n     the 45 day period asserting that the property is of \n     consequential value or benefit to the estate. If the court \n     finds that the retention of the property will benefit \n     creditors significantly, orders appropriate adequate \n     protection of the creditor's interest, and orders the debtor \n     to deliver the property to the trustee, the court may \n     extend application of the stay for a further reasonable \n     time to permit the trustee to obtain the benefit for the \n     estate.\n       The section also amends section 722 to make it absolutely \n     clear that the full, complete and immediate cash payment of \n     the redemption amount to the creditor is necessary for there \n     to be a redemption. Installment redemptions are not \n     permitted.\n\n[[Page S11709]]\n\n     Section 305. Relief from the automatic stay when the debtor \n         does not complete intended surrender of consumer debt \n         collateral\n       Like the previous section, this section is also intended to \n     prevent ``ride through'' with respect to any property the \n     section covers. Any personal property of the estate or of the \n     debtor securing a claim or subject to an unexpired lease is \n     covered by the section, and in certain instances creditors \n     will be protected by both this section and the previous \n     section, in which case the provisions can be applied \n     cumulatively.\n       The section provides that the automatic stay terminates if \n     the debtor fails to timely (1) file a statement of intention \n     covering the property indicating that the debtor will either \n     redeem the property under section 722 of the Code, reaffirm \n     the debt it secures under section 524(c) of the Code, or \n     assume an unexpired lease under section 365(p) of the Code \n     (as amended by HR 2415), or (2) take the action specified in \n     the statement of intention (unless the statement of intention \n     specifies reaffirmation and the creditor refuses to reaffirm \n     on the original contract terms). Although the automatic stay \n     ends upon the expiration of the period for taking action, a \n     creditor is free to allow a debtor to retain possession of \n     collateral and accept continued payments by not taking any \n     actions to collect, since this provision is for the \n     creditor's benefit.\n       However, as with the previous section, the trustee can \n     bring a motion before the end of the period set by section \n     521(a)(2) asserting that the property is of consequential \n     value or benefit to the estate, and on similar findings, the \n     court may extend application of the stay for a further \n     reasonable time to permit the trustee to obtain the benefit \n     for the estate.\n       In addition, this section validates certain clauses which \n     have the effect of placing the debtor in default by reason of \n     the occurrence, pendency or existence of a proceeding under \n     this title, or the insolvency of the debtor.\n     Section 306. Giving secured creditors fair treatment in \n         chapter 13\n       This provision changes the relationship of secured \n     creditors and debtors in certain situations arising in \n     chapter 13 proceedings.\n       First, in order for a debtor's plan to be confirmed, it \n     must provide that a creditor's lien will continue until the \n     earlier of payment of the underlying debt under nonbankruptcy \n     law or the grant of discharge under section 1328. Nothing in \n     this provision is intended to alter other requirements for \n     confirmation. Thus if a secured debt will not be fully paid \n     before the end of the plan, this provision does not authorize \n     a plan to provide that the lien terminate upon discharge.\n       Moreover, the plan must provide that if the case is \n     dismissed or converted without completion of the plan, the \n     creditor will retains the lien to the full extent permitted \n     by nonbankruptcy law. It is intended that any benefits \n     debtors obtain under a plan as against their secured \n     creditors will be lost unless the debtor fully completes the \n     plan. In the event a debtor's case is discharged under the \n     hardship discharge provisions without completion of the plan, \n     the creditor's lien nonetheless survives unaffected by the \n     bankruptcy to the extent permitted by nonbankruptcy law.\n       Second, the extent to which claims secured by purchase \n     money security interests in personal property are subject to \n     cramdown to fair market value is limited. It is intended that \n     cramdown not apply to any collateral described in this \n     provision during the periods of time specified, and that the \n     amount of the claim which must be paid under the plan be the \n     full amount of the claim allowed under section 502 without \n     application of section 506. Thus, if the debt was incurred \n     within 5 years prior to filing and the collateral consists of \n     a motor vehicle acquired for the personal use of the debtor, \n     the value of the collateral cannot be reduced to the current \n     fair market value and therefore the amount the plan must pay \n     under section 1325(5)(B)(ii) over the duration of the plan \n     must be the amount of the allowed claim under section 502 \n     rather than the allowed secured claim under section 506. A \n     similar result applies for any other personal property if the \n     debt was incurred during the one year period preceding the \n     filing.\n       Third, terms used in section 1322(b)(2) which limits \n     cramdown of certain real estate mortgages are defined to make \n     clear that a debt secured by real estate which is the \n     debtor's principal residence includes any 1 to 4 family \n     structure, including incidental property, without regard to \n     whether the structure is attached to real estate, and \n     includes condominium or cooperative units and mobile or \n     manufactures homes or trailers. Incidental property includes \n     any property commonly conveyed with a principal residence in \n     the area where it is located.\n       This provision is intended to reject those cases which have \n     allowed cramdown of real estate mortgages on the grounds that \n     the security property is not a ``principal residence'' or \n     covers property which is not real estate, simply because the \n     property included multi-family housing, or the mortgage \n     encumbered incidental property, or covered less traditional \n     forms of housing such as condominiums, coops or mobile homes \n     or trailers.\n     Section 307. Domiciliary requirements for exemptions\n       This provision limits the state exemptions which debtors \n     can enjoy in bankruptcy when they have moved into a state \n     within two years of filing. If a debtor has lived for 2 or \n     more years in a State immediately prior to filing, the debtor \n     can use the exemptions allowed by the state where the debtor \n     resides under section 522 of the Code. If the debtor has \n     lived in a state for less than 2 years at the time of filing, \n     then the debtor must use the State exemptions of the State \n     where the debtor lived 2 years prior to filing if the debtor \n     lived there all of the 180 days which precede that 2 year \n     period. If the debtor lived in more than one State during \n     that 180 day period, the State exemptions of the State \n     where the debtor lived the longest during that period will \n     control.\n       If a debtor has to use a particular State's exemptions, the \n     law of that State also determines whether the debtor can \n     elect to use the federal exemptions available under section \n     522(d) of the Code.\n     Section 308. Residency requirement\n       Any home equity acquired within the 7 years prior to filing \n     is not exempt if: (1) such equity was attributable to \n     property that the debtor disposed of with the intent to \n     hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor; and (2) such property \n     was not an exempt asset. For example, if a debtor disposes of \n     cash, a non-exempt asset, by exchanging that cash for a \n     residence with the intention of delaying the payment of a \n     creditor, such residence would not be exempt from the \n     bankruptcy estate. It is the intent of Congress that it \n     should be easier to prove intent to hinder or delay than to \n     prove intent to defraud.\n     Section 309. Protecting secured creditors in chapter 13 cases\n       This provision adjusts the relationship of debtors to \n     lessors and secured creditors in bankruptcy proceedings.\n       First, it amends section 348(f) to assure that when a \n     debtor converts a case from chapter 13 to chapter 7, the \n     debtor does not retain any benefits of the chapter 13 case \n     with respect to any secured creditor, unless the full amount \n     of the secured creditor's claim determined under \n     nonbankruptcy law has been paid in full, and unless a \n     prebankruptcy default has been fully cured prior to \n     conversion. If a debtor converts from chapter 13 to another \n     chapter and then converts to chapter 7, the courts should \n     impose similar limitations.\n       Second, provision is made to allow a debtor and creditor to \n     arrange for the debtor to assume a personal property lease \n     rejected or not timely assumed by a trustee. On the other \n     hand, in a chapter 11 or 13 proceeding, if the plan does not \n     provide for assumption of the lease, the lease is deemed \n     rejected as of the conclusion of the hearing on confirmation \n     and the automatic stay automatically terminates.\n       Third, in a chapter 13 proceeding, a debtor's plan must \n     provide that the debtor will make monthly payments if there \n     are to be periodic payments to a personal property secured \n     creditor or personal property lessor receiving distributions \n     under the plan, and those payments must at least be in an \n     amount sufficient to provide adequate protection. This \n     provision, however, is not intended to lessen any of the \n     other protections of secured creditors or lessors provided in \n     the Bankruptcy Code.\n       In addition, debtors are required to continue to make \n     payments to creditors holding claims secured by personal \n     property and to personal property lessors from 30 days after \n     the order for relief. These payments are to be made directly \n     to the creditor or lessor, and the amount of plan payments \n     which the debtor must make can be reduced by the amount paid \n     to the creditors or lessors. The debtor must provide an \n     accounting of these payments to the chapter 13 trustee.\n     Section 310. Luxury goods\n       This section provides that certain debts are presumed to be \n     nondischargeable under section 523(a)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy \n     Code. Under section 523(a)(2)(A), a debt is nondischargeable \n     when it is incurred, among other things, by fraud. For \n     example, fraud can occur when a cardholder misrepresents his \n     or her intentions by using a credit card when the objective \n     facts show that the cardholder did not or could not intend to \n     repay. This bill provides that if a debtor incurs debts to a \n     single creditor aggregating for purchases on a credit card of \n     more than $250 for luxury goods or services within 90 days of \n     filing for bankruptcy, such debt is presumed to be \n     nondischargeable. This provision recognizes that debtors may \n     use open end credit to purchase goods and services necessary \n     for the support of the debtor shortly before bankruptcy, \n     while identifying presumptively abusive behavior which \n     warrants making the debt nondischargeable such as purchasing \n     a significant amounts of items or services not necessary for \n     the support of the debtor (i.e. luxury goods and services).\n       A related provision is included with regard to cash \n     advances. Cash advances under open-end credit plans \n     aggregating more than $750 within 70 days of filing for \n     bankruptcy are presumed to be nondischargeable. This language \n     is carefully drafted to require the aggregation of all cash \n     advances within 70 days of filing, even if they involve more \n     than one creditor. Furthermore, there is no requirement to \n     demonstrate that the cash advances were for ``luxury goods'' \n     since such a requirement would be virtually impossible to \n     fulfill given the difficulty of accounting for cash. The \n     behavior itself is sufficient indicia of abuse.\n     Section 311. Automatic stay\n       This section provides that the automatic stay under section \n     362 will not apply in several situations in which residential \n     tenants\n\n[[Page S11710]]\n\n     file for bankruptcy. First, the automatic stay will not bar \n     the continuation of an eviction action pending when the \n     debtor files for relief. Second, eviction proceedings \n     commenced after filing are not barred by the automatic stay \n     if the lease has terminated before or after filing of \n     bankruptcy. Third, the automatic stay also will not bar \n     eviction proceedings based on endangement to property or \n     person or the use of illegal drugs, or to any transfer that \n     is not avoidable under sections 544 or 549 of the Code.\n     Section 312. Extension of period between bankruptcy \n         discharges\n       The period of time which must elapse between bankruptcies \n     is increased by this provision. When a chapter 7 proceeding \n     is involved, the period is increased from six to eight \n     years. Furthermore, a chapter 13 discharge cannot be \n     granted if the debtor received a discharge under any \n     chapter of title 11 within 5 years of the order for relief \n     in the chapter 13 case.\n     Section 313. Definition of household goods\n       Section 522(f) of title 11 permits a debtor to void a non-\n     purchase money security interest in certain categories of \n     goods if the property subject to the security interest is \n     otherwise exempt in the debtor's case. One of the categories \n     is ``household goods''. This section is intended to clarify \n     what this term means so that there can be a nationwide, \n     uniform standard for what can be included in this category, \n     and so that debtors and creditors alike can know whether a \n     loan is truly secured or unsecured. It is expected that the \n     additional clarity will assist debtors in obtaining the \n     lowest price available for this type of secured credit.\n     Section 314. Debt incurred to pay nondischargeable debts\n       If a claim arises from payment of a tax to a governmental \n     unit other than the United States and the tax that was paid \n     would be nondischargeable under section 524(a)(1), then the \n     debt incurred to pay the tax is also nondischargeable.\n     Section 315. Notice to creditors\n       This section changes the requirements for providing notice \n     to creditors and also changes what information they must \n     provide in the schedules or otherwise as part of a bankruptcy \n     filing.\n       Notice.--This section is intended to ensure that creditors \n     receive actual, meaningful, and timely notice of bankruptcy \n     filings.\n       In order to ensure proper processing by a creditor, debtors \n     will need to include the account number in any required \n     notice to a creditor with respect to any debt owed to such \n     creditor. Furthermore, any notice required to be given by the \n     debtor to the creditor must be done so at an address \n     specified by the creditor. Creditors will be required to \n     include the account number and appropriate address in the \n     last two communications supplied to the debtor within the 90-\n     day period prior to filing for bankruptcy. However, if any \n     legal requirement impedes the creditor's ability to \n     communicate with the debtor at any point during the 90-day \n     period prior to filing, the creditor's burden will be \n     satisfied if the appropriate information was included on its \n     last two communications with the debtor. For purposes of this \n     section, the creditor's communications with the debtor are \n     those which deal specifically with an individual debt. \n     ``Communications'' do not include promotional material or \n     other communications that do not pertain specifically to a \n     debtor's debt to the creditor.\n       Language in the Bankruptcy Code which states that failure \n     to include the specified information in a notice does not \n     invalidate the legal effect of such notice is deleted.\n       Furthermore, if a creditor in an individual chapter 7 or 13 \n     case has specified an address for notice by filing a \n     statement to that effect with the court, the court and the \n     debtor are required to use such an address starting five days \n     after receiving the address. A creditor may file a notice \n     address with the court to be used generally by the court, \n     parties in interest and the debtor to provide notice to the \n     creditor in all cases under chapters 7 and 13. In the event a \n     creditor has provided different notice addresses by more than \n     one of the permitted methods, a debtor may use any one of \n     them, except that a notice address filed in a particular case \n     shall control.\n       Notices which are not sent to the appropriate address as \n     specified by the creditor are not effective until the notice \n     is brought to the creditor's attention. If the creditor has \n     designated an entity to be responsible for receiving notices \n     concerning bankruptcy cases and has established reasonable \n     procedures so that these notices will be delivered to such \n     entity, a notice will not be deemed to have been received by \n     the creditor until it has been received by the designated \n     entity. Sanctions for violation of the automatic stay under \n     section 362 of the Code or for the failure to comply with the \n     turnover provisions in sections 542 and 543 of the Code may \n     not be imposed if a creditor has not received proper notice.\n       Tax Return Information.--The section also requires debtors \n     to provide certain tax return information. By no later than 7 \n     days before the date first set for the first meeting of \n     creditors, a debtor must provide the trustee, without any \n     prior request, the debtor's tax return or transcript, or the \n     case will be dismissed unless the debtor can show that the \n     failure to file a return is due to circumstances beyond the \n     control of the debtor. Such circumstances would include that \n     the debtor did not file a return for the period required, but \n     not that the debtor could not find the return unless the \n     debtor in addition showed that a significant, diligent and \n     timely effort had been made to obtain at least the transcript \n     of the return from the Internal Revenue Service and it was \n     not forthcoming. A transcript is a computer generated line by \n     line statement of debtor supplied information with respect to \n     a tax return which the Internal Revenue Service will provide \n     any tax return filer on request.\n       Once such information is provided the trustee, creditors in \n     chapter 7 and 13 cases can obtain it by request to the \n     trustee or through the procedure set forth for creditors to \n     obtain copies of the petition and schedules from the court. \n     It is intended that the trustee and the court will make \n     arrangements for the tax return information the debtor \n     provides to be made available to the court to satisfy \n     creditor requests. Creditors can also request the tax return \n     directly, in which case the debtor must provide it directly \n     to the creditor or the case will be dismissed, subject to \n     limitations already discussed.\n       Debtors are also required to provide tax returns with \n     respect to the period after filing, or with respect to pre-\n     filing periods if they are filed with the taxing authorities \n     after bankruptcy filing. The Director of the Administrative \n     Office of United States Courts is to develop procedures for \n     safeguarding privacy of these returns, and to make a report \n     to Congress no later and one and one half years after \n     enactment on the effectiveness of these procedures.\n       Other information. Debtors are required to provide certain \n     other information, including ongoing income and expense \n     information, in certain circumstances.\n     Section 316. Dismissal for failure to timely file schedules \n         or provide required information\n       The Fed. R. Bankr. Pro. already provide that schedules must \n     be filed within 10 days of filing unless an extension is \n     granted, and many bankruptcy courts have already established \n     a general practice of dismissing cases when debtors fail to \n     provide all required information within 15 days of filing, \n     unless good cause for additional time is shown. Nothing in \n     this provision is intended to interfere with such \n     requirements. However, if an individual debtor after such \n     extensions as the court may grant, has not filed all of the \n     information required by section 521(a)(1) within 45 days of \n     filing a petition, the case is automatically dismissed. On \n     request of the debtor made before 45 days after filing, the \n     court may grant up to 45 days additional time for the debtor \n     to file schedules. Once the time period provided under this \n     section elapses, the court must enter an order of dismissal \n     within 5 days of request.\n     Section 317. Adequate time to prepare for hearing on \n         confirmation of the plan\n       A hearing on confirmation of a chapter 13 plan must be held \n     between 20 and 45 days after the first meeting of creditors. \n     If a plan cannot be confirmed within that period, the court \n     should take appropriate action to dismiss or convert the \n     case.\n     Section 318. Chapter 13 plans to have a 5-year duration in \n         certain cases\n       If a debtor's current monthly income is more than the \n     monthly median income, the debtor's plan must be no shorter \n     than 5 years, unless the debtor proposes and confirms a plan \n     which provides for payment in full of all creditors within a \n     shorter period. The same rules apply to modifications.\n     Section 319. Sense of Congress regarding expansion of rule \n         9011 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure\n       It is the sense of Congress that Rule 9011 should be \n     applied to the schedules and other documents filed with the \n     court.\n     Section 320. Prompt relief from stay in individual cases\n       Relief from stay proceedings must be finally decided within \n     60 days after relief is requested, unless the parties agree \n     to the contrary, or the court for good cause finds it is \n     necessary to do so, but then only for a specified period of \n     time. Otherwise, the stay automatically expires as to the \n     requesting creditor.\n     Section 321. Chapter 11 cases filed by individuals\n       This section changes some chapter 11 provisions to bring \n     the chapter more closely into conformance with chapter 13 \n     when the debtor is an individual.\n       First, the property of the estate is expanded from present \n     law to include all property and earnings acquired between the \n     time of filing and the closing, dismissal or conversion of \n     the case. Such property is placed under the supervision of \n     the court and is protected by the automatic stay. Second, \n     what may be included in a plan is expanded to permit the \n     debtor to subject future earnings and income to the plan. \n     Third, the individual debtor's plan must provide either that \n     it will pay each claim in full or that at least the debtor's \n     disposable income over the first 5 years of the plan is paid \n     to unsecured creditors. Fourth, in an individual case, the \n     discharge is not granted until completion of payments under \n     the plan. Provision is made for a hardship discharge. Fifth, \n     modifications of a plan are subject to the same requirements \n     as an original plan.\n     Section 322. Limitation\n       The state law homestead exemption is limited to a maximum \n     of $100,000 for the home equity acquired within the 2 years \n     prior to filing. Amounts acquired within the 2-year period \n     that exceed $100,000, are not exempt from the bankruptcy \n     estate. Amounts of home equity acquired prior to the 2-year \n     period are not subject to the $100,000 cap, but\n\n[[Page S11711]]\n\n     are subject to the relevant state law homestead exemption. \n     For this purpose, equity acquired in a principal residence \n     prior to the 2-year period and rolled over into another \n     principal residence after the 2-year period is not subject to \n     the $100,000 cap, but is subject to the relevant state law \n     homestead exemption. This rollover provision does not apply \n     to the sale of a principal residence in one state and the \n     purchase of another principal residence in another state.\n     Section 323. Excluding employee benefit plan participant \n         contributions and other property from the estate\n       Amounts which have been withheld from wages of employees \n     for payment as contributions to retirement plans or health \n     insurance plans, or received from employees for payment over \n     to such plans are not property of the estate. It is not \n     intended that this provision will affect money which has been \n     paid over and received by the respective plans for the \n     purposes the withholding or contributions have been made.\n     Section 324. Exclusive jurisdiction in matters involving \n         bankruptcy professionals\n       This section gives the district court exclusive \n     jurisdiction of any property of the debtor as of the \n     commencement of the case, of property of the estate, and of \n     all claims that involve construction of section 327 (on \n     employment of professional persons) or disclosure rules under \n     that section.\n     Section 325. United States Trustee Program filing fee \n         increase\n       This section changes the filing fees for chapter 7 and 13 \n     cases, and changes the sharing percentages with respect to \n     such fees.\n     Section 326. Sharing of compensation\n       Section 504 of the Bankruptcy Code restricts the extent to \n     which those being paid compensation or reimbusement in a \n     bankruptcy case may share such compensation or reimbursement. \n     This section creates an exception from those rules to permit \n     bona fide public service attorney referral programs operating \n     in accordance with non-Federal law regulating attorney \n     referral services to share such compensation or \n     reimbursement.\n     Section 327. Fair valuation of collateral\n       This section is intended to make clear that when value is \n     determined under title 11, it shall be determined based \n     solely upon what it would cost the debtor to purchase a \n     replacement considering the age and condition of the \n     property, without deductions for other costs or expenses of \n     any kind. In personal, family or household transactions, \n     replacement value is based upon what a retail merchant would \n     charge for the property, considering age and condition at the \n     time value is determined.\n     Section 328. Defaults based on nonmonetary obligations\n       The requirements of section 365 are altered so that certain \n     defaults relating to nonmonetary obligations of the debtor \n     under an unexpired lease of real property need not be cured. \n     Furthermore, such defaults are excepted from the ordinary \n     rules applying to impaired classes. Technical changes are \n     also made to remove certain provisions relating to\n\n\n       Title IV--General and Small Business Bankruptcy Provisions\n\n     Subtitle A--General Business Bankruptcy Provisions\n     Section 401. Adequate protection for investors\n       This section creates a definition for a ``securities self-\n     regulatory organization'' and then provides an exception to \n     the automatic stay for investigations, orders, or delisting \n     activities by such an organization involving the debtor.\n     Section 402. Meetings of creditors and equity security \n         holders\n       This section gives the court the authority, for cause, not \n     to convene a meeting of creditors if there is a prepackaged \n     plan of reorganization. This would save time and expenses in \n     those instances where the court determines there would be \n     little or no meaningful benefit to be derived from a \n     creditors meeting.\n     Section 403. Protection of refinance of security interest\n       This provision alters the preference provisions of section \n     547 of the Bankruptcy Code with respect to when a transfer is \n     made for the purposes of that section. A transfer is deemed \n     made at the time it takes effect if it is perfected within 30 \n     days after it takes effect between the parties. Present law \n     provides only a 10 day period.\n     Section 404. Executory contracts and unexpired leases\n       HR 2415 cures some abuses in the Bankruptcy Code regarding \n     executory contracts and unexpired leases. HR 2415 amends \n     Section 365(d)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code. It imposes a firm, \n     bright line deadline on a retail debtor's decision to assume \n     or reject a lease, absent the lessor's consent. It permits a \n     bankruptcy trustee to assume or reject a lease on a date \n     which is the earlier of the date of confirmation of a plan or \n     the date which is 120 days after the date of the order for \n     relief. A further extension of time may be granted, within \n     the 120 day period, for an additional 90 days, for cause, \n     upon motion of the trustee or lessor. Any subsequent \n     extension can only be granted by the judge upon the prior \n     written consent of the lessor: either by the lessor's motion \n     for an extension, or by a motion of the trustee, provided \n     that the trustee has the prior written approval of the \n     lessor. This provision is designed to remove the bankruptcy \n     judges' discretion to grant extensions of the time for the \n     retail debtor to decide whether to assume or reject a lease \n     after a maximum possible period of 210 days from the time of \n     entry of the order of relief. Beyond that maximum period, \n     there is no authority in the judge to grant further time \n     unless the lessor has agreed in writing to the extension.\n       HR 2415 also amends Section 365(f)(1) of the Bankruptcy \n     Code to make sure that all of the provisions of Section \n     365(b) are adhered to and that Section 365(f) does not \n     override Section 365(b). Congress made clear, in Section \n     365(b)(1), that the trustee may not assume an executory \n     contract or unexpired lease of the debtor, unless the trustee \n     makes adequate assurance of future performance under the \n     contract or lease. In Section 365(b)(3), Congress provided \n     that for purposes of the Bankruptcy Code, ``adequate \n     assurance of future performance of a lease of real property \n     in a shopping center includes adequate assurance . . . that \n     assumption or assignment of such lease is subject to all the \n     provisions thereof, including (but not limited to) provisions \n     such as a radius, location, use, or exclusivity provision. . \n     . .''\n       Regrettably, some bankruptcy judges have not followed this \n     Congressional mandate. Under another provision of the Code, \n     Section 365(f), a number of bankruptcy judges have allowed \n     the assignment of a lease even though terms of the lease are \n     not being followed.\n       For example, if a shopping center's lease with an \n     educational retailer requires that the premises shall be used \n     solely for the purpose of conducting the retail sale of \n     educational items, as the lease provided in the Simon \n     Property Group v. Learningsmith case, then the lessor has a \n     right to maintain this mix of retail uses in his shopping \n     centers, even if the retailer files for bankruptcy.\n       Instead, in the Learningsmith case, the judge allowed the \n     assignment of the lease to a candle retailer because it \n     offered more money than an educational store to buy the \n     lease, in contravention of Section 365(b)(3) of the Code. As \n     a result, the lessor lost control over the nature of its very \n     business, operating a particular mix of retail stores. If \n     other retailers file for bankruptcy in that shopping center, \n     the same result can occur. The bill remedies this problem by \n     amending Section 365(f)(1) to make clear it operates subject \n     to all provisions of Section 365(b). The legal holding in the \n     Learningsmith case, and other cases like it which do not \n     enforce Section 365(b), particularly 365(b)(3), are \n     overturned.\n       Thus, this section adds language to Section 365(f)(1) for \n     the purpose of assuring that Section 365(f) does not override \n     any part of Section 365(b). The section provides that in \n     addition to being subject to Section 365(c), Section 365(f) \n     is also subject to section 365(b) which is to be given its \n     full effect.\n     Section 405. Creditors and equity security holders committees\n       This section is intended to permit small business interests \n     to obtain representation on creditors' committees even though \n     no small business would otherwise be selected under the \n     standards for selecting members of creditors' committees in \n     the present Bankruptcy Code. Bankruptcy judges are given \n     discretion to increase the size of a creditor's committee to \n     place a small business concern on the committee as a fully \n     voting member if the court determines that the small business \n     creditor holds claims the aggregate amount of which is \n     disproportionately large in comparison to the annual gross \n     revenue of that creditor. Congress intends that this standard \n     be liberally applied in favor of a small business concern. \n     For example, a claim that was more than 5% of the net profit \n     after taxes and debt service of the small business concern \n     would be disproportionately large, since if the claim is not \n     paid, it would cause a 5% reduction in profitability, often \n     the difference between success and failure for a small \n     business.\n     Section 406. Amendment to section 546 of title 11, United \n         States Code\n     Section 407. Amendment to section 330(a) of title 11, United \n         States Code\n     Section 408. Postpetition disclosure and solicitation\n       This provision permits post-petition solicitation of a \n     prepackaged plan of reorganization if both the pre-petition \n     solicitation and the post-petition solicitation comply with \n     applicable nonbankruptcy law. However, the provision only \n     applies when the holder of a claim or interest solicited \n     post-petition has been solicited pre-petition, thus avoiding \n     different standards being applicable to pre- and post-\n     petition solicitations. Time is crucial in a prepackaged plan \n     of reorganization in order to minimize the adverse effects of \n     bankruptcy on the debtor's business and financial affairs. \n     When it applies, this section permits avoidance of the time \n     and expense of going through the disclosure statement process \n     normally applicable to post-petition solicitations.\n     Section 409. Preferences\n       The ordinary course of business defense to preference \n     recovery is liberalized. As under current law, the debt must \n     be incurred in the ordinary course. The payment, however, \n     under the new provision must only be in the ordinary course \n     or according to ordinary business terms.\n       A new preference exception is also added in business cases. \n     Aggregate transfers of less than $5,000 are exempted from \n     preference recovery.\n\n[[Page S11712]]\n\n     Section 410. Venue of certain proceedings\n     Section 411. Period for filing plan under chapter 11\n       This new provision is designed to deal with the time and \n     expense of reorganization cases by providing the debtor's \n     exclusive period to file a plan of reorganization may not be \n     extended beyond 18 months after the order for relief in the \n     case. No change is made to current law that permits, for \n     cause, either the reduction or the extension of the debtor's \n     initial 120-day exclusivity period, except that the period \n     may not be extended beyond the new 18 month maximum.\n       The new provision also provides that, if the debtor files a \n     plan of reorganization within its applicable exclusivity \n     period, parties in interest may file a reorganization plan if \n     the debtor's plan is not accepted by each impaired class \n     before 180 days after the order for relief, as such date may \n     be extended for cause up to a maximum of 20 months from the \n     order for relief in the case.\n       The new time periods are maximum periods that may not be \n     extended by the court. They are not, however, minimums. \n     Debtors will still have to show ``cause'' to extend the \n     initial 120-day and 180-day periods in section 1121 and any \n     extensions granted by the court. The establishment of the new \n     so-called ``exclusivity wall'' is not intended to change the \n     standards under section 1104 for conversion or dismissal.\n     Section 412. Fees arising from certain ownership interests\n     Section 413. Creditor representation at first meeting of \n         creditors\n       This section permits either a creditor owed a consumer debt \n     or any representative of that creditor to appear at and \n     participate in the meeting of creditors in a case under \n     chapter 7 or 13 even if the creditor or representative is not \n     admitted to practice before the court or before the local \n     federal or state court, notwithstanding any federal or state \n     rule of practice or statutory provision barring unauthorized \n     practice of law. It is intended that this provision will \n     permit non-attorneys to appear at and participate in the \n     meeting of creditors and any related negotiations entered \n     into before or after the meeting to facilitate more efficient \n     and economical participation by creditors in chapter 7 and 13 \n     bankruptcy proceedings.\n     Section 414. Definition of disinterested person\n       This provision deletes the per se exclusion of investment \n     bankers and attorneys for investment bankers from being a \n     disinterested person. Whether an investment banking firm or \n     an attorney for an investment banker is disinterested will \n     depend on an ad hoc application of the definition.\n     Section 415. Factors for compensation of professional persons\n       This section permits consideration in setting compensation \n     of whether the professional is board certified or otherwise \n     has demonstrated skill.\n     Section 416. Appointment of elected trustee\n       This section provides for procedures when a trustee is \n     elected, and for handling disputes over election of trustees.\n     Section 417. Utility service\n       Section 366 of the Code is amended to permit a utility to \n     refuse to provide service to a debtor under certain \n     circumstances unless adequate assurance payments are \n     received.\n     Section 418. Bankruptcy fees\n       This provision permits a court to waive filing fees if it \n     finds that a debtor is unable to pay the fees in installments \n     and that the debtor's income is under 150 percent of the \n     official poverty line. The court is expected to examine \n     carefully the debtor's projected future income over the \n     period during which installment payments must be made before \n     concluding that the debtor is truly unable to pay in \n     installments. The mere fact that the debtor is experiencing \n     debt difficulty is not, in and of itself, determinative of \n     whether a debtor can pay in installments. ``Filing fees'' \n     cover any fee which must be paid in order to file a petition \n     and commence a bankruptcy case under title 11, but not fees \n     for motions or adversary complaints.\n     Section 419. More complete information regarding assets of \n         the estate\n       This section directs the Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy \n     Rules of the Judicial Conference to propose for adoption \n     amended rules and forms directing chapter 11 debtors to \n     provide information on the value, operations and \n     profitability of any closely held corporation in which the \n     debtor has a substantial or controlling interest. This \n     direction is intended to result in changes to the Bankruptcy \n     Rules and Forms so that parties in interest will be able to \n     obtain, on the schedules or otherwise on other disclosures \n     provided by the debtor full and complete information about \n     the value of such an interest in a closely held corporation.\n     Subtitle B--Small Business Bankruptcy Provisions\n       These provisions effect reforms in chapter 11 cases. They \n     further two primary goals. First, they are designed to reduce \n     cost and delay in chapter 11 cases. Second, they are designed \n     to ensure that the extraordinary protections provided chapter \n     11 debtors are used to further the public interest, by \n     limiting those protections to cases in which there is both a \n     likelihood of successful reorganization and in which the \n     debtor fully complies with the applicable statutes and rules.\n       These sections achieve these goals through the following \n     means:\n       First, the fast-track plan confirmation rules for small \n     business cases that were adopted by Congress in 1994 have \n     been strengthened. Second, the bill simplifies the process of \n     drafting a plan and disclosure statement to make it easier \n     for the small business debtor to comply with the fast-track \n     requirements. Third, the debtor is required to provide \n     additional information about post-filing operations, and the \n     Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy Rules is directed to \n     promulgate forms that will simplify such reporting. Fourth, \n     the United States trustee is directed to oversee the debtor \n     in small business cases. Fifth, the bankruptcy courts are \n     directed to use case-management conferences and scheduling \n     orders to reduce cost and delay. Sixth, it is made easier to \n     appoint an independent trustee or examiner and to convert or \n     dismiss a chapter 11 case in which the debtor is not playing \n     by the rules or there is little likelihood of a successful \n     reorganization. Seventh, the bill protects creditors against \n     repeat filings after a prior chapter 11 case has failed.\n     Section 431. Flexible rules for disclosure statement and plan\n       Under current law, the debtor generally files a drafted-\n     from-scratch plan and disclosure statement, even if the debts \n     and assets involved are small. This practice is expensive, \n     and imposes an undue burden on the debtor. Section 1125 of \n     the Bankruptcy Code is amended to streamline the plan \n     confirmation process in several ways for small business \n     debtors. First, it encourages the use of standard-form plans \n     and disclosure statements. Second, it directs the court to \n     weigh the cost of providing additional information against \n     the benefit of such information in determining whether a \n     disclosure statement provides adequate information. Third, it \n     provides that a separate disclosure statement is not \n     necessary if the court determines that the plan provides \n     adequate information. Fourth, it permits the court to \n     consider at a single hearing both the adequacy of the \n     disclosure statement and confirmation of the plan.\n     Section 432. Definition of small business debtor\n       Sections 101(51C) and (51D) of the Bankruptcy Code are \n     amended in two significant respects. First, the debt limit \n     used to define a small business debtor is increased from $2.0 \n     million to $3.0 million. Second, a debtor with debts within \n     the limit is treated as a small business debtor whether or \n     not it elects to be treated as a small business debtor. All \n     of the provisions applicable to small business debtors are \n     now mandatory. There are two exclusions from the definition: \n     (1) cases in which the debtor is primarily engaged in \n     passive real estate investments; and (2) cases in which \n     the court has certified that there is an active and \n     representative committee of unsecured creditors.\n     Section 433. Standard form disclosure statement and plan\n       Section 433 directs the Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy \n     Rules of the Judicial Conference of the United States to \n     propose standard forms for plans and disclosure statements in \n     small business cases. Under section 1125 as amended, the \n     debtor may use either a form approved by the court in which \n     the case is pending or a form approved by the Rules \n     Committee. The intent of these provisions is to encourage \n     experimentation in the use of standard forms. Use of an \n     approved form does not by itself satisfy the disclosure \n     requirements. The court must determine that the form provides \n     information that is adequate in light of the facts of the \n     case.\n     Sections 434 and 435. Reporting requirements\n       New section 308 of the Bankruptcy Code imposes new \n     reporting requirements on small business debtors, and section \n     435 of the bill calls for the Advisory Committee on \n     Bankruptcy Rules to promulgate uniform national reporting \n     forms. These provisions have three chief aims: (1) to assist \n     small business debtors in understanding and improving their \n     businesses through the process of preparing the reports; (2) \n     to provide the persons interested in a case with information \n     about that case; and (3) to provide a data base for further \n     evaluation of the efficacy of chapter 11 for small \n     businesses. The standard imposed on the Rules Committee in \n     promulgating uniform national forms is to effect a practical \n     balance between: (a) the needs of interested parties for \n     information; (b) ease and lack of expense in preparation; and \n     (c) ``the interest of all parties that the required reports \n     help the small business debtor to understand its financial \n     condition and plan its future.''\n     Section 436. Duties of trustee or debtor in possession in \n         small business cases\n       New section 1116 of the Bankruptcy Code imposes six types \n     of clear, new duties on small business debtors. The debtor \n     must: (1) promptly file with the court the best available \n     financial information about the debtor's business through its \n     most recent financial statements or federal income tax \n     return; (2) attend through its responsible individual and \n     counsel meetings scheduled by the court or the United States \n     trustee; (3) timely file the schedules and statements of \n     affairs (with a strict limit on extensions) and financial and \n     other reports required by law; (4) maintain insurance \n     necessary to protect the public and the estate; (5) timely \n     pay all administrative expense tax claims; and (6) allow the \n     United States trustee at reasonable times after reasonable \n     notice to inspect the debtor's business premises and books \n     and\n\n[[Page S11713]]\n\n     records. These provisions are designed to assist the debtor, \n     the courts, and the United States trustee in effectuating \n     expeditious administration of small business cases. They are \n     based on recommendations of the National Bankruptcy Review \n     Commission's small business proposal.\n     Section 437. Plan filing deadline\n       Section 1121 of the Bankruptcy Code is amended to require a \n     small business debtor to file a plan within 300 days after \n     the petition date. This deadline is based on the assumption \n     that the typical small business debtor can reasonably file a \n     plan and disclosure statement within 300 days. Any request \n     for extension of this deadline is an appropriate occasion to \n     require the debtor to justify the continuation of the broad \n     injunctive relief the debtor received automatically upon the \n     filing of the petition. The amendment does this by requiring \n     the debtor to show that it is more likely than not that the \n     debtor will confirm a plan within a reasonable time if the \n     extension is granted.\n     Section 438. Plan confirmation deadline\n       This section provides that a plan shall be confirmed by 175 \n     days after the order for relief, unless such time is extended \n     under section 1121(e)(3) of the Code. If a plan is not \n     confirmed within the period and the period is not extended, \n     it is expected that the case will be dismissed or converted, \n     as appropriate.\n     Section 439. Duties of the United States trustee\n       In small business cases, there is rarely an active, \n     functioning creditor's committee. As a result, the debtor in \n     possession is generally not subject to the creditor \n     supervision contemplated when chapter 11 was first enacted. \n     To fill this void and to provide adequate supervision of the \n     debtor, section 586 of the Judicial Code is amended to \n     enlarge the duties of the United States Trustee in small \n     business cases. One of these duties is to conduct an initial \n     debtor interview promptly after the order for relief and \n     before the official creditors' meeting under section 341 of \n     the Bankruptcy Code. At this meeting, the United States \n     Trustee should investigate the debtor's viability, ascertain \n     what the debtor's business plan is, and explain the debtor's \n     reporting and other compliance obligations. In addition, new \n     section 1116 of the Bankruptcy Code authorizes the United \n     States Trustee to visit the business premises of the debtor \n     and ascertain the status of the books and records and \n     timeliness of filing of tax returns.\n       The amendments to section 586 of the Judicial Code also \n     require the United States Trustee in cases where there are \n     grounds for conversion or dismissal under section 1112 of the \n     Bankruptcy Code to ``apply promptly to the court for \n     relief.'' This duty applies in all chapter 11 cases, not only \n     small business cases.\n     Section 440. Scheduling conferences\n       Section 105(d) of the Bankruptcy Code is amended to provide \n     that bankruptcy judges are now required to hold status \n     conferences and enter scheduling orders in chapter 11 cases \n     whenever that would ``further the expeditious and economical \n     resolution of the case.'' The change reflects a determination \n     that bankruptcy judges should assume responsibility for \n     reducing cost and delay in the chapter 11 cases before them, \n     and that active case management by the trial judge is a \n     proven means of cost and delay reduction.\n     Section 441. Serial filers\n       This section creates a new section 362(k) of the Bankruptcy \n     Code that provides that the filing of a chapter 11 petition \n     does not create an automatic stay if the debtor: (1) is a \n     debtor in another pending chapter 11 case; (2) was a debtor \n     in a chapter 11 case dismissed within the previous two years; \n     (3) confirmed a plan in a chapter 11 case within the previous \n     two years; or (4) succeeded to the assets of an entity that \n     was a chapter 11 debtor within the previous two years. A \n     debtor affected by this provision is not precluded from \n     filing a chapter 11 petition, and is not precluded from \n     seeking protection from creditor action. The protections of \n     section 362(a) do not go into effect, however, unless and \n     until the debtor makes the required showing regarding the \n     likelihood of confirming a plan and the reasons a second \n     chapter 11 case is necessary. The logic of this provision is \n     that in each of the four identified circumstances there is \n     sufficient likelihood of abuse to require the debtor to make \n     some showing before receiving injunctive relief. The \n     exception to the automatic stay does not apply to an \n     involuntary petition that is not filed in collusion with the \n     debtor or its insiders.\n     Section 442. Expanded grounds for dismissal, conversion, or \n         appointment of a trustee or examiner\n       Section 1112 of the Bankruptcy Code is amended to expand \n     the circumstances in which the bankruptcy court may dismiss a \n     chapter 11 case, convert the case to another chapter, or \n     appoint a chapter 11 trustee or examiner. The most salient \n     characteristic of chapter 11 is its most problematic--the \n     debtor is protected against all creditor action automatically \n     upon filing, while remaining in control of all its assets. \n     Any non-debtor seeking comparable injunctive relief must show \n     a likelihood of prevailing on the merits of the dispute and \n     that the equities weigh in favor of equitable relief. Under \n     current law, a chapter 11 debtor gets what is perhaps the \n     broadest injunction available under American law, without \n     making any showing whatsoever. Some courts impose a heavy \n     burden on any party who, by moving for dismissal of the \n     chapter 11 case or appointment of a trustee, seeks to deprive \n     the debtor of that relief.\n       The amendment to section 1112 is intended to effect a \n     significant change in the burden of proof governing motions \n     to dismiss, convert, or appoint a chapter 11 trustee or \n     examiner. First, the amendment creates an expanded definition \n     of ``cause'' for such relief. Each type of cause listed \n     represents a warning sign that the chapter 11 case is not \n     proceeding properly (e.g., that assets of the estate are \n     being diminished, that the debtor is not complying with \n     applicable statutes or rules, or that the debtor is not \n     moving promptly toward confirmation of a plan of \n     reorganization). Second, the amendment creates a new shifting \n     burden of proof. If a creditor establishes one or more of the \n     specified warning signs, the burden shifts to the debtor to \n     show: (1) that the debtor is likely to confirm a plan \n     promptly; and (2) if the basis for relief is the debtor's \n     failure to comply with an applicable statute or rule, that \n     there is a reasonable justification for the lack of \n     compliance, and that the lack of compliance will be cured \n     within a reasonable time fixed by the court. If the debtor \n     fails to meet its burden of proof, the court must convert, \n     dismiss, or appoint a chapter 11 trustee or examiner, \n     whichever is in the best interest of creditors and the \n     estate. In substance, the amended section 1112 adopts a \n     position midway between current chapter 11 law and \n     traditional injunction practice. The debtor still receives \n     the protection of the automatic stay upon filing, but the \n     debtor will now be required to prove up its entitlement to \n     that injunction in a wide variety of circumstances.\n       The bankruptcy court should determine whether there is a \n     reasonable possibility that the debtor will confirm a plan \n     within a reasonable time in much the same manner the court \n     would determine whether a party seeking a preliminary \n     injunction is likely to prevail upon the merits. The \n     determination is a preliminary one regarding the likelihood \n     of prevailing in the future, not a final determination on the \n     merits. The hearing may often be a summary one. The court \n     need not conduct a miniature confirmation hearing. The debtor \n     should be required to prove a likelihood that its business is \n     financially viable enough to pass the feasibility \n     requirements of section 1129(a)(11), and that it will be able \n     to pay in full those claims (i.e., secured and priority \n     claims) that must be paid in full in order to confirm a plan.\n       If the debtor shows that it is likely to make a \n     distribution to general unsecured creditors and that those \n     creditors have no realistic alternative to debtor's plan, the \n     debtor need not submit additional evidence that general \n     unsecured creditors will vote to accept the plan in order to \n     establish a prima facie case. The moving party or any other \n     creditor may rebut debtor's evidence. The debtor does not \n     satisfy its burden of proof when unsecured creditors holding \n     claims sufficient to block acceptance by that class state \n     their intent to vote against the plan and the debtor cannot \n     show a likelihood that it will be able to confirm a plan \n     notwithstanding such rejection.\n       Attention from the debtor and the court to the economic \n     viability of the debtor's business is appropriate in all \n     cases except liquidating chapter 11 cases. A debtor with a \n     business that is not viable should not be allowed to remain a \n     debtor in possession under chapter 11, unless it is avowedly \n     using chapter 11 to confirm a liquidating plan promptly. \n     Because the likely-to-confirm-a-plan standard turns on issues \n     of business feasibility as much as on issues of law, the \n     parties should be permitted to introduce evidence from \n     accounting and other professionals concerning the viability \n     of the debtor's business. The likely-to-confirm-a-plan \n     standard should be applied in the same manner when it arises \n     in a motion to extend the deadlines provided for in the \n     amendments to section 1121.\n       All of the provisions of the amended section 1112 apply to \n     all chapter 11 cases. This is so even though some of the \n     listed examples of ``cause'' for dismissal, conversion, or \n     appointment of a trustee or examiner resemble duties that \n     under new sections 308 and 1116 apply only to small business \n     debtors.\n     Section 443. Study of operation of title 11, United States \n         Code, with respect to small businesses\n       Requires the Adminstrator of the Small Business \n     Administration, in conjunction with the Attorney General and \n     the Director of the Executive Office of United States \n     Trustees and Director of the Administrative Office of United \n     States Courts to conduct a study of small business \n     bankruptcies and report to Congress how Federal bankruptcy \n     laws may be made more effective with regard to such \n     businesses.\n     Section 444. Payment of interest\n       This provision continues present law under section \n     362(d)(3) which provides that the court shall grant relief \n     from stay to a real estate secured creditor holding security \n     in a single asset real estate debtor unless not later than 90 \n     days after the order for relief the debtor has either filed a \n     plan of reorganization that has a reasonable possibility of \n     being confirmed or commences making interest payments. This \n     provision permits the debtor to make those interest payments \n     from rents or other income the debtor holds, and requires \n     that the interest be at the nondefault interest rate under \n     the contract with the creditor.\n     Section 445. Priority for administrative expenses\n       This section amends section 503 of the Bankruptcy Code to \n     provide that certain\n\n[[Page S11714]]\n\n     amounts owed with respect to nonresidential real property \n     leases become administrative expenses.\n\n\n                Title V--Municipal Bankruptcy Provisions\n\n     Section 501. Petition and proceedings related to petition\n       This section amends section 921(d) of the Code to clarify \n     that the special rules with respect to commencement of a case \n     of an unincorporated tax or special assessment district in \n     that section control over the general rules on commencement \n     of voluntary cases under section 301 of the Code. As a \n     conforming change, section 301 is amended to divide it into \n     two subsections, subsection (a), which provides that a \n     voluntary case is commenced by the filing of a petition, and \n     subsection (b), which provides that the commencement of a \n     case is also the order for relief. Section 301 as amended \n     will continue to govern the voluntary cases which it now \n     covers, except those covered by section 921(d).\n     Section 502. Applicability of other sections to chapter 9\n       Section 901(a) of the Code, which lists the sections of \n     title 11 which apply to chapter 9 cases, is amended to \n     include sections 555, 556, 559, 560, 561, and 562. These \n     sections provide an exception to the stay of proceedings to \n     allow the liquidation of various types of securities \n     contracts. The amendment is necessary to avoid a stay \n     violation or other complications when certain executory \n     contracts, municipal bonds, for instance, come due and must \n     be redeemed.\n\n\n                       Title VI--Bankruptcy Data\n\n     Section 601. Improved bankruptcy statistics\n       It has been obvious for some time that despite the scope \n     and frequency of bankruptcy relief, organized statistics with \n     respect to what occurs during and as a result of the \n     bankruptcy case are not available. It is strongly felt that \n     there should be a concerted effort by the federal government \n     to collect, maintain and disseminate broad information about \n     the bankruptcy system and how it operates. Such information \n     should include how much debt is discharged in different types \n     of bankruptcy cases, as well as other information relative to \n     assessing how well the bankruptcy system is serving both \n     debtors in need and the wider group of citizens who pay in \n     higher credit prices for the discharged debt.\n       This section creates a standardized and centralized method \n     for collecting relevant bankruptcy statistics for cases \n     involving primarily consumer debts filed under chapters 7, \n     11, and 13. The statistics will be collected by the clerk in \n     each district. The Director of the Administrative Office of \n     the United States Courts will compile the statistics, \n     producing a centralized data source. The Director will make \n     the statistics available to the public. Furthermore, by \n     October 31, 2002, the Director will make annual reports to \n     Congress which include the statistics as well as an analysis \n     of the information.\n       The Director's compilation of statistics will be \n     comprehensive. The requirements of the compilation, as \n     outlined in the new section 159(c), are self-explanatory. It \n     is intended that the information required under Section \n     159(c)(3)(H) should also include the cases involving \n     sanctions imposed on debtor's counsel under Section 707(b) of \n     the Bankruptcy Code.\n     Section 602. Uniform rules for the collection of bankruptcy \n         data\n       This provision complements Section 601 by requiring the \n     Attorney General to issue rules requiring the establishment \n     of uniform forms for final reports filed by bankruptcy \n     trustees and monthly operating reports filed by chapter 11 \n     debtors in possession. The information that should be \n     contained in these reports is self-explanatory. The reports \n     must also be made publicly available for physical inspection \n     (at one or more central filing locations) and by electronic \n     access through the Internet or other appropriate media.\n     Section 603. Audit procedures\n       This section requires the Attorney General to establish \n     procedures for auditing the accuracy and completeness of \n     information supplied by individual debtors in connection with \n     their bankruptcy cases under chapter 7 and chapter 13 of the \n     Bankruptcy Code. The audit must be in accordance with \n     generally accepted auditing standards and performed by \n     independent certified public accountants or independent \n     licensed public accountants. However, the Attorney General is \n     given discretion to develop alternative auditing standards \n     not later than two years after the date of enactment of H.R. \n     2415. Should the Attorney General develop alternative \n     auditing standards, such standards are expected to have \n     integrity and reliability comparable to generally accepted \n     auditing standards. It is intended that the Attorney General \n     in developing auditing standards, and any others who set \n     procedures or practices to be used in the audits or supervise \n     them, will in doing so consult with those units in the \n     Department of Justice which enforce against bankruptcy fraud \n     and bankruptcy crimes, including the bankruptcy fraud task \n     force in the Attorney General's office and bankruptcy fraud \n     and crime units in the United States Attorneys' offices.\n       The audits are to be performed on randomly selected cases \n     and should include at least 1 out of every 250 cases in each \n     Federal judicial district. Audits are required for schedules \n     of income and expenses which reflect greater than average \n     variances from the statistical norm of the district in which \n     the schedules were filed. The aggregate results of the audits \n     is to be made public and is required to include the \n     percentage of cases, by district, in which a material \n     misstatement of income, expenditures or assets is reported.\n       A report of each audit must be filed with the court and \n     transmitted to the United States trustee. Each report must \n     clearly and conspicuously specify any material misstatement \n     of income, expenditures or assets. In any case where a \n     material misstatement of income, expenditures or assets has \n     been reported, the clerk of the bankruptcy court must give \n     all creditors in the case notice of the misstatement(s). \n     Where appropriate, the matter could be referred to the U.S. \n     Attorney for possible criminal prosecution.\n       Furthermore, the Bankruptcy Code is amended to make it a \n     duty of the debtor to supply certain information to an \n     auditor. This section also adds, as grounds for revocation of \n     a chapter 7 debtor's discharge, a chapter 7 debtor's failure \n     to satisfactorily explain a material misstatement discovered \n     as the result of an audit and the failure to make available \n     all necessary documents or property belonging to the debtor \n     that are requested in connection with such audit.\n     Section 604. Sense of Congress regarding availability of \n         bankruptcy data\n       This section expresses the sense of the Congress that it is \n     a national policy of the United States that all data \n     collected by the bankruptcy clerks in electronic form (to the \n     extent such data related to public records as defined in \n     Section 107 of the Bankruptcy Code) should be made available \n     to the public in a usable electronic form in bulk, subject to \n     appropriate privacy concerns and safeguards as determined by \n     the Judicial Conference of the United States. Those privacy \n     concerns and safeguards should be developed keeping in mind \n     that the data covered is already of public record.\n       It is also the sense of Congress that a single bankruptcy \n     data system should be established that uses a single set of \n     data definitions and forms to collect such data and that data \n     for any particular bankruptcy case be aggregated in such \n     electronic record.\n\n\n                  Title VII--Bankruptcy Tax Provisions\n\n     Section 701. Treatment of certain tax liens\n       The conference agreement follows the House bill. Section \n     701 makes several amendments to section 724 of the Bankruptcy \n     Code to provide greater protection for holders of ad valorem \n     tax liens on real or personal property of the estate. Many \n     school boards obtain liens on real property to ensure \n     collection of unpaid ad valorem taxes. Often, governments are \n     unable to collect despite the presence of a lien because, \n     under current law, these liens may be subordinated to certain \n     claims against and expenses of the bankruptcy estate. The \n     conference agreement would seek to protect the holders of \n     these tax liens from, among other things, erosions of their \n     claims' status by expenses incurred under chapter 11 of the \n     Bankruptcy Code.\n       Under the conference agreement, subordination of ad valorem \n     tax liens is still possible under section 724(b). However, \n     the purposes are limited to paying for chapter 7 \n     administrative expenses and priority claims for postpetition \n     ``wages, salaries, and commissions'' and claims for \n     ``contributions to an employee benefit plan.'' Thus, \n     subordination for the purpose of paying chapter 11 \n     administrative expenses is not permitted. Also, section 701 \n     requires the chapter 7 trustee to utilize all other estate \n     assets before the trustee could resort to section 724 of the \n     code to subordinate liens on personal and real property of \n     the estate.\n       In addition, the conference agreement prevents a bankruptcy \n     court from determining the amount or legality of ad valorem \n     tax obligations if the applicable period for contesting or \n     redetermining the amount of the claim under nonbankruptcy law \n     has expired. This addresses those instances where debtors or \n     trustees use section 505 of the Bankruptcy Code as a means to \n     have bankruptcy courts set aside these types of taxes, to the \n     detriment of the local communities that depend on them for \n     revenue.\n     Section 702. Treatment of fuel tax claims\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill. The \n     agreement simplifies the filing of claims by states against \n     truckers for unpaid fuel taxes by modifying section 501 of \n     the Bankruptcy Code. Rather than requiring all states to file \n     a claim for unpaid fuel taxes (as is the case under current \n     law), the designated ``base jurisdiction'' under the \n     International Fuel Tax Agreement would file a claim on behalf \n     of all states. This claim would be treated as a single claim.\n     Section 703. Notice of request for a determination of taxes\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill. Under \n     current law, debtors may request that the government \n     determine administrative tax liabilities under section 505(b) \n     of the Bankruptcy Code in order to receive a discharge of \n     those liabilities. There are no requirements as to the \n     content or form of such notice to the government.\n       The conference agreement requires that each bankruptcy \n     court clerk maintain a listing under which government \n     entities may designate their addresses for service of debtor \n     requests. If a governmental entity does not designate an \n     address and provide that address to the bankruptcy court \n     clerk, any request made under section 505(b) of the \n     Bankruptcy Code may be served at the address of the \n     appropriate taxing authority of\n\n[[Page S11715]]\n\n     that governmental unit. The conference agreement also \n     provides that governmental entities may describe where \n     further information concerning additional requirements for \n     filing such requests may be found.\n     Section 704. Rate of interest on tax claims\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill with a \n     modification and a technical correction. Under current law, \n     there is no uniform rate of interest for payment of tax \n     claims. Bankruptcy courts have used varying standards to \n     determine the applicable rate. The conference agreement adds \n     section 511 to the Bankruptcy Code to simplify the interest \n     rate calculation. The agreement provides that for all tax \n     claims (federal, state, and local), including administrative \n     expense taxes, the interest rate shall be determined in \n     accordance with applicable non-bankruptcy law and as of the \n     calendar month in which the plan is confirmed.\n       The conference agreement modifies the Senate bill to \n     clarify that the applicable non-bankruptcy law interest rate \n     would apply to administrative expense taxes, as well as to \n     all other tax claims.\n     Section 705. Priority of tax claims\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill with a \n     modification and a technical correction. Under current law, \n     in section 507(a)(8) of the Bankruptcy Code, tax claims are \n     entitled to a priority if they arise within certain time \n     periods. In the case of income taxes, a priority arises, \n     among other times, if the tax return was due within 3 years \n     of the filing of the bankruptcy petition or if the assessment \n     of the tax was made within 240 days of the filing of the \n     petition. The 240-day period is tolled during the time that \n     an offer in compromise is pending (plus 30 days). Though the \n     statute is silent, most courts have also held that the 3-year \n     and 240-day time periods are tolled during the pendency of a \n     previous bankruptcy case.\n       The conference agreement codifies the rule tolling priority \n     periods during a previous bankruptcy and adds an additional \n     90 days. The agreement also includes tolling provisions to \n     adjust for the collection due process rights provided by the \n     IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. During any period \n     in which the government is prohibited from collecting a tax \n     as a result of a request by the debtor for a hearing and an \n     appeal of any collection action taken against the debtor, the \n     priority is tolled, plus 90 days. Also, during any time in \n     which there was a stay of proceedings in a prior bankruptcy \n     case or collection of an income tax was precluded by a \n     confirmed bankruptcy plan, the priority is tolled, plus 90 \n     days. The conference agreement modifies the Senate bill to \n     apply the priority tolling periods to non-income taxes as \n     well.\n     Section 706. Priority property taxes incurred\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill, replacing \n     the word ``assessed'' with ``incurred'' in the case of real \n     property taxes. Under current law, many provisions of the \n     Bankruptcy Code are keyed to the word ``assessed.'' While \n     this word has an accepted meaning in the federal system, it \n     is not used in many state and local statutes and has created \n     some confusion. Replacing the word ``assessed'' with \n     ``incurred'' in the case of real property taxes in section \n     507(a)(8)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code eliminates this problem.\n     Section 707. No discharge of fraudulent taxes in chapter 13\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill. Under \n     current law, a debtor's ability to discharge his tax debts \n     varies depending on whether the debtor is in chapter 7 \n     (liquidation) or chapter 13 (income earner plans of \n     repayment). Chapter 7 contains a much narrower discharge. \n     Under chapter 7, taxes from a return due within 3 years of \n     the petition date, taxes assessed within 240 days, or taxes \n     related to an unfiled return or false return are not \n     dischargeable. Chapter 13, on the other hand, permits what is \n     known as a ``superdischarge,'' which allows courts to \n     discharge these same tax debts.\n       The conference agreement repeals the superdischarge for \n     fraudulent and non-filed taxes by amending section 1328(a)(2) \n     of the Bankruptcy Code. Fraudulent and non-filer claims would \n     not receive any special treatment. The conference agreement \n     also repeals the superdischarge for a tax required to be \n     collected or withheld and for which the debtor is liable in \n     whatever capacity, such as an employee's share of federal \n     payroll and trust fund taxes. However, the conference \n     agreement leaves the superdischarge in place for other tax \n     claims. Thus, consistent with the IRS Restructuring and \n     Reform Act of 1998, taxpayers who have complied with a \n     reorganization plan--which includes paying taxes--would \n     continue to receive the superdischarge.\n     Section 708. No discharge of fraudulent taxes in chapter 11\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill with a \n     modification. Under current law, the confirmation of a plan \n     of reorganization under chapter 11 discharges the debtor from \n     all liability. The conference agreement would except, in the \n     case of corporations, fraudulent taxes, willfully evaded \n     taxes, and debts for money or property obtained in a false or \n     fraudulent manner from the broad chapter 11 discharge. \n     Congress believes the Bankruptcy Code should not encourage \n     fraud by allowing the discharge of debts incurred through \n     fraud or false representation simply because those debts were \n     incurred in a corporate setting.\n       The conference agreement amends the discharge provisions of \n     chapter 11 (Bankruptcy Code section 1141(d)) to prevent the \n     discharge of tax or customs duty tax claims resulting from a \n     corporate debtor's fraudulent tax returns. It also prevents \n     the discharge of any unpaid tax obligations that resulted \n     from a corporate chapter 11 debtor's willful evasion of \n     applicable tax laws. Further, the conference agreement \n     modifies the Senate bill to prevent the discharge of any debt \n     for money, property, services, or credit, obtained by a \n     corporate debtor in a false or fraudulent manner (applying \n     section 523(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code to corporate \n     debtors).\n     Section 709. Stay of tax proceedings limited to pre-petition \n         taxes\n       The conference agreement modifies the Senate and House \n     bills. Under current law, filing a petition for relief under \n     the Bankruptcy Code triggers an automatic stay which \n     precludes the commencement or continuation of a case in U.S. \n     tax court. This rule was arguably extended in Halpern v. \n     Commissioner, 96 T.C. 895 (1991), in which the tax court \n     ruled that it did not have jurisdiction to hear a case \n     involving a post-petition year. The conferees believe that \n     Halpern went too far.\n       In order to address this issue, the conference agreement \n     specifies that the automatic stay is limited to an individual \n     debtor's prepetition taxes (taxes incurred before entering \n     bankruptcy). Thus, the automatic stay would not apply to \n     cases involving an individual debtor's postpetition taxes. \n     The agreement allows the bankruptcy court to determine \n     whether the stay will apply to the postpetition tax \n     liabilities of a corporate debtor.\n     Section 710. Periodic payment of taxes in chapter 11 cases\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill with a \n     modification. Section 710 of the conference agreement limits \n     the discretion of the debtor and the trustee regarding \n     treatment of pre-petition tax claims in chapter 11 cases. \n     Under current law, non-tax claims are paid out over several \n     years in equal installments. Tax claims must be paid out over \n     six years from the date of assessment and typically include \n     interest-only payments in the early years and a balloon \n     payment at the end.\n       The conference agreement modifies section 1129(a)(9) of the \n     Bankruptcy Code by reducing the maximum period of tax \n     payments from six years from the date of assessment to five \n     years from the entry of the order for relief and by \n     specifying that payment should be made in ``regular \n     installment payments.''\n       The conference agreement modifies the Senate bill to delete \n     language regarding the interest rate applicable to \n     installment payments in chapter 11 cases.\n     Section 711. Avoidance of statutory liens prohibited\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill. Under the \n     Bankruptcy Code, trustees may act to keep assets in the \n     bankruptcy estate even though a statutory lien exists against \n     the asset. The Internal Revenue Code gives special protection \n     to certain purchasers of securities and motor vehicles \n     notwithstanding the existence of a filed tax lien. The \n     conference agreement amends section 545(2) of the Bankruptcy \n     Code to prevent trustees from using the tax code provision to \n     displace an otherwise valid lien. In other words, trustees \n     could not keep securities or motor vehicles in the bankruptcy \n     estate if they were subject to a lien under the tax code \n     provisions.\n       The conference agreement prevents the avoidance of \n     unperfected liens against a bona fide purchaser, if the \n     purchaser qualifies as such under section 6323 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code or a similar provision of either state \n     or local law.\n     Section 712. Payment of taxes in the conduct of business\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill. \n     Bankruptcy laws and statutes-at-large generally require \n     trustees and receivers to pay business taxes in the ordinary \n     course. Other kinds of administrative expenses can be paid \n     only upon motion after a court order. Some bankruptcy courts \n     have not permitted debtors to pay post-petition tax \n     liabilities (those accruing after filing a bankruptcy \n     petition) prior to the approval of a plan for the bankruptcy \n     estate. The conference agreement amends section 960 of title \n     28 of the U.S. Code to provide clear authority to pay taxes \n     in the ordinary course of business. The agreement also amends \n     section 503(b) of the Bankruptcy Code to require payment of \n     ad valorem taxes as an allowed administrative expense tax and \n     eliminates any requirement to file a request for payment of \n     any administrative expense taxes.\n     Section 713. Tardily filed priority tax claims\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill. Under \n     current law, in chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, tax claims \n     timely filed are entitled to their full statutory priority. \n     Late-filed tax claims lose their full statutory priority, but \n     are entitled to distribution as unsecured claims provided \n     they are filed before the trustee commences distribution of \n     the estate. The problem is that a claim filed just before \n     distribution can significantly delay the process of \n     distribution due to certifying the validity of the claim and \n     determining its proper priority.\n       The conference agreement modifies section 726(a)(1) of the \n     Bankruptcy Code to require a tax claim to be filed either \n     before the trustee commences distribution or 10 days \n     following the mailing to creditors of the summary of\n\n[[Page S11716]]\n\n     the trustee's final report, whichever is earlier, in order \n     for the claim to be entitled to distribution as an unsecured \n     claim.\n     Section 714. Income tax returns prepared by tax authorities\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill. In \n     general, taxpayers cannot be discharged from taxes unless a \n     return was filed. Courts have struggled with what constitutes \n     filing a return. The tax code authorizes the Secretary of \n     Treasury to file a return on behalf of a taxpayer if either \n     (1) the taxpayer provides information sufficient to complete \n     a return, or (2) the Secretary can obtain sufficient \n     information through testimony or otherwise to complete a \n     return.\n       The conference agreement modifies section 523(a) of the \n     Bankruptcy Code to provide that a return filed on behalf of a \n     taxpayer who has provided information sufficient to complete \n     a return constitutes filing a return (and the debt can be \n     discharged) but that a return filed on behalf of a taxpayer \n     based on information the Secretary obtains through testimony \n     or otherwise does not constitute filing a return (and the \n     debt cannot be discharged).\n     Section 715. Discharge of the estate's liability for unpaid \n         taxes\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill. Under the \n     Bankruptcy Code, a debtor may request a prompt audit to \n     determine post-petition tax liabilities. If the government \n     does not make a determination or request extension of time to \n     audit, then the debtor's determination of taxes will be \n     final. Several court cases have held that while this protects \n     the debtor and the trustee, it does not necessarily protect \n     the estate.\n       The conference agreement modifies section 505(b) of the \n     Bankruptcy Code to clarify that the estate is also protected \n     if the government does not request an audit of the debtor's \n     tax returns. Therefore, if the government does not make a \n     determination of the debtor's post-petition tax liabilities \n     or request extension of time to audit, then the estate's \n     liability for unpaid taxes will be discharged.\n     Section 716. Requirement to file tax returns to confirm \n         chapter 13 plans\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill with a \n     modification. Under current law, a debtor may be entitled to \n     the benefits of chapter 13 (reorganization) even if he is \n     delinquent in his tax returns. Without access to tax return \n     information, creditors cannot obtain full information about \n     the debtor's status. Most districts have established \n     procedures requiring the filing of returns prior to the \n     initial meeting of creditors.\n       The conference agreement amends section 1325(a) of the \n     Bankruptcy Code (and adds section 1308 to the Code) to \n     require a debtor to be current on the filing of tax returns \n     for the four years prior to the filing of a petition in order \n     to have a chapter 13 plan confirmed. If the returns have not \n     been filed by the date on which the meeting of creditors is \n     first scheduled, the trustee may hold open that meeting for a \n     reasonable period of time to allow the debtor to file any \n     unfiled returns. The additional period of time may not extend \n     beyond 120 days after the date of the meeting of the \n     creditors or beyond the date on which the return is due under \n     the last automatic extension of time for filing. However, the \n     debtor may also obtain an extension of time to file from the \n     court if the debtor demonstrates by a preponderance of the \n     evidence that the failure to file was attributable to \n     circumstances beyond the debtor's control.\n     Section 717. Standards for tax disclosure\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill. Under \n     current law, before a chapter 11 (business bankruptcy) plan \n     may be submitted to creditors and stockholders for a vote, \n     the proponent of the plan must file a disclosure statement in \n     which holders of claims and interests are given ``adequate \n     information'' on which they can make a decision as to whether \n     or not to vote in favor of the plan. A chapter 11 plan's tax \n     consequences represent an important aspect of that plan.\n       The conference agreement amends section 1125(a) of the \n     Bankruptcy Code to require that a chapter 11 disclosure \n     statement discuss the potential material Federal tax \n     consequences of the plan to the debtor and to holders of \n     claims and interests in the case.\n     Section 718. Setoff of tax refunds\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill. Under \n     current law, a petition for bankruptcy triggers an automatic \n     stay of the setoff of any debt owing to the debtor that arose \n     before the commencement of the case against any debt owed by \n     the debtor. This automatic stay precludes setoff of a pre-\n     petition tax refund against a pre-petition tax obligation \n     unless the bankruptcy court has approved the setoff. Because \n     the interest and penalties which may continue to accrue are \n     often nondischargeable, the inability to promptly apply \n     income tax refunds against tax claims can cause individual \n     debtors undue hardship.\n       The conference agreement amends section 362(b) of the \n     Bankruptcy Code to allow the setoff to occur unless setoff \n     would not be permitted under applicable tax law because of a \n     pending action to determine the amount or legality of the tax \n     liability. In that circumstance, the governmental authority \n     may hold the refund pending resolution of the action.\n     Section 719. Special provisions related to the treatment of \n         State and local taxes\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill, \n     conforming state and local income tax administrative issues \n     to the Internal Revenue Code. For example, under federal law, \n     a bankruptcy petitioner filing on March 5 has two tax years--\n     January 1 to March 4, and March 5 to December 31. However, \n     under the Bankruptcy Code, state and local tax years are \n     divided differently--January 1 to March 5, and March 6 to \n     December 31. Section 719 of the conference agreement requires \n     the states to follow the federal convention.\n       The conference agreement conforms state and local tax \n     administration to the Internal Revenue Code in the following \n     areas: division of tax liabilities and responsibilities \n     between the estate and the debtor, tax consequences with \n     respect to partnerships and transfers of property, and the \n     taxable period of a debtor. The conference agreement does not \n     conform state and local tax rates to federal tax rates.\n     Section 720. Dismissal for failure to timely file tax returns\n       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill. Under \n     existing law, there is no definitive rule concerning whether \n     a bankruptcy court should dismiss a bankruptcy case if the \n     debtor fails to file tax returns after entering bankruptcy. \n     The conferees believe that it is good policy to require that \n     these returns be filed.\n       Thus, the conference agreement amends section 521 of the \n     Bankruptcy Code to allow a taxing authority to request that \n     the court dismiss or convert a bankruptcy case if the debtor \n     fails to file a post-petition tax return or obtain an \n     extension on such a return. The conference agreement provides \n     that the debtor would have 90 days from the time of the \n     request to file the return or to obtain an extension, or the \n     court would be required to dismiss or convert the case.\n\n\n           Title VIII--Ancillary and other cross-border cases\n\n       This Title adds a new chapter to the Bankruptcy Code (the \n     ``Code'') for transactional bankruptcy cases. This \n     incorporates the Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency to \n     encourage cooperation between the United States and foreign \n     countries with respect to transnational insolvency cases. \n     Title IX is intended to provide greater legal certainty for \n     trade and investment as well as to provide for the fair and \n     efficient administration of cross-border insolvencies, which \n     protects the interests of creditors and other interested \n     parties, including the debtor. In addition, it serves to \n     protect and maximize the value of the debtor's assets.\n     Section 801. Amendment to add Chapter 15 to title 11, United \n         States Code\n       Each of the sections of new chapter 15 is discussed in \n     order.\n       Section 1501. Purpose and scope of application\n       The chapter introduces into the Bankruptcy Code the Model \n     Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (``Model Law''), which was \n     promulgated by the United Nations Commission on \n     International Trade Law (``UNCITRAL'') at its Thirtieth \n     Session, May 12-30, 1997.\n       Cases brought under this chapter are intended to be \n     ancillary to cases brought in a debtor's home country, unless \n     a full United States bankruptcy case is brought under another \n     chapter. Even if a full case is brought, the court may decide \n     under section 305 to stay or dismiss the United States case \n     under the chapter and limit the United States' role to \n     ancillary case under this chapter. If the full case is not \n     dismissed, it will be subject to the provisions of this \n     chapter governing cooperation, communication and coordination \n     with foreign courts and representatives. In any case, an \n     order granting recognition is required as a prerequisite to \n     use the sections 301 and 303 by a foreign representative.\n       Section 1501 combines the Preamble to the Model Law \n     (subsection (1)) with its article 1 (subsections (2) and \n     (3)). It largely follows the language of the Model Law and \n     fills in blanks with appropriate United States references. \n     However, it adds in subsection (3) an exclusion of certain \n     natural persons who may be considered ordinary consumers. \n     Although the consumer exclusion is not in the test of the \n     Model Law, the discussions at UNCITRAL recognized that some \n     such exclusion would be necessary in countries like the \n     United States where there are special provisions for consumer \n     debtors in the insolvency laws.\n       The reference to section 109(e) essentially defines \n     ``consumer debtors'' for purposes of the exclusion by \n     incorporating the debt limitations of that section, but not \n     its requirement or regular income. The exclusion adds a \n     requirement that the debtor or debtor couple be citizens or \n     long-term legal residents of the United States. This ensures \n     that residents of other countries will not be able to \n     manipulate this exclusion to avoid recognition of foreign \n     proceedings in their home countries or elsewhere.\n       The first exclusion in subsection (c) constitutes, for the \n     United States, the exclusion provided in article 1, \n     subsection (2), of the Model Law. Foreign representatives of \n     foreign proceedings which are excluded from the scope of \n     chapter 15 may seek relief from courts other than the \n     bankruptcy court since the limitations of section 1509(b) (2) \n     and (3) would not apply to them.\n       The reference to section 109(b) interpolates into chapter \n     15 the entities governed by specialized insolvency regimes \n     under United States law which are currently excluded from \n     liquidation proceedings under title 11. Section 1501 contains \n     an exception to the\n\n[[Page S11717]]\n\n     section 109(b) exclusions so that foreign proceedings of \n     foreign insurance companies are eligible for recognition and \n     relief under chapter 15 as they had been under section 304. \n     However, section 1501(d) has the effect of leaving to State \n     regulation any deposit, escrow, trust fund or the like posted \n     by a foreign insurer under State law.\n       Section 1502. Definitions\n       ``Debtor'' is given a special definition for this chapter. \n     That definition does not come from the Model Law but is \n     necessary to eliminate the need to refer repeatedly to ``the \n     same debtor as in the foreign proceeding.'' With certain \n     exceptions, the term ``person'' used in the Model Law has \n     been replace with ``entity,'' which is defined broadly in \n     section 101(15) to include natural persons and various legal \n     entities, thus matching the intended breadth of the term \n     ``person'' in the Model Law. The exceptions include contexts \n     in which a natural person is intended and those in which the \n     Model Law language already refers to both persons and \n     entities other than persons. The definition of ``trustee'' \n     for this chapter ensures that debtors in possession and \n     debtors, as well as trustees, are included in the term.\n       The definition of ``within the territorial jurisdiction of \n     the United States'' in subsection (7) is not taken from the \n     Model Law. It has been added because the United States, like \n     some other countries, assets insolvency jurisdiction over \n     property outside its territorial limits under appropriate \n     circumstances. Thus a limiting phrase is useful where the \n     Model Law and this chapter intend to refer only to property \n     within the territory of the enacting state. In addition, a \n     definition of ``recognition'' supplements the Model Law \n     definitions and merely simplifies drafting of various other \n     sections of chapter 15.\n       Two key definitions of ``foreign proceeding'' and ``foreign \n     representative,'' are found in sections 101(23) and (24), \n     which have been amended consistent with Model Law article 2.\n       The definitions ``establishment,'' ``foreign court,'' \n     ``foreign main proceeding,'' and ``foreign non-main \n     proceeding,'' have been taken from Model Law article 2, with \n     only minor language variations necessary to comport with \n     United States terminology. Additionally, defined terms have \n     been placed in alphabetical order.\n       In order to be recognized as a foreign non-main proceeding, \n     the debtor must at least have an establishment in that \n     foreign country.\n       Section 1503. International obligations of the United \n           States\n       This section is taken exactly from the Model Law with only \n     minor adaptations of terminology.\n       Although this sections makes an international obligation \n     prevail over chapter 15, the courts will attempt to read the \n     Model Law and the international obligation so as not to \n     conflict, especially if the international obligation \n     addresses a subject matter less directly related than the \n     Model Law to a case before the court.\n       Section 1504. Commencement of ancillary case\n       Article 4 of the Model Law is designed for designation of \n     the competent court which will exercise jurisdiction under \n     the Model Law. In United States law, section 1334(a) of title \n     28 gives exclusive jurisdiction to the district courts in a \n     ``case'' under this title.\n       Therefore, since the competent court has been determined in \n     title 28, this section instead provides that a petition for \n     recognition commences a ``case'', an approach that also \n     invokes a number of other useful procedural provisions.\n       In addition, a new subsection (P) to section 157 of title \n     28 makes cases under this chapter part of the core \n     jurisdiction of bankruptcy courts when referred to them by \n     the district court that will rule on the petition is \n     determined pursuant to a revised section 1410 of title 28 \n     governing venue and transfer.\n       The title ``ancillary'' in this section and in the title of \n     this chapter emphasizes the United States' policy in favor of \n     a general rule that countries other than the home country of \n     the debtor, where a main proceeding would be brought, should \n     usually act through ancillary proceedings, in preference to a \n     system of full bankruptcies (often called ``secondary'' \n     proceedings) in each state where assets are found. Under the \n     Model Law, notwithstanding the recognition of a foreign main \n     proceeding, full bankruptcy cases are permitted in each \n     country (see sections 1528 and 1529). In the United States, \n     the court will have the power to suspend or dismiss such \n     cases where appropriate under section 305.\n       Section 1505. Authorization to act in a foreign country\n       The language in this section varies from the wording of \n     articles 5 of the Model Law as necessary to comport with \n     United States law and terminology. The slight alteration to \n     the language in the last sentence is meant to emphasize that \n     the identification of the trustee or other entity entitled to \n     act is under United States law, while the scope of actions \n     that may be taken by the trustee or other entity under \n     foreign law is limited by the foreign law.\n       The related amendment to section 586(a)(3) of title 28 \n     makes acting pursuant to authorization under this section an \n     additional power of a trustee or debtor in possession.\n       While the Model Law automatically authorizes an \n     administrator to act abroad, this section requires all \n     trustees and debtors to obtain court approval before acting \n     abroad. That requirement is a change from the language of the \n     Model Law, but one that is purely internal to United States \n     law.\n       Its main purpose is to ensure that the court has knowledge \n     and control of possibly expensive activities, but it will \n     have the collateral benefit or providing further assurance to \n     foreign courts that the United States debtor or \n     representative is under judicial authority and supervision. \n     This requirement means that the first-day orders in \n     reorganization cases should include authorization to act \n     under this section where appropriate.\n       This section also contemplates the designation of an \n     examiner or other natural person to act for the estate in one \n     or more foreign countries where appropriate. One instance \n     might be a case in which the designated person had a special \n     expertise relevant to that assignment. Another might be where \n     the foreign court would be more comfortable with a designated \n     person than with an entity like a debtor in possession. \n     Either are to be recognized under the Model Law.\n       Section 1506. Public policy exception\n       This provision follows the Model Law article 5 exactly, is \n     standard in UNCITRAL texts and has been narrowly interpreted \n     on a consistent basis in courts around the world. The word \n     ``manifestly'' in international usage restricts the public \n     policy exemption to the most fundamental policies of the \n     United States.\n       Section 1507. Additional assistance\n       Subsection (1) follows the language of Model law article 7.\n       Subsection (2) makes the authority for additional relief \n     (beyond that permitted under sections 1519-1521, below) \n     subject to the conditions for relief heretofore specified in \n     United States law under section 304, which is repealed. This \n     section is intended to permit the further development of \n     international cooperation begun under section 304, but is not \n     to be the basis for denying of limiting relief otherwise \n     available under this chapter. The additional assistance is \n     made conditional upon the court's consideration of the \n     factors set forth in the current subsection 304(c) in a \n     context of a reasonable balancing of interests following \n     current case law. The references to ``estate'' in section 304 \n     have been changed to refer to the debtor's property, because \n     many foreign systems do not create an estate in insolvency \n     proceedings or the sort recognized under this chapter. \n     Although the case law, construing section 304 makes it \n     clear that comity is the central consideration, its \n     physical placement as one of six factors in subsection 304 \n     is misleading, since those factors are essentially \n     elements of the grounds for granting comity. Therefore, in \n     subsection (2) of this section, comity is raised to the \n     introductory language to make it clear that it is the \n     central concept to be addressed.\n       Section 1508. Interpretation\n       This provision follows conceptually Model law article 8 and \n     is a standard one in recent UNCITRAL treaties and model laws. \n     Language changes were made to express the concepts more \n     clearly in terminology which accords with that of the \n     bankruptcy laws of the United States.\n       Interpretation of this chapter on a uniform basis will be \n     aided by reference to the Guide and the Reports cited \n     therein, which explain the reasons for the terms used and \n     often cite their origins as well. Uniform interpretation will \n     also be aided by reference to CLOUT, the UNCITRAL Case Law On \n     Uniform Texts, which is a service of UNITRAL. CLOUT receives \n     reports from national reporters all over the world concerning \n     court decisions interpreting treaties, model laws, and other \n     text promulgated by UNCITRAL. Not only are these sources \n     persuasive, but they are important to the crucial goal of \n     uniformity of interpretation. To the extent that the United \n     States courts rely on these sources, their decisions will \n     more likely be regarded as persuasive elsewhere.\n       Section 1509. Right of direct access\n       This section implements the purpose of article 9 of the \n     Model Law, enabling a foreign representative to commence a \n     case under this chapter by filing a petition directly with \n     the court without preliminary formalities that may delay or \n     prevent relief. It varies the language to fit United States \n     procedural requirements and it imposes recognition of the \n     foreign proceeding as a condition to further rights and \n     duties of the foreign representative. If recognition is \n     granted, the foreign representative will have full capacity \n     under U.S. law (subsection (b)(1)), may request such relief \n     in a state or federal court other than the bankruptcy court \n     (subsection (b)(2)) and may be granted comity or cooperation \n     by such non-bankruptcy court (subsection (b)(3) and (c)). \n     Subsections (b)(2), (b)(3) and (c) make it clear that chapter \n     15 is intended to be the exclusive door to ancillary \n     assistance to foreign proceedings. The goal is to concentrate \n     control of these questions in one court. That goal is \n     important in a federal system like that of the United States \n     with many different courts, state and federal, that may have \n     pending actions involving the debtor or the debtor's \n     property. This section, therefore, completes for the United \n     States the work of article 4 of the Model Law (``competent \n     court'') as well as article 9.\n       Although a petition under current section 304 is the proper \n     method for achieving deference by a United States court to a \n     foreign insolvency under present law, some cases in state and \n     federal courts under current law have granted comity \n     suspension or dismissal\n\n[[Page S11718]]\n\n     of cases involving foreign proceedings without requiring a \n     section 304 petition or even referring to the requirements of \n     that section. Even if the result is correct in a particular \n     case, the procedure is undesirable, because there is room for \n     abuse of comity. Parties would be free to avoid the \n     requirements of this chapter and the expert scrutiny of the \n     bankruptcy court by applying directly to a state or federal \n     court unfamiliar with the statutory requirements. Such an \n     application could be made after denial of a petition under \n     this chapter. This section concentrates the recognition and \n     deference process in one United States court, ensures against \n     abuse, and empowers a court that will be fully informed of \n     the current status of all foreign proceedings involving the \n     debtor.\n       Subsection (d) has been added to ensure that a foreign \n     representative cannot seek relief in courts in the United \n     States after being denied recognition by the court under this \n     chapter.\n       Subsection (c) makes activities in the United States by a \n     foreign representative subject to applicable United States \n     law, just as 28 U.S.C. section 959 does for a domestic \n     trustee in bankruptcy.\n       Subsection (f) provides a limited exception to the prior \n     recognition requirement so that collection of a claim which \n     is property of the debtor, for example an account receivable, \n     by a foreign representative may proceed without commencement \n     of a case or recognition under this chapter.\n       Section 1510. Limited jurisdiction\n       Section 1510, article 10 of the Model Law, is modeled on \n     section 306 of the Code. Although the language referring to \n     conditional relief in section 306 is not included, the court \n     has the power under section 1522 to attach appropriate \n     conditions to any relief it may grant. Nevertheless, the \n     authority in section 1522 is not intended to permit the \n     imposition of jurisdiction over the foreign representative \n     beyond the boundaries of the case under this chapter and any \n     related actions the foreign representative may take, such as \n     commencing a case under another chapter of this title.\n       Section 1511. Commencement of case under section 301 or 303\n       This section follows the intent of article 11 of the Model \n     Law, but adds language that conforms to United States law or \n     that is otherwise necessary in the United States given its \n     many bankruptcy court districts and the importance of full \n     information and coordination among them.\n       Article 11 does not distinguish between voluntary and \n     involuntary proceedings, but seems to have implicitly assumed \n     an involuntary proceeding.\n       Subsection 1(a)(2) goes farther and permits a voluntary \n     filing, with its much simpler requirements, if the foreign \n     proceeding that has been recognized is a main proceeding.\n       Section 1512. Participation of a foreign representative in \n           a case under this title\n       This section follows article 12 of the Model Law with a \n     sight alternation to adjust to United States procedural \n     terminology. The effect of this section is to make the \n     recognized foreign representative a party in interest in any \n     pending or later commenced United States bankruptcy case.\n       Throughout this chapter, the word ``case'' has been \n     substituted for the word ``proceeding'' in the Model Law when \n     referring to cases under the United States Bankruptcy Code, \n     to conform to United States usage.\n       Section 1513. Access of foreign creditors to a case under \n           this title\n       This section mandates nondiscriminatory or ``national'' \n     treatment for foreign creditors, except as provided in \n     subsection (b) and section 1514. It follows the intent of \n     Model Law article 13, but the language required alternation \n     to fit into the Bankruptcy Code.\n       The law as to priority for foreign claims that fit within a \n     class given priority treatment under section 507 (for \n     example, foreign employees or spouses) is unsettled. This \n     section permits the continued development of case law on that \n     subject and its general principle of national treatment \n     should be an important factor to be considered. At a minimum, \n     under this section, foreign claims must receive the treatment \n     given to general unsecured claims without priority, unless \n     they are in a class of claims in which domestic creditors \n     would also be subordinated.\n       The Model Law allows for an exception to the policy of \n     nondiscrimination as to foreign revenue and other public law \n     claims. Such claims (such as tax and social security claims) \n     have been denied enforcement in the United States \n     traditionally, inside and outside of bankruptcy. The Code is \n     silent on this point, so the rule is purely a matter of \n     traditional case law. It also allows the Department of the \n     Treasury to negotiate reciprocal arrangements with out tax \n     treaty partners in this regard, although it does not mandate \n     any restriction of the evolution of case law pending such \n     negotiations.\n       Section 1514. Notification of foreign creditors concerning \n           a case under title 11.\n       This section ensures that foreign creditors receive proper \n     notice of cases in the United States.\n       As ``foreign creditor'' is not defined term, foreign \n     addresses are used as the distinguishing factor. The Federal \n     Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure (``Rules'') should be amended \n     to conform to the requirements of this section, including a \n     special form for initial notice to such creditors. In \n     particular, the Rules must provide for additional time for \n     such creditors to file proofs of claim where appropriate and \n     must provide for the court to make specific orders in that \n     regard in proper circumstances. The notice must specify that \n     secured claims must be asserted, because in many countries \n     such claims are not affected by an insolvency proceeding and \n     need not be filed. Of course, if a foreign creditor has made \n     an appropriate request for notice, it will receive notices in \n     every instance where notices would be sent to other creditors \n     who have made such requests.\n       Subsection (d) replaces the reference to ``a reasonable \n     time period'' in Mode Law article 14(3)(a). It makes clear \n     that the Rules, local rules, and court orders must make \n     appropriate adjustments in time periods and bar dates so that \n     foreign creditors have a reasonable time within which to \n     receive notice or take an action.\n       Section 1515. Application for recognition of a foreign \n           proceeding\n       This section follows article 15 of the Model Law with minor \n     changes.\n       The Rules will require amendment to provide forms for some \n     or all of the documents mentioned in this section, to make \n     necessary additions to Rules 1000 and 20002 to facilitate \n     appropriate notices of the hearing on the petition for \n     recognition, and to require filing of lists of creditors and \n     other interested persons who should receive notices. \n     Throughout the Model Law, the question of notice procedure is \n     left to the law of the enacting state.\n       Section 1516. Presumptions concerning recognition\n       This section follows article 16 of the Model Law with minor \n     changes.\n       Although section 1515 and 1516 are designed to make \n     recognition as simple and expedient as possible, the court \n     may hear proof on any element stated. The ultimate burden as \n     to each element is on the foreign representative, although \n     the court is entitled to shift the burden to the extent \n     indicated in section 1516. The word ``proof'' in subsection \n     (3) has been changed to ``evidence'' to make it clearer using \n     United States terminology that the ultimate burden is on the \n     foreign representative.\n       ``Registered office'' is the term used in the Model Law to \n     refer to the place of incorporation or the equivalent for an \n     entity that is not a natural person.\n       The presumption that the place of the registered office is \n     also the center of the debtor's main interest is included for \n     speed and convenience of proof where there is not serious \n     controversy.\n       Section 1517. Order granting recognition\n       This section closely follows article 17 of the Model Law, \n     with a few exceptions.\n       The decision to grant recognition is not dependent upon any \n     findings about the nature of the foreign proceedings of the \n     sort previously mandated by section 304(c). The requirements \n     of this section, which incorporates the definitions in \n     section 1502 and sections 101(23) and (24), are all that must \n     be fulfilled to attain recognition.\n       Reciprocity was specifically suggested as a requirement for \n     recognition on more than one occasion in the negotiations \n     that resulted in the Model Law. It was rejected by \n     overwhelming consensus each time. The United States was one \n     of the leading countries opposing the inclusion of a \n     reciprocity requirement. In this regard, the Model Law \n     conforms to section 304, which has no such requirement.\n       The drafters of the Model Law understood that only a main \n     proceeding or a non-main proceeding meeting the standards of \n     section 1502 (that is, one brought where the debtor has an \n     establishment) were entitled to recognition under this \n     section. The Model Law has been slightly modified to make \n     this point clear by referring to the section 1502 definition \n     of main and non-main proceedings, as well as to the general \n     definition of a foreign proceeding in section 101(23). \n     Naturally, a petition under section 1515 must show that \n     proceeding is a main or a qualifying non-main proceeding in \n     order to win recognition under this section.\n       Consistent with the position of various civil law \n     representatives in the drafting of the Model Law, recognition \n     creates a status with the effects set forth in section 1520, \n     so those effects are not viewed as orders to be modified, as \n     are orders granting relief under section 1519 and 1521. \n     Subsection (4) states the grounds for modifying or \n     terminating recognition. On the other hand, the effects of \n     recognition (found in section 1520 and including an automatic \n     stay) are subject to modification under section 362(d), made \n     applicable by section 15320(2), which permits lifting the \n     stay of section 1520 for cause.\n       Paragraph 1(d) of section 17 of the Model Law has been \n     omitted as an unnecessary requirement for United States \n     purposes, because a petition submitted to the wrong court \n     will be dismissed or transferred under other provisions of \n     United States law.\n       The reference to section 350 refers to the routine closing \n     of a case that has been completed and will invoke \n     requirements including a final report from the foreign \n     representative in such form as the Rules may provide or a \n     court may order.\n       Section 1518. Subsequent information\n       This section follows the Model Law, except to eliminate the \n     word ``same'' which is rendered unnecessary by the definition \n     of ``debtor'' in section 1502 and to provide for a formal \n     document to be filed with the court.\n       Judges in several jurisdictions, including the United \n     States, have reported a need for a\n\n[[Page S11719]]\n\n     requirement of complete and candid reports to the court of \n     all proceedings, worldwide, involving the debtor. This \n     section will ensure that such information is provided to the \n     court on a timely basis. Any failure to comply with this \n     section will be subject to the sanctions available to the \n     court for violations of the statue. The section leaves to the \n     Rules the form of the required notice and related questions \n     of notice to parties in interest, the time for filing, and \n     the like.\n       Section 1519. Relief may be granted upon petition for \n           recognition of a foreign proceeding\n       This section generally follows article 19 of the Model Law.\n       The bankruptcy court will have jurisdiction to grant \n     emergency relief under Rule 7065 pending a hearing on the \n     petition for recognition. This section does not expand or \n     reduce the scope of section 105 as determined by cases under \n     section 105 nor does it modify the sweep of sections 555 to \n     560. Subsection (d) precludes injunctive relief against \n     police and regulatory action under section 1519, leaving \n     section 105 as the only avenue to such relief. Subsection (e) \n     makes clear that this section contemplates injunctive relief \n     and that such relief is subject to specific rules and a body \n     of jurisprudence. Subsection (f) was added to complement \n     amendments to the Code provisions dealing with financial \n     contracts.\n       Section 1520. Effects of recognition of a foreign main \n           proceeding\n       In general, this chapter sets forth all the relief that is \n     available as a matter of right based upon recognition \n     hereunder, although additional assistance may be provided \n     under section 1507 and this chapter have no effect on any \n     relief currently available under section 105.\n       The stay created by article 20 of the Model law is imported \n     to chapter 15 from existing provisions of the Code. \n     Subsection (a)(1) combines subsections 1(a) and (b) of \n     article 20 of the Model Law, because section 362 imposes the \n     restrictions required by those two subsections and additional \n     restrictions as well.\n       Subsections (a)(2) and (4) apply the Code sections that \n     impose the restrictions called for by subsection 1(c) of the \n     Model Law. In both cases, the provisions are broader and more \n     complete than those contemplated by the Model Law, but \n     include all the restrains the Model Law provisions would \n     impose.\n       As the foreign proceeding may or may not create an \n     ``estate'' similar to that created in cases under this title, \n     the restraints are applicable to actions against the debtor \n     under section 362(a) and with respect to the property of the \n     debtor under the remaining sections. The only property \n     covered by this section is property within the territorial \n     jurisdiction of the United States as defined in section 1502. \n     To achieve effects on property of the debtor which is not \n     within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States, the \n     foreign representative would have to commence a case under \n     another chapter of this title.\n       By applying section 361 and 362, subsection (a) makes \n     applicable the United States exceptions and limitation to the \n     restraints imposed on creditors, debtors, and other in a case \n     under this title, as stated in article 20(2) of the Model \n     Law. It also introduces the concept of adequate protection \n     provided in sections 362 and 363.\n       These exceptions and limitations include these set forth in \n     section 362(b), (c) and (d). As one result, the court has the \n     power to terminate the stay pursuant to section 362(d), for \n     cause, including a failure of adequate protection.\n       Subsection (a)(2), by its reference to section 363 and 552 \n     adds to the powers of a foreign representative of a foreign \n     main proceeding an automatic right to operate the debtor's \n     business and exercise the power of a trustee under section \n     363 and 542, unless the court orders otherwise. A foreign \n     representative of a foreign main proceeding may need to \n     continue a business operation to maintain value and granting \n     that authority automatically will eliminate the risk of \n     delay. If the court is uncomfortable about his authority in a \n     particular situation it can ``order otherwise'' as part of \n     the order granting recognition.\n       Two special exceptions to the automatic stay are embodied \n     in subsections (b) and (c). To preserve a claim in certain \n     foreign countries, it may be necessary to commence an action. \n     Subsection (b) permits the commencement of such an action, \n     but would not allow for its further prosecution. Subsection \n     (c) provides that there is not stay of the commencement of a \n     full United States bankruptcy case. This essentially provides \n     an escape hatch through which any entity, including the \n     foreign representative, can flee into a full case. The full \n     case, however, will remain subject to subchapter IV and V on \n     cooperation and coordination of proceedings and to \n     section 305 providing for stay or dismissal.\n       Section 108 of the Bankruptcy Code provides the tolling \n     protection intended by Model Law article 2(3), so no \n     exception is necessary as to claims that might be \n     extinguished under United States law.\n       Section 1521. Relief that may be granted upon recognition \n           of a foreign proceeding\n       This section follows article 21 of the Model Law, with \n     detailed changes to fit United States law.\n       The exceptions in subsection (a)(7) relate to avoiding \n     powers. The foreign representative's status as to such powers \n     is governed by section 1523 below. The avoiding power in \n     section 549 and the exceptions to that power are covered by \n     section 1520(a)(2).\n       The word ``adequately'' in the Model Law, articles 21(2) \n     and 22(1), has been changed to ``sufficiently'' in section \n     1521(b) and 1522(a) to avoid confusion with a very \n     specialized legal term in United States bankruptcy, \n     ``adequate protection.''\n       Subsection (c) is designed to limit relief to assets having \n     some direct connection with a non-main proceeding, for \n     example where they were part of an operating division in the \n     jurisdiction of the non-main proceeding when they were \n     fraudulently conveyed and then brought to the United States. \n     Subsections (d), (e) and (f)j are identical to those same \n     subsections of section 1519.\n       This section does not expand or reduce the scope of relief \n     currently available in ancillary cases under sections 105 and \n     304 nor does it modify the sweep of section 555 through 560.\n       Section 1522. Protection of creditors and other interested \n           persons\n       This section follows article 22 of the Model Law with \n     changes for United States usage and references to relevant \n     Code sections.\n       It gives the bankruptcy court broad latitude to mold relief \n     to circumstances, including appropriate responses if it is \n     shown that the foreign proceeding is seriously and \n     unjustifiably injuring United States creditors. For response \n     to a showing that the conditions necessary to recognition did \n     not actually exist or have ceased to exist, see section 1517. \n     Concerning the change of ``adequately'' in the Model Law to \n     ``sufficiently'' in this section, see section 1521 Subsection \n     (d) is new and simply makes clear that an examiner appointed \n     in a case under chapter 15 shall be subject to certain duties \n     and bonding requirements based on those imposed on trustees \n     and examiners under other chapters of this title.\n       Section 1523. Actions to avoid acts detrimental to \n           creditors\n       This section follows article 23 of the Model Law, with \n     wording to fit it within procedure under this title.\n       It confers standing on a recognized foreign representative \n     to assert an avoidance action but only in a pending case \n     under another chapter of this title. The Model Law is not \n     clear about whether it would grant standing in a recognized \n     foreign proceeding if not full case were pending. This \n     limitation reflects concerns raised by the United States \n     delegation during the UNCITRAL debates that a single grant of \n     standing to bring avoidance actions neglects to address very \n     difficult choice of law and forum issues. This limited grant \n     of standing in section 1523 does not create or establish any \n     legal right of avoidance nor does it create or imply any \n     legal rules with respect to the choice of applicable law as \n     to the avoidance of any transfer or obligation.\n       The courts will determine the nature and extent of any such \n     action and what national law may be applied to such action.\n       Section 1524. Intervention by a foreign representative\n       The wording is the same as the Model Law, except for a few \n     clarifying words.\n       This section gives the foreign representative whose foreign \n     proceeding has been recognized the right to intervene in \n     United States cases, state or federal, where the debtor is a \n     party. Recognition begin an act under federal bankruptcy law, \n     it must take effect in state as well as federal courts. This \n     section does not require substituting the foreign \n     representative for the debtor, although that result may be \n     appropriate in some circumstances.\n       Section 1525. Cooperation and direct communication between \n           the court and foreign courts or foreign representatives\n       The wording is almost exactly that of the Model Law.\n       The right or courts to communicate with other courts in \n     worldwide insolvency cases is of central importance. This \n     section authorizes courts to do so. This right must be \n     exercised, however, with due regard to the rights of the \n     parties. Guidelines for such communications are left to the \n     Rules.\n       Section 1526. Cooperation and direct communication between \n           the trustee and foreign courts or foreign \n           representatives\n       This section follows the Model Law almost exactly.\n       The language in Model Law article 26 concerning the \n     trustee's function was eliminated as unnecessary because \n     always implied under United States law. The section \n     authorizes the trustee, including a debtor in possession, to \n     cooperate with other proceedings.\n       Subsection (3) is not taken from the Model Law but is added \n     so that any examiner appointed under this chapter will be \n     designated by the United States Trustee and will be bonded.\n       Section 1527. Forms of cooperation\n       This section follows the Model Law exactly. United States \n     bankruptcy courts have already engaged in most of the forms \n     of cooperation mentioned here, but they now have explicit \n     statutory authorization for acts like the approval of \n     protocols of the sort used in cases.\n       Section 1528. Commencement of a case under title 11 after \n           recognition of a foreign main proceeding\n       This section follows the Model Law, with specifics of \n     United States law replacing the general clause at the end to \n     cover assets normally included within the jurisdiction of the \n     United States courts in bankruptcy cases,\n\n[[Page S11720]]\n\n     except where assets are subject to the jurisdiction of \n     another recognized proceeding.\n       In a full bankruptcy case, the United States bankruptcy \n     court generally has jurisdiction over assets outside the \n     United States. Here that jurisdiction is limited where those \n     assets are controlled by another recognized proceeding, if it \n     is a main proceeding.\n       The court may use section 305 of this title to dismiss, \n     stay, or limit a case as necessary to promote cooperation and \n     coordination in a cross-border case. In addition, although \n     the jurisdictional limitation applies only to United States \n     bankruptcy cases commenced after recognition of a foreign \n     proceeding, the court has ample authority under the next \n     section and section 305 to exercise its discretion to \n     dismiss, stay, or limit a United States case filed after a \n     petition for recognition of a foreign main proceeding has \n     been filed but before it has been approved, if recognition is \n     ultimately granted.\n       Section 1529. Coordination of a case under title 11 and a \n           foreign proceeding\n       This section follows the Model Law almost exactly, but \n     subsection (4) adds a reference to section 305 to make it \n     clear the bankruptcy court may continue to use that section, \n     as under present law, to dismiss or suspend a United States \n     case as part of coordination and cooperation with foreign \n     proceedings. This provision is consistent with United States \n     policy to act ancillary to a foreign main proceeding whenever \n     possible.\n       Section 1530. Coordination of more than one foreign \n           proceeding\n       This section follows exactly article 30 of the Model Law.\n       It ensures that a foreign main proceeding will be given \n     primacy in the United States, consistent with the overall \n     approach of the United States favoring assistance to foreign \n     main proceedings.\n       Section 1531. Presumption of insolvency based on \n           recognition of a foreign main proceeding\n       This section follows the Model Law exactly, inserting a \n     reference to the standard for an involuntary case under this \n     title.\n       Where an insolvency proceeding has begin in the home \n     country of the debtor, and in the absence of contrary \n     evidence, the foreign representative should not have to make \n     a new showing that the debtors in the sort of financial \n     distress requiring a collective judicial remedy. The word \n     ``proof'' here means ``presumption.'' The presumption does \n     not arise for any purpose outside this section.\n       Section 1532. Rule of payment in concurrent proceeding\n       This section follows the Model Law exactly and is very \n     similar to prior section 508(a), which is repealed. The Model \n     Law language is somewhat clearer and broader than the \n     equivalent language of prior section 508(a).\n     Section 802. Other amendments to titles 11 and 28, United \n         States Code\n       Other sections of title 11 have been amended to apply \n     relevant provisions in those sections to chapter 15 and to \n     specify which portions of chapter 15 apply in cases under \n     other chapters of title 11.\n       The key definitions of foreign proceeding and foreign \n     representative do not appear in chapter 15, but rather \n     replace the prior definitions of those terms in section \n     101(23) and 101(24). The new definitions are nearly identical \n     to those contained in the Model Law but add to the phrase \n     ``under a law relating to insolvency'' the words ``or debt \n     adjustment.'' This addition emphasizes that the scope of the \n     Model Law and chapter 15 is not limited to proceedings \n     involving only debtors which are technically insolvent, but \n     broadly includes all proceedings involving debtors in severe \n     financial distress, so long as those proceedings also meet \n     the other criteria of section 101(24).\n       The amendment to section 157(b)(2) of title 28 provides \n     that proceedings under chapter 15 will be core proceedings \n     while other amendments to title 28 provide that the United \n     States Trustee's standing extend to cases under chapter 15 \n     and that the United States Trustee's duties include acting in \n     chapter 15 cases.\n       Although the United States will continue to assert \n     worldwide jurisdiction over property of a domestic or foreign \n     debtor in a full bankruptcy case under chapters 7 and 13 of \n     this title, subject to deference to foreign proceedings under \n     chapter 15 and section 305, the situations different in a \n     case commenced under chapter 15. There the United States is \n     acting solely in an ancillary position, so jurisdiction over \n     property is limited to that stated in chapter 15.\n       Amendments to section 109 permit recognition of foreign \n     proceedings involving foreign insurance companies and \n     involving foreign banks which do not have a branch or agency \n     in the United States (as defined in 12 U.S.C. section 3103). \n     While a foreign bank not subject to United States regulation \n     will be eligible for chapter 15 as a consequence of the \n     amendment to section 109, section 303 prohibits the \n     commencement of a full involuntary case against such a \n     foreign bank unless the bank is a debtor in a foreign \n     proceeding.\n       While section 304 is repealed and replace by chapter 15, \n     access to the jurisprudence which developed under section 304 \n     is preserved in the context of new section 1507. On deciding \n     whether to grant the Additional Assistance contemplated by \n     section 1507, the Court must consider the same factors that \n     had been imposed by former section 304.\n       The venue provisions for cases ancillary to foreign \n     proceedings have been amended to provide a hierarchy of \n     choices beginning with principal place of business in the \n     United States, if any. If there is no principal place of \n     business in the United States, but there is litigation \n     against a debtor, then the district in which the litigation \n     is pending would be the appropriate venue. In any other case, \n     venue must be determined with reference to the interests of \n     justice and the convenience of the parties.\n\n\n                title ix--financial contract provisions\n\n       This title addresses recently prominent forms of financial \n     investments which require special treatment in the insovlency \n     context. It amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to \n     provide treatment financial contracts, commodities contracts, \n     securities contracts, forward contracts, repurchase \n     agreements and swaps. It also amends the Bankruptcy Code to \n     provide appropriate treatment for those types of financial \n     investments. The Securities Investor Protection Act is \n     amended as well to create an exception from the stay under \n     that Act for certain financial investment instruments. \n     Finally, the Bankruptcy Code is amended to deal with certain \n     specialized aspects of asset securitization.\n\n\n                 title x--protection of family farmers\n\n     Section 1001. Permanent reenactment of chapter 12\n       Under subsection 1001(a) chapter 12 (Adjustment of Debts of \n     a Family Farmer with Regular Annual Income) is reenacted \n     effective October 1, 1999. No time limit or termination date \n     is established for chapter 12 under this provision. \n     Subsection 1001(b) repeals subsection 302(f) of the \n     Bankruptcy, Judges, United States Trustees, and Family Farmer \n     Bankruptcy Act of 1986, which set a now outdated termination \n     date of October 1, 1998 for chapter 12.\n     Section 1002. Debt limit increase\n       This section amends section 104(b) of title 11, United \n     States Code, providing for annual or biannual adjustments of \n     the debt limit for family farmers beginning with the \n     adjustment to be made on April 1, 2001.\n     Section 1003. Certain claims owed to governmental units\n       Subsection 1003(a) provides for payment in full of all \n     claims entitled to section 507 priority unless the claim is \n     owed to a governmental unit arising from the sale, exchange, \n     or other disposition of any farm asset used in the debtor's \n     farming operation. In that case, the claim is treated as an \n     unsecured claim and the underlying debt is treated the same \n     if the debtor receives a discharge or the holder of a \n     particular claim agrees to a different treatment of that \n     claim. Subsection 1003(b) amends section 1231(d) of chapter \n     11, providing that any governmental unit'' may provide a \n     determination regarding the tax effects of a proposed plan \n     under chapter 12.\n\n\n              Title XI--Health Care and Employee Benefits\n\n       This title amends the Bankruptcy Code to deal with the \n     problems presented when a health care business, such as a \n     hospital or nursing home, files for bankruptcy under chapters \n     7, 9 or 11.\n     Section 1101. Definitions\n       Section 1101 defines the terms ``health care business,'' \n     ``patients,'' and ``patient records,'' which are added to \n     definitions section of the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. '101).\n     Section 1102. Disposal of patient records\n       Section 1102 adds a new section 351 in subchapter III of \n     Chapter 3 of title 11 dealing with the protection and \n     disposal of patient records in a health care business \n     bankruptcy situation.\n       The Trustee is required to follow certain procedures with \n     respect to general and specific notice to patients and \n     insurance companies regarding patient records, as well as the \n     transfer and disposal of such records. These procedures are \n     intended to protect the privacy and confidentiality of an \n     individual's medical records when they are in the custody of \n     a health care business that has filed for bankruptcy relief.\n     Section 1103. Administrative expenses claim for costs of \n         closing a health care business\n       Section 1103 amends section 503(b) of title 11, making the \n     actual, necessary costs and expenses of closing a health care \n     business, including the cost or expense of disposing of \n     patient records and transferring patients to another health \n     care facility, an allowable administrative expense.\n     Section 1104. Appointment of ombudsman to act as patient \n         advocate\n       Section 1104 (a) adds a new section 332 in subchapter II of \n     chapter 3 of title 11, providing that the court appoint an \n     ombudsman to act as an advocate for patients of health care \n     facilities that have filed for bankruptcy. The ombudsman will \n     monitor the quality of patient care and report to the court \n     every 60 days regarding the quality of that care. If the \n     ombudsman determines that patient care is declining \n     significantly or is otherwise materially compromised, he/she \n     is to immediately notify the court by motion or written \n     report, with notice to appropriate parties in interest. The \n     ombudsman is to treat any information obtained regarding \n     patients as confidential information. The ombudsman may not \n     review confidential patient records, without the prior \n     approval of the court and under restrictions protecting their \n     confidentiality. Section 1104(b) provides for compensation of \n     an ombudsman under section 330(a)(1) of title 11.\n\n[[Page S11721]]\n\n     Section 1105. Debtor in possession; duty of trustee to \n         transfer patients\n       Section 1105 amends section 704(a) of title 11, stating \n     that the trustee is to use all reasonable and best efforts to \n     transfer patients from a health care facility being closed to \n     another nearby and comparable health care facility, which \n     maintains a reasonable quality of care.\n     Section 1106. Exclusion from program participation not \n         subject to automatic stay\n       This section permits the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services to exclude the debtor from participation in the \n     medicare program or other Federal healthcare program without \n     violating the automatic stay.\n\n\n                    Title XII--Technical Amendments\n\n     Section 1201. Definitions\n       This section makes technical corrections to the definitions \n     of the Bankruptcy Code, alters the definitions for ``single \n     asset real estate'' and ``transfer'', and renumbers the \n     definitions.\n     Sections 1202--1212. Miscellaneous technical corrections\n       These provisions make technical changes to the Bankruptcy \n     Code provisions on adjustment of dollar amounts, extensions \n     of time, dismissal, bankruptcy petition preparers, \n     compensation of professionals, conversion, administrative \n     expenses, discharge, discriminatory treatment, and property \n     of the estate provisions.\n     Section 1213. Preferences\n       This provision overrules Levit v. Ingersoll Rand Financial \n     Corp. (In re V.N. Deprizio Const. Co.), 874 F.2d 1186 (7th \n     Cir. 1989). If a transfer is avoided because it was made \n     during the period 90 days-1 year before bankruptcy to a non-\n     insider creditor for the benefit of an insider, the transfer \n     is avoided only with respect to the insider. It is not \n     avoided with respect to the non-insider creditor, and \n     neither the transferred property nor its value may be \n     recovered from the non-insider creditor.\n     Sections 1214-1217. Miscellaneous technical corrections\n       These sections make technical changes to the Bankruptcy \n     Code provisions on postpetition transactions, property of the \n     estate, municipal bankruptcy and railroad line abandonments.\n     Section 1219. Discharge under chapter 12\n       Section 1219 amends section 1228 (which deals with \n     discharge under chapter 12) of the Bankruptcy Code to correct \n     erroneous references.\n     Section 1220. Bankruptcy cases and proceedings\n       Section 1220 of the of the Act amends section 1334(d) of \n     title 28 of the United States Code to correct erroneous \n     references.\n     Section 1221. Knowing disregard of bankruptcy law or rule\n       This section amends section 156(a) of title 18 of the \n     United States Code, which defined ``bankruptcy petition \n     preparer'' and ``document for filing,'' by making stylistic \n     changes and by making a correct reference to title 11 of the \n     United States Code.\n     Section 1222. Transfers made by nonprofit charitable \n         corporations\n       Section 1222 amends section 363(d) of the Bankruptcy Code \n     to restrict the right of a trustee to use, sell, or lease \n     property owned by a nonprofit corporation or trust. First, \n     the use, sale or lease must be in accordance with applicable \n     nonbankruptcy law and must not be inconsistent with any \n     relief granted under certain specified provisions of section \n     362 of the Bankruptcy Code concerning the applicability of \n     the automatic stay. Second, the section imposes similar \n     restrictions with regard to chapter 11 plan confirmation \n     requirements. Third, it amends section 541 of the Bankruptcy \n     Code to provide that any property of a bankruptcy estate, \n     where the debtor is a nonprofit corporation (as described in \n     section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code) may be \n     transferred to an entity that is not such a corporation, but \n     only under the same conditions that would apply if the debtor \n     was not in bankruptcy. The amendments made by this section \n     apply to cases pending on the date of enactment of this Act. \n     A limited exception pertains with respect to confirmation of \n     a chapter 11 plan.\n     Section 1223. Protection of valid purchase money security \n         interests\n       Section 1223 amends section 547(c)(3)(B) of the Bankruptcy \n     Code extending the applicable perfection period for a \n     security interest in property acquired by the debtor from 20 \n     days to 30 days after the debtor receives possession of the \n     property.\n     Section 1224. Extensions\n       Section 302(d)(3) of the Bankruptcy, Judges, U.S. Trustees, \n     and Family Farmer Bankruptcy Act of 1986 is amended by \n     striking out all references to ``or October 1, 2002, \n     whichever occurs first'' and ``October 1, 2003, or'' and \n     ``whichever occurs first''. These changes permanently extend \n     the bankruptcy administrator program in Alabama and North \n     Carolina.\n     Section 1225. Bankruptcy judgeships\n       This section may be cited as the ``Bankruptcy Judgeship Act \n     of 2000.'' It authorizes the appointment of additional \n     temporary bankruptcy judgeships in the districts that follow:\n       (A) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the eastern \n     district of California.\n       (B) Four additional bankruptcy judgeships for the central \n     district of California.\n       (C) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the district of \n     Delaware.\n       (D) Two additional bankruptcy judgeships for the southern \n     district of Florida.\n       (E) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the southern \n     district of Georgia.\n       (F) Two additional bankruptcy judgeships for the district \n     of Maryland.\n       (G) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the eastern \n     district of Michigan.\n       (H) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the southern \n     district of Mississippi.\n       (I) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the district of \n     New Jersey.\n       (J) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the eastern \n     district of New York.\n       (K) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the northern \n     district of New York.\n       (L) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the southern \n     district of New York.\n       (M) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the eastern \n     district of North Carolina.\n       (N) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the eastern \n     district of Pennsylvania.\n       (O) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the middle \n     district of Pennsylvania.\n       (P) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the district of \n     Puerto Rico.\n       (Q) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the western \n     district of Tennessee.\n       (R) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the eastern \n     district of Virginia.\n       The section provides that judgeship vacancies in the above \n     districts resulting from death, retirement, resignation, or \n     removal of a bankruptcy judge which occur 5 years or more \n     after the appointment date shall not be filled.\n       The section also adds that temporary bankruptcy judgeships \n     authorized for the northern district of Alabama, the district \n     of Delaware, the district of Puerto Rico, the district of \n     South Carolina, and the eastern district of Tennessee under \n     the Bankruptcy Judgeship Act pf 1992 are extended until the \n     first vacancy resulting from the death, retirement, \n     resignation, or removal occurs:\n       (A) 8 years or more after November 8, 1993, in the northern \n     district of Alabama.\n       (B) 10 years or more after October 28, 1993, in the \n     district of Delaware.\n       (C) 8 years or more after August 29, 1994, in the district \n     of Puerto Rico.\n       (D) 8 years or more after June 27, 1994, in the district of \n     South Carolina.\n       (E) 8 years or more after November 23, 1993, in the \n     district of Tennessee.\n       The section also amends section 152(a)(1) of title 28 of \n     the United States Code. It adds that each judge shall be \n     appointed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the circuit in \n     which such a district is located.\n     Section 1226. Compensating trustees\n       This section amends section 326 (Limitation on Compensation \n     of Trustee) with a new subsection (e) providing that, in a \n     case where a trustee in a chapter 7 case makes a motion to \n     dismiss or convert under section 707(b) and such motion is \n     granted, the court shall allow ``reasonable compensation'' \n     under section 330(a) of title 11 for the services and \n     expenses of the trustee and the trustee's counsel. The \n     compensation covers the reasonable costs of preparing and \n     presenting the section 707(b) motion and any related appeals. \n     This section also adds a new subsection (f) to section 326 \n     providing that, subject to the limits established in \n     subsection 326(a), the court shall consider the ``results \n     achieved'' when determining a trustee's compensation. \n     Finally, this section amends subsection 1326(b) dealing with \n     payments under a chapter 13 plan. Specifically, a new \n     paragraph (3) is added to subsection 1326(b) establishing a \n     formula limiting the amount a debtor must pay under a plan to \n     compensate a chapter 7 trustee or trustee's attorney who has \n     been awarded fees in a chapter 7 case, when that compensation \n     is allowed under section 326(e).\n     Section 1227. Amendment to section 362 of title 11, U.S. Code\n       Amends section 362(b)(18) to exempt from the automatic stay \n     a special tax or special assessment on real property (whether \n     or not ad valorem), imposed by a governmental unit, if such \n     special tax or assessment comes due after the filing of the \n     bankruptcy petition.\n     Section 1228. Judicial education\n       Provides that the Director of the Federal Judicial Center, \n     in consultation with the Director of the Executive Office of \n     U.S. Trustees, shall develop materials and conduct such \n     training as may be useful to the courts in implementing this \n     Act, focusing in particular on the section 707(b) means test \n     and reaffirmation.\n     Section 1229. Reclamation\n       Subsection (a) of this section amends section 546(c) of \n     title 11, to allow a seller of goods to reclaim those goods \n     under certain circumstances and establishing the procedures \n     and time limits for doing so. This provision was amended in \n     1994 so as to expand the ability of sellers of goods to \n     reclaim such goods from a trustee by extending the \n     reclamation demand period from 10 days to 20 days. The \n     amendment made by this Act extends this period to 45 days, \n     subject to certain limitations and requirements. Under \n     existing law and this amendment, the rights and powers of the \n     trustee under sections 544(a), 545, 547 and 549 are subject \n     to the right of a seller of goods that has sold goods to the \n     debtor in the ordinary course of the seller's business.\n       Specifically, under the new subsection 546(c)(1), the \n     seller's rights to reclaim goods which an insolvent debtor \n     received not later than 45 days after the commencement of the\n\n[[Page S11722]]\n\n     case is not subject to certain of the trustee's avoiding \n     powers. However, the seller may not reclaim the goods unless \n     the seller makes a reclamation demand in writing: (A) not \n     later than 45 days of the date of receipt of such goods by \n     the debtor; or (B) not later than 20 days after the date of \n     commencement of the case, if the 45-day period expires after \n     commencement of the case. Subsection 546(c)(2) states that a \n     failure to provide notice in a manner required under \n     paragraph (1), does not preclude a seller from making a claim \n     under section 503(b)(8).\n       As amended, subsection 546(c) contains certain exceptions \n     to the seller's reclamation rights. First, such rights do not \n     apply to claims with respect to grain or fish covered in \n     subsection 546(d). Second, another exception is provided for \n     priority claims of a governmental unit under subsection \n     507(c) with respect to an erroneous refund or tax credit. \n     Finally, reclamation claims are also made subject to the \n     prior rights of holders of security interests in such goods \n     or the proceeds of the sale of such goods.\n       Subsection (b) of this section, amends section 503(b) of \n     title 11 to add a new paragraph (8) which provides for an \n     administrative expense allowance for the value of goods \n     received by the debtor not later than 20 days after filing, \n     if the goods were sold to the debtor in the ordinary course \n     of the debtor's business.\n     Section 1230. Providing requested tax documents to the court\n       Section 315 of HR 2415 amends section 521 of the Bankruptcy \n     Code to insert a new subsection which requires the debtor to \n     provide certain tax documents. In addition, under Rule 2004 \n     discovery, a debtor can be required to disclose tax returns \n     and other tax information in appropriate cases. If a debtor \n     fails to do so, this provision provides sanctions.\n       Subsection (a) withholds a discharge in a chapter 7 case \n     where the debtor has failed to provide requested tax \n     documents to the court. Similarly, subsection (b) provides \n     that the court shall not confirm a reorganization plan under \n     chapter 11 or chapter 13 unless and until requested tax \n     documents have been filed with the court. For these purposes, \n     failure to provide a tax return to the trustee is considered \n     a refusal to provide it to the court. Subsection (c) provides \n     that the bankruptcy court must retain all documents submitted \n     in support of an individual's bankruptcy claim under chapter \n     7, 11 or 13 for a period of not more than 3 years after the \n     conclusion of the case. In the event of a pending audit or \n     enforcement action, the court may extend the time for \n     retention of the documents beyond the 3 year minimum.\n     Section 1231. Encouraging creditworthiness\n       Subsection (a) expresses that it is the sense of Congress \n     that: (1) some lenders may offer credit to consumers, without \n     taking all the steps necessary to ensure that consumers have \n     the capacity to repay the resulting debts; and (2) the \n     availability of credit may be a factor contributing to \n     consumer insolvency. Subsection (b) authorizes the Federal \n     Reserve Board to conduct a study of credit industry practices \n     with respect to soliciting and extending credit. Subsection \n     (c) provides that, not later than 12 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Board shall make public a report \n     on the findings of its study of the credit industry. The \n     Board may then issue regulations that would require \n     additional disclosures to consumers and take any other \n     action, consistent with its statutory authority, to encourage \n     responsible lending practices and greater personal \n     responsibility on the part of consumers.\n     Section 1232. Property no longer subject to redemption\n       This section amends section 541(b) of the Bankruptcy Code \n     to clarify that pawned, tangible personal property (other \n     than securities or written or printed evidence of \n     indebtedness or title) cannot be treated as property of the \n     bankruptcy estate once the statutory redemption period has \n     run and the pawned goods have not been redeemed. Thus, pawned \n     personal property is not part of a debtor's bankruptcy \n     estate, after the time under the contract for redeeming the \n     property has expired. This codifies what most courts have \n     held, and will relieve the courts from the burden of having \n     to repeatedly rule on whether pawn transactions are subject \n     to the automatic stay.\n     Section 1233. Trustees\n       This section amends 28 U.S.C. 586(d) to allow private \n     trustees, appointed to a panel under subsection 586(a)(1) or \n     appointed under subsection 586(b), to obtain judicial review \n     when they are terminated or cease to be assigned cases. \n     Judicial review shall be available in the United States \n     district court for the district for which the panel to which \n     the trustee was appointed under subsection 586(a)(1) serves, \n     or the district where a trustee appointed under subsection \n     586(a) resides. The trustee must first exhaust all \n     administrative remedies which, if the trustee elects, shall \n     include a hearing on the record. The final agency decision \n     will be upheld unless it is found unreasonable and without \n     cause based upon the administrative record before the agency. \n     This section also amends 28 U.S.C. 586(e) to allow an \n     individual appointed under subsection 586(b) to seek judicial \n     review of a final agency decision to deny a claim for actual, \n     necessary expenses. Before seeking judicial review, the \n     individual must exhaust all available administrative remedies \n     and the final agency decision will be upheld unless it is \n     unreasonable and without cause based on the administrative \n     record.\n     Section 1234. Bankruptcy forms\n       This section amends 28 U.S.C. 2075 (Bankruptcy rules) by \n     adding at the end a requirement that a form be prescribed for \n     the statement required under section 707(b)(2)(C) of title 11 \n     concerning the debtor's current monthly income and the \n     calculations that determine whether a presumption of abuse \n     arises under section 707(b)(2)(A)(i). The form may provide \n     general rules on the content of the statement.\n     Section 1235. Expedited appeals of bankruptcy cases to courts \n         of appeals\n       Subsection (a) of this section strikes the existing \n     language contained in subsection 158(d) of title 28, United \n     States Code, and replaces it with language establishing an \n     expedited appeals process for judgments, decisions, orders, \n     or decrees issued by bankruptcy judges. Specifically, it \n     provides that where an appeal of a judgment, decision, order, \n     or decree of a bankruptcy judge is filed with the district \n     court, that judgment, decision, order, or decree shall be \n     deemed to be a judgment, decision, order, or decree of \n     (``entered by'') the district court 31 days after the appeal \n     is filed with the district court. This result will occur \n     unless, not later than 30 days after such an appeal is filed \n     with the district court, the district court: (1) files its \n     own decision on the appeal; (2) enters an order extending the \n     30-day period for cause upon a motion of a party or on its \n     own motion; or (3) all parties to the appeal file a written \n     consent that the district court may retain the appeal. An \n     appeal is to be considered filed with the district court on \n     the date the notice of appeal is filed, or on the date a \n     party makes an election under 28 U.S.C. 158(c)(1)(B).\n       This section also adds a new subsection (e) to 28 U.S.C. \n     158, providing that the courts of appeals have jurisdiction \n     over appeals from all final judgments, decisions, orders, and \n     decrees of district courts under subsection 158(a) and of \n     bankruptcy appellate panels under subsection 158(b). In \n     addition, the courts of appeals are granted jurisdiction over \n     appeals from all judgments, decisions, orders, and decrees of \n     the district courts entered under the new subsection 158(d), \n     to the extent such judgment, decision, order, and decree \n     would be reviewable by the district court under subsection \n     158(a). An appeal from a district court or a bankruptcy \n     appellate panel shall be taken in the same manner as civil \n     appeals are generally taken to the courts of appeals from the \n     district courts as provided in Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of \n     Appellate Procedure. The court of appeals, in its discretion, \n     may exercise jurisdiction over an appeal from an \n     interlocutory judgment, decision, order, or decree to the \n     extent provided in paragraph (3) of subsection (e).\n       Subsection (b) of section 1237 of this Act, merely makes \n     conforming changes substituting ``section 158(e)'' for \n     ``section 158(d)'' in three sections of the Code.\n     Section 1236. Exemptions\n       This section corrects a cross reference.\n\n\n      Title XIII--Methamphetamine and Other Controlled Substances\n\n       This title increases the controls on the manufacture and \n     sale of certain illegal drugs.\n\n\n                 Title XIV--Consumer Credit Disclosure\n\n     Section 1401. Enhanced disclosures under an open-ended credit \n         plan\n       This section would amend section 127(b) of the Truth in \n     Lending Act (``TILA'') to require new minimum payment \n     disclosures on monthly billing statements sent to \n     cardholders. Under this section, the front page of each \n     monthly billing statement must include a new minimum payment \n     disclosure. The contents of the disclosure will vary \n     depending upon the level of minimum payments required under \n     the applicable credit plan and whether the creditor is \n     subject to enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission \n     (``FTC''). It is intended that the Federal Reserve Board \n     (``FRB'') will implement the new disclosures in a manner that \n     will enable creditors to preprint the disclosures on the \n     billing statements they send to cardholders.\n       Disclosures by federally regulated financial institutions. \n     Financial institutions that are subject to enforcement under \n     TILA by a federal agency other than the FTC must provide a \n     minimum payment warning that will vary depending upon whether \n     the institution's credit plan typically requires a minimum \n     payment that is 4% or less, or more than 4%, of the \n     outstanding balance. If the institution's credit plan \n     requires minimum payments that are 4% or less of the \n     outstanding balance, the institution will include the \n     following on the front of the monthly billing statement.\n       ``Minimum Payment Warning: Making only the minimum payment \n     will increase the interest you pay and the time it takes to \n     repay your balance. For example, making only the typical 2% \n     minimum monthly payment on a balance of $1,000 at an interest \n     rate of 17% would take 88 months to repay the balance in \n     full. For an estimate of the time it would take to repay your \n     balance, making only minimum payments, call this toll-free \n     number ______.'':\n       If the financial institution requires a minimum payment of \n     more than 4% of the outstanding balance, the institution \n     would make the same minimum payment disclosure with a \n     different repayment example. Specifically, in such cases, the \n     institution would indicate that ``[m]aking a typical 5% \n     minimum monthly payment on a balance of $300 at an interest \n     rate of 17% would take 24 months to repay the balance in \n     full.'' However, such an institution may elect to use\n\n[[Page S11723]]\n\n     the example applicable to plans requiring minimum payments of \n     4% or less if it chooses to do so.\n       Federally regulated financial institutions also would be \n     required to include in the disclosure a toll-free telephone \n     number that the institution's open-end credit accountholders \n     may use to obtain information to be published by the FRB \n     estimating how long it could take to repay a similar \n     outstanding balance. The toll-free telephone number may be \n     operated individually by the institution, jointly with other \n     creditors, or by a third party. The toll-free number may \n     connect accountholders to an automated device that enables \n     accountholders to obtain information through use of a touch-\n     tone telephone or similar device, so long as accountholders \n     without a touch-tone telephone or similar device are provided \n     an opportunity to speak to an individual. The FRB is charged \n     with developing charts or tables showing how long it could \n     take to repay various balances, assuming the limited number \n     of repayment assumptions specified in the bill. It is \n     intended that the FRB, in preparing the charts or tables, \n     will use the same methodology as that used in calculating the \n     88-month and 24-month repayment periods set forth in the \n     disclosures in new paragraphs (11) (A), (B) and (C) of TILA \n     section 127(b). The FRB charts or tables would be used for \n     responding to accountholders who call the toll-free telephone \n     number.\n       A special rule is established for depository institutions \n     with total assets not exceeding $250 million. Under this \n     special rule, such depository institutions are not required \n     to comply with the toll-free number provision described \n     above. Instead, such depository institutions are required to \n     furnish a toll-free number which the FRB shall establish and \n     maintain itself, or have established and maintained by a \n     third party, for a period not to exceed 24 months following \n     the effective date of this Act. Once the FRB (or third party) \n     no longer maintains the toll-free telephone number, \n     depository institutions with total assets not exceeding $250 \n     million shall continue to be required to furnish a toll-free \n     telephone number under this Act.\n       Disclosures for creditors subject to FTC enforcement under \n     TILA. Creditors subject to FTC enforcement under TILA would \n     be required to include the same minimum payment disclosure as \n     financial institutions who require minimum payments in excess \n     of 4% of the outstanding balance. However, instead of \n     including a toll-free telephone number operated by the \n     creditor (or third party), those subject to FTC enforcement \n     under TILA would include a toll-free telephone number through \n     which accountholders could contact the FTC for an estimate of \n     the time it would take to repay the accountholder's \n     outstanding balance. In responding to accountholder calls \n     made to the toll-free number, the FTC will use the same \n     repayment charts or tables developed by the FRB.\n       Additional flexibility. In order to provide added \n     flexibility in making the new disclosures, new paragraph \n     (11)(D) allows a creditor to use its own repayment example \n     rather than those specified in subparagraphs (A), (B) or (C) \n     provided that the creditor's example is based on an interest \n     rate greater than 17%.\n       Exemptions from new disclosure requirements. The new \n     section 127(b)(11) does not apply to charge card accounts \n     provided that the primary purpose of such accounts is to \n     require payment of charges in full each month.\n       Disclosures for creditors providing actual number of months \n     to repay balance. Under new section 127(b)(11)(J), a creditor \n     is not subject to new sections 127(b) (11)(A) or (B) if the \n     creditor maintains a toll-free number which provides open-end \n     credit accountholders with the actual number of months that \n     it will take to repay the accountholder's outstanding \n     balance. In order to qualify for the exemption in \n     subparagraph (J), the creditor would simply include the \n     following statement on each billing statement as provided in \n     new subparagraph (K) (as included in section 1234 of this \n     Act):\n       ``Making only the minimum payment will increase the \n     interest you pay and the time it takes to repay your balance. \n     For more information, call this toll-free number: ______.''\n       The toll-free number may be operated individually by the \n     institution, jointly with other creditors or by a third \n     party. It is intended that the toll-free number may connect \n     accountholders to an automated device that enables them to \n     obtain information through the use of a touch-tone telephone \n     or similar device, so long as accountholders without a touch-\n     tone telephone or similar device are provided the opportunity \n     to speak with an individual.\n       FRB study. In addition, the FRB has the authority to \n     conduct a study, if it chooses to do so, to determine the \n     types of information available to potential borrowers \n     regarding factors of notifying potential borrowers for \n     credit, repayment requirements, and the consequences of \n     default.\n       Effective date. New section 127(b)(11) of TILA and any \n     regulations promulgated by the FRB to implement section \n     127(b)(11) will not take effect until the later of: (A) 18 \n     months after the date of enactment of this Act; or (B) 12 \n     months after the publication of final regulations by the FRB.\n     Section 1402. Enhanced disclosure for credit extension \n         secured by a dwelling\n       This section adds a new disclosure that must be made by \n     creditors who make either open-end or closed-end loans to \n     consumers if those loans are secured by the consumer's \n     principal dwelling. This section provides that, in connection \n     with credit applications and credit advertisements for such \n     loans, the creditor must disclose to the consumer that if the \n     loan exceeds the fair market value of the dwelling, the \n     interest on the portion of the credit that exceeds the fair \n     market value is not tax deductible for federal income tax \n     purposes and that the consumer may want to consult a tax \n     advisor for further information regarding the deductibility \n     of interest and charges. This section and any regulations \n     issued by the FRB to implement this section will not take \n     effect until the later of: (A) 12 months after the date of \n     enactment of the Act; or (B) 12 months after publication of \n     the final regulations by the FRB.\n     Section 1403. Disclosure related to ``introductory rates''\n       This section mandates new disclosures regarding \n     introductory rates on open-end credit card accounts if those \n     rates will be in effect for less than 1 year (``temporary \n     rates''). This section provides that an application or \n     solicitation to open a credit card account which is described \n     in section 127(c)(1) of TILA must comply with the following \n     requirements if the account offers a temporary rate:\n       1. Each time the temporary rate appears in the written \n     materials, the term ``introductory'' must appear clearly and \n     conspicuously in immediate proximity to the rate itself.\n       2. If the rate that will apply after the temporary rate \n     expires will be a fixed rate, the creditor must disclose the \n     time period in which the introductory period will expire and \n     the annual percentage rate that will apply after the end of \n     the introductory period. This disclosure must be made clearly \n     and conspicuously in a prominent location closely proximate \n     to the first listing of the temporary rate. This disclosure \n     does not apply to any listing of a temporary rate on an \n     envelope or other enclosure in which an application or \n     solicitation is mailed.\n       3. If the annual percentage rate that will apply after the \n     expiration of the temporary rate will be a variable rate, the \n     creditor must disclose the time period in which the \n     introductory period will expire and an annual percentage rate \n     that was in effect within 60 days before the date of mailing \n     the application or solicitation. Like the fixed-rate \n     disclosure, this disclosure must be made clearly and \n     conspicuously in a prominent location closely proximate to \n     the first listing of the temporary rate. This disclosure does \n     not apply to any listing of a temporary rate on an envelope \n     or other enclosure in which an application or solicitation is \n     mailed.\n       4. If the temporary rate can be revoked for reasons other \n     than the expiration of the introductory period, the creditor \n     must clearly and conspicuously disclose on or with the \n     application or solicitation a general description of the \n     circumstances that may result in the revocation of the \n     temporary rate and either the fixed rate that would apply \n     upon the revocation of the temporary rate, or in the case of \n     a variable rate program, the rate that was in effect within \n     60 days before the date of mailing the application or \n     solicitation.\n       Effective date. This section and any regulations \n     promulgated by the FRB to implement this section will not \n     take effect until the later of: (A) 12 months after the date \n     of enactment of this Act; or (B) 12 months after the \n     publication of final regulations by the FRB.\n     Section. 1404. Internet-based credit card solicitations\n       This section requires that the existing TILA credit card \n     application and solicitation disclosures must be made in \n     connection with a solicitation to open a credit card account \n     via the Internet. It also requires that the new introductory \n     rate disclosures required under section 1603 of this Act must \n     be made in connection with Internet solicitations, as \n     applicable. All disclosures required under this section must \n     be made in a clear and conspicuous manner. The disclosures \n     must be readily accessible to consumers in close proximity to \n     the solicitation to open a credit card account, and updated \n     regularly to reflect the current policies, terms, and fee \n     amounts applicable to the credit card account. It is intended \n     that the disclosures can be made by allowing a consumer to \n     use a ``link'' or similar method to view the disclosures. \n     This section and any regulations promulgated by the FRB to \n     implement this section will not take effect until the later \n     of: (A) 12 months after the date of enactment of this Act; or \n     (B) 12 months after the publication of final regulations by \n     the FRB.\n     Section 1405. disclosures related to late payment deadlines \n         and penalties\n       This section requires that each monthly billing statement \n     sent to credit cardholders and other open-end credit \n     borrowers must include a new disclosure if a late payment fee \n     will be imposed on the borrower for failing to make the \n     minimum payment by the payment due date. In such cases, the \n     monthly billing statement must clearly and conspicuously \n     state the date that the payment is due or, if the card issuer \n     contractually establishes a different date, the earliest date \n     on which (or time period in which) a late payment fee may be \n     charged and the amount of the late payment fee to be imposed \n     if payment is made after that date (or time period). This \n     section and any regulations promulgated by the FRB to \n     implement this section will not take effect until the later \n     of: (A) 12 months after the date of enactment of this Act; or \n     (B) 12 months after the publication of final regulations by \n     the FRB.\n\n[[Page S11724]]\n\n     Section 1406. Prohibition on certain actions for failure to \n         incur finance changes\n       This section prohibits a creditor under an open-end \n     consumer credit plan from terminating an account of a \n     consumer prior to its expiration date (e.g., expiration of \n     the card in the case of a credit card account) solely because \n     the consumer has not incurred finance charges on the account. \n     This provision makes it clear, however, that the creditor may \n     terminate the account if it is inactive for three or more \n     consecutive months. New section 127(h) of TILA and any \n     regulations promulgated by the FRB to implement new section \n     127(h) will not take effect until the later of: (a) 12 months \n     after the date of enactment of this Act; or (b) 12 months \n     after the publication of final regulations by the FRB.\n     Section 1407. Dual use debit card\n       This section permits the FRB to conduct a study of existing \n     consumer protections, including voluntary industry rules, \n     that limit the liability for consumers when a consumer's ATM \n     card or debit card is used to access the consumer's asset \n     account without the consumer's authorization.\n     Section. 1408. Study of bankruptcy impact of credit extended \n         to dependent students\n       This section directs the FRB to conduct a study regarding \n     the impact that the extension of credit to certain students \n     has on the rate of bankruptcy. Specifically, the study must \n     examine the bankruptcy impact of extending credit to \n     consumers who are claimed as a dependent by their parents or \n     others for federal tax purposes and who are enrolled within 1 \n     year of successfully completing all required secondary \n     education requirements on a full-time basis in post-secondary \n     educational institutions. The results of the study must be \n     reported to Congress within 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of the Act.\n     Section 1409. Clarification of clear and conspicuous\n       This section directs the Board, in consultation with other \n     federal banking agencies, the National Credit Union \n     Administration and the FTC, to promulgate regulations, \n     including examples of model disclosures, to provide guidance \n     regarding the meaning of ``clear and conspicuous'' as used in \n     sections 127(b)(11)(A), (B) and (C) and 127(c)(6)(A)(ii) and \n     (iii) of TILA as added by this Act.\n\n\n      Title XV--General Effective Date; Application of Amendments\n\n     Section 1501. Effective date; application of amendments.\n       The amendments made by the Act take effect 180 days after \n     the date of enactment, except as provided elsewhere in the \n     Act. These amendments apply only with respect to cases \n     commenced after the effective date.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Thank you. We are in agreement on what this legislation \ndoes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the Bankruptcy \nReform Conference Report that is being considered by the Senate. Let me \nstart by noting that there is strong opposition to this bill--in its \ncurrent form--by consumer advocacy groups such as the National Women's \nLaw Center, the Association for children for Enforcement of Support, \nand the Consumer Federation of America.\n  This conference report is an illustration of what happens when a \nsound idea is submitted to an unsound process. The idea of reforming \nthe Bankruptcy Code to stop obvious abuses was an idea that had broad \nsupport. It was a bipartisan issue. Regrettably, however, this modest \nand sensible idea--the idea that we should close the loopholes that a \nsmall number of people were using to game the system--has been warped \ninto legislation that goes far beyond its original purposes.\n  The process that created this conference report was highly partisan \nand highly unusual. Its provisions were drafted by one party meeting in \nsecret, with no formal input from members of the Democratic Party. \nIndeed, no formal conference was ever held. Instead, at the last minute \nthe majority found a stalled Department of State authorization bill \nthat was being managed by Senators who were sympathetic to their \nversion of the bankruptcy bill and they performed a legislative bait \nand switch. They deleted every word from the Department of State bill \nand then inserted every word of their bankruptcy bill.\n  Now the Senate is being asked to vote on a so-called Department of \nState authorization bill that contains not a word about the Department \nof State. The Department of State bill is nothing but an empty vessel \ninto which a so-called ``compromise'' bankruptcy bill has been poured. \nBut we have to be careful here--the word ``compromise'' doesn't mean \nwhat it used to mean, what it normally means in the legislative \nprocess. This isn't a compromise between the two Houses of Congress. \nThis isn't a compromise between the two parties. This compromise bill \nis the result of negotiations among like-minded men and women of the \nsame political party. This is a majority-only bill. There has been no \nmeaningful compromise at all.\n  Aside from the procedural problems with how this bill has been \nhandled, I have deep and serious concerns about the substance of this \nlegislation.\n  This legislation will unintentionally injure honest hard-working \nAmericans who have fallen on hard times through no fault of their own. \nThe reason that we have a Bankruptcy Code is because life sometimes \ndeals people a bad hand and we believe that it's important to give \npeople a fresh start--an opportunity to overcome the financial \nmisfortunes that have struck them. This principle is so fundamental \nthat the Constitution expressly lists the establishment of uniform \nbankruptcy laws as a congressional responsibility. It seems that the \nFramers understood that society is better off if we find an orderly way \nto allow people to pay off their debts to the degree possible, and then \nget back on their feet as productive citizens. Regrettably, that \nprinciple seems to suffer at the hands of this conference report.\n\n  Evidence suggests that the vast majority of people who file for \nbankruptcy do so because some financial crisis beyond their control has \nplunged them into debt that they cannot avoid. People file for \nbankruptcy because they've lost their jobs or because a child needs \nmedical care that is not covered by insurance.\n  The evidence shows that abusive filings are the exception, not the \nrule. The median income of the average American family filing for a \nchapter 7 bankruptcy is just above $20,000 per year, according to the \nGeneral Accounting Office. The majority of people who file for \nbankruptcy are single women who are heads of households, elderly people \ntrying to cope with medical costs, again people who have lost their \njobs, or families whose finances have been complicated by divorce.\n  For the most part, we are talking about working people or elderly \npeople on fixed incomes, who through no fault of their own have fallen \non hard times and need the protection of bankruptcy to help put their \nlives back together. It is also worth noting that last year, the per \ncapita personal bankruptcy rate dropped by more than 9 percent, and \nagain this year the bankruptcy rate has dropped.\n  The impact that this legislation would have on single-parent \nhouseholds is particularly disturbing to me. Single parents have one of \nthe hardest jobs in America. Most work all day, cook meals, keep house, \nhelp their children with homework, and schedule doctors' appointments, \nparent-teacher meetings, and extracurricular activities. Life isn't \neasy for working single parents and often the financial assistance they \nreceive in the form of alimony or child support is critical to keeping \ntheir families from falling into poverty. I believe that the conference \nreport before the Senate would frustrate the efforts of single-parent \nfamilies to collect support payments.\n  I understand that the proponents of this bill believe that they have \ntreated single-parent families fairly. But what I am worried about is \nthe unintended--but perfectly foreseeable--consequences of allowing \nmore debts to survive bankruptcy.\n  For more than 100 years, the Bankruptcy Code has given women and \nchildren an absolute preference over all others who have claims on a \ndebtor's estate. Under the well-established rule, if a divorced person \nfiles for bankruptcy, the court doesn't require that person's ex-spouse \nor children to compete with creditors for the funds needed to pay child \nsupport and alimony. Instead, alimony and child support are taken out \nof the debtor's monthly income first and if there is anything left \nover, it is made available to commercial creditors. If there is nothing \nleft over, then the commercial or consumer debts are discharged and the \ndebtor's only remaining obligation is to the ex-spouse and children.\n  This conference report would change the rules. For the first time, it \nwould make credit card and other consumer debts essentially \nnondischargable. So, while a divorced spouse would still be obliged to \npay alimony and child support, his or her other unsecured debts would \nremain intact.\n  Proponents of this bill say this does no harm to divorced spouses and \ntheir\n\n[[Page S11725]]\n\nchildren because ex-spouses are still at the front of the collections \nline. But there is a huge practical difference between being first in \nline and being the only one in line. Under current law, nonsupport \ndebts are often discharged and debtors can focus entirely on meeting \ntheir obligations to their children and ex-spouses. If this conference \nreport becomes law, that will change--debtors will not be able to focus \non their children, they will--as a matter of law--have to divert \nlimited financial resources to pay back consumer creditors.\n  I believe that this change will inevitably lead to conflicts between \ncommercial creditors and single parents who are owed support and \nalimony payments. Sure, they will be first in line, but single parents \nwill be competing with large creditors. Creditors, I might add, who are \nwell-represented by teams of lawyers.\n  I believe that it is a mistake to make single parents compete with \nteams of lawyers for the money they need to feed and clothe and educate \ntheir children.\n  I understand the perspective that says that all debts should be \npaid--but when debtors simply cannot pay all of their debts, then I \nbelieve that our laws should protect the interests of children and \nfamilies first. Under this legislation, a child support payment could \nvery well be reduced in order to satisfy an unsecured commercial \ncreditor. In my view, that change would place the well-being of a child \nat a disadvantage and elevate the status of the unsecured creditor.\n  Low-income children and families will be put at a practical \ndisadvantage by this bill and will ultimately suffer greater economic \ndeprivation because they cannot afford to compete with sophisticated \ncreditors.\n  Mr. President, Congress should reform the Bankruptcy Code, but we \nneed to do so in a responsible and effective and fair way. In my \nopinion, this conference report--even though it was well-intentioned--\nhas not answered this call.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today we reach a point that has been far \ntoo long in coming: a vote on final passage of bankruptcy reform. Just \ntwo days ago, the Senate voted overwhelmingly--67 to 31--to end debate \non this legislation.\n  I expect the same strong endorsement in today's vote.\n  For reasons that we are all aware of, it has been a prolonged and \ncomplicated process that has brought us to this point today. In one of \nour very first votes this year, the Senate passed bankruptcy reform \nlegislation by the overwhelming margin of 83 to 14. Similar legislation \npassed the House last year, 313 to 108. I personally believe that we \nshould not have waited for legislation that passed both Houses by \noverwhelming margins, many months ago, to finally reach the floor of \nthe Senate in the last hours of this session.\n  For vast, bipartisan majorities of both houses, the idea that we need \nto restore some balance to our bankruptcy code is not controversial.\n  The legislation before us today does indeed tighten current law. It \nassures that those who have the ability to pay--but only those with the \nability to pay--will have to complete at least a partial repayment \nplan. This fundamental change will affect probably fewer than 10 \npercent of the people who file for bankruptcy, and only those who have \nthe demonstrated ability to pay.\n  I would bet, that most of our constituents would be surprised to find \nthat is not the case today. Today's code makes no clear distinction \nbetween those who have the income to pay some of their debts and those \nwhose only recourse is to sell off whatever assets they have to pay \ntheir creditors. The bill before us corrects that basic flaw.\n  I am convinced that flaw has a lot to do with the fact that \nbankruptcy filings have been at record levels in recent years, in spite \nof the strongest economy we have ever enjoyed. And--contrary to some of \nthe assertions we have heard recently, those filings are not going \ndown. After a leveling off, following interest rate reductions a couple \nof years ago that made credit easier, the latest statistics show a \nrevival in the record wave of bankruptcy filings in recent months. The \nproblem has not gone away--and the growing evidence of a slowing \neconomy means we should expect even more filings in the coming months.\n  The fact is, Mr. President, that we have before us legislation that \nis the result of weeks of debate and amendment here on the Senate floor \nlast year. Although we could not convene a formal conference, further \nbipartisan discussions continued this summer, including the direct \nparticipation of the White House. I ask my colleagues to consider how \nclosely the legislation before us today matches the letter and the \nspirit of the bill that had such overwhelming support earlier this \nyear.\n  I also strongly urge the President to reconsider his threat to veto \nthis legislation, that contains many provisions that are the product of \ndirect negotiations with his White House. I know that important voices \nin his administration continue to support bankruptcy reform, and I hope \nthat he will heed their advice.\n  We still have a strong safe harbor, to protect families below the \nmedian income, along with adjustments for additional expenses that will \nassure that only those with real ability to pay will be steered from \nChapter Seven to Chapter 13. Senate language, that gives judges the \ndiscretion to determine whether there are special circumstances that \njustify those expenses, prevailed over stricter House language.\n\n  Beyond that, the Senate-passed safe harbor provision has actually \nbeen strengthened, with additional protection for those between 100 and \n150 percent of the national median income, who are largely exempted \nfrom the means test.\n  Compared to current law, this legislation provides increased \nprotections against creditors who try to abuse the reaffirmation \nprocess. This bill also imposes new requirements on credit card \ncompanies to explain to their customers the implications of making \nminimum payments on their bills every month.\n  And a feature of this legislation that I think deserves much more \nemphasis is its historic improvement in the treatment of family support \npayments--child support and alimony. Compared to current law, there are \nnumerous specific new protections for those who depend on those \npayments.\n  The improvements are so important that they have the endorsement of \nthe National Child Support Enforcement Association, the National \nDistrict Attorneys Association, and the National Association of \nAttorneys General.\n  These are the people who are actually in the businesses of making \nsure that family support payments are made. One passage from a letter \nsent to members of the Senate Judiciary Committee deserves repeating \nhere, Mr. President. Referring to the very real advantages which this \nlegislation would provide to the women and children who depend on those \nsupport payments, they say that, and I quote ``defeat of this \nlegislation based on vague and unarticulated fears'' would be \n``throwing out the baby with the bathwater.''\n  I think this last line from the letter deserves special stress: ``No \none who has a genuine interest in the collection of support should \npermit such inexplicit and speculative fears to supplant the specific \nand considerable advantages which this reform legislation provides to \nthose in need of support.''\n  Mr. President, I can think of no stronger rebuttal to the arguments \nwe have heard recently about the supposed effects of this legislation \non the women and children who depend on alimony and child support.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to briefly address two issues that \nhave been raised by the President, and by opponents of this \nlegislation. I honestly believe that compared to the many substantial \nvictories for Senate positions, those two issues fall far short of \njustifying a change in the overwhelming support bankruptcy reform has \nreceived in the last two sessions of Congress.\n  First, there is the issue of the homestead cap. One of the most \negregious examples of abuse under current law is the ability of wealthy \nindividuals, on the eve of filing for bankruptcy, to shelter income \nfrom legitimate creditors by buying an expensive house in one of the \nhandful of states that have an unlimited homestead exemption in \nbankruptcy.\n  It is one of the most egregious abuses, Mr. President, but it is \nactually pretty rare, involving only a very\n\n[[Page S11726]]\n\nfew of the millions of bankruptcies that have been filed in recent \nyears. Nevertheless, it is an abuse that should be eliminated. Senator \nKohl and Senator Sessions have been the leaders in the Senate on this. \nThey are the reason why the Senate included a strong provision--a \n``hard cap'' of $100,000 on the value of a home that could be exempt \nfrom creditors in bankruptcy.\n\n  That provision is not in the bill before us today, Mr. President, but \nthe worst abuse--the last-minute move to shelter assets from \ncreditors--has been eliminated. To be eligible for any state's \nhomestead exemption, a bankruptcy filer must have lived in that state \nfor the last two years before filing. If you buy a home within two \nyears of filing, your exemption is capped at $100,000. That is a huge \nimprovement over current law.\n  So I say to my colleagues: if you want to eliminate the worse abuse \nof the homestead exemption, then you will vote for the conference \nreport before us today.\n  That brings us to the last of the major issues--one that we have come \nto call the Schumer Amendment, because of the energy and dedication of \nmy friend and colleague from New York.\n  We all know of the confrontations--sometimes peaceful, sometimes \ntragically violent--that have occurred in recent years between pro-life \nand pro-choice groups over access to family planning clinics. Because \nof the threat to the Constitutional rights of the people who run those \nclinics and their patrons, Congress passed, and President Clinton \nsigned, the Free Access to Clinic Entrances Act in 1993. That law makes \nit a crime--punishable by fines as well as imprisonment--to block \naccess to family planning clinics.\n  Some of those who have been arrested and prosecuted under that law \nhave brazenly announced that they plan to file for bankruptcy, to \nescape the consequences of their crimes--specifically, to avoid paying \ndamages. Some of these individuals have in fact filed for bankruptcy.\n  But in no case--in no case that I am aware of, Mr. President, or that \nthe Congressional Research Service has been able to find--has any \nindividual escaped a single dollar's liability by filing for \nbankruptcy. Not a dollar, not a dime, not a penny. It hasn't happened, \nand it won't happen. The reason is simple: current bankruptcy already \nstates that such settlements--for ``willful and malicious'' conduct--\nare not dischargeable in bankruptcy.\n  If that were not enough, current case law supports a very strong \nreading of that provision of current law. When one clinic \ndemonstrator--who violated a restraining order--attempted to have the \nsettlement against her wiped out in bankruptcy, her claim was rejected \nout of hand. The violation of a restraining order setting physical \nlimits around a clinic has been ruled to be ``wilful and malicious'' \nunder the current code. The penalties she was assessed were not \ndischargeable.\n  Mr. President, the Congressional Research Service, as of October 26, \nconducted an exhaustive, authoritative search which, and I quote: ``did \nnot reveal any reported decisions where such liability was discharged \nunder the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.''\n  So the current bankruptcy statute--and the most recent case law on \nthis point--all say that the Schumer Amendment is not needed. That is \nto take nothing away from the hard work and dedication of my friend and \ncolleague on the Judiciary Committee, or to minimize the frustration \nand outrage many Americans feel at the announced attempts to abuse the \nbankruptcy code. It is simply to say that the women who use and who \noperate family planning clinics are not without recourse, and not \nwithout the full protection of the law, under the current bankruptcy \ncode.\n  I repeat, Mr. President: no one has escaped liability under the Fair \nAccess to Clinics Entrances Act through an abuse of the bankruptcy \ncode. No one.\n  So, Mr. President, we will vote today on a conference report that has \na strong Senate stamp on it, that contains important victories for \nSenate positions, victories that make the bill in some ways fairer and \nmore balanced than the version that passed here in January by an \noverwhelming vote.\n  While the homestead provision is not what I hoped it would be, I will \nvote for closing the worst aspects of the homestead loophole in the \ncurrent code. I will not let the best be the enemy of the good.\n  And I will vote for this conference report confident that family \nplanning clinics, and the women who need and use them, will continue to \nenjoy the full protection available under current law.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I support bankruptcy reform, and I \nvoted in favor of the Senate bankruptcy bill, this past February. \nSimply put, people who can afford to repay their debts, should repay \ntheir debts.\n  However, I cannot support the version of bankruptcy legislation \noutlined in the Conference Report to H.R. 2415. The Conference Report \nhas dropped key provisions from the Senate-passed bankruptcy bill, and \nhas failed to protect consumers against irresponsible creditor \npractices. Thus, I intend to vote ``No''.\n  Let me recount my concerns.\n  First, the Conference Report lets wealthy individuals continue to \npurchase multimillion dollar homes that are shielded from creditors' \nbankruptcy claims. The Senate bill curbed this abuse, voting 76-22 to \napprove the Kohl amendment placing a $100,000 nationwide cap on \nhomestead exemptions. The Conference Report replaced the Kohl amendment \nwith a two-year ownership or residency requirement that wealthy debtors \ncan easily sidestep. Debtors should not be able to avoid their \nobligations by funneling money into extravagant estates. The Conference \nReport lets this egregious practice continue.\n  Second, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of Senator Schumer's \namendment to prevent anti-abortion extremists from using bankruptcy \nlaws to avoid paying civil judgements against them. The Senate passed \nthe Schumer amendment by an overwhelming 80-17 vote. It protects a \nwoman's right to choose and the ongoing effectiveness of the Freedom of \nAccess to Clinic Entrances, FACE, Act. The FACE Act has led to \nsuccessful criminal and civil judgements against groups that use \nintimidation and outright violence to prevent people from obtaining or \nproviding reproductive health services. I am deeply disappointed that \nthe Conference Report has omitted this important provision.\n  Third, I had hoped that the Conference Report would work to improve \nthe limited consumer credit card protections in the Senate bill. \nUnfortunately, the Conference Report has gone the other way--consumer \nprotections have been deleted. For example, the Senate passed an \namendment by Senator Byrd that would have required any credit card \nsolicitation on the Internet to be accompanied by information from the \nFederal Trade Commission, FTC, that gives consumers advice about \nselecting and using credit cards. The Conference Report dropped this \nprovision.\n  Additionally, the Conference Report deleted an amendment by Senator \nLevin that would have made it clear that consumers do not owe interest \nfor on-time credit card payments. Presently, many credit card \nsolicitations advise consumers that interest is not charged on payments \nmade within a grace period (such as 25 days). However, in the fine \nprint, these agreements state that if the entire debt is not paid back, \nthe cardholder is liable for interest on the full amount charged. Say \n$995 is paid off of a $1,000 credit debt, most people reasonably assume \nthat they owe interest on just the unpaid $5. Not so. The credit card \ncompany will charge consumers interest retroactively on the full \n$1,000. This important amendment would have brought interest charges in \nline with consumer expectations.\n  When analyzing legislation, it is often telling to review the \nopinions of those groups with no financial stake in the outcome. \nOverwhelmingly, the non-partisan experts on bankruptcy--the judges, \ntrustees, and academics--have expressed serious concerns or opposition \nto this bankruptcy bill. These organizations include the National \nBankruptcy Conference, NBC, the National Conference of Bankruptcy \nJudges, NCBJ, the National Association of Chapter 13 Trustees, NACTT, \nthe National Association of Bankruptcy Trustees, NABT, and law \nprofessors from many of our nation's law schools.\n\n[[Page S11727]]\n\nOn October 30, 2000, for example, 91 law professors wrote to me that \nthe ``bill is deeply flawed,'' and will not achieve balanced reform. \nThe professors state that ``. . . the problems with the bankruptcy bill \nhave not been resolved, particularly those provisions that adversely \naffect woman and children.''\n  Congress should also take note that, after soaring to record levels \nin the mid-1990s, bankruptcy filings declined in recent years. In 1998, \nbankruptcy filings totaled 1,442,549. In 1999, bankruptcy filings \ntotaled 1,319,540 cases, a decline of almost 10 percent from the \nprevious year.\n  A final note, Mr. President. When the 107th Congress convenes, the \nSenate will be evenly divided for the first time in over a century. If \nwe are to govern, to conduct the nation's business, we have to be able \nto work across party lines. The bankruptcy Conference Report we are \nconsidering this afternoon is a case study of how not to govern. There \nwas no conference; this report emerged as the product of negotiations \nheld exclusively between House and Senate Republicans. Maybe if they \nhad consulted with the minority, they could have fashioned a bill the \nminority could support. But they didn't. They deliberately excluded us. \nThe result is a Conference Report the President has vowed to veto.\n  Bankruptcy reform requires a balanced bill that is fair to both \ndebtors and creditors. This bill doesn't measure up. I intend to vote \nno on passage of the Conference Report to H.R. 2415. I hope that \nCongress will revisit bankruptcy reform in the 107th Congress, and work \nin a bipartisan way to address known abuses in our bankruptcy laws.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I strongly believe that reform of our \nbankruptcy laws is necessary. During the 105th and 106th Congress, I \nsupported legislation to reform bankruptcy laws and end the abuse of \nthe system. However, I am unable to support the conference report of \nthe Bankruptcy Reform Bill because I believe it is unfair and \nunbalanced, was completed without appropriate consideration by the \nMinority party, and is unfair to many working families and single \nmothers. Sponsors of bankruptcy reform have justified the legislation \nby arguing that the bill is necessary because we are in the midst of a \n``bankruptcy crisis.'' I am among those who believe that, too often, \nbankruptcy is used as an economic tool to avoid responsibility for \nunsound decisions and reckless spending. There has been a decline in \nthe stigma of filing for bankruptcy, and appropriate changes are \nnecessary to ensure that bankruptcy is no longer considered a lifestyle \nchoice. However, I must point out that the current numbers show that \nthe bankruptcy rate is lower than it was when the bill was first \nintroduced. Indeed, if the bankruptcy reform act had been enacted into \nlaw, the sponsors would undoubtedly now be taking credit for this \nturnaround in the bankruptcy numbers. However, the current decline came \nabout without Congressional intervention, demonstrating that to some \ndegree, free-market forces work to correct any over-use of the \nbankruptcy system. The reason is that lenders and credit card \ncompanies, in an effort to maximize their profits, can and do respond \nto an unexpected increase in personal bankruptcies by curtailing new \nlending to consumers who are credit risks. However, there are still \nthose who will game the system, and we should narrowly craft \nlegislation to address such abuse. Unfortunately, this bill fails to \ntake a balanced approach to bankruptcy reform. I had hoped that through \na legitimate legislative process we would arrive at a compromise that \nwould have ended the abuses but still provided our most vulnerable \ncitizens with adequate protections. This bill does just the opposite: \nIt harms those who most need bankruptcy protection and protects those \nwho don't. For instance, the bill's safe harbor will not benefit \nindividuals in most need of help. Because the safe harbor is based on \nthe combined income of the debtor and the debtor's spouse, many single \nmothers who are separated from their husbands and who are not receiving \nchild support will not be able to take advantage of the safe harbor \nprovision. In other words, a single mother who is being deprived of \nneeded support from a well-off spouse is further harmed by this bill, \nwhich will deem the full income of that spouse available to pay debts \nfor the safe harbor determination. Moreover, the bill jeopardizes the \npost-bankruptcy collection of child support. By creating many new types \nof nondischargeable debts in favor of credit card companies, the bill \nwould place banks in direct competition with single parents trying to \ncollect child support after bankruptcy. In addition, the bill gives \ncreditors new levers to coerce reaffirmations, in which debtors must \nagree to pay back debts that otherwise would have been discharged, so \nthat those debts also will compete with child support obligations. \nFinally, the claim of the bill's sponsors that it ``puts child support \nfirst'' is an example of the worst kind of Washington cynicism. \nAlthough the bill moves child support claims from seventh to first \npriority in Chapter 7 cases, the provision is virtually meaningless \nbecause almost no Chapter 7 cases involve any distribution of assets to \ncreditors. Few debtors have any assets to distribute to priority \nunsecured creditors after secured creditors receive the value of their \ncollateral. Therefore, this change would affect fewer than 1 percent of \ncases. On the other hand, the conference report protects wealthy \ndebtors by allowing them to use overly broad homestead exemptions to \nshield assets from their creditors. The homestead exemption has been \nused by wealthy individuals to shelter millions of dollars in expensive \nhomes to avoid repaying their creditors. The Conference Report would \ndelete the Senate amendment that provided a firm homestead cap of \n$100,000 and instead allow wealthy debtors to retain expensive homes \nwhile filing for bankruptcy, so long as the debtor owned the property \nfor two years before the bankruptcy filing. Because wealthier debtors \nwould have no difficulty tying up their creditors for a relatively \nshort period of time, the two-year residency requirement would have no \nreal effect on debtors moving to states with unlimited homestead \namounts to take advantage of this loophole. The bill changes nothing, \nas long as the well-counseled debtor makes his homestead purchase at \nleast 24 months before filing. But, the 24-month rule unfairly \ndifferentiates between consumers who are sophisticated enough to plan \nin advance for homestead protection and which are not.\n  The whole point of bankruptcy reform is to create accountability for \nboth creditors and debtors. The first part of that equation is missing \nentirely in H.R. 2415. At the same time, the bill fails in any way to \nimpose any restrictions on these industries with regard to the way they \nprovide credit to those who can least afford to incur a great deal of \ndebt. The bill does not require important specific disclosures on \nmonthly credit card statements that would show the time it will take to \npay a balance and the cost of the credit if only minimum payments are \nmade. This type of disclosure was included in the legislation passed by \nthe Senate in 1998 and should be part of any reform bill. The \nconference report also excludes Senate-passed amendments that would \nhave provided credit information in electronic credit card applications \nover the Internet and protections against finance charges being imposed \non credit card payments made within the creditor-provided grace period. \nIt also does nothing to discourage lenders from further increasing the \ndebt of consumers who are already overburdened with debt.\n  I am also very disappointed that the conference report does not \ninclude an amendment offered by Senator Collins and myself, which was \nincluded in the Senate bill, that would make Chapter 12 of the \nBankruptcy Code, which now applies to family farmers, applicable for \nfishermen. I believe that this provision would have made bankruptcy a \nmore effective tool to help fishermen reorganize effectively and allow \nthem to keep fishing while they do so.\n  Finally, this bill is the result of a conference process that was a \nsham. In October, the House appointed conferees for the Bankruptcy \nReform Act and without holding a conference meeting, the Majority filed \na conference report striking international security legislation and \nreplacing it with a reference to a bankruptcy reform bill introduced \nearlier that same day. This makes a mockery of the legislative process \nand demeans the United States Senate. I\n\n[[Page S11728]]\n\nam hopeful that during the 107th Congress, we can develop bipartisan \nlegislation that would encourage responsibility and reduce abuses of \nthe bankruptcy system.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express my \ndisappointment with the Bankruptcy Conference Report. I reluctantly \nwill be voting no on the final conference agreement because it fails \nthe fairness test and because it fails to protect the most vulnerable \nfamilies facing dire financial times.\n  I have supported bankruptcy reform in the past. I continue to support \nfair and balanced reforms to prohibit the misuse of the bankruptcy code \nand to prohibit individuals from using the code as a shield against \nhonoring their financial commitments. We need reform because we all pay \nfor the abuses. Working families struggling with the cost of credit \ndeserve reform. Families trying to save to purchase their first home \ncannot afford the added burden forced on them due to abuse of our \nbankruptcy laws.\n  Unfortunately, the final product presented to the Senate is \nunacceptable. In an attempt to prevent a fair and open debate, this \nconference report has bypassed the normal legislative process, and \nSenators have been denied the opportunity to improve the legislation. \nClearly this conference report has been driven by special interests and \nnot the interests of working families. It does not ensure that mothers \nand children who depend on child support and alimony payments won't \nlose out to big special interests. It does not require any responsible \nactions by credit card companies in educating or informing consumers to \nthe cost of debt.\n  This conference report is vastly different from the bill that passed \nthe Senate in March. I supported that bill. The conference report \nbefore us, however, will make it impossible for families to seek \nbankruptcy protection when they are hit with overwhelming financial \nproblems often caused by events beyond their control. In many cases, \nfamilies are forced into bankruptcy due to unexpected medical bills \ncaused by a disabling accident or condition. Many women are forced into \nbankruptcy due to the break up of their family and their inability to \ncollect court ordered child support. These families should not be \nturned away simply because credit card companies made reckless \ndecisions in issuing credit to individuals unable to manage debt or \nunaware of the costs of managing debt.\n  This conference report also eliminates the Schumer Clinic Violence \nAmendment that I cosponsored and that I believe must be part of any \nreform bill. We cannot allow those who use violence or the threat of \nviolence to shield themselves from financial responsibilities by \nrunning to bankruptcy court. Without the Schumer amendment, the \nBankruptcy Code will continue to be subject to exploitation by \nperpetrators of violence against women. Protecting access to \nreproductive health clinics and providers is not an abortion issue, but \na women's health and safety issue.\n  Violent anti-choice groups provide legal assistance to violent \nprotesters on how to use the Code to protect their assets against \npossible financial liability. Their criminal debts are simply excused \nunder the current Code. This conference report fails to close that \nloophole. The Schumer amendment was adopted on an 80 to 17 vote, but \nthe final conference agreement simply dropped this bipartisan anti-\nviolence amendment.\n  We know that this conference report will be vetoed and has little or \nno chance of becoming law. The decision to push this through in a \npartisan manner has jeopardized bankruptcy reform. As a result, working \nfamilies will suffer. I am hopeful that with the new Congress and the \nneed to work in a bipartisan manner we will see real bankruptcy reform \nin the next Congress. I will continue to work for reform that is \nbalanced, fair and that protects women against violence and \nintimidation. I want reform, but not at the expense of women or \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, I hope all of my colleagues will honor the mandate we \nall received in the election. The American people did not give one \nparty or one philosophy a mandate to govern. They want a bipartisan \nCongress that will put aside political bickering and special interest \nand work to solve the problems facing real people and real families.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, earlier in the year, when the Bankruptcy \nReform bill was before the Senate, I voted in favor of the bill. I said \nat the time that ``over the course of debate, the Senate adopted more \nthan 40 amendments, making this a more reasonable approach to \nbankruptcy reform.'' However, I also said that ``should this \nlegislation come back from conference . . . without the modest \namendments we adopted in the Senate, I will consider opposing the bill \nat that time.''\n  The bill before us is one I cannot support. The negotiators who \nworked out the differences between the Senate and House passed versions \nof the bill, deleted or weakened many of the provisions that were key \ncomponents of the Senate-passed bankruptcy reform bill. Both of the \namendments that I sponsored were deleted from the final version of the \nbill. One of those amendments simply required a study to determine if \ncredit card companies use residences or zip codes to determine credit \nworthiness. The other amendment I sponsored would have prohibited \ncredit card companies from applying interest charges on the paid \nportion of a balance during a so-called grace period.\n  Another provision that was deleted was Senator Schumer's amendment, \nwhich passed by an enormous margin in the Senate. The Schumer Amendment \nwould have ensured that perpetrators of clinic violence, who incurred \ndebt as a result of unlawful acts, could not discharge that debt in \nbankruptcy proceedings.\n  I am also concerned that the Senate-passed proposal to curb debtor \nabuse by closing the homestead loophole was weakened in conference. The \nhomestead loophole permits debtors in certain states to shield \nluxurious homes, while shedding thousands of dollars of debt in \nbankruptcy. The Senate passed an amendment to create a $100,000 \nnationwide cap on the homestead exemption, thus closing the loophole. \nThe conference report still allows for such abuse of the system so long \nas the expensive home was purchased two years in advance of the \nbankruptcy filing. This provision allows sophisticated debtors with the \nresources to plan ahead for bankruptcy to game the system.\n  Furthermore, I am disappointed with the unusual legislative process \nthe majority used to file this conference report. The bill before us \ntoday, H.R. 2415, was originally introduced as the American Embassy \nSecurity Act. Last August, when the Senate passed this legislation and \nrequested a conference with the House, it dealt with State Department \nand international security matters. More than a year later, the House \nappointed conferees, stripped the international security provisions \nfrom the bill and replaced them with a version of a bankruptcy reform \nbill. That is the wrong way to legislate.\n  Mr. President, I believe that bankruptcy reform could have been \nresolved in a fair and bipartisan way. Unfortunately, it was not \nhandled in this way and so I cannot lend my support to the bill.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, throughout my career I have been a staunch \nadvocate for fiscal responsibility, believing that as a government we \nshould make every effort to pay our own way and not leave our debts to \nour children. That same principle of fiscal responsibility compelled me \nto be an early cosponsor of the bankruptcy reform bill. I believe that, \nwhenever possible, individuals should take personal responsibility for \ndebts that they incur and pay what they owe.\n  Under our current bankruptcy system, debtors can be absolved of their \ndebts even when they may have the ability to pay. I support bankruptcy \nreform because I believe that if an individual has the ability to repay \ntheir debts, they should have an obligation to do so. The conference \nreport we're considering today adheres to that basic principle.\n  While I have supported bankruptcy reform throughout this Congress, \nhowever, I'm extremely disappointed with how we got to this point in \nthe process. There has been a lot of talk about the need for \nbipartisanship recently, but there is little evidence of bipartisanship \nin the process used to develop this conference report. In fact, that \nprocess\n\n[[Page S11729]]\n\nrepresents the exact opposite of bipartisanship. The minority was \nlocked out of the deliberations completely.\n  In addition, I'm concerned that important provisions that I supported \nand which passed overwhelmingly in the Senate were dropped in \nconference, specifically the amendment involving violence against \nabortion clinics and the amendment involving the homestead exemption. I \ncontinue to support those provisions, but they were not in the bill I \noriginally cosponsored. And while I had hoped that those provisions \nwould be included in the final package, the absence of those provisions \ndoesn't diminish the basic proposition contained in the underlying bill \nwhich caused me to lend my support to the measure in the first place.\n  Let me conclude by acknowledging the help and friendship of many of \nthose who have called me or my office over the last few days urging me \nto change my position on this legislation. Many of the groups and \nindividuals who oppose this bill are among those with whom I most often \nfind common cause and have supported me strongly over the years. It is \nparticularly painful for me not to be able to oblige them in this \ninstance. But I made a decision in May of last year to cosponsor this \nlegislation, and there have been no major substantive changes between \nthen and now that would compel me to change my position. So while I \nregret having to say ``no'' to so many of my friends, I cannot in good \nconscience turn my back on a principle which is so fundamental to me--\nthe principle of personal responsibility. As a result, I will maintain \nthe position I have held since this bill was introduced and will vote \nfor final passage.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me begin by saying that H.R. 2415 is \none of the most important legislative efforts to reform the bankruptcy \nlaws in decades.\n  I would like to express my thanks to the people who have worked on \nthis legislation. First, I want to acknowledge the Majority Leader, who \nhas worked diligently to keep this legislation on its course. Thanks to \nhis commitment to moving this legislation, we are in a position to \neliminate the abuses in the current bankruptcy system, while at the \nsame time, enhance consumer protections.\n  I also want to acknowledge the Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Leahy, who has worked with me to reach agreement on \nmany of the bill's provisions. In addition, I want to commend my \ncolleagues, Senators Grassley and Torricelli, the Chairman and ranking \nminority member of the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the \nCourts, respectively, for their hard work in crafting this much needed \nlegislation, and for their unrelenting commitment to making the \ndevelopment and passage of this bill a bipartisan process. My thanks \nalso goes to Senator Sessions and Senator Biden, who have shown \nunwavering dedication to accomplishing the important reforms in this \nbill; and the many other members of the Senate for their hard work and \ncooperation.\n  The compelling need for this reform is highlighted by the large \nnumber of bankruptcy filings we have seen over the past several years, \nwhich are particularly troubling because they have occurred during a \ntime of relative prosperity for our Nation. Mr. President, the \nbankruptcy system was intended to provide a ``fresh start'' for those \nwho truly need it. During the process of developing this legislation, I \nhave remained committed to preserving a bankruptcy system that will \nallow those individuals to emerge from severe financial hardship. At \nthe same time, I believe that individuals should take personal \nresponsibility for their debts and repay them if they are able to do \nso. I believe the complete elimination of debt should be reserved for \nthose who truly cannot repay their debts, not for those who simply \nchoose not to repay.\n  This bipartisan legislation, authored by Senators Grassley and \nTorricelli, is carefully structured to achieve an appropriate balance \nbetween the rights and responsibilities of both debtors and creditors. \nIf enacted, it will enable those truly in need of a fresh start to get \none, and at the same time, reform current law to prevent the system \nfrom being abused at the expense of honest, hard-working Americans. Mr. \nPresident, again I would like to applaud the bipartisan efforts of my \ncolleagues who have made this a broadly-supported bill that removes \nsome of the abuses of the current bankruptcy system while enhancing \nconsumer protections.\n\n  I am particularly proud of the great strides this legislation makes \nin improving current law. The legislation includes my provision to \nprevent deadbeat parents from using bankruptcy to avoid paying child \nsupport. It includes my provision to protect educational savings \naccounts that parents and grandparents set up for their children and \ngrandchildren. And, it includes my provision that ensures that the \nretirement savings of teachers and church workers are given the same \nprotection in bankruptcy as everyone else. It includes my provision \nthat prevents violent criminals and drug traffickers from taking \nadvantage of bankruptcy at the expense of their victims. Specifically, \nwhen these criminals voluntarily file for bankruptcy, my provision \nprotects victims by allowing them to move for dismissal of the \nbankruptcy case. The legislation also includes my provision that is \ndesigned to curb fraud in bankruptcy filings by putting in place new \nprocedures and providing new resources to enhance enforcement of \nbankruptcy fraud laws. My provision requires (1) that bankruptcy courts \ndevelop procedures for referring suspected fraud in bankruptcy \nschedules to the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office for investigation \nand prosecution and (2) that the Attorney General designate one \nAssistant U.S. Attorney and one FBI agent in each judicial district as \nhaving primary responsibility for investigating and prosecuting fraud \nin bankruptcy.\n  I would like to take a moment to acknowledge a few people who have \nworked very hard on this legislation. On my staff, I particularly would \nlike to thank the Committee's Chief Counsel and Staff Director, Manus \nCooney, the counsels who worked diligently on this measure, Makan \nDelrahim, Rene Augustine and Kyle Sampson, and staff assistant Katie \nStahl. On Senator Leahy's Committee staff, I want to recognize Minority \nChief Counsel Bruce Cohen, along with counsel Ed Pagano. On the \nAdministrative Oversight and the Courts Subcommittee, I would like to \nthank John McMickle and Kolan Davis, counsels to Senator Grassley, and \nJennifer Leach, counsel to Senator Torricelli, for their tireless \nefforts and input. My thanks also goes to Ed Haden and Sean Costello, \ncounsels to Senator Sessions. I also would like to express my gratitude \nto Senate Legislative Counsel, and in particular I want to recognize \nLaura Ayoud of that office, whose hard work made this bill a better \nproduct. Without the dedication and efforts of these loyal public \nservants, the important reforms in this legislation would not have been \npossible. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/07/senate-section/article/S11729-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.J.

Mr. President, responding to my friend from Iowa, the \nPresident has called Senators and for good reason: This is a piece of \nlegislation that has very little balance.\n  I gave the example again of LTV workers in the iron range of \nMinnesota which is going to shut down in February. One month later, \nthere could be\n\n[[Page S11730]]\n\nan illness in a family, a medical bill, the worker no longer has a job \nand cannot pay the mortgage.\n  Under this piece of legislation, what would be the income that is \ncalculated? Would it be the income of this family with the head of the \nhousehold unemployed? No. Under this bill, in order to see whether this \nfamily could file under chapter 7, you would look over the past 6 \nmonths and average out the income all the months he or she was working. \nBut they do not have a job.\n  Most of the people file for chapter 7 because of a major medical \nbill. It is 50 percent. Only about 3 percent game this system.\n  Now we have a piece of legislation that does not ask the credit card \ncompanies to be accountable, does not do anything about their egregious \npractices, targets the most vulnerable people, and has very little \nbalance. This piece of legislation should be defeated. That is why the \nPresident is opposed to it. That is why labor, civil rights, women, \nchildren, consumer organizations, all oppose this piece of legislation. \nI say to my colleagues, it is too harsh. It is without balance. I know \nthere is a powerful economic constituency behind it, but I hope you \nwill vote against it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate all the Senators \nwho have been working on this issue and, in particular, the chairman \nwho is standing here, Senator Grassley, and has been here many times.\n  Today, in an extended session, we will finally reform the bankruptcy \nlaws of America. They are very important because credit in America, be \nit from banks, from individual lenders, wherever, is really the \nheartbeat of what makes us tick and permits us to give our citizens \nmaterial means. Without credit, things do not work in America.\n  Every now and then, we have to fix the bankruptcy laws so they work \nin behalf of not only the debtors but the creditors of America. That is \nwhat we are doing here. I think it will pass overwhelmingly.\n  My thanks to those who have worked so hard on it.

They showed leadership \nand we made some progress.\n  I only wish we could have completed our work on this bill and \nresolved the remaining important issues in a way that I could have \nsupported and the President could sign.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/07/senate-section/article/S11730-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know that Senators are interested in the \nschedule.\n  First, just very briefly, I want to recognize the achievement that \nhas just taken place. A lot of hard work went into this bill over a \nlong period of time by, of course, Senator Grassley, Senator Hatch, \nSenator Leahy, and Senator Torricelli. But it also took cooperation \nfrom Senator Wellstone. Whether he is for it or against it, I think \nagain it showed that when we try we can get a final result which gets \nsome 70 votes.\n  I commend all of them.\n  This upcoming vote on the continuing resolution should be the last \nvote of the week. It will be necessary to pass an additional continuing \nresolution on Friday. However, we are not aware of any request on the \nother side of the aisle for a rollcall vote.\n  Tomorrow's continuing resolution should carry us over until Monday or \nTuesday, and we will make further announcements to update Members as to \nthe schedule for next week.\n  During this time, we will be putting the finishing touches on the \nappropriations bills and a final determination on the Medicare \nadjustments.\n  We are working in a bipartisan way and in a bicameral way with the \nadministration.\n  We hope to be able to finish the business for the year and for this \nCongress before the end of next week. It will take a lot more work, but \nwe are making some progress in that direction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/07/senate-section/article/S11730-2", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11730-S11731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   MAKING FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2001\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is rare in this Chamber for incumbent \nSenators who have lost on election day to still have the privilege of \naddressing the Senate again, at least in their capacity of finishing \nout their terms. For me, if there is a silver lining behind this \nextended session of which we are a part, it is because it gives me a \nchance to thank people--friends, supporters, staff, colleagues, and \nothers--who have made it possible for me, a grandson of immigrants, to \nserve and succeed here.\n  I begin today by making some comments and thanking people who have \nmade a difference.\n  First, I thank my Senate colleagues with whom I have worked over the \nlast 6 years. I especially express my gratitude for the majority \nleaders under whom I have served--Senator Bob Dole and Senator Trent \nLott--for their confidence in me, for making me part of their circle of \nkey advisers, for their support on both legislative and political \nmatters and, most importantly, for their friendship.\n  I extend the same heartfelt thanks to the other members of our \nleadership teams over the last 6 years: To Senator Don Nickles for whom \nI served as deputy whip for 4 years; to our conference chairman, Thad \nCochran, who served when I first arrived here, and Senator Connie Mack; \nto our Senate campaign committee chairman, Mitch McConnell, and the \nlate Senator Paul Coverdell; to the Chairman of the Republican Policy \nCommittee Senator Larry Craig; to our new Conference Secretary Senator \nKay Bailey Hutchison, and so many others who have provided me with \nguidance and leadership during the time I have been here.\n  I also take special note of the people with whom I have served as a \nmember of their committees: To our Commerce Committee chairman, John \nMcCain, who has been a great friend and supporter and through whose \nhelp I have been able to pass significant legislation that came from \nour Commerce Committee agenda.\n  I thank our Judiciary Committee chairman, Orrin Hatch, who helped me \nget on his committee my very first year here and whose support on that \ncommittee helped me to achieve a number of personal objectives with \nrespect to legislative goals and who worked closely with me and his \nstaff worked closely with my staff as we fought a number of very \nimportant battles in the Senate.\n  I thank my good friend Senator Pete Domenici, who chairs the Budget \nCommittee on which I sat for 6 years. When I came to the Senate, I met \nwith Senator Domenici. At the time, I was selected for that committee, \nand we talked about our goals and hopes that some day we might advance \na balanced budget to complete and see the Nation balance its budget. \nMany people thought we would never achieve that in our lifetime, and \nyet 3 short years after I arrived on the committee, and under Pete \nDomenici's great leadership, that objective was realized.\n  I thank the chairman of the Small Business Committee, Kit Bond, whose \nfriendship has helped me in legislative battles of recent years. I have \nonly been on that committee 2 years, but his leadership also has been \nimportant to my success in the Chamber.\n  I extend my thanks to all of my colleagues. There are many close \nfriends who are part of this Chamber, people with whom my family and I \nhave become close in the last 6 years and others who have already \ndeparted the Chamber but with whom we remain close.\n  Senator Chuck Hagel from Nebraska is here with me today. I especially \nthank him for his great friendship and support. Senators Jeff Sessions, \nSusan Collins, Judd Gregg and Mike DeWine have also done me the honor \nof helping me in my legislative efforts as well as being my friends \nover these last six years, and for that I want to thank them. And \nfinally for my Republican colleagues, I want to thank all the other \nmembers of my freshman class, the folks with whom I came in 1995, and \nwho helped so substantially change the direction of this country: \nSenator Santorum, Senator Inhofe, Senator Thompson, Senator Frist, \nSenator Ashcroft, Senator Kyl, Senator Snowe, Senator Grams, and as I \nmentioned before, Senator DeWine.\n\n  I reach across the aisle and thank the many colleagues on the \nDemocratic side with whom I have worked on so many bipartisan issues in \nthe last 6 years:\n  To Carl Levin, our senior Senator from Michigan with whom I have \nworked very closely on many issues of importance to our State;\n  To Ted Kennedy, my ranking member on the Senate Immigration \nSubcommittee which I chaired. We have been very successful in passing a \nnumber of pieces of legislation through the bipartisan cooperation we \nhave achieved in that subcommittee;\n  To Joe Lieberman, who has been the lead cosponsor of my American \nCommunity Renewal Act, and other progrowth initiatives;\n  To Ron Wyden, my partner in so many high-technology initiatives;\n  To Russ Feingold, Bob Graham, and others who have worked closely with \nme.\n  I also thank the many friends and supporters and mentors who have \nhelped me to arrive in the Senate and in a lengthy political career in \nmy State of Michigan. There are many\n\n[[Page S11732]]\n\npeople who are part of that success. It would be impossible to name all \nof them. I want to single out, though, four people who played \nparticularly important roles:\n  Former Michigan Senator Bob Griffin whose campaigns and staffs I \nworked on many years ago and a role model for me in that he was the \nlast Republican Senator from my State and a man whose integrity and \nleadership in the Senate were well recognized. He served ultimately as \nwhip on the Republican side. His guidance and friendship from the time \nI was in college has meant a great deal to my political success and my \npersonal success as well.\n  To our great Governor John Engler, who has been a political friend \nand colleague in Michigan politics since 1971. Without his support and \nhelp, I would not have been successful in my campaign for the Senate or \nother roles I played in Michigan politics.\n  To former Congressman Guy Vander Jagt with whom I served as \ncochairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee in 1991 \nand 1992 when I made my first appearance on the legislative side of \nWashington working on Capitol Hill for the first time.\n  And especially to a great friend, former Vice President Dan Quayle on \nwhose staff I served as deputy chief of staff in 1990 and 1991, my \nfirst assignment in Washington in Government service at the Federal \nlevel.\n  I thank all of those individuals, and the others I have not had a \nchance today to name, for having helped me get to this role and being \neffective in it.\n  There are today on the floor a great number of people who have worked \non my Senate staff. I am proud of them and proud to have them with me. \nThey only reflect a percentage of the many folks who served in the \nState of Michigan and their country in the context of working on my \nstaff. There are so many. I am going to try to name the ones I have \nlisted, but I will submit the names of everybody for the Record.\n  The people who served on my senior staff: Tony Antone, Cesar Conda, \nKate Hinton, Randa Fahmy Hudome, Joe McMonigle, Katie Packer, Jim \nPitts, Larry Purpuro, Laurie Bink Purpuro, and Sue Wadel.\n  To those folks who served over the years on my press and \ncommunications staff: Joe Davis, Nina Delorenzo, Steve Hessler, \nMargaret Murphy, Julie Teer, Jessica Morris, and Dan Senor.\n  To a terrific legislative staff, and people who have worked on my \nsubcommittees: Stuart Anderson, Rachel Bohlander, Bob Carey, Ann \nCoulter, Chase Hutto, Elizabeth Kessler, Ray Kethledge, Kevin Kolevar, \nBrandi Laperriere, Brian Reardon, Gregg Willhauck; and Tyler White.\n  To my administrative staff: Katja Bullock, Majida Dandy, Paul \nErhardt, Jim Neill, Matt Suhr, and Lillian Smith.\n  To the many people who have worked with us who are on our Michigan \nstaff: In particular, I would note Greg Andrews, Joe Cella, Larry \nDickerson, Sharon Eineman, Tom Frazier, Phil Hedges, Eunice Myles \nJeffries, Stuart Larkins, Renee Meyers, John Petz, Elroy Sailor, \nLillian Simon, and Billie Wimmer.\n  And there are many others who have served and whose names I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Staff of Senator Spencer Abraham (R-Michigan)\n\n       Mohammed Abouharb, Staff Assistant; Stuart Anderson, \n     Director of Immigration Policy and Research; Gregory Andrews, \n     Regional Director; Anthony Antone, Deputy Chief of Staff; \n     Sandra Baxter, Assistant to the State Chief of Staff; Beverly \n     Betel, Staff Assistant; Rachel Bohlander, Legislative \n     Assistant; David Borough, Computer Specialist; Michell Brown, \n     Staff Assistant; Katja Bullock, Office Manager; Carrie \n     Cabelka, Staff Assistant; Cheryl Campbell, Regional Director; \n     Robert H.

Mr. President, I also acknowledge that in addition to \nthis great staff--and I do want to thank them here on the floor \npublicly for their great performance on my behalf and the many \nachievements I am going to talk about in a minute that we have been \nable to accomplish--I also note that none of us would have been able to \nget as much done as we did without the help of the tremendous staff \nthat serves us in the Senate as a Chamber: The people who work the \nfloor, our pages, the folks who work at the front here who handle the \nclerk roles, and the parliamentary roles, and so on. I thank them.\n  I thank the people who serve on the leadership staffs of both parties \nwho have been great friends and who have helped us to chart the very \ncomplicated parliamentary waters we have to so often navigate, the \nfolks who work on the staffs of the committees on which I have served \nthat have helped us to pass legislation, and to the other people who \nwork in the Senate, from the Capitol Police, who help us in so many \nways that go unnoted, to the folks in the libraries and the \nCongressional Research Service, and in the Cloakrooms.\n  To all of those people, and others I have probably forgotten, I say \nthank you because it has really been a very enjoyable part of this job \nto work with such nice people, people who give 100 percent to this \nChamber and to America, and often without any recognition at all. I \nhope that we will continue to always be served in this body by people \nof such great skill and talent.\n  Finally, I thank the people of Michigan. They gave me and my family \nthe chance to come to Washington to represent them in the Senate.\n  I thank you for what I consider to be the most tremendous honor that \nany American can have bestowed upon them by their friends and neighbors \nin their State, and for their tremendous support throughout my 6 years \nin the Senate.\n\n[[Page S11733]]\n\n  I am very proud of the accomplishments I have achieved. I have worked \nvery hard--I hope in most cases in an effective way--to help the people \nof Michigan, to make sure my constituents have had their voices heard \nin the Senate, and to make certain that the Federal Government is \nresponsive to their needs.\n  Speaking of accomplishments, although I spent only a relevantly brief \ntime here in the Senate, I am very proud of what my staff and I have \nbeen able to accomplish for the people of Michigan and for the country.\n  In 1994, a group of freshmen were elected here. Eleven of us came in \nto basically create a new majority. In 1995, I came to the Senate as \npart of a historic class of Republican Senators --the class that gave \nRepublicans control of Congress for the first time in decades. I \nbelieve we were sent to Washington to accomplish a very clear agenda: \nto balance the Federal budget, to reduce the tax burden, to reform the \nwelfare system, and to make Washington more accountable.\n  I am proud to say, as I look back on our 6 years, that I believe we \nhave delivered on those promises.\n  We balanced the budget in 1998--and we have kept it balanced every \nyear since. We have done it this past year without using one penny of \nthe Social Security trust fund surplus to get the job done.\n  We reformed the welfare system, reducing the welfare rolls by over a \nthird.\n  We provided parents with a $500-per-child tax credit and investors a \ncut in the capital gains tax.\n  And we made Congress more accountable by requiring Members to live by \nthe same rules and regulations and mandates we impose on the rest of \nthe country.\n  I am proud of those achievements, which I think, of course, are \nachievements of this body as a whole.\n  I am also proud of some of the things which I have been able to \naccomplish during the last 6 years. I am very proud of the fact that, \nincluding today, I have never missed a single rollcall vote on the \nfloor of the Senate. I have just cast, I think, my 2,002nd consecutive \nrollcall vote.\n  In my view, voting in the Senate is the single most important duty \nthat we can, as Senators, perform on behalf of our constituents. It is \nwhat the people of our States elect us to do. I am glad I have been \nhere every single day for the people of Michigan to perform that \nresponsibility.\n  I am also proud of the fact that in a fairly short period of time I \nhave been able to author 22 pieces of legislation that have been signed \ninto law. I am proud of that legislative record.\n  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I took a special interest in \ndrug and crime issues. My first bill to become law prevented the U.S. \nSentencing Commission from reducing prison sentences for crack-cocaine \noffenders. Had that bill not passed, the sentences would have been \nautomatically reduced.\n  Later, with my staff, we wrote the Prison Conditions Litigation \nReform Act, which helped reduce prisoner lawsuits and return control of \nour prisons from judges back to local authorities.\n  And just a few months ago, the President signed into law the Samantha \nReid Date-Rape Drug Prohibition Act. Samantha Reid was a Rockwood, MI, \nteenager who died after drinking a can of Mountain Dew she did not know \nhad been laced with the deadly date rape drug GHB. Our law amends the \nControlled Substances Act by adding GHB to the list of Schedule 1 \ncontrolled substances, which also includes heroin and cocaine.\n  As a member of both the Judiciary and Commerce Committees, I focused \non a wide range of high-technology issues that I believe are critical \nto the continued growth and prosperity of this country.\n  My American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act increased \nthe number of skilled professional visas to help with critical labor \nshortages, especially in the entrepreneurial high-tech sector.\n  The law also funds 10,000 new college scholarships annually for low-\nincome students for studies in math, engineering, and computer science, \nand job training for unemployed Americans through the Jobs Partnership \nAct.\n  I was also the author of two new laws dealing with electronic \ncommerce: the Government Paperwork Elimination Act and the Electronic \nSignatures and Global and National Commerce Act.\n  The first law set forth a timetable for Federal agencies to accept \nelectronically signed and transmitted records and forms from businesses \nand individuals. The second law ensured that contracts agreed to over \nthe Internet using digital signatures would have the same legal \nvalidity as contracts agreed to in the paper world using pen and ink \nsignatures.\n  Both of these laws have laid the groundwork, I think, for continued \ngrowth and expansion of electronic commerce in the years to come.\n  Other laws which I have been involved with--I am especially proud of \nthe passage, this year, of the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation \nAct and the College Scholarship Fraud Prevention Act; and in the \nprevious year, the Child Passenger Protection Act.\n  I am especially proud of having been the Senate sponsor of \nlegislation that conferred the Congressional Gold Medal on one of my \nconstituents, Mrs. Rosa Parks.\n  One area that I spent a great deal of time working on in this \nChamber, as many know, is the area of immigration. As a grandson of \nimmigrants, I am especially proud of the role that I tried to play in \nchanging the tone of the debate over immigration in this Chamber. In \nthe mid-1990s, my party--the Republican Party--in my judgment, seemed \nto have lost its way on immigration. It had strayed from the inclusive, \nproimmigration philosophy of President Ronald Reagan toward the more \nprotectionist and nativist views of a vocal minority within the \nRepublican ranks.\n\n  In 1997, I helped lead a bipartisan group of Senators--from Phil \nGramm, Mike DeWine, and Sam Brownback, to Russ Feingold, Joe Lieberman, \nPaul Wellstone, and others--to defeat a misguided effort to slash legal \nimmigration to this country.\n  I believe, with all of my heart, that America should remain--as \nPresident Reagan said--the ``Shining City on the Hill,'' welcoming \nthose who play by the rules and who contribute to society.\n  I would say, despite the ugly campaign that was run in my State \nagainst me by some of these anti-immigrant hate groups, I am absolutely \nconfident that the bipartisan coalition for legal immigration that was \nbuilt in this Chamber will remain strong long after I have left the \nSenate.\n  I am also proud of what I have been able to deliver to the people of \nthe State of Michigan on issues important to our State.\n  I am very proud of what I have been able to do with respect to \nincreasing transportation funding; stopping an effort to move to \nWashington control of the Great Lakes, and increasing environmental \nfunding for the Great Lakes; restoring Medicare reimbursements for \nMichigan hospitals; and protecting our auto workers' jobs with respect \nto issues that threaten the auto industry.\n  I intend to continue to fight--perhaps not in the elective political \narena or in public life specifically, but in whatever roles that I \nmight be able to play--for tax and regulatory policies that strengthen \nAmerican competitiveness and economic growth, to ensure strong national \nsecurity, tough laws against criminals, and to have immigration policy \nthat respects America's great traditions, having schools that are \nsecond to none, training for 21st-century jobs, community renewal \nefforts to empower the poor, and a transportation and infrastructure \nsystem that makes us prepared to be competitive in the 21st century.\n  As I close, I have a few moments upon which I will reflect. When one \ncomes to the end of a 6-year period here, there are a lot of memories. \nIt is probably possible for one to speak long into the night about the \nvarious things one recalls. I do remember being sworn in here that \nfirst day just a few steps in front of me by Vice President Gore, \nholding our family Bible and very nervously taking the oath of office \nbecause it was such an important moment in my life.\n  I remember the first day I sat in the President's chair presiding \nover the Senate. I considered it to be quite an important honor to be \ngiven that duty. Then by the second and third day that I performed it, \nI realized exactly how\n\n[[Page S11734]]\n\nthat responsibility was viewed by the other Members of this Chamber. \nThis week I asked once again to have the chance to preside because I \nwanted to never forget just exactly how meaningful it is to serve in \nthis Chamber.\n  I remember passing our first bill with regard to sentencing and \nseeing it signed into law. I remember standing at this desk and casting \nthe very first vote on the impeachment trial that we had in January of \n1999 with respect to the impeachment of President Clinton, an \nunbelievably historic moment to have been a part. And of course I will \nnever forget today, the chance to be here with colleagues and staff and \nfriends speaking one last time in the Senate. Indeed, it is these \nmoments, the chance to stand up and to make one's case for one's State, \nfor one's beliefs, that will stay with me probably more than any other.\n  In closing, I will just make a few short observations. First, this \ninstitution has been served by great people. All too often we tend to \ntake for granted the truly extraordinary political leaders who work \nhere every day. I personally consider it a great honor and privilege to \nserve with people who will long be recognized, probably for the entire \nhistory of our country, as giants in this Chamber--leaders such as \nSenator Bob Dole, our President pro tempore Strom Thurmond, retiring \nMember Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and of course the great Senator from \nWest Virginia Robert Byrd--two on each side of the aisle whose \ncontributions to their Nation and to this Chamber will never be \nforgotten, and two on each side of the aisle whose leadership I hope \nall of us will be able to in some ways emulate in our careers. I know \nthere will be others who are serving here and with whom I have served \nwho someday will be looked upon the same way, as history records their \naccomplishments.\n  The second observation I have is for those sitting in the gallery, \nwatching and paying attention to the action of the Senate. Sometimes \nthe media and others tend to focus too much on the areas in which we \ndisagree in this Chamber. Indeed, we do have our disagreements. That is \nwhy we have a democratic system that gives each side an opportunity to \nfight for their causes.\n  But as the Presiding Officer knows, in the committees and usually on \nthe floor of this Chamber, we work together on a bipartisan basis to \nget things done for the American people. More often than not, things \npass here unanimously. They do so quietly. They do so by the unanimous-\nconsent agreements that don't get reported very often. Indeed, much of \nAmerica's business is accomplished without rancor and strife, without \ndivisive debates. At the same time, the Founding Fathers created the \nSenate as the saucer to cool the passions of the day.\n  I have observed that passion for philosophy, at least for ideas, \nreigns here in the Senate. I can remember during the last 6 years from \nthe balanced budget amendment debates, when I first got here, to the \ndebates over Bosnia and other foreign affairs issues, to the \nimpeachment trial and so on, while we in the Senate obviously have a \nreputation for being a deliberative body, we also are a body in which \nthe passions of the country are best reflected in the debates we have. \nI hope that will always be the tradition as well.\n\n  Indeed, I think the Senate really does reflect democracy at its \nfinest. Over 150 years ago, De Tocqueville observed:\n\n       I confess that in America I saw more than America; I saw \n     the image of democracy itself, with its inclinations, its \n     character, its prejudices, and its passions, in order to \n     learn what we have to fear or hope from its progress.\n\n  Some say this America, this image of democracy, no longer exists. But \nI say that it does exist, right here in this great Chamber.\n  I will miss the Senate. I will miss the institution, and I will miss \nthe people. Being a Senator has been my dream job. I hope that during \nmy 6 years here I have contributed in some small way to the rich \nhistory of what has been and forever will be called ``the world's \ngreatest deliberative body in the world's greatest democracy.'' It is a \nlong distance from being the grandson of immigrants to this floor.\n  I know when my grandparents came here, they never dreamt that their \ngrandson or anyone in the family would end up as a Member of the U.S. \nSenate, but they came to America because they wanted to live in a place \nin which something such as that could happen. This is the one country \nwhere something such as that not only can happen in the family of the \nAbrahams, but in many other families happened all the time. It is the \ngreatest thing about America. I am proud and believe, as I leave the \nChamber, that I have helped contribute in my own small way during these \n6 years to making sure that America always remains that country.\n  I thank everyone I have mentioned, but I especially thank my family, \nsome of whom are here today, my wife Jane and my daughters Betsy and \nJulie, without whom none of this would have been possible for me. Their \nsupport in every way and their love and affection have made the \ndifference in my life.\n  As I leave the Senate, I will only say that I hope all Americans will \nin their own way find a way to appreciate the greatness of this \ndemocracy. I hope all of my colleagues will continue to fight to make \nsure that that tradition, that Nation which my grandparents and so many \nothers fought for, so many others strove to come to be part of, will \nalways be available to those who seek freedom and liberty and \nopportunity and that that dream will be forever part of our great \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to respond very briefly on behalf of \nthis Senator, and I think I speak for the entire body when I say thank \nyou to Senator Spence Abraham from Michigan for his contributions, his \nleadership, his effectiveness.\n  My grandfather Hagel used to occasionally pay the highest compliment \nto an individual when he would say: He is a good man.\n  Well, Spence Abraham is a good man. He will go on to do other very \nsignificant things with his life, with his talent, with his leadership. \nWe will all be well served. It will impact the future of his children \nand our children, just as his service in the Senate has made this a \nbetter institution and a stronger Nation.\n  I have been privileged to serve with Spence Abraham, be his seatmate \nhere on the Senate floor, and become a good friend. Of that friendship \nand that service, I am proud. I thank Senator Abraham.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in remembrance of those who \nrelinquished their lives at the Japanese attack of Pearl Harbor. As \nPresident Franklin Delano Roosevelt said at the time, December 7, 1941, \nwill remain ``a date which will live in infamy,'' for it was on this \ndate that the Japanese forces attacked our unsuspecting Nation.\n  The first Japanese assault struck the United States naval base at \nPearl Harbor, Hawaii, on the island of Oahu, at 7:55 a.m. The base was \njust awakening early Sunday morning when the sound of Japanese torpedo \nplanes could be heard. The American armed forces in the Pacific were \ncaught completely off guard. When a war warning was issued two weeks \nprior, Hawaii was not mentioned as a possible target. At the time, \nAmerican authorities thought that the Philippines or Malaysia would be \na possible area of attack, not the island of Hawaii. Therefore, Pearl \nHarbor was not prepared for the onslaught of\n\n[[Page S11735]]\n\nterror that occurred that devastating morning.\n  The Japanese attack consisted of 363 planes that came in two waves \nwith the second only 45 minutes after the first. The United States had \nconcentrated almost its entire fleet of 94 vessels, including 8 \nbattleships, at Pearl Harbor, and this proximity made an easy target \nfor the Japanese. Additionally, to prevent against saboteurs, the \nArmy's planes at Oahu were alined wing tip to wing tip on airfields. \nTherefore, the Japanese were able to easily diminish the threat of any \nAmerican defense. Before noon, when the Japanese attack concluded, \n2,403 American servicemen and civilians were killed and an additional \n1,178 were wounded.\n  December 7, 1941, is the day our land, our people, and our spirit \nwere brutally attacked. However, the Japanese forces failed to defeat \nthe patriotism of the American people and our undying belief in our \nNation. We were able to rally around one another with the knowledge and \nthe confidence that America would prevail, and the great losses we \nsuffered at Pearl Harbor would not be in vain. As a veteran of World \nWar II, and a proud American, I would like to recognize the patriotism, \nthe bravery, and the extreme sacrifices of those who were at Pearl \nHarbor on December 7, 1941, including our own Senator Dan Inouye. These \nfine men and women are true American heroes, and our country forever \nowes them a great debt of gratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/07/senate-section/article/S11735-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COUNTRY DOCTOR OF THE YEAR\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, I rise to pay tribute to the Country \nDoctor of the Year, Dr. Howard Clark of Morton, MS. Clark was selected \nfor this award out of 501 doctors from 41 States by a national \nphysicians association. At the young age of 73, Dr. Clark sees an \naverage of 60 patients a day, cares for about 20 who are hospitalized \nand 110 who reside in the local nursing home. He is a graduate of \nMississippi State University and attended medical school at both the \nUniversity of Mississippi and Tulane University. Clark was among the \nfirst doctors hired when the University of Mississippi Medical Center \nopened its doors in 1955. He has been in practice in Morton since 1956. \nI want to commend Dr. Clark not only for his service to the people of \nMorton and the surrounding areas but also for the service he gave this \ngreat Nation. When Howard Clark joined the Armed Forces following \ngraduation from high school, he was stationed in the South Pacific. At \nthe time, there was a dire need for medics and he volunteered. This \naltruistic act sparked the start of a career that has made life better \nfor those around him. Dr. Clark's selflessness spills over into his \npersonal life as well. He is an active member of the Morton community, \nserving as the local school doctor at sporting events, missing only one \ngame in 43 years. Dr. Clark, you are to be admired for your service to \nthe community, the Nation, and for being chosen Country Doctor of the \nYear. I join your family, friends, and colleagues in congratulating you \non this honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/07/senate-section/article/S11735-2", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RETIREMENT OF JOYCE NEWTON\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, at the end of December, one of my charter \nstaff members will be retiring. Joyce Newton has been on my staff since \nI took office as the Senator from Utah in January 1977.\n  As a freshman Senator, I was the beneficiary of Joyce's decade of \nprevious experience as a caseworker for former Representatives Frank \nHorton and John Conlan and as a staffer at the Office of Management and \nBudget.\n  But, during these last 24 years, Joyce has helped countless Utahns \nwith Social Security snafus, international adoptions, military \ntransfers, and a whole host of other special needs and problems. Joyce \nhas always been there to offer a sympathetic ear or to jump start a \nslow or reluctant bureaucracy.\n  Joyce has been known to come to the office in the wee hours of the \nmorning in order to telephone an embassy halfway around the globe.\n  She has been known to telephone the same Federal caseworker three \ntimes in one day just to make sure a constituent's application was not \nburied under another pile of work resulting in a needless delay or \nmissed deadline.\n  She has been known to go to bat for constituents even when the \ngrounds for their congressional appeals were shaky.\n  And, Joyce has been tenacious. She has pursued cases as far as she \ncould. If we were unsuccessful in resolving a constituent problem, it \nwas never for lack of trying--it was only for lack of more avenues.\n  I remember the ``Books for Bulgaria'' project. How could we get \nliterally hundreds of pounds of books to Bulgaria at little or no cost \nto be used by a nonprofit organization for educational outreach in that \ndistressed country? This was not an easy problem. Joyce somehow managed \nto solve it.\n  I remember the young woman from England who needed specialized \nsurgery to cure a rare condition that prevented her from walking. \nDoctors at the University of Utah had pioneered a new technique not \navailable anywhere else, but various INS rules needed to be sorted out \nin order for her to come and remain in our country long enough for \nrecovery and rehabilitation. There is a woman able to walk today \nbecause Joyce got it done.\n  I have always had complete confidence in Joyce. When she phoned an \nagency, she was phoning for me. No Senator or Representative can \npossibly do this work by himself or herself. It takes dedicated, \ncaring, and competent people to work through the various redtape \nentanglements that often ensnare our citizens.\n  These constituent service staffers too often work in the background. \nThey don't attend signing ceremonies. They don't meet with celebrities \nor national leaders. They don't have bills and photographs, plaques or \ncertificates on their office walls. Joyce Newton was one of these \ndevoted individuals on Capitol Hill who labored quietly on behalf of \nthe citizens of America. And, she got it done.\n\n  There are thousands of citizens in my State--seniors, children, \nservice men and women, families, students--who may not remember Joyce \nNewton's name. But, they will always remember what she did for them.\n  We are sorely going to miss Joyce Newton on the Hatch staff. And, \ntoday I want to thank her publicly for all of her dedicated hard work \nover these last many years and wish her all the best in a much \ndeserved, well-earned retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/07/senate-section/article/S11735-3", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11735-S11736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              BOB LOCKWOOD\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I pay public tribute to Bob Lockwood, who \nis finally retiring. I say ``finally'' because he has tried to leave at \nleast twice previously, and I successfully prevailed on him to stay. \nBut, this time, it looks as if he is really going to do it.\n  Bob came to my staff after a long and distinguished career in the \nArmy, serving in many capacities, including in Vietnam and on the \nSecretary of Defense staff. Bob has many credentials making him unique \namong military officers. He is a lawyer, an engineer, and an economist. \nHe found an organization--the U.S. Army--where he could put all of \nthese qualifications to work. So, when he wanted to establish a second \ncareer in public policy, I benefited from a man who could wear many \nhats. It will probably take three people to replace him.\n  Bob had the complex portfolios of defense and trade as well as \nbusiness liaison. The amazing thing is that he is expert in all these \nareas as well as tenacious and unwilling to let any issue slide. There \nmay be a few people at the Pentagon and at USTR who will cheer his \nretirement if only because Bob will not be around to bug them. On the \nother hand, I know firsthand that Bob is universally respected for his \nknowledge, his integrity, and his professionalism. He has big shoes \nthat will be hard to fill.\n  Over the years, he has helped me to foster business development in \nUtah, to prepare for the landmark debates we have had on trade, and to \nprotect our great Hill Air Force Base and other military facilities \nfrom ill-advised and politically motivated cuts and closures. I will \nalways be grateful for his yeoman effort on these projects. Utah is \nbetter off today for his dedication to these major issues.\n  Bob has also turned into a real Utahan during the years he has worked \nfor me. Traveling to our State often during the year, he fell in love \nwith\n\n[[Page S11736]]\n\nUtah and the possibilities that abound there. At the end of the month, \nBob will go from being my employee to being my constituent.\n  I wish him well as he is taking on the new challenge of retirement, \none for which his wife may not be fully prepared. I know Bob to be \nsuccessful at any project he takes on. I know he will drive his wife \nnuts if he stays home very much. But he won't. He is one of these guys \nwho really works hard and makes every second of his life count. He is \none of my dearest friends, and I love him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/07/senate-section/article/S11736-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               DONNA DAY\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I also want to say a word about Donna Day.\n  Donna has been on my staff for 15 years. She has been a loyal and \nefficient staffer, working diligently on data entry. I don't quite know \nhow we will fill the hole left in our correspondence management unit \nwhen she retires at the end of the month.\n  If the personnel office at any organization were to write down the \nattributes of the perfect employee, the list would describe Donna Day. \nShe has worked tirelessly over these 15 years on my behalf. She is \nnever late, rarely absent, and always pleasant. It seems that Donna \nnever has a bad day. We have always been able to count on her day after \nday, year after year, to do an important job consistently well. And, I \ndon't believe I have ever heard her complain about anything--not even \nthe deluge of letters, cards, faxes, and e-mails we received during \nsome very high profile debates.\n  Frankly, it is hard to imagine walking into our mailroom in January \nand not seeing her there sorting mail or working at the computer.\n  I have been blessed during my Senate tenure to have had excellent \nstaff, not just in my policy and senior staff positions, but in the \nsupport roles as well. Donna has been such a staffer, and I will miss \nher.\n  I want to thank her for her many contributions to my office, \ncongratulate her on a well-deserved retirement, and wish her all the \nbest as she moves on to the next chapter in her life.\n  I want her to know how much I appreciate her and her colleague Joyce \nand how much I love and appreciate Bob Lockwood. These people have \nproven that government workers work above and beyond, that they really \nmake a difference in all of our lives, and that they are part of the \nreason why many in this country have a quality of life they would not \notherwise have.\n  I am so grateful to these three people and for the service they have \ngiven to our country, to the Senate, to my constituents. It has been \nsuch a privilege to work with them. I say ``with them.'' They never \nworked for me. They worked for all of us. They worked with me. I don't \nthink I would be nearly as effective had it not been for the work that \nthese three wonderful people have done.

Mr. President, I rise with regret to mark another \nmilestone in the history of our system of justice. This morning's \npapers report that yesterday the state of Texas carried out its 39th \nexecution, the most of any state since 1862, when the military hanged \n39 Native Americans in one day in Minnesota. This evening, Texas is \nscheduled to surpass that record with its 40th execution. This is a \nregrettable record.\n  This year, as of yesterday, states in America have executed 82 \npeople. We have reached a sad state of affairs when this Country \nexecutes nearly 100 people every year. In 1998, only China and the \nCongo executed more people a year than did the United States.\n  And we have reached an inequitable state of affairs when nearly half \nof the executions this year--39 out of the 82 to date--were carried out \nin just one state. The state with the next most executions this year, \nOklahoma, has had 11 executions. Southern states have carried out \nnearly 9 out of 10 executions that have taken place this year.\n  Across the street, the building that holds the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States has emblazoned across its pediment the words ``Equal \nJustice Under Law.'' In a Nation that prides itself in that equal \njustice, how can we abide a system where nearly half of the executions \nare carried out in just one state?\n  Finally, I rise to mark another milestone. On Tuesday of next week, \nthe Federal Government is scheduled to reenter the grim business of \nexecution. For nearly 40 years, no one has been executed in the name of \nthe people of the United States. That is set to change next Tuesday.\n  In light of the demonstrated evidence of regional and racial \ndisparity in the application of this most final punishment, I call on \nthe President to stay that execution. I call on the President to impose \na moratorium on Federal executions and establish a blue ribbon \ncommission to examine the fairness of the system of capital punishment \nin America.\n  In September, the Department of Justice released a report on the \nfederal death penalty system. That report found that whether the \nfederal system sends people to death row appears to be related to the \nfederal district in which they are prosecuted or the color of their \nskin.\n  After the Justice Department released the report, White House \nspokesman Jake Siewert confirmed the President's view that ``these \nnumbers are troubling'' and that more information must be gathered to \ndetermine ``more about how the system works and what's behind those \nnumbers,'' including ``why minorities in some geographic districts are \ndisproportionately represented.''\n  We do not yet know why our federal system produces racially and \ngeographically lopsided results. We need a systematic review.\n  Many are joining in asking the President for a moratorium on \nexecutions. Their ranks include, among so many others, Lloyd Cutler, \nthe esteemed former adviser to Presidents Carter and Clinton; Julian \nBond, Chairman of the NAACP; and the Reverend Joseph Lowrey, chair of \nthe Black Leadership Forum and President emeritus of the Southern \nChristian Leadership Conference.\n  Yes, justice demands that crimes be punished. But if we demand \njustice, we must administer justice fairly.\n  Before we reach the milestone of reinstituting Federal executions, \nlet us pause to evaluate the fairness of our Nation's machinery of \ndeath.\n  Mr. President, let this be a milestone that we choose not to reach, \nnext week. God willing, let this be a milestone that we choose not to \nreach, if ever, for some time to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/07/senate-section/article/S11736-4", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11736-S11737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       AMBASSADOR DAVID HERMELIN\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to David \nB. Hermelin, former U.S. Ambassador to Norway, who passed away on \nNovember 22.\n\n[[Page S11737]]\n\n  After a distinguished business and philanthropic career in his native \nMichigan, Mr. Hermelin was nominated as envoy to Norway by President \nClinton in 1997 and confirmed by the Senate that same year.\n  Members of this Chamber know that, as might be expected with any \nlarge group, over the years the performance of our ambassadors, both \ncareer diplomats and political appointees, have varied widely. By any \nstandard, David Hermelin's tenure was spectacularly successful.\n  In the short space of two years, Ambassador Hermelin managed a \nremarkable feat: strengthening the already close ties between our ally \nNorway and the United States. His diplomatic and personal charm led to \nunprecedented reciprocal visits within three weeks of each other last \nyear--the Norwegian Prime Minister's to Washington, and President \nClinton's to Oslo, the first ever visit of an incumbent President to \nNorway, in this case in pursuit of a Middle Eastern peace settlement.\n  But Ambassador Hermelin's accomplishments were not limited to such \nhighly publicized events. Through behind-the-scenes daily efforts, he \nwas directly instrumental in the success of Lockheed Martin's bid, as \npart of a consortium, to sell the Norwegian Navy five new frigates \nequipped with the Aegis missile system, a sale worth more than one \nbillion dollars.\n  Ambassador Hermelin was recognized for his many contributions by \nbeing awarded the Royal Norwegian Order of Merit, the highest honor the \ncountry bestows upon non-Norwegians.\n  Even after Ambassador Hermelin was diagnosed with a terminal illness, \nhe vigorously played a major role to help others through an \ninternational initiative to provide prostheses to victims of civil \nconflict, such as in Sierra Leone.\n  On his visit to Oslo in November 1999, President Clinton, in speaking \nof Ambassador Hermelin, reflected on this kind of behavior: ``I don't \nknow anyone who has such a remarkable combination of energy and \ncommitment to the common good.''\n  After diagnosis of his terminal illness, he and a group of friends \ndonated ten million dollars to establish a brain tumor center at Henry \nFord Hospital in Michigan.\n  Ambassador Hermelin felt deeply connected to Israel and to Jewish \ncauses, raising millions of dollars for local Detroit and overseas \nneeds.\n  After the Ambassador's death, the U.S. State Department's Norway desk \nofficer offered this heartfelt testimony: ``David Hermelin was the kind \nof man who made a friend out of everybody he met, and the people who \nworked for him at the embassy regarded him with an affection that is \nunmatched by the feelings I've seen for any other ambassador at any \ntime to any country.''\n  Ambassador Hermelin is survived by his wife, five children, and eight \ngrandchildren. He will be sorely missed by all who knew him, \nparticularly by his colleagues in the U.S. Government.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/07/senate-section/article/S11737-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNITION OF DR. DWIGHT CRIST NORTHINGTON\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Dr. \nDwight Crist Northington on the occasion of his 9th Pastoral \nAnniversary at Calvary Baptist Church in Red Bank, New Jersey. Dr. \nNorthington is an extremely gifted individual, and it is an honor to \nrecognize this special moment in his life.\n  Dr. Northington has served the citizens of New Jersey since 1986, \nwhen he was named Pastor of First Baptist Church of South Orange. Since \nthat time, he has also served as president of Westside Ministerial \nAlliance and currently serves as the Moderator of the Seacoast \nMissionary Baptist Association. While having done a great deal for the \ncommunity of Red Bank, Dr. Northington has also served as an instructor \nat Brookdale Community College and as a member of the Borough of Red \nBank Board of Education.\n  The needs of our Nation can only be met through the industrious \nefforts of each individual. The work of Dr. Northington and others like \nhim is vital to the continued prosperity of our communities and meeting \nthe needs of people who live within them.\n  The citizens of Red Bank are fortunate to have a talented and \ndedicated individual such as Dr. Northington in their \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/07/senate-section/article/S11737-2", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOSH HEUPEL\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Josh \nHeupel, a native of Aberdeen, South Dakota. All of South Dakota, and \nespecially Aberdeen, is extremely proud of Josh, one of four finalists \nfor the Heisman Trophy. The Heisman Trophy is presented annually to the \nnation's top collegiate football player.\n  Josh is the starting quarterback of the number one ranked and \nundefeated Oklahoma Sooners, 12-0. Josh has passed for 3,392 yards and \n20 touchdowns this year which makes him one of the Heisman favorites. \nJosh has led the Oklahoma Sooners through a very difficult schedule, \nwhich included two wins against top ten ranked Kansas State and \novercame an early 14 point deficit against the then number one ranked \nNebraska Cornhuskers. Josh is preparing for the National Championship \ngame on January 3, 2001 against the Florida State Seminoles. No matter \nwhat the outcome is, I know the entire state is very proud of Josh and \ngrateful he has conducted himself in a way that shines greatly on South \nDakota.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Ken and \nCindy Heupel, Josh's parents, on Josh's success. As the father of three \nchildren who have participated in extracurricular activities, I can \nimagine how proud Ken and Cindy must feel today. Ken is currently the \nHead Football Coach at Northern State University in Aberdeen and Cindy \nis the principal at Aberdeen Central High School.\n  Again, my congratulations to Josh Heupel and his family on behalf of \nthe entire state of South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/07/senate-section/article/S11737-3", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO VINCENT CANBY\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, in late October, as many Senators \nwill know, Vincent Canby, ``whose lively wit and sophisticated tastes \nilluminated film and theater reviews in the New York Times for more \nthan 35 years'' died at age 76. Thinking of an appropriate manner in \nwhich the United States Congress might honor his most honored memory, \nthere came to mind an observation he made in a review of a film based \non E.M. Foster's novel ``Howard's End.''\n\n       It's time for legislation decreeing that no one be allowed \n     to make a screen adaptation of any quality whatsoever if \n     Ismail Merchant, James Ivory and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala are \n     available, and if they elect to do the job. Trespassers \n     should be prosecuted, possibly condemned, sentenced to watch \n     ``Adam Bede'' on ``Masterpiece Theatrer'' for five to seven \n     years.\n\n  The legislative drafting service had no difficulty producing \nlegislative language. I had in mind a joint resolution, which is, of \ncourse, a statute. However, in view of our oath ``to uphold and defend \nthe Constitution of the United States,'' I felt in need of a legal \nopinion as to whether there might be constitutional impediments to such \na measure. I think for example of the ``taking clause'' of the fourth \namendment recently much discussed in learned papers associated with the \nUniversity of Chicago School of Law. And so I set out to obtain \nadvisory opinions. Alas, I had tarried too long. November 7 had passed. \nThe Presidential election was in dispute. All of the constitutional \nlawyers in Washington had decamped for Florida.\n  And now, in the closing hours of the 106th Congress, they are still \nthere.\n  This leaves me with no choice but to withhold the measure for now. \nHappily I am informed that next April we will witness the premier of \nThe Wandering Company's adaptation of Henry James' ``The Golden Bowl.'' \nWhat a splendid way to begin the new millennium. (For that is what the \nyear 2001 will be, and our trio are naught if not scrupulous as to \ndetails.) Surely a Senator in the 107th Congress will wish to pursue \nthis matter. The glory of three continents is yet to be proclaimed in \nlaw.\n  I regret the inconvenience this may cause viewers of ``Adam Bede,'' \nand I surely would not wish to denigrate ``Masterpiece Theatre,'' but \nVincent Canvy was a just and moderate man. And, as is proclaimed on the \nwall above the bench of the Chenango County Courthouse in James Ivory's \nancestral home of Norwich, New York ``Fiat Justica Ruat Coelum''.--Let \njustice be done though the heavens fall.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/07/senate-section/article/S11738-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11738]]\n   IN RECOGNITION OF DR.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to three \noutstanding people from my home state of Michigan. On December 10, \n2000, Dr. Charles G. Adams, Heaster Wheeler and Wendy Wagenheim are \nbeing recognized for their outstanding leadership in this year's ``All \nKids First'' campaign initiative.\n  Dr. Charles G. Adams has served as Pastor of Hartford Memorial \nBaptist Church in Detroit, Michigan, since 1969, and is one of \nDetroit's pre-eminent religious and civil rights leaders. Because of \nhis eloquence and command of the issues, he is highly sought after as a \nspeaker on issues of faith and social justice. He served as Co-Chair of \nthe All Kids First initiative, participating in televised debates and \nhelped to lead the effort among his colleagues in the religious \ncommunity and the community at large. Finally, I would like to add a \nheartfelt ``Happy Birthday'' to Dr. Adams, who will be celebrating his \n64th birthday on December 13, 2000.\n  Heaster Wheeler is the Executive Director of the Detroit Branch \nNAACP, the largest NAACP chapter in the United States. Wendy Wagenheim \nserves as Legislative Director for the American Civil Liberties Union \nof Michigan. Their combined experience in government, community service \nand public relations was invaluable in the All Kids First initiative. \nTogether, Mr. Wheeler and Ms. Wagenheim participated in more than 45 \ndebates about Proposal 1 throughout the state of Michigan. Their \nefforts were instrumental in defeating the proposal and in ensuring \nthat all of Michigan's public schools will have adequate resources to \neducate our children.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating \nDr. Charles Adams, Heaster Wheeler and Wendy Wagenheim as they are \nhonored for their leadership of Michigan's All Kids First initiative, \nand in encouraging them to keep fighting on behalf of Michigan's \nchildren and to improve Michigan's public schools.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/07/senate-section/article/S11738-2", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:55 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby one of its clerks, announced that the House has passed the following \njoint resolution, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.J.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Energy to guarantee \nloans to facilitate nuclear nonproliferation programs and activities of \nthe Government of the Russian Federation, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                  FISSILE MATERIAL LOAN GUARANTEE ACT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Fissile Material \nLoan Guarantee Act. This Act is intended to increase the arsenal of \nprograms that reduce proliferation threats from the Russian nuclear \nweapons complex.\n  This Act presents an unusual option, which I've been discussing with \nthe leadership of some of the world's largest private banks and lending \ninstitutions and with senior officials of the Russian Federation's \nMinistry for Atomic Energy. I also am aware that discussions between \nWestern lending institutions and the Russian Federation are progressing \nwell and that discussions with the International Atomic Energy \nAuthority or IAEA have helped to clarify their responsibilities.\n  This Act would enable the imposition of international protective \nsafeguards on new, large stocks of Russian weapons-ready materials in a \nway that enables the Russian Federation to gain near-term financial \nresources from the same materials. The Act requires that these \nresources be used in support of non-proliferation or energy programs \nwithin Russia. It also requires that the materials used to \ncollateralize these loans must remain under international IAEA \nsafeguards forevermore.\n  This Act does not replace programs that currently are in place to \nensure that weapons-grade materials can\n\n[[Page S11740]]\n\nnever be used in weapons in the future. The Highly Enriched Uranium or \nHEU Agreement is moving toward elimination of 500 tons of Russian \nweapons-grade uranium. The Plutonium Disposition Agreement is similarly \nworking on elimination of 34 tons of Russian weapons-grade plutonium.\n  The HEU agreement removes material usable in 20,000 nuclear weapons, \nwhile the plutonium disposition agreement similarly removes material \nfor more than 4,000 nuclear weapons. Both of these agreements enable \nthe transition of Russian materials into commercial reactor fuel, \nwhich, after use in a reactor, destroys its ``weapons-grade'' \nattributes. There should be no question that both these agreements \nremain of vital importance to both nations.\n  But estimates are that the Russian Federation has vast stocks of \nweapons-grade materials in addition to the amounts they've already \ndeclared as surplus to their weapons needs in these earlier agreements. \nIf we can provide additional incentives to Russia to encourage \ntransition of more of these materials into configurations where it is \nnot available for diversion or re-use in weapons, we've made another \nsignificant step toward global stability.\n  By introducing this Act now, Mr. President, I'm hoping that this \nconcept will be carefully reviewed by all interested parties--by the \nnew Administration, by lending institutions, and by the Russian \nFederation. My hope is that in the next Congress, these interests can \ncome together to enable this new approach to still further reduce the \nproliferation threats from surplus weapons materials in the Russian \nnuclear weapons complex.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/07/senate-section/article/S11740-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                S. 1915\n\n  At the request of Mr. Jeffords, the name of the Senator from \nWashington (Mrs. Murray) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1915, a bill to \nenhance the services provided by the Environmental Protection Agency to \nsmall communities that are attempting to comply with national, State, \nand local environmental regulations.\n\n\n                                S. 3175\n\n  At the request of Mr. Craig, the name of the Senator from Oregon (Mr. \nWyden) was added as a cosponsor of S. 3175, a bill to amend the \nConsolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to authorize the National \nRural Development Partnership, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 3250\n\n  At the request of Mr. Brownback, the name of the Senator from Indiana \n(Mr. Bayh) was added as a cosponsor of S. 3250, a bill to provide for a \nUnited States response in the event of a unilateral declaration of a \nPalestinian state.\n\n\n                            S.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) in 1980 and 1981, the Bureau of Reclamation constructed \n     the bascule gates on top of the Dickinson Dam on the Heart \n     River, North Dakota, to provide additional water supply in \n     the reservoir known as Patterson Lake for the city of \n     Dickinson, North Dakota, and for additional flood control and \n     other benefits;\n       (2) the gates had to be significantly modified in 1982 \n     because of damage resulting from a large ice block causing \n     excessive pressure on the hydraulic system, causing the \n     system to fail;\n       (3) since 1991, the City has received its water supply from \n     the Southwest Water Authority,\n\n[[Page S11744]]\n\n     which provides much higher quality water from the Southwest \n     Pipeline Project;\n       (4) the City now receives almost no benefit from the \n     bascule gates because the City does not require the \n     additional water provided by the bascule gates for its \n     municipal water supply;\n       (5) the City has repaid more than $1,200,000 to the United \n     States for the construction of the bascule gates, and has \n     been working for several years to reach an agreement with the \n     Bureau of Reclamation to alter its repayment contract;\n       (6) the City has a longstanding commitment to improving the \n     water quality and recreation value of the reservoir and has \n     been working with the United States Geological Survey, the \n     North Dakota Department of Game and Fish, and the North \n     Dakota Department of Health to improve water quality; and\n       (7) it is in the public interest to resolve this issue by \n     providing for a single payment to the United States in lieu \n     of the scheduled annual payments and for the termination of \n     any further repayment obligation.\n\n     SEC. 803. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Bascule gates.--The term ``bascule gates'' means the \n     structure constructed on the Dam to provide additional water \n     storage capacity in the Lake.\n       (2) City.--The term ``City'' means the city of Dickinson, \n     North Dakota.\n       (3) Dam.--The term ``Dam'' means Dickinson Dam on the Heart \n     River, North Dakota.\n       (4) Lake.--The term ``Lake'' means the reservoir known as \n     ``Patterson Lake'' in the State of North Dakota.\n       (5) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior, acting through the Commissioner of the \n     Bureau of Reclamation.\n\n     SEC. 804. FORGIVENESS OF DEBT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary shall accept a 1-time \n     payment of $300,000 in lieu of the existing repayment \n     obligations of the City under the Bureau of Reclamation \n     Contract No. 9-07-60W0384, dated December 19, 1988, toward \n     which amount any payments made by the City to the Secretary \n     on or after June 2, 1998, shall be credited.\n       (b) Ownership.--Title to the Dam and bascule gates shall \n     remain with the United States.\n       (c) Costs.--(1) The Secretary shall enter into an agreement \n     with the City to allocate responsibilities for operation and \n     maintenance costs of the bascule gates as provided in this \n     subsection.\n       (2) The City shall be responsible for operation and \n     maintenance costs of the bascule gates, up to a maximum \n     annual cost of $15,000. The Secretary shall be responsible \n     for all other costs.\n       (d) Water Service Contracts.--The Secretary may enter into \n     appropriate water service contracts if the City or any other \n     person or entity seeks to use water from the Lake for \n     municipal water supply or other purposes.\n       Amend the title so as to read ``An Act to direct the \n     Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study on the \n     reclamation and reuse of water and wastewater in the State of \n     Hawaii, and for other purposes.''.\n\n  Mr. HAGEL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 5461, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5461) to amend the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries \n     Conservation and Management Act to eliminate the wasteful and \n     unsportsmanlike practice of shark finning.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks on H.R. \n5461, the Shark Finning Prohibition Act, legislation to begin, and I \nstress the word begin, to ensure the conservation of sharks, including \naddressing the causes and consequences of shark finning.\n  First, I want to recognize Ms. Snow, our chairman on the Oceans and \nFisheries Subcommittee on the Commerce Committee, and Mr. Kerry, \nranking member of the subcommittee, for putting shark conservation \nlegislation on the committee agenda this Congress. My colleagues \nrecognized the substantial danger international fleets pose to sharks \naround the world, either as a result of direct harvest, high bycatch, \nor practices such as shark finning. As with so many of our highly \nmigratory and protected species, we cannot hope to address these \nthreats solely through domestic action.\n  We are here today because of the growing threats to shark \npopulations, which are particularly vulnerable to harvest and bycatch \nmortality. Most attention has been focused specifically on the practice \nof shark finning, which has increased dramatically over the past \ndecade, driven by rising demand for fins in the world market. However, \nthere are other threats to shark conservation, including directed shark \nfisheries and the use of non-selective fishing gear, that must be given \nfurther attention, both here and abroad. In addition, the amount of \nfinning done by U.S. fishermen pales by comparison to the amount of \nfinning done by foreign fleets outside of U.S. waters. The global shark \nfin trade involves at least 125 countries, and the demand for shark \nfins and other shark products has driven dramatic increases in shark \nfishing and shark mortality around the world. In 1998, the National \nMarine Fisheries Service estimated that 120 metric tons of shark fins \nwere landed in Hawaii that had been caught by foreign vessels, with a \nvalue between $2,376,000 and $2,640,000. That is roughly four times the \namount landed by U.S. vessels in the same year. These figures include \nonly figures for shark fins that happen to go through U.S. ports in the \nPacific; the total amount of finning by foreign fishermen is \nundoubtedly much higher.\n  Although I support the legislation before us today, I am disappointed \nthat we were not able to convince House Members and others that passage \nof S. 2831, the Shark Conservation Act of 2000, introduced by Senator \nKerry, and supported by our subcommittee members, was the best course \nof action to take this year. S. 2831 attempted to address threats to \nshark conservation in a holistic manner. It looked beyond domestic \nfinning, and provided the administration with tools to address finning \nby foreign nations as well. As a result, the current bill does not \ncontain the strong international enforcement measures of the Shark \nConservation Act. Dr. Andrew Rosenberg of the National Marine Fisheries \nService, in October 1999 testimony before the House warned of the \nconsequences of failing to impose international measures against shark \nfinning:\n\n       . . . even with implementation of new U.S. management \n     measures to prohibit shark finning, in all likelihood, \n     foreign-flagged vessels will continue shark finning in \n     international waters. In the absence of strict international \n     measures to prohibit shark finning, the anticipated result of \n     new U.S. prohibitions would be that foreign vessels will \n     develop new shipment routes for shark fins through ports \n     outside Hawaii.\n\n  The administration's warning should be taken seriously. When all the \npress releases and headlines have faded from memory, there is no doubt \nthat foreign fleets will silently, and happily, continue--or even \nincrease--shark finning, with no adverse repercussions to speak of. We \nsincerely hope that H.R. 5461 will not merely shift shark-finning and \nthe resulting profits over to foreign nations and international \ncorporations, with no net benefit to shark conservation. The only way \nto prevent this is by applying these rules to everyone. Simply enacting \nH.R. 5461 without addressing shark conservation internationally is \nshort-sighted and will not solve the problem. In the next Congress, I \nintend to continue working with my colleagues in the Senate, House, and \nthe new administration, whichever administration that may turn out to \nbe, to craft a solution that will lead to the eventual cessation of \nfinning internationally.\n  Although I do believe that the current bill is not as strong as it \nshould be, I am glad to report it contains a number of provisions from \nthe Senate bill that will lay the foundation for addressing the \ninternational fishing practices that threaten shark conservation \nefforts, including the practice of finning. H.R. 5461 begins the \ncritical process of collecting the information, including data on the \ninternational shark fin trade, that is so lacking at the present time \nby: (1) directing the administration to initiate or continue \ndiscussions with other countries to ban shark finning; (2) requiring \nthe collection of information on trade in shark fins and directing the \nSecretary to report the findings to Congress; and (3) establishing a \nresearch program to help improve shark stock assessments, reduce \nincidental catch, and better utilize sharks captured legally.\n  Let me conclude by stating that I rise in support of this legislation \nand urge its adoption, but I cannot help but think of what we may have \nbeen able to accomplish with passage of Mr. Kerry's bill, S. 2831. H.R. \n5461 does take an important first step to end the practice of finning, \nbut it is only the first step--the real work is yet to come.\n\n[[Page S11745]]\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks in support of \nH.R. 5461, the Shark Finning Prohibition Act, which will the Senate has \npassed today and which will be forwarded to President Clinton for his \nsignature.\n  H.R. 5461 is identical to a provision I authored, along with Senator \nSnowe, in Senate Amendment 4320. That provision was then introduced in \nthe House by Representative Cunningham as a stand alone bill and passed \nthe House on October 30, 2000. I want to thank Senators Hollings and \nSnowe, who helped move this legislation through the Commerce Committee \nand the Senate. And, I thank Representative Cunningham for his work.\n  Shark finning is the practice of catching a shark, removing its fins \nand returning the remainder of the shark to the sea. It is highly \nwasteful practice since only a very small portion of the shark is \nconsumed and the rest is dumped back into the sea. The National Marine \nFisheries Service already prohibits shark finning in the Atlantic and \nGulf of Mexico. This legislation would expand that ban into the Pacific \nand create a consistent national policy by amending the Magnuson-\nStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.\n  Sharks are among the most biologically vulnerable species in the \nocean. Their slow growth, late maturity and small number of offspring \nleave them exceptionally vulnerable to over fishing and slow to recover \nfrom depletion. At the same time, sharks, as top predators, are \nessential to maintaining the balance of life in the sea. While many of \nour other highly migratory species such as tunas and swordfish are \nsubject to rigorous management regimes, sharks have largely been \noverlooked until recently. By ending the wasteful practice of finning, \nwe will, I hope, protect shark populations.\n  However, it is important that the passage of this legislation is only \nthe beginning of national efforts to protect sharks and their marine \necosystems. There are other threats to sharks in addition to finning in \ndomestic waters. These include directed fisheries, by-catch and the use \nof non-selective gear. And, importantly, we must recognize that shark \nfinning takes place in foreign and international waters, not just the \nUnited States waters. The global shark fin trade involves at least 125 \ncountries, and the demand for shark fins and other shark products has \ndriven dramatic increases in shark fishing and shark mortality around \nthe world. We must tackle these issues, as well.\n  I want to note that in the Commerce Committee we tried to address the \nissue of international shark finning more aggressively and, I believe, \nmore appropriately. Senator Hollings and I introduced S. 2831, the \nShark Conservation Act of 2000. This proposal would have (1) mandated \nthat the Secretary of Commerce report to Congress on progress being \nmade domestically and internationally to reduce shark finning; (2) \nestablished a procedure to certify whether governments have adopted \nshark conservation measures; (3) banned the import of sharks or shark \nparts from countries that do not meet these certification procedures; \nand (4) provided technical assistance to foreign nations in an attempt \nto promote compliance.\n  Unfortunately, this comprehensive proposal was rejected by the House. \nWe therefore sought the middle ground of the proposal in H.R. 5461. The \nlegislation we will pass today (1) calls on the Administration to \ninitiate or continue discussions with other countries to ban shark \nfinning; (2) requires the collection of information on trade in shark \nfins and directing the Secretary of Commerce to report the findings to \nCongress; and (3) establishes a research program to help improve shark \nstock assessments, reduce incidental catch, and better utilize shark \ncaptured legally. This is a start, but only a start. I hope that my \ncolleagues and the advocacy groups that advocated for this proposal \nwill continue to work for additional international conservation \nmeasures.\n  Finally, my bill would authorize a Western Pacific longline fisheries \ncooperative research program to provide information for shark stock \nassessments, identify fishing gear and practices that prevent or \nminimize incidental catch of sharks and ensure maximum survivorship of \nreleased sharks, and provide data on the international shark fin trade.\n  Mr. President, the United States is a global leader in fisheries \nconservation and management. I believe this legislation provides us the \nopportunity to further this role, and take the first step in addressing \nan international fisheries management issue. In addition, I believe the \nU.S. should continue to lead efforts at the United Nations and \ninternational conventions to achieve coordinated international \nmanagement of sharks, including an international ban on shark-finning. \nI look forward to working with Committee members on this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. HAGEL.

Res. 386\n\n       Whereas on December 7, 1941, the Imperial Japanese Navy and \n     Air Force attacked units of the Armed Forces of the United \n     States stationed at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii;\n       Whereas 2,403 members of the Armed Forces of the United \n     States were killed in the attack on Pearl Harbor;\n       Whereas there are currently more than 12,000 members of the \n     Pearl Harbor Survivors Association;\n       Whereas the 60th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor \n     will be on December 7, 2001;\n       Whereas on August 23, 1994, Public Law 103-308 was enacted, \n     designating December 7 of each year as National Pearl Harbor \n     Remembrance Day;\n       Whereas Public Law 103-308, reenacted as section 129 of \n     title 36, United States Code, requests the President to issue \n     a proclamation each year calling on the people of the United \n     States to observe National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities, and for all \n     departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the Federal \n     Government, and interested organizations, groups, and \n     individuals, to fly the flag of the United States at half-\n     staff each December 7 in honor of the individuals who died as \n     a result of their service at Pearl Harbor;\n       Whereas many citizens remain unaware of National Pearl \n     Harbor Remembrance Day; and\n       Whereas many Federal offices do not lower their flags to \n     half-staff each December 7: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) pays tribute to the citizens of the United States who \n     died in the attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7, \n     1941, and to the members of the Pearl Harbor Survivors \n     Association; and\n       (2) urges the President to take more active steps--\n       (A) to inform the American public of the existence of \n     National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day; and\n       (B) to ensure that the flag of the United States is flown \n     at half-staff in accordance with section 129 of title 36, \n     United States Code.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/07/senate-section/article/S11746-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, DECEMBER 8, 2000\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate completes its business today, it recess until the hour of 10 \na.m. on Friday, December 8. I further ask consent that on Friday, \nimmediately following the prayer, the Journal of proceedings be \napproved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their \nuse later in the day, and the Senate then begin a period of morning \nbusiness until 10:30 a.m., with Senators permitted to speak for up to \n10 minutes each with the time equally divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I say to my \nfriend from Nebraska, the acting leader, it is my understanding we are \ngoing to try to extend the CR until Monday. I hope in the spirit that \nwas felt around here today, that we were going to try to complete this \nsession's work sometime next week, we can continue that.\n  I do say, just as a warning to everyone, we have been to this point \non a number of occasions before with this session of Congress. It seems \nwe can never quite get over the goal line.\n  I hope all Members, Democrats and Republicans, will do their utmost \nto try to work this out. We have four appropriations bills that are \nbadly needed. In my opinion--and I think everyone in the minority \nagrees--it would be a shame if we were unable to complete those bills \nand have to go forward with a continuing resolution, in effect dumping \nall that in the lap of the new President and new Congress.\n  Of course, I am not going to object to my friend's unanimous consent \nrequest, but I do say we should really try to put our shoulders to the \nwheel and push this session over the goal line.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Senator. I know that is the intent of the \nleadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
