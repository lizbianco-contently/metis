Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the pending amendments to the FAA bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       Gorton Amendment No. 1892, to consolidate and revise \n     provisions relating to slot rules for certain airports.\n       Gorton (for Rockefeller/Gorton) Amendment No. 1893, to \n     improve the efficiency of the air traffic control system.\n       Baucus Amendment No. 1898, to require the reporting of the \n     reasons for delays or cancellations in air flights.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am sorry that I was not here yesterday \nwhen the debate began. Nevertheless, I rise in support of S. 82, the \nAir Transportation Improvement Act. As everyone should be aware, this \nis ``must-pass'' legislation that includes numerous provisions to \nmaintain and improve the safety, security and capacity of our nation's \nairports and airways. Furthermore, this bill would make great strides \nin enhancing competition in the airline industry.\n  If Congress does not reauthorize the Airport Improvement Program \n(AIP), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will be prohibited \nfrom issuing much needed grants to airports in every state, regardless \nof whether or not funds have been appropriated. We have now entered \nfiscal year 2000, and we cannot put off reauthorization of the AIP. The \nprogram lapsed as of last Friday. Every day that goes by without an AIP \nauthorization is another day that important projects cannot move ahead.\n  If we fail to reauthorize this program, we may do significant harm to \nthe transportation infrastructure of our country. AIP grants play a \ncritical part of airport development. Without these grants, important \nsafety, security, and capacity projects will be put at risk throughout \nthe country. The types of safety projects that airports use AIP grants \nto fund include instrument landing systems, runway lighting, and \nextensions of runway safety areas.\n  But the bill does more than provide money. It also takes specific, \nproactive steps to improve aviation safety. For example, S. 82 would \nrequire that cargo aircraft be equipped with instruments that warn of \nimpending midair collisions. Passenger aircraft are already equipped \nwith collision avoidance equipment, which gives pilots ample time to \nmake evasive maneuvers. The need for these devices was highlighted a \nfew months ago by a near-collision between two cargo aircraft over \nKansas. Unfortunately, that was not an isolated incident.\n  On the aviation safety front, the bill also: provides explicit AIP \nfunding eligibility for the installation of integrated inpavement \nlighting systems, and other runway incursion prevention devices, \nrequires more types of fixed-wing aircraft in air commerce to be \nequipped with emergency locator transmitters by 2002, provides broader \nauthority to the FAA to determine what circumstances warrant a criminal\n\n[[Page S11892]]\n\nhistory record check for persons performing security screening of \npassengers and cargo, reauthorizes the aviation insurance program, also \nknown as war risk insurance. This program provides insurance for \ncommercial aircraft that are operating in high risk areas, such as \ncountries at war or on the verge of war. Commercial insurers usually \nwill not provide coverage for such operations, which are often required \nto advance U.S. foreign policy or to support our overseas national \nsecurity operations. The program expired on August 6, 1999, and cannot \nbe extended without this authorization, gives the FAA the authority to \nfine unruly airline passengers who interfere with the operation or \nsafety of a civil flight, up to $10,000 per violation, authorizes \n$450,000 to address the problem of bird ingestions into aircraft \nengines, authorizes $9.1 million over three years for a safety and \nsecurity management program to provide training for aviation safety \npersonnel. The program would concentrate on personnel from countries \nthat are not in compliance with international safety standards, \nauthorizes at least $30 million annually for the FAA to purchase \nprecision instrument landing systems (ILS) through its ILS inventory \nprogram, authorizes at least $5 million for the FAA to carry out at \nleast one project to test and evaluate innovative airport security \nsystems and related technologies, including explosive detection systems \nin an airport environment, requires the FAA to maintain human weather \nobservers to augment the services provided by the Automated Surface \nObservation System (ASOS) weather stations, at least until the FAA \ncertifies that the automated systems provide consistent reporting of \nchanging meteorological conditions, allows the FAA to continue and \nexpand its successful program of establishing consortia of government \nand aviation industry representatives at individual airports to provide \nadvice on aviation security and safety, requires that individuals be \nfined or imprisoned when they knowingly pilot a commercial aircraft \nwithout a valid FAA certificate, requires the FAA to consider the need \nfor (1) improving runway safety areas, which are essentially runway \nextensions that provide a landing cushion beyond the ends of runways; \n(2) requiring the installation of precision approach path indicators, \nwhich are visual vertical guidance landing systems for runways, \nprohibits any company or employee that is convicted of an offense \ninvolving counterfeit aviation parts from keeping or obtaining an FAA \ncertificate. Air carriers, repair stations, manufacturers, and any \nother FAA certificate holders would be prohibited from employing anyone \nconvicted of an offense involving counterfeit parts.\n\n  This bill requires the FAA to accelerate a rulemaking on Flight \nOperations Quality Assurance. FOQA is a program under which airlines \nand their crews share operational information, including data captured \nby flight data recorders. Information about errors is shared to focus \non situations in which hardware, air traffic control procedures, or \ncompany practices create hazardous situations.\n  It requires the FAA to study and promote improved training in the \nhuman factors arena, including the development of specific training \ncurricula.\n  It provides FAA whistleblowers who uncover safety risks with the \nability to seek redress if they are subject to retaliation for their \nactions.\n  The legislation provides employees of airlines, and employees of \nairline contractors and subcontractors, with statutory whistleblower \nprotections to facilitate their providing air safety information.\n  These provisions will be critical in the continuing effort to enhance \nsafety and reduce the accident rate.\n  Of all the bills that the Senate may consider this year, the Air \nTransportation Improvement Act should be easy. This bill is \nsubstantially the same as the Wendell H. Ford National Air \nTransportation System Improvement Act, which this body approved last \nSeptember by a vote of 92-1. If anything, this bill is better than last \nyear's. There is no rational reason why we can't take care of this \nquickly.\n  Because S. 82 is so similar to last year's FAA reauthorization bill, \nI will skip a lengthy description of every provision, particularly \nthose that have not changed. Nevertheless, I do want to remind my \ncolleagues of a few key items in this legislation and describe what has \nchanged since last year.\n  The manager's amendment to this bill, which is in the nature of a \nsubstitute, has at least three critical parts that are worth \nhighlighting. First and foremost, S. 82 reauthorizes the FAA and the \nAIP through fiscal year 2002. Second, the bill contains essential \nprovisions to promote a competitive aviation industry. Third, it will \nprotect the environment in our national parks by establishing a system \nfor the management of commercial air tour overflights. With the help of \nmy colleagues, I have worked long and hard on all of these issues.\n\n  The provisions in S. 82 that have generated the most discussion are \nthe airline competition provisions. As I have said many times, the \npurpose of these provisions is to complete the deregulation of our \ndomestic aviation system for the benefit of consumers and communities \neverywhere. According to the General Accounting Office, there still \nexist significant barriers to competition at several important airports \nin this country. These barriers include slot controls at Chicago \nO'Hare, Reagan National, and LaGuardia and Kennedy in New York, and the \nFederal perimeter rule at Reagan National.\n  In a recent study, the GAO found that the established airlines have \nexpanded their slot holdings a the four-slot constrained airports, \nwhile the share held by startup airlines remains low. Airfares at these \nairports continue to be consistently higher than other airports of \ncomparable size.\n  It does not take a trained economist to figure that out. If you \nrestrict the number of flights, then obviously the cost of those \nflights will go up.\n  Additionally, the federal permimeter rule continues to prevent \nairlines based outside the perimeter from gaining competitive access to \nReagan National.\n  This GAO report reinforces my view that the perimeter rule is a \nrestrictive and anti-competitive Federal regulation that prohibits \nairlines from flying the routes sought by their customers. According to \ntestimony presented to the Commerce Committee by the Department of \nTransportation, the perimeter rule is not needed for safety or \noperational reasons. For that matter, neither are slot controls. \nTherefore, these restrictions simply are not warranted.\n  So long as the Federal Government maintains outdated unneeded \nrestrictions, which favor established airlines over new entrants, \nderegulation will not be complete. Slot controls and the perimeter rule \nare Federal interference with the market's ability to reflect consumer \npreferences. We should not be in the position of choosing sides in the \nmarketplace.\n  With respect to Reagan National, I would like to make one final \npoint. Just last month, the GAO came out with another study confirming \nthat the airport is fully capable of handling more flights without \ncompromising safety or creating significant aircraft delays. The GAO \nalso found that the proposal in this bill pertaining to perimeter rule \nwould not significantly harm any of the other airports in this region. \nI believe the GAO's findings demonstrated that there are no credible \narguments against the modest changes proposed in this bill.\n  Although the reported version of S. 82 increased the number of new \nopportunities for service to Reagan National compared to last year's \nbill, an amendment that will be offered by Senators Gorton and \nRockefeller will bring the total number of slot exemptions back to the \nlevel approved by the Senate last year. It is sadly ironic that an \nairport named for President Reagan, who stood for free markets and \nderegulation, will continue to be burdened with two forms of economic \nregulation--slots and a perimeter rule. But some loosening of these \nunfair restrictions is better than the status quo, and so I will not \noppose the amendment.\n  Fortunately, the competition-related amendment being offered by \nSenator Gorton and others includes several significant improvements to \nthe reported bill. Most notably, the slot controls at O'Hare, Kennedy, \nand LaGuardia airports will eventually be eliminated. This is a \nremarkable win for consumers and a change that I endorse \nwholeheartedly. Furthermore, before the slot controls are lifted \nentirely, regional jets, and new entrant air carriers will\n\n[[Page S11893]]\n\nhave more opportunities to serve these airports. The typically low \ncost, low fare new entrants will bring competition to these restricted \nmarkets, which will result in lower fares for travelers. Travelers from \nsmall communities will benefit from increased access to these crucial \nmarkets.\n  I am not alone in believing that the competition provisions in the \nbill are a big step forward for all Americans. Support for these \ncompetition-enhancing provisions is strong and widespread. I have heard \nfrom organizations as diverse as the Western Governor's Association of \nAttorneys General, the Des Monies International Airport, and Midwest \nExpress Airlines. All of them support one or more of the provisions \nthat loosen or eliminate slot and perimeter rule restrictions.\n  But it was a letter from just an average citizen in Alexandria, VA \nthat caught my attention. He said that he feels victimized by the \nartificial restrictions placed on flights from Reagan National. His \nyoung family is living on one paycheck. He says that his family budget \ndoes not allow them the luxury of using Reagan National, which is less \nthan ten minutes from his home. To him, using Reagan National seems to \nbe ``a privilege reserved for the wealthy and those on expense \naccounts.'' For the sake of his privacy I will not mention his name, \nbut this is precisely the type of person who deserves the benefits of \nmore competition at restricted airports like Reagan National.\n  In summary, this bill represents two years of work on a comprehensive \npackage to promote aviation safety, airport and air traffic control \ninfrastructure investment, and enhanced competition in the airline \nindustry. Our air transportation system is essential to the Nation's \nwell being. We must not neglect its pressing needs. If we fail to act, \nthe FAA will be prevented from addressing vital security and safety \nneeds in every State in the Union. I urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport swift passage of this legislation.\n  I thank Senator Hollings and his staff, Senator Rockefeller, Senator \nGorton, and all members of the Commerce Committee who have taken a very \nactive role in putting this legislation together. It is a significantly \nlarge piece of legislation reflecting a great deal of complexities \nassociated with aviation and the importance of it.\n  Approximately a year ago, a commission that was mandated to be \nconvened by legislation reported to the Congress and the American \npeople. Their findings and recommendations were very disturbing. In \nsummary, these very qualified individuals reported that unless we \nrapidly expand our aviation capability in America, every day, in every \nmajor airport in America, is going to be similar to the day before \nThanksgiving. I do not know how many of my colleagues have had the \nopportunity of being in a major airport on the busiest day of the year \nin America. It is not a lot of fun.\n  I do a lot of flying, a great deal of flying this year, more than I \nhave in previous years. I see the increase in delays, especially along \nthe east coast corridor. I have seen when there is a little bit of bad \nweather our air traffic control system becomes gridlocked and hours and \nhours of delay ensue. These delays are well documented.\n  The committee is going to have to look at what we have done in the \nair traffic control system modernization area. We are going to have to \nlook at what they have not done. There are a number of recommendations, \nsome of which we have acted on in this committee, some of which we have \nnot. But if we do not pass this legislation, then how can we move \nforward in aviation in this country?\n  I believe any objective economist will assure all of us that \nderegulation has led to increased competition and lower fares. But some \nof that trend has leveled off of late because of a lack of competition, \nbecause of a lack of ability to enter the aviation industry.\n  This is disturbing to me because the one thing, it seems to me, we \nowe Americans is an affordable way of getting from one place to \nanother; and more and more Americans, obviously, are making use of the \nairlines.\n  I can give you a lot of anecdotal stories about what the effective \ncompetition is. For example, at Raleigh-Durham Airport, when it was \nannounced that a new, low-cost airline was going to be operating out of \nthat airport, the day after the announcement, long before the airline \nstarted its competition, the average fares dropped by 25 percent--a 25-\npercent drop in average airfares.\n  We have to do whatever we can to encourage the ability of new \nentrants to come into the aviation business. My greatest disappointment \nin deregulation of the airlines is that the phenomenon which was \ngenerated initially has not remained nearly at the level we would like \nto see it.\n  There are problems many of my colleagues, including the Senator from \nWest Virginia, have talked about at length--of rural areas not being \nable to have just minimal air services. That is why we are dramatically \nincreasing the essential air service authorization, so that more rural \nareas can achieve it.\n\n  I also think it is very clear the air traffic control system is \nlagging far behind. I think there is no doubt that we have had problems \nwith passengers receiving fundamental courtesies and rights which they \ndeserve. That is why there has been so much attention generated \nconcerning the need for some fundamental, basic rights that passengers \nshould have and receive from the airlines. For example, the debacle of \nlast Christmas at Detroit should never be repeated in America, what \nairline passengers were subjected to on that unhappy occasion. Yes, it \nwas generated by bad weather, but, no, there was no excuse for the \ntreatment many of those airline passengers received on that day and \nother passengers have received in other airports around the country, \nonly the examples were not as egregious, nor did they get the \nwidespread publicity.\n  If you believe, as I do, if we continue the economic prosperity that \nwe have been enjoying in this country, we will continue to see a \ndramatic and very significant increase in the use of the airlines by \nAmerican citizens, we have major challenges ahead.\n  I do not pretend that this legislation addresses all of those \nchallenges, but I do assert, unequivocally, that if we pass this \nlegislation, pass it through the body, get it to conference, and get it \nout, we will make some significant steps forward, including in the \nvital area of aviation safety.\n  I again thank Senator Gorton and Senator Rockefeller for all their \nhard work on this issue. I remind my colleagues that in about 5 \nminutes, according to the unanimous consent agreement, all relevant \namendments should be filed.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the \nFAA reauthorization bill to establish an independent commission to \nthoroughly examine the impact of airline deregulation on smalltown \nAmerica. I am very pleased to be joined in this effort by several \ncosponsors, including Senators Rockefeller, Burns, Baucus, Robb, \nHollings, and Harkin.\n  This amendment is modeled after a bill I recently introduced that \nwould authorize a study into how airline deregulation has affected the \neconomic development of smaller towns in America, the quality and \navailability of air transportation, particularly in rural areas of this \ncountry, and the long-term viability of local airports in smaller \ncommunities and rural areas.\n  For far too long, small communities throughout this Nation, from \nBangor, ME, to Billings, MT, to Bristol, TN, have weathered the effects \nof airline deregulation without adequately assessing how deregulation \nhas affected their economic development, their ability to create and \nattract new jobs, the quality and availability of air transportation \nfor their residents, and the long-term viability of their local \nairports. It is time to evaluate the effects of airline deregulation \nfrom this new perspective by looking at how it has affected the \neconomies in small towns and rural America.\n  Bangor, ME, where I live, is an excellent example of how airline \nderegulation can cause real problems for a smaller community. Bangor \nrecently learned it was going to lose the services of Continental \nExpress. This follows a pullout by Delta Airlines last year. It has \nbeen very difficult for Bangor to provide the kind of quality air\n\n[[Page S11895]]\n\nservice that is so important in trying to attract new businesses to \nlocate in the area as well as to encourage businesses to expand.\n  Nowadays, businesses expect to have convenient, accessible, and \naffordable air service. It is very important to their ability to do \nbusiness. Although there have been several studies on the impact of \nairline deregulation, they have all focused on some aspects of air \nservice itself. For example, there have been GAO studies that have \nlooked at the impact on airline prices.\n  Not one study I am aware of has actually analyzed the impact of \nairline deregulation on economic development and job creation in rural \nStates. Indeed, we have spoken to the GAO and the Department of \nTransportation, and they are not aware of a single study that has taken \nthe kind of comprehensive approach I am proposing. Moreover, one GAO \nofficial told my staff he thought such a study was long overdue. We \nneed to know more about how airline deregulation has affected smaller \nand medium-sized communities such as Presque Isle, ME, and Bangor, ME. \nWe need to focus on the relationship between access to affordable, \nquality airline service and the economic development of America's \nsmaller towns and cities.\n  During the past 20 years, air travel has become increasingly linked \nto business development. Successful businesses expect and need their \npersonnel to travel quickly over long distances. It is expected that a \nregion being considered for business location or expansion should be \nreachable conveniently, quickly, and easily via jet service. Those \nareas without air access or with access that is restricted by \nprohibitive travel costs, infrequent flights, or small, slow planes \nappear to be at a distinct disadvantage compared to those communities \nthat enjoy accessible, convenient, and economic air service.\n  This country's air infrastructure has grown to the point where it now \nrivals our ground transportation infrastructure in its importance to \nthe economic vibrancy and vitality of our communities. It has long been \naccepted that building a highway creates an almost instant corridor of \neconomic activity for businesses eager to cut shipping and \ntransportation costs by locating close to the stream of commerce.\n  Like a community located on an interstate versus one that is \nreachable only by back roads, a community with a midsize or small \nairport underserved by air carriers appears to be operating at a \ndisadvantage to one located near a large airport. What this proposal \nwould do is allow us to take a close look at the relationship between \nquality air service and the communities it serves.\n  Bob Ziegelaar, director of the Bangor International Airport, perhaps \nput it best. He tells me: Communities such as Bangor are at risk of \nbeing left behind with service levels below what the market warrants, \nboth in terms of capacity and quality. The follow-on consequences are a \ndecreasing capacity to attract economic growth.\n  He sums it up well. A region's ability to attract and keep good jobs \nis inextricably linked to its transportation system. Twenty-one years \nafter Congress deregulated the airline industry, it is important that \nwe now look and assess the long-term impacts of our actions. The \ncommission established by my amendment will ensure that Congress, small \ncommunities, and the airlines are able to make future decisions on \nairline issues fully aware of the concerns and the needs of smalltown \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee and the ranking \nminority members of both the subcommittee and the full committee for \ntheir assistance in shaping this amendment. I look forward to working \nwith them. I know they share my concerns about providing quality, \naccessible air service to all parts of America. I thank them for their \ncooperation in this effort and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, obviously, this Senator from West \nVirginia is already a cosponsor of the amendment. There are very few \npeople who would know the situation in this amendment as well as the \nSenator from Maine. Her State, as many rural States, has had a major \nreaction to deregulation. Economic development is always the first \nthing on the minds of States that are trying to grow and attract their \npopulation back. This is simply asking for a commission to study the \neffects of deregulation on economic development. I think it is very \nsensible. I think it highlights a real agony for a lot of States. It is \nhighly acceptable on this side.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I also thank the Senator from Maine. I do \nunderstand there have been some very negative impacts on Bangor and \nother parts of the State of Maine associated with airline deregulation. \nIt needs to be studied. We need to find out how we can do a better job, \nas I said in my earlier remarks, allowing smaller and medium-sized \nmarkets to receive the air service they deserve which has such a \ndramatic impact on their economies.\n  I thank the Senator from Maine for her amendment. Both sides are \nprepared to accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1907.\n  The amendment (No. 1907) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COLLINS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment Nos. 1948 And 1949, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send two amendments to the desk, en \nbloc, and ask for their immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes amendments \n     numbered 1948 and 1949, en bloc.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1948\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit discrimination in the use of Private Airports)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . NONDISCRIMINATION IN THE USE OF PRIVATE AIRPORTS.\n\n       (a) Prohibiting Discrimination in the Use of Private \n     Airports.--Chapter 401 of Subtitle VII of title 49, United \n     States Code, is amended by inserting the following new \n     section after section 40122:\n\n     ``Sec. 40123. Nondiscrimination in the Use of Private \n       Airports\n\n       ``(a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, no state, county, city or municipal government may \n     prohibit the use or full enjoyment of a private airport \n     within its jurisdiction by any person on the basis of that \n     person's race, creed, color, national origin, sex, or \n     ancestry.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1949\n\n(Purpose: To amend section 49106(c)(6) of title 49, United States Code, \n               to remove a limitation on certain funding)\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Metropolitan Airports \n     Authority Improvement Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REMOVAL OF LIMITATION.\n\n       Section 49106(c)(6) of title 49, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking subparagraph (C); and\n       (2) by redesignating subparagraph (D) as subparagraph (C).\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, these two amendments, along with amendment \nNo. 1893, which was previously offered, have been accepted on both \nsides. There is no further debate on the amendments, and I ask for \ntheir adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto.\n  The amendments (Nos. 1948, 1949, and 1893) were agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that there is now \nsome 304 amendments that are germane that have been filed by the \nSenator from Illinois. Obviously, that is his right under the rules of \nthe Senate.\n  I would like for the Senator from Illinois to understand what he is \ndoing. This is a very important piece of legislation. It has a lot to \ndo with safety. The Senator from Illinois should know that. He is \njeopardizing, literally, the safety of airline passengers across this \ncountry, perhaps throughout the world.\n\n[[Page S11896]]\n\n  I will relate to the Senator what he is doing. Before I do, I think \nhe should know there are strong objections by the Senators from \nVirginia, the Senators from New York, and the Senators from Maryland, \nconcerning this whole issue of slots and the perimeter rule--but \nparticularly slots. We have been able to work with the Senators from \nthese other States that are equally affected. It is very unfortunate \nthat the Senator from Illinois cannot sit down and work out something \nthat would be agreeable.\n  I want to tell the Senator from Illinois, again, this is very serious \nbusiness we are talking about. We are talking about aviation safety. \nThis is the reauthorization of the Aviation Improvement Program. It \nrequires fixed-wing aircraft in air commerce to be equipped with \nemergency locator transmitters; it provides broader authority to the \nFAA to determine what circumstances warrant a criminal history record \ncheck for persons performing security screening of passengers and \ncargo; it extends the authorization for the Aviation Insurance Program, \nalso known as war risk insurance, through 2003; it requires all large \ncargo aircraft to be equipped with collision avoidance equipment by the \nend of 2002; it gives FAA the authority to fine unruly airline \npassengers who interfere with the operation or safety of a civil \nflight, up to $10,000 per violation; it authorizes $450,000 to address \nthe problem of bird ingestions into aircraft engines; it authorizes \n$9.1 million over 3 years for a safety and security management program \nto provide training for aviation safety personnel.\n  Mr. President, I have three pages. I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n     Safety-related Provisions in S. 82, Air Transportation \n         Improvement Act\n       Extends the contract authority through fiscal year 2000 for \n     Airport Improvement Programs (AID) grants. Federal airport \n     grants lapsed on August 6, 1999, because the contract \n     authority had not been extended. Authorizes a $2.475 billion \n     AID program in fiscal year 2000. (Sec. 103)\n       Provides explicit AIP funding eligibility for the \n     installation of integrated in-pavement lighting systems, and \n     other runway incursion prevention devices. (Sec. 205)\n       Requires nearly all fixed-wing aircraft in air commerce, to \n     be equipped with emergency locator transmitters by 2002. \n     (Sec. 404)\n       Provides broader authority to the FAA to determine what \n     circumstances warrant a criminal history record check for \n     persons performing security screening of passengers and \n     cargo. (Sec. 306)\n       Extends the authorization for the aviation insurance \n     programs (also known as war risk insurance) through 2003. The \n     program provides insurance for commercial aircraft that are \n     operating in high risk areas, such as countries at war or on \n     the verge of war. Commercial insurers usually will not \n     provide coverage for such operations, which are often \n     required to advance U.S. foreign policy or the country's \n     national security policy. The program expired on August 6, \n     1999, and cannot be extended without this authorization in \n     place. (Sec. 307)\n       Requires all large cargo aircraft to be equipped with \n     collision avoidance equipment by the end of 2002. (Sec. 402)\n       Gives the FAA the authority to fine unruly airline \n     passengers who interfere with the operation or safety of a \n     civil flight, up to $10,000 per violation. (Sec. 406)\n       Authorizes $450,000 to address the problem of bird \n     ingestions into aircraft engines. (Sec. 101)\n       Authorizes $9.1 million over three years for a safety and \n     security management program to provide training for aviation \n     safety personnel. The program would concentrate on personnel \n     from countries that are not in compliance with international \n     safety standards. (Sec. 101)\n       Authorizes at least $30 million annually for the FAA to \n     purchase precision instrument landing systems (ILS) \n     through its ILS inventory program. (Sec. 102)\n       Authorizes at least $5 million for the FAA to carry out at \n     least one project to test and evaluate innovative airport \n     security systems and related technologies, including \n     explosive detection systems in an airport environment (Sec. \n     105)\n       Requires the FAA to maintain human weather observers to \n     augment the services provided by the Automated Surface \n     Observation System (ASOS) weather stations, at least until \n     the FAA certifies that the automated systems provide \n     consistent reporting of changing meteorological conditions. \n     (Sec. 106)\n       Allows the FAA to continue and expand its successful \n     program of establishing consortia of government and aviation \n     industry representatives at individual airports to provide \n     advice on aviation security and safety. (Sec. 303)\n       Requires the imprisonment (up to three years) or imposition \n     of a fine upon any individual who knowingly serves as an \n     airman without an airman's certificate from the FAA. The same \n     penalties would apply to anyone who employs an individual as \n     an airman who does not have the applicable airman's \n     certificate. The maximum term of imprisonment increases to \n     five years if the violation is related to the transportation \n     of a controlled substance. (Sec. 309)\n       Requires the FAA to consider the need for (1) improving \n     runway safety areas, which are essentially runway extensions \n     that provide a landing cushion beyond the ends of runways at \n     certificated airports; (2) requiring the installation of \n     precision approach path indicators (PAPI), which are visual \n     vertical guidance landing systems for runways. (Sec. 403)\n       Prohibits any company or employee that is convicted of \n     installing, producing, repairing or selling counterfeit \n     aviation parts from keeping or obtaining an FAA certificate. \n     Air carriers, repair stations, manufacturers, and any other \n     FAA certificate holders would be prohibited from employing \n     anyone convicted of an offense involving counterfeit parts. \n     (Sec. 405)\n       Requires the FAA to accelerate a rulemaking on Flight \n     Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA). FOQA is a program under \n     which airlines and their crews share operational information, \n     including data captured by flight data recorders. Sanitized \n     information about crew errors is shared, to focus on \n     situations in which hardware, air traffic control procedures, \n     or company practices create hazardous situations. (Sec. 409)\n       Requires the FAA to study and promote improved training in \n     the human factors arena, including the development of \n     specific training curricula. (Sec. 413)\n       Provides FAA whistleblowers who uncover safety risks with \n     the ability to seek redress if they are subject to \n     retaliation for their actions. (Sec. 415)\n       Provides employees of airlines, and employees of airline \n     contractors and subcontractors, with statutory whistleblower \n     protections to facilitate their providing air safety \n     information. (Sec. 419)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I won't go through them all. This is a \nvery important bill. In this very contentious and difficult time \nconcerning balanced budgets and funding for other institutions of \nGovernment, this authorization bill has been brought up by the majority \nleader, not by me. I hope it is fully recognized. I repeat, the \nSenators from Virginia, Senator Warner and Senator Robb, Senator \nMikulski, Senator Sarbanes, Senator Durbin, and Senator Fitzgerald's \npredecessor, all worked together on this issue. We need to work this \nout and we need to have this authorization complete. I hope we can get \nthat done as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that John \nFisher of the Congressional Research Service be granted the privilege \nof the floor during the Senate's consideration of S. 82.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, in response to the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona, I would be delighted to work with him as best I \ncan. I am sorry we have missed each other in recent days. Obviously, he \nhas dual responsibilities now as a candidate for President of the \nUnited States. I would certainly like to continue negotiations with \nhim. I do believe----\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield, he knows full well that for \nthe last several months--in fact, ever since he came to this body--the \nSenator and I have been discussing this issue. It has nothing to do \nwith any Presidential campaign or anything else. The Senator should \nknow that and correct the record.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Well, I understand the last time we talked, I thought \nthe Senator was working to address my concerns. In fact, I didn't \nrealize he supported lifting the high density rule altogether. I guess \nthat is what has taken me by surprise. Senator Moseley-Braun, my \npredecessor, and Senator Durbin urged your support to limit the \nincreased exceptions for slot restrictions at O'Hare from 100 down to \n30. You had supported that in your original bill which had that 30 \nfigure. You and I had been having discussions with respect to that.\n  This year, the amendment by Senator Gorton and Senator Rockefeller is \nwhat has given me pause because, obviously, that would be going in a \ndifferent direction than the limitations that were worked out with you, \nSenator Durbin, and former Senator Moseley-Braun last year in what was \nreflected as the original version of S. 82.\n\n[[Page S11897]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield, the fact is, the Senator has \nbeen involved in discussions in the Cloakroom, on the floor, in my \noffice, and other places on this issue. If we don't agree, that is one \nthing, but to say somehow that my attention has been diverted is an \ninaccurate depiction of the situation.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, since we are on the FAA bill this morning, \nI will take a few minutes to discuss the issue of airline passenger \nrights.\n  In the face of a wave of consumer complaints which are running at \ntwice the number this time last year, the airline industry has proposed \na Customer First program. I will take a few minutes this morning to \nensure the Senate understands what this program is all about. After the \nindustry released its voluntary proposal, I asked the General \nAccounting Office and the Congressional Search Service to analyze what \nthe industry had actually proposed. In summary, these two reports--the \none done by the General Accounting Office and the one done by the \nCongressional Research Service--demonstrates, unfortunately, when it \ncomes to the industry's plan to protect passenger rights, there is no \n``There there.''\n  These two reports found the airline industry's proposal puts \npassenger rights into three categories: first, rights that passengers \nalready have, as in the rights of the disabled; second, rights that \nhave no teeth in them because they are not written into the contracts \nof carriage between the passenger and the airline; third, rights that \nare ignored altogether, such as the right to full information on \noverbooking and ensuring that passengers can find out about the lowest \npossible fare.\n  Specifically, I asked the General Accounting Office to compare the \nvoluntary pledges made by the airline industry to the hidden but \nactually binding contractual rights airline passengers have that are \nwritten into something known as a contract of carriage. The \nCongressional Research Service pointed out:\n\n       . . .front line airline staff seem uncertain as to what \n     contracts of carriage are.\n\n  The Congressional Research Service found that:\n\n       . . . even if the consumer knows they have a right to the \n     information, they must accurately identify the relevant \n     provisions of the contract of carriage or take home the \n     address or phone number, if available, of the airline's \n     consumer affairs department, send for it and wait for the \n     contract of carriage to arrive in the mail.\n\n  As the Congressional Research Service states with their unusual tact \nand diplomacy:\n\n       . . . the airlines do not appear to go out of their way to \n     provide easy access to contract of carriage information.\n\n  I want the Senate to know the current status of passenger rights so \nwe can begin to strengthen the hand of passengers at a time when we \nhave a record number of consumer complaints.\n  Two weeks ago, the Senate began the task of trying to empower the \npassengers with the Transportation appropriations bill. In that \nlegislation, we directed the Department of Transportation inspector \ngeneral to investigate unfair and deceptive practices in the airline \nindustry. The Department of Transportation inspector general does not \ncurrently conduct these investigations so we added the mandatory \nbinding consumer protection language in the Transportation \nappropriations bill to ensure the Transportation inspector general \nwould have exactly the same authority to investigate these consumer \nprotection issues that I proposed in the airline passenger bill of \nrights early this session.\n  On this FAA bill, I am proposing another step to help passengers. The \npurpose of the amendment I offer is to make sure customers can find out \nwhether the airlines are actually living up to their voluntary \ncommitments by beginning to write them into the contracts of carriage--\nthe binding agreement between the passenger and the airline.\n\n  This is what the law division of the Congressional Research Service \nhad to say on that point:\n\n       It would appear that the voluntary aviation industry \n     standards would probably not have the same level of \n     contractual enforceability that the provisions of the \n     ``contract of carriage'' has. Under basic American contract \n     law, the airlines offer certain terms and service under these \n     ``contracts of carriage'' and the consumer accepts this offer \n     and relies on the terms of the contract when he or she buys a \n     ticket. The voluntary industry standards are not the basis of \n     the contract and may lack the enforceability that the \n     conditions of the ``contract of carriage'' may possess.\n\n  What especially troubles me is that the airlines are clearly dragging \ntheir feet on actually writing these consumer protection provisions in \nany kind of meaningful fashion.\n  In fact, one of the proposals I saw from American Airlines stipulates \nspecifically that their pledges to the consumer are not enforceable, \nthat they are not going to be in the contracts of carriers.\n  Under my amendment on this FAA bill, the Department of Transportation \ninspector general is going to investigate whether an airline means what \nit says, whether it is actually moving to put these various nice-\nsounding, voluntary proposals into meaningful language. I am very \nhopeful that as a result of this amendment, we are going to know the \ntruth about actually what kind of consumer protection proposals are in \nthe airline industry's package.\n  This amendment has been shared with the ranking minority member of \nthe committee and the ranking minority member of the subcommittee, and \nI have talked about it with the chairman of the full committee, Senator \nMcCain. Also, it has been shared with the chairman of the subcommittee.\n  There are many things in this good bill with which I agree. I am \nespecially pleased, with Senator Rockefeller, Senator McCain, and \nSenator Gorton, we are taking steps to improve competition. I am very \npleased, for example, we are doing more for small and medium-size \nmarkets. These are very sensible proposals.\n  My concern is that together and on a bipartisan basis, we need to \npersuade the airline industry to put just a small fraction of the \ningenuity and expertise they have that has produced one of the world's \ntruly extraordinary safety records--the airline industry's safety \nrecord is extraordinary, and I simply want to see them put the \ningenuity and expertise they have into trying to ensure that \npassengers get a fair shake as well.\n\n  It is not right at a time like this, particularly when many of the \nairlines are making such significant profits, to leave airline service \nfor the passengers out on the runway. The figures are indisputable. \nThere are a record number of complaints. I hear constantly from \nbusiness travelers about the unbelievable problems they have with \nfailure to disclose, for example, overbooking. Many consumers have had \nproblems trying to find out about the lowest fare.\n  With the binding consumer protection language that was adopted in the \nTransportation appropriations bill so there will be an investigation \ninto the problems I outlined in the airline passenger bill of rights, \nwe have made a start. Today we will have a chance to build on that by \nmaking sure these voluntary pledges begin to show up in the contracts \nof carriage that actually protect the consumer.\n  I express my thanks to Chairman McCain and Senators Rockefeller and \nGorton for working with me on these matters and particularly to make \nsure the Senate knows that in many areas, the areas that promote \ncompetition and address the needs of small and medium-size airports--\nthis is an important bill. We can strengthen it with this consumer \nprotection amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon for his \nsteadfast advocacy for airline passengers and a range of other issues. \nI believe he has done this Nation a great service by attempting to see \nthat airline passengers have certain fundamental benefits that most \nAmericans assume they already had before certain information became \nknown to them and to the Senate. I thank him very much. It appears to \nbe a very good amendment.\n  It has not been cleared yet by Senator Rockefeller. They still have \nsome people with whom they have to talk. I have every confidence we \nwill accept the amendment. I ask that the\n\n[[Page S11898]]\n\nSenator from Oregon withhold his amendment at this time until we are \nready to accept it.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am happy to do that and anxious to work \nwith the chairman and Senator Rockefeller. I will be glad to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Oregon, there \nis no plot or underlying purpose not to accept the amendment at this \npoint, but there may be others who have amendments that relate to this \narea. Let's see what we have. From this Senator's point of view, the \nSenator from Oregon has made a useful amendment and, at the appropriate \ntime, should there not be any problems that arise--I do not anticipate \nthem--I will have no problem.\n\n\n   Amendment No. 2070 To Amendment No. 1892, Amendment No. 1920, As \n               Modified, And Amendment No. 2071, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send three amendments to the desk, one \nby Senator Helms, which is a second-degree amendment to the Gorton \namendment No. 1892, an amendment by Senator Boxer, and an amendment by \nSenator Inhofe. I ask unanimous consent that they be considered en \nbloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments now \nduring this lull in activity on the floor to speak to my concerns about \nlifting the high density rule that governs O'Hare International Airport \nin my State.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1892\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I think the first thing we need to do, \nin considering the Gorton-Rockefeller amendment to lift altogether the \nhigh density rule that governs O'Hare International Airport, is to look \nat what that high density rule is and why it was first imposed.\n  The high density rule was imposed not by Congress, although Congress \nis attempting to repeal it; the high density rule was imposed by the \nFederal Aviation Administration back in 1968 or 1969. The reason they \nimposed it at O'Hare was because by then--already the world's busiest \nairport--demand for flight operations exceeded capacity at O'Hare. \nGiven that situation, in order to prevent inordinate delays to the air \ntraffic system at O'Hare and around the country, they capped the number \nof operations per hour at O'Hare. They capped those operations at 155 \nflights per hour--roughly 1 every 20 seconds.\n  The sponsors of this amendment, and others who are proponents of it, \nhave said: We need to lift that high density rule because it is \nanticompetitive, and we have to get more competition for more slots and \nmore flights at O'Hare. They point out that just two carriers--United \nAirlines and American Airlines--control 80 percent of the flight \noperations at O'Hare International Airport, and there are studies that \nshow that given that duopoly, the prices are higher at O'Hare. And that \nis true. There is absolutely no question about it.\n  The idea of increasing competition is great in the abstract. There is \nonly one problem. O'Hare Airport does not have the capacity for more \nflights.\n  How do we know that? We know that because the last time Congress \nconsidered lifting the high density rule in 1994, the FAA commissioned \na study and asked: What would happen if we were to lift the high \ndensity rule at O'Hare International Airport? The study, commissioned \nby the FAA, came back and said if you did that, there would be huge \ndelays at O'Hare International Airport that would reverberate \nthroughout the entire air travel system in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Consequently, following that report, in the summer of 1995, the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation said they would not lift the high density \nrule at O'Hare because it would add to delays. The reason it would add \nto delays was because it would put more planes there waiting to take \noff or land, and that demand for more flights vastly outstripped the \ncapacity at O'Hare.\n  So the problem with lifting that high density rule is that unless \nthere is more capacity in Chicago, planes are just going to sit on the \nrunway at O'Hare until they can take off.\n  What is the situation now? We have not lifted the high density rule \nnow. Are there delays at O'Hare? You bet. There are more delays at \nO'Hare than just about any other major airport in the entire country, \nwith as many as 100 airplanes lined up every morning waiting to take \noff from the runway.\n\n  This proposal is a proposal that would give airlines an unfettered \nability to schedule even more flights. Sometimes they schedule 20 \nflights to take off at the same time. The marketing experts have told \nthe airlines that 8:45 a.m. is a popular time, so schedule your plane \nto take off at 8:45 a.m. The airlines know darn well only one plane can \ntake off at 8:45 a.m., but as many as 20 of them will be scheduled to \ntake off at that time. What does that mean? That means when you are \ntrying to take off on an 8:45 a.m. flight out of O'Hare, most likely \nyou are going to be sitting on the tarmac waiting to take off.\n  At least the high density rule is some limitation because it is a \nlimitation on how many airline flights can be scheduled to take off \nwithin that 8 o'clock hour. But by lifting this rule, we are saying \nthere is not going to be any limitation. Perhaps the airlines could \nschedule 100 or 200 or 300 flights to take off in that 8 o'clock hour. \nPeople will buy tickets; they think they are going to be able to take \noff sometime in that hour. They do not realize that is just a bait and \nswitch; that the airlines know full well the passengers are going to \nhave to be sitting on the tarmac waiting to take off.\n  Does it make sense, at the most congested, most delay-ridden airport, \nto add even more delays? It makes no sense at all.\n  I know Senator McCain well. I do believe he is very concerned about \ncompetition in the airline industry, and he, in good faith, wants to \nincrease competition in the airline industry. I agree with him \nwholeheartedly on that point. But I do not agree we want to do it in a \nway that is going to inconvenience everybody who flies out of O'Hare, \nand not just everybody who flies out of O'Hare but people all around \nthe country who will suffer because of backlogs and delays at O'Hare \nInternational Airport, which is in the center of our country.\n  Furthermore, there is a provision in this bill--neatly tucked in \nthere--that probably not many people can figure out what it means. Let \nme read it to you. As I said earlier, United and American have 80 \npercent of the flights at O'Hare. So if we were to add slots or more \nflights at O'Hare, you would\n\n[[Page S11899]]\n\nthink we would want to encourage some new entrants into the market, \nsome other companies. That would bring some more competition, bringing \nsome other airlines into O'Hare.\n  There is a little provision in here. I wonder who thought of this. \nDid some Senator think of this?\n  This is on page 4 of the amendment: ``Affiliated Carriers: . . . the \nSecretary shall treat all commuter air carriers that have cooperative \nagreements, including code-share agreements with other air carriers \nequally for determining eligibility for the application of any \nprovision of these sections regardless of the form of the corporate \nrelationship between the commuter air carrier and the other air \ncarrier.''\n  I bet many people wonder what that means. What that means is that \nAmerican Airlines' wholly-owned subsidiary, American Eagle, and United \nAirlines' affiliate, United Express, can be treated equally with new \ncommuter airlines that are trying to get in and get slots out of \nO'Hare.\n  This provision in the bill seems to undercut, in my judgment, the \nargument that this bill would increase competition. In my judgment, \ncompetition isn't going to be increased by increasing concentration. \nThe FAA bill before us today will not increase competition due to its \ndefinition of the term ``affiliated carrier.'' As the term ``affiliated \ncarrier'' is defined, those carriers that already control the vast \nmajority of capacity at the airport, United and American, will get \neligibility for additional capacity and slots.\n  In addition, many carriers that would benefit from this bill are \nwholly-owned subsidiaries of the controlling carriers. Later, I hope we \ncan have a discussion on that particular aspect of the bill.\n  Let me talk a little bit more in depth about the delays we already \nhave at O'Hare, without this idea of increasing the number of flights \nwe are going to have, regardless of the fact that we don't have more \ncapacity for more flights.\n  This was an article just the other day, September 10, 1999: ``Delays \nat O'Hare Mounting. For the first 8 months of this year, flight delays \nat O'Hare soared by 65 percent compared to all of 1997 and by 18 \npercent over 1998, according to an analysis by the Federal Aviation \nAdministration.''\n\n  Why are those delays occurring? In part because in the existing law \nwe already have exemptions from the slot controls put in by the FAA \nback in 1969. Those slot controls limited the number of flights to 155 \noperations per hour. By virtue of the 1994 bill we passed in this \nCongress, before I was here, they allowed more exemptions to those slot \nrules, and the FAA has been granting those. In fact, I am told the FAA \nnow has about 163 flights an hour at O'Hare. This bill would lift those \ncaps entirely.\n  This is from August 23, 1999. I said O'Hare is one of the most delay-\nridden, congested airports in the country. This article talks about it: \nO'Hare has one of the worst on-time arrival and departure records of \nany major airport in the Nation, according to U.S. Department of \nTransportation data analyzed by the Chicago Sun-Times. For the first 6 \nmonths of 1999, O'Hare ranked at the bottom or second to last in \npercentage of on-time arrivals and departures at the 29 biggest U.S. \nairports, performing worse than the Boston and Newark airports, the \nother chronic laggards.\n  This goes back to the idea that airlines set their own schedules. \nThere are slot controls that limit the number of flights in an hour at \nO'Hare. You can get from the FAA a slot to take off in a particular \nhour. You can get a slot, for example, to take off at the 8 a.m. hour. \nIt is up to the airline, then, to schedule when that plane will take \noff.\n  It turns out, as the Sun-Times investigative report found, that many \nof the airlines schedule them all at the same time. At times there have \nbeen as many as 80 planes scheduled to take off, all at the same time. \nObviously, they can't do that. What that means is that passengers sit \non the runway and wait.\n  Have you ever been in an airplane, sitting on the tarmac with that \nstuffy air, waiting for the plane to take off? The airlines always \nblame it on the weather or they blame it on the FAA. They blame it on \nsomebody else. They never blame it on themselves for scheduling all the \nflights to take off at the same time, which we know as a matter of \nphysics is impossible.\n  This October 3 article, just this Sunday, was the front-page headline \narticle in the Chicago Sun-Times:\n\n                 Airlines Cramming Departure Time Slots\n\n       Airlines at O'Hare Airport schedule so many flights in and \n     out during peak periods that it is impossible to avoid \n     delays, a Chicago Sun-Times analysis shows.\n       O'Hare can handle about 3 takeoffs a minute at most, [that \n     is one every 20 seconds] but air carriers slate as many as 20 \n     at certain times, slots they believe will draw the most \n     passengers. And they've continued to add flights to crowded \n     time slots, even though delays have been increasing since \n     1997.\n\n  At least today, even as we have these horrible delays, there is some \nlimitation as to how far the airlines can go with this bait-and-switch \ntactic with consumers. There is some check. That is the check on the \nabsolute maximum number of slots that can be given for takeoffs and \nlandings at O'Hare in a given hour. This bill removes that check. There \nwill be no check then on airlines scheduling departures and arrivals \nall at the same time, when it is impossible for them all to land or \ntake off at that time. In fact, you could have 200, 300, 400 flights \nall scheduled to take off at the same time. We are removing any of \nthose caps.\n\n  I mentioned that in 1995, the FAA ordered a study of what would \nhappen if we lifted the high density rule. Again, the 1995 DOT study \nshows that lifting the high density rule more than doubles delay times \nat O'Hare. That is why they didn't do it. According to this report, a \nDepartment of Transportation May 1995 Report to Congress, a study of \nthe high density rule, lifting the rule at O'Hare, ORD, is estimated to \nincrease the average time average annual all-weather delay by nearly 12 \nminutes, from 11.8 to 23.7 minutes per operation, and besides, that \naverage annual delay is much higher now than it was back in 1995, \nassuming no flight cancellations occur due to instrument flight rules, \nweather. This is beyond the average of 15 minutes, the original basis \nfor imposing HDR.\n  There are many studies that show the problem. This is why the caps \nwere put on at O'Hare. They wanted to stop delays. The studies have all \nshown that adding just one more slot beyond the capacity of an airport \ncauses an exponential, compounding increase on the delays. In fact, \nthis is a chart that the Federal Aviation Administration prepared on \nairfield and airspace capacity and delay policy analysis. Once you go \nbeyond the practical capacity of an airport--and for O'Hare, the FAA \nhas said it is 158 flights per hour--the delays skyrocket. In my \njudgment, if we are saying now we are not going to have any checks on \nthe demand at O'Hare and there is no added capacity, we are going to go \nright up into this range very fast.\n  I said yesterday, Mayor Daley from Chicago was supposed to be in \nWashington last week for an event. We were going to have a taste and \ntouch of Chicago in Washington. There was a huge celebration. There \nwere about 500 people at this reception. We were all there waiting for \nMayor Daley. Everybody was asking: Where is Mayor Daley? It turns out \nMayor Daley was delayed at O'Hare Airport. In fact, poor Mayor Daley \nhad to sit on the tarmac for 4 hours at O'Hare. He arrived in \nWashington at 8:30 at night, after the reception was over, and he got \nthe next plane back to Chicago.\n  That is typical of the kind of delays people incur going through \nO'Hare. This bill would add to that. I think it is a mistake to do \nthat. It ignores the original reason we had for the high density rule. \nFurthermore, I think it is unusual for Congress to put on the mantle of \nsafety and aviation experts and decide that we are going to rewrite FAA \nrules. We ought to take that out of the political process, have the FAA \nwrite its own rules, not us rejiggle them from the statutes.\n  With that, I am not going to mention at this time what I believe will \nbe the extreme safety hazards by trying to cram more flights into less \ntime and space at O'Hare. A flight lands and takes off every 20 seconds \nat O'Hare. If we are going to cram more in and narrow the distance, \nmaybe it will come down to every 10 or 15 seconds. There is not much \nroom for error. If you are sitting in a plane and you think there is a \nplane tailgating you, there is a lot of\n\n[[Page S11900]]\n\npressure. All these takeoffs and landings will not give air passengers \na great deal of comfort.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate for a few minutes. I see Chairman McCain, and I wanted to engage \nhim in a brief discussion on a matter involving the Death on the High \nSeas Act. I have offered several amendments with respect to this issue, \nbut I don't intend to offer them this morning because this bill has \nseveral hundred amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I think it is extraordinarily important \nthat the Senate take steps promptly to remedy some of the loopholes in \nthe antiquated Death on the High Seas Act. I have had constituents \nbring to my attention a tragedy that is almost unique in my years of \nworking in the consumer protection field.\n  Mr. John Sleavin, one of my constituents, testified before the \nCommerce Committee that he lost his brother, Mike, his nephew, Ben, and \nhis niece, Annie, under absolutely grotesque circumstances. The \nfamily's pleasure boat was run over by a Korean freighter in \ninternational waters. The only survivor was the mother, Judith Sleavin, \nwho suffered permanent injuries. The accident was truly extraordinary \nbecause, after the collision, there was absolutely no attempt by the \nKorean vessel to rescue the family or even to notify authorities about \nthe collision. Mr. Sleavin's brother and his niece perished after 8 \nhours in the water following the collision. It was clear to me that \nthere was an opportunity to have rescued this family. Yet there was no \nremedy.\n  We have had very compelling testimony on this problem in the Senate \nCommerce Committee. The chairman has indicated a willingness to work \nwith me on this. We have a Coast Guard bill coming up, and because this \nis an important consumer protection issue and a contentious one, I \ndon't want to do anything to take a big block of additional time.\n  I will yield at this time for a colloquy with the chairman in the \nhopes that we can finally get this worked out so we don't have \nAmericans subject to the kind of tragic circumstances we saw in this \ncase, where a family was literally mowed down in international waters \nby a Korean freighter and should have been rescued and, tragically, \nloved ones were lost. I feel very strongly about this.\n  I yield now to the chairman of the full committee to hear his \nthoughts on our ability to get this loophole-ridden Death on the High \nSeas Act changed, and particularly doing it on the Coast Guard bill \nthat will be coming up.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Oregon. I know he \nhas been heavily involved in this issue for a long time. We will have \nthe Coast Guard bill scheduled for markup. At that time, I hope the \nSenator from Oregon will be able to propose an amendment addressing \nthis issue. But I also remind my friend that there may be objection \nwithin the committee as well. I know he fully appreciates that. There \nis at least one other Senator who doesn't agree with this remedy. But I \nthink we should bring up this issue and it should be debated and voted \non. I think certainly the Senator from Oregon has the argument on his \nside in this issue.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the chairman. I am going to be very brief in \nwrapping this up. I think our colleagues know that I am not one who \ngoes looking for frivolous litigation. The chairman of the committee \nand all our colleagues on the Commerce Committee know that I spent a \nlot of time on the Y2K liability legislation this year so we could \nresolve these problems without a whole spree of frivolous litigation.\n  But we do know that there are areas, particularly ones where injured \nconsumers in international waters have no remedy at all, when they are \nsubject to some of the most grizzly and unfortunate accidents, where \nthere is a role for legislation and a need for a remedy.\n  I am very appreciative that the chairman has indicated he thinks it \nis appropriate that we devise a remedy. I intend to work very closely \nwith our colleagues on the Commerce Committee. I know the chairman of \nthe subcommittee, Senator Gorton, has strong views on this. I am \nwilling to look anew with respect to what that remedy ought to be so we \ncan pass a bipartisan bill. But I do think we have to devise a remedy \nbecause to have innocent Americans run down in international waters \nwithout any remedy can't be acceptable to the American people.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw all four of the \namendments I have had filed on this bill with respect to the Death on \nthe High Seas Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendments are \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon. I look \nforward to working with him on this very important issue.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I will comment on an amendment we \nintroduced last night and ask for the support of my colleagues. Before \nI do that, I want to recognize the chairman of the full committee, the \nCommerce Committee, and my colleagues on the subcommittee. There are \nmany important provisions in this bill. Most importantly, I think it \nreauthorizes the funding mechanism for airport construction which has \nbeen going on around the country. I hardly find a place where there are \nnot improvements being done to the infrastructure for air traffic.\n  The legislation allows a limited number of exemptions to the current \nperimeter rule at the Ronald Reagan National Airport. Creating these \nexemptions takes a step in the right direction to provide balance \nbetween Americans within the perimeter and outside the perimeter. The \ncurrent perimeter rule is outdated and restrictive to creating \ncompetition.\n  We have the best and the most efficient modes of transportation in \nthe entire world. No other country can make such a boast. With the \nexception, of course, of rail transportation and passengers, we have \nvery competitive alternatives. Now is the time to further enhance our \ncompetitive aviation and rail alternatives, although some who live at \nthe end of the lines sometimes question if we have competition in the \nright places.\n  These limited exemptions to the perimeter rule will improve service \nto the nation's capital for dozens of western cities beyond the \nperimeter--while at the same time ensuring that cities inside the \nperimeter are not adversely impacted by new service. This is a fair \nbalance which is consistent with the overall intent of the bill to \nimprove air service to small and medium-sized cities.\n  As a result, I believe our committee has crafted a limited compromise \nwhich protects the local community from uncontrolled growth, ensures \nthat service inside the perimeter will not be affected and creates a \nprocess which will improve access to Ronald Reagan National Airport for \nsmall and medium-sized communities outside the current perimeter. \nMontana's communities will benefit from these limited exemptions \nthrough improved access to the nation's capitol.\n  Throughout this bill, our goal has been to improve air service for \ncommunities which have not experienced the benefits of deregulation to \nthe extent of larger markets. The provision related to improved access \nto Reagan National is no different.\n  Today, passengers from many communities in Montana are forced to \ndouble or even triple connect to fly to Washington National. My goal is \nto ensure that not just large city point-to-point service will benefit, \nbut that passengers from all points west of the perimeter will have \nbetter options to reach Washington and Ronald Reagan National Airport.\n  This provision is about using this restricted exemption process to \nspread\n\n[[Page S11901]]\n\nimproved access throughout the West--not to limit the benefits to a few \nlarge cities which already have a variety of options.\n  Let me be clear, if the Secretary receives more applications for more \nslots than the bill allows, DOT must prioritize the applications based \non quantifying the domestic network benefits. Therefore, DOT must \nconsider and award these limited opportunities to western hubs which \nconnect the largest number of cities to the national transportation \nnetwork.\n  I request the support of my colleagues on a very important amendment \nI along with my colleague from Missouri have introduced to this bill. \nThat amendment was added last night. This amendment will establish a \ncommission to study the future of the travel agent industry and \ndetermine the consumer impact of airline interaction with travel \nagents.\n  Since the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 was enacted, major \nairlines have controlled pricing and distribution policies of our \nnation's domestic air transportation system. Over the past four years, \nthe airlines have reduced airline commissions to travel agents in a \ncompetitive effort to reduce costs.\n  I am concerned the impact of today's business interaction between \nairlines and travel agents may be a driving force that will force many \ntravel agents out of business. Combined with the competitive emergence \nof Internet services, these practices may be harming an industry that \nemploys over 250,000 people in this country.\n  This amendment will explore these concerns through the establishment \nof a commission to objectively review the emerging trends in the \nairline ticket distribution system. Among airline consumers there is a \ngrowing concern that airlines may be using their market power to limit \nhow airline tickets are distributed and sold.\n  Mr. President, if we lose our travel agents, we lose a competitive \ncomponent to affordable air fare. Travel agents provide a much needed \nservice and without them, the consumer is the loser.\n  The current use of independent travel agencies as the predominate \nmethod to distribute tickets ensures an efficient and unbiased source \nof information for air travel. Before deregulation, travel agents \nhandled only about 40 percent of the airline ticket distribution \nsystem. Since deregulation, the complexity of the ticket pricing system \ncreated the need for travel agents resulting in travel agents handling \nnearly 90 percent of transactions.\n  Therefore, the travel agent system has proven to be a key factor to \nthe success of airline deregulation. I'm afraid, however, that the \ndemise of the independent travel agent would be a factor of \nderegulation's failure if the major airlines succeed in dominating the \nticket distribution system.\n  Tavel agents and other independent distributors comprise a \nconsiderable portion of the small business sector in the United States. \nThere are 33,000 travel agencies employing over 250,000 people. Women \nor minorities own over 50 percent of travel agencies.\n  Since 1995, commissions have been reduced by 30%, 14% for domestic \ntravel alone in 1998. since 1995, travel agent commissions have been \nreduced from an average of 10.8 to 6.9 percent in 1998. Travel agencies \nare failing in record numbers.\n  I think it is important we study the issue, get an unbiased \ncommission together, and give a report to Congress. We will see how \nimportant the role played by the ticket agents and the travel agencies \nis in contributing to the competitive nature of travel in this country.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this important amendment. We are \ndealing with a subject that needs to be dealt with; this bill needs to \nbe passed. We are in support of it.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I would like to take advantage of this \nopportunity to finish one final point to the speech I had given a few \nmoments ago wherein I mentioned the likely delays that would be caused \nat Chicago O'Hare, and that is the increase in delays that would be \ncaused in Chicago O'Hare and throughout our Nation's entire air traffic \nsystem if the high density rule were to be repealed. But right now I \nmention one other item which is probably the most important matter this \nSenate confronts in passing statutes to govern our aviation system, and \nthat is the issue of safety.\n  I alluded earlier to the fact that O'Hare is the world's biggest \nairport and that there is a takeoff and landing every 20 seconds at \nO'Hare. Any sixth grader can figure out if we are going to try to run \nmore flights per hour and more flights per minute through O'Hare, we \nare going to have to bring them in and take them off in less time than \n20 seconds. Either that or we will continue mounting delays.\n  Most likely, we will continue mounting delays. But it is possible the \nincreased congestion and delays would cause the air carriers to be \npressuring the FAA to let the planes take off and would be pressuring \nthe air traffic controllers to get planes into the air quicker, and it \nwould be pressuring them to shorten the separation distances between \nairplanes.\n  Already in this country, in order to increase capacity at our \nairports without adding capacity in terms of new facilities and \nrunways, we are doing a number of things. We are reducing separation \ndistances between arriving aircraft.\n  A couple of years ago, I was doing a landing at O'Hare. I was on a \ncommercial air carrier. We were about to land at O'Hare. Lo and behold, \nwe were about to land on top of another plane that was still on the \nrunway. At the last minute, the pilot lifted up, and we took off again \nright before we hit the other plane that had not gotten off the runway. \nMany people have probably been through that experience. It is pretty \nfrightening.\n\n  If we are going to cram more flights into the same space at O'Hare, \nwe are going to see more incidents like that. They are already reducing \nrunway occupancy time. You will notice when your plane lands that it \nhightails it off that runway because it knows there is another plane \nright behind.\n  They are doing something that they call land-and-hold operations--\nthey are doing it at O'Hare and across the country--where the plane \nlands, and it has to get to a crisscross with another runway. They have \nto hold while another plane lands. Pilots hate to do that, but they are \nforced to by air traffic control.\n  We are seeing increasing incidents of triple converging runway \narrivals in this country. All of this is designed to put more planes \ntogether in time and space. I think it is obvious to anybody that \ndecreases the margin of safety that we have in aviation in this \ncountry.\n  I think that is a great mistake because nothing is as important as \nthe safety of the flying public.\n  I call your attention to an article that appeared in USA Today. I \napologize. The date is wrong on this. It says November 13, 1999. \nObviously, that was November 13 of a different year because we haven't \ngotten to November 13 of 1999. This is actually from 1998.\n  They had a front-page headline article called: ``Too Close for \nComfort. Crossing Runways Debated as Travel Soars. Safety, On-Time \nTravel on Collision Course, Pilots Say.''\n  Let me read a quote from this article from USA Today from November \n13, 1998.\n\n       ``They are just trying anything to squeeze out more \n     capacity from the system,'' says Captain Randolph Babbitt, \n     President of the Airline Pilots Association, which represents \n     51,000 of the 70,000 commercial pilots in the United States \n     and Canada. ``Some of us think this is nibbling at the safety \n     margins.''\n\n  Probably at no airport in the country have we nibbled more at the \nsafety margins than at O'Hare International Airport--the world's \nbiggest airport, the world's most congested, the one that has the most \ndelays in this country.\n  I will read a portion of a letter that was sent earlier this year to \nthe Governor of our great State, Governor George Ryan.\n\n       My name is John Teerling and I recently retired, after 31.5 \n     years with American Airlines as a Captain, flying \n     international\n\n[[Page S11902]]\n\n     routes in Boeing 767 and 757's. I was based at Chicago's \n     O'Hare my entire career. I have seen the volume of traffic at \n     O'Hare pick up and exceed anyone's expectations, so much so, \n     that on occasions, mid-airs were only seconds apart. O'Hare \n     is at maximum capacity, if not over capacity. It is my \n     opinion that it is only a matter of time until two airliners \n     collide making disastrous headlines.\n\n  I close with that thought, and I caution the Senate on the effects of \nour interfering in the rulemaking authority of the FAA, overruling \ntheir authority, and by statute rewriting their rules.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter to Governor George Ryan from \nthis former American Airlines captain, John Teerling, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                             John W. Teerling,\n\n                                   Lockport, IL, January 18, 1999.\n     RE: A Third Chicago Airport\n     Gov. George Ryan,\n     State Capitol, Springfield, IL.\n       Dear Governor Ryan: My name is John Teerling and I recently \n     retired, after 31.5 years with American Airlines as a \n     Captain, flying international routes in Boeing 767 and 757's. \n     I was based at Chicago's O'Hare my entire career. I have seen \n     the volume of traffic at O'Hare pick up and exceed anyone's \n     expectations, so much so, that on occasion mid-airs were only \n     seconds apart. O'Hare is at maximum capacity, if not over \n     capacity. It is my opinion that it is only a matter of time \n     until two airliners collide making disastrous headlines.\n       Cities like Atlanta, Dallas and especially Miami continue \n     to increase their traffic flow, some months exceeding \n     Chicago, and at some point could supersede Chicago \n     permanently. If Chicago and Illinois are to remain as the \n     major Hub for airline traffic, a third major airport has to \n     be built, and built now. Midway, with its location and \n     shorter runways will never fill this void. A large \n     international airport located in the Peotone area, complete \n     with good ground infrastructure (rail and highway) to serve \n     Chicago, Kankakee, Joliet, Indiana and the Southwest suburbs, \n     would be win, win situation for all. The jobs created for \n     housing and offices, hotels, shopping, manufacturing and \n     light industry could produce three to four hundred thousand \n     jobs. Good paying jobs.\n       Another item to consider, which I feel is extremely \n     important is weather. I have frequently observed that there \n     are two distinct weather patterns between O'Hare and \n     Kankakee. Very often when one is receiving snow, fog or rain \n     the other is not. These conditions affect the visibility and \n     ceiling conditions determining whether the airports operate \n     normally or not. Because of the difference in weather \n     patterns when one airport, say O'Hare, is experiencing a \n     hampered operation, an airport in Peotone, in all \n     probability, could be having more normal operations. \n     Airliners could then divert to the ``other'' Chicago Airport, \n     saving time and money as well as causing less inconvenience \n     to the public. (It's better to be in Peotone than in \n     Detroit).\n       It is well known that American and United, who literally \n     control O'Hare with their massive presence, are against a \n     third airport. Why? It is called market share competition and \n     greed. A new airport in the Peotone area would allow other \n     airlines to service Chicago and be competition. American and \n     United are of course dead set against that. What they are not \n     considering is that their presence at a third airport would \n     afford them an even greater share of the Chicago regional pie \n     as well as put them in a great position for future expansion.\n       You also have Mayor Daley against a third airport because \n     he feels a loss of control and possible revenue for the city. \n     This third airport, if built, and it should be, should be \n     classified as the Northern Illinois Regional Airport, \n     controlled by a Board with representatives from Chicago and \n     the surrounding areas. That way all would share in the \n     prestige of a new major international airport along with its \n     revenues and expanding revenue base.\n       The demand in airline traffic could easily expand by 30% \n     during the next decade. Where does this leave Illinois and \n     Chicago? It leaves us with no growth in the industry if we \n     have no place to land more airplanes. If Indiana were ever to \n     get smart and construct a major airport to the East of \n     Peotone, imagine the damaging economic impact it would have \n     on Northern Illinois!\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 John W. Teerling.\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would just make a couple of \ncomments in general and not direct it to those who are trying to \ndecrease or increase slots at airports but some philosophical points.\n  A lot of these rules were set, as has been pointed out, some 30 years \nago. Of course, there has been a lot of technology which has developed \nsince that time, and a lot of it which has been in place since that \ntime which allows much more efficient use. We don't have so-called \n``buy and sell'' situations anymore. We have slots.\n  We also have, as I described in my opening statement yesterday, \nmillions of Americans who fly every year, and 1 billion people will be \nflying in the next decade. We have a tripling of air cargo. We have an \nenormous increase in international flights. We have an enormous \nincrease in letters and boxes, all of which require flights and all of \nwhich require slots. They go to different airports. But the point is \neverything is increasing.\n  I don't think that any of us on the floor or colleagues who will be \nhere to vote on various issues can pretend that we can turn around and \nsay: All right, Mr. and Mrs. America. Yes, you are making more income. \nYes, you are maybe vacation-conscious. Yes, this is a free market \nsystem. Yes, you live in a free country and you want to fly to more \nplaces and you have the money now to take your children with you. You \nare writing more letters. You are sending more packages because more \nservices are available.\n  We cannot pretend as though we are going to stop this process. I \ndon't want to make the comparison to the Internet because the Internet \nhas a life of its own. But it comes to mind. There are a lot of people \nwho want to stop some of the things going on on the Internet. They \ncan't do it. The Internet has a life of its own. It is the result of \nthe free enterprise system that people decide to buy it or not buy it. \nThat is their choice.\n  But people also have the choice as to whether they want to fly or \nnot. We are now coming to the point where we have the technology to \nallow a lot more of that to happen.\n  I described a visit I made to the air traffic control center in \nHerndon, VA, which is highly automated and has the highest form of \ntechnology. If you want to say: All right. How many flights are in the \nair right now from 3,000 to 5,000 feet? How many are in the air now \nfrom 5,000 to 7,000, or 5,000 to 6,000? They push a button, and they \ncan tell you every flight--because I have seen it--every flight in the \ncountry at certain levels. The whole concept of being able to increase \nflights is going to be there.\n\n  No. 1, we have established the fact that Americans are free. This is \nnot the former Soviet Union. People have the right to fly. They have \nthe money to fly. The economy is doing better, and exponentially \neverything is growing. That case is closed.\n  If somebody wants to say, let's stop that, let's just say we are \ngoing to pretend it was 30 years ago and only so many people can fly, \nonly so many letters can be written, only so many international \nflights, the Italians and French are going to have to stop, it is OK \nthe Japanese and Germans do it--life does not work like that. People \nhave the right to make their decisions, and it is up to us in Congress \nto expedite the ability of the FAA to have in place the instruments, \nthe technology, and the funding to make all of this work properly.\n  I point out one economic thing that comes from the Department of \nTransportation which is very interesting. This happens to deal with \nO'Hare. That is an accident; it is not deliberate. But it makes an \ninteresting point because it talks about the benefits if you open up \nslots and it talks about the deficiencies; there are both. If you open \nup more slots, you will get a benefit for the consumer that outweighs \nthe total cost of the delays and, in short, the consumer will save a \ngreat deal of money, or a certain amount of money, on tickets. They \nwill save money because there will be more competition, because there \nwill be more slots, because there will be more flights. That is the \nfree-market system. That is what brings lower costs.\n  I do not enjoy flying from Charleston, WV, to Washington, DC, and \npaying $686 for a flight on an airplane into which I can barely \nsqueeze.\n  Let's understand, we have something which is growing exponentially \nand happens to be terrific for our economy. As I indicated, 10 million \npeople work in this industry. You are not going to stop people from \nsending letters. You are not going to stop people from flying. You are \nnot going to stop people from taking vacations. You are not\n\n[[Page S11903]]\n\ngoing to stop international traffic. None of that is going to happen. \nWe have to accommodate ourselves.\n  Does that mean there is going to be somewhat more noise? Yes.\n  Does that mean we have to improve systems, engines, and research that \nare reducing that noise? Yes, we do.\n  Does that mean there are going to be more delays? Probably.\n  But the alternative to that is to say, all right, since we cannot \nhave a single delay and nobody can be inconvenienced a single half \nhour, then let's just shut all of this off and go back to the 1960s and \npretend we are in that era. We cannot do that. We simply cannot do \nthat.\n  I introduce that thought into this conversation. There will be other \namendments and other points that will be made about it. But we are \ndealing with inexorable growth, which the American people want, which \nthe international community wants, which is now supported by an economy \nwhich is going to continue to sustain it. Even if the economy goes \nthrough a downturn, it is not going to slow down traffic use \nsubstantially because once people begin to fly, they keep on flying; \nthey do not give up that habit.\n\n  We are dealing with a fact of life to which we have to make an \nadjustment in two ways: One, we have to be willing to accept certain \ninconveniences. I happen to live in one place where the airplanes just \npour over my house. I do not enjoy that, but I adjust to it.\n  Let's deal in the real world here. Flights are good for the economy; \nflights are good for Americans; flights are good for the world. \nPackages and letters are all part of communication. There is nothing we \nare going to do to stop it, so we have to make adjustments. One, in our \nown personal lives, and, two, we in Congress have to make adjustments \nby being far more aggressive in terms of expediting funding for \nresearch, instruments, and technology that will make all of this as \neasy as possible.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to \namendment No. 1892 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Robb] for himself, Mr. \n     Sarbanes and Ms. Mikulski; proposes an amendment numbered \n     2259 to amendment No. 1892.\n       Beginning on page 12 of the amendment, strike line 18 and \n     all that follows through page 19, line 2, and redesignate the \n     remaining subsections and references thereto accordingly.\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from Arizona \nfor accepting three out of four of the amendments I have proposed. I \nhad hoped we might someday find a way he could accept the fourth. I am \nvery much aware of the fact, however, that he and some others are not \ninclined to do that. I have, therefore, sent to the desk an amendment, \njust read by the clerk in its entirety, which simply strikes the \nsection of the amendment that deals with the number of additional slots \nat National Airport.\n  In this particular case, this amendment offered by the Senator from \nWashington, while a step in the right direction from the original bill \nlanguage which would have required that an additional 48 slots be \nforced on the Washington National Airport Authority, nonetheless cuts \nthat in half and it gets halfway to the objective I hope we can \nultimately achieve in this particular case.\n  The amendment would reduce to zero the number of changes in the slots \nthat are currently in existence at Ronald Reagan Washington National \nAirport.\n  My primary objection to this section is that it breaks a commitment \nto the citizens of this region, by injecting the Federal Government \nback into the management of our local airports.\n  Before I discuss this issue in detail, I wish to make clear that I \nfully support nearly all of the underlying legislation and have for \nsome period of time. Congress ought to approve a multiyear FAA \nreauthorization bill that boosts our investment in aviation \ninfrastructure and keeps our economy going strong. There is no question \nabout that. I have supported that from the very beginning, and I thank \nthe managers for their efforts in this particular regard.\n  I have long believed that funding for transportation, particularly \nmass transportation, is one of the best investments our Government can \nmake. For our aviation system, in particular, these investments are \ncritical.\n  As Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater noted:\n\n       . . . aviation will be for America in the 21st Century what \n     the Interstate Highway System has been for America in this \n     century.\n\n  It has been suggested that as part of our preparation for the next \ncentury of aviation to promote competition and protect consumers, we \nought to impose additional flights on the communities surrounding \nNational Airport.\n  It has been argued that the high density rule, which limits the \nnumber of slots or flights at National, is a restriction on our free \nmarket and hurts consumers. I do not dispute the fact that flight \nlimits at National restrict free market. I believe, however, that the \nproponents of additional flights give an inaccurate picture of the \nsupposed benefits of forcing flights on National Airport.\n\n  Before I go on to discuss the impact of additional flights on \ncommunities in Northern Virginia, I would like to deflate the idea that \nmore flights will necessarily be a big winner for consumers.\n  Based on the number of GAO reports we have had on this subject, some \nof our colleagues may think slot controls are somehow the primary cause \nof consumer woes. When we look at the facts, however, this simply is \nnot the case.\n  I understand reports by the GAO and by the National Research Council \nargue that airfares at slot-controlled airports are higher than \naverage. However, the existence of higher-than-average fares does not \ntell us how slot controls may contribute to high fares at a specific \nairport. Many other factors, such as dominance of a given market by a \nparticular carrier, or the leasing terms for gates, play a role in \ndetermining price. Also, simply noting the higher-than-average fares do \nnot tell us whether slot controls are really a significant problem for \nthe Nation.\n  The U.S. Department of Transportation has examined air service on a \ncity-by-city basis looking at all service to each city. This chart \nshows a 1998 third quarter DOT assessment of airfares, ranking each \ncity based on the average cost per mile traveled. As you can see, the \nairports with the slot controls are not at the top of the list. In \nfact, they do not even make the top 106. Slot-controlled Chicago, as my \ndistinguished colleague from Illinois has pointed out, comes in at No. \n19, right after Atlanta, GA; slot-controlled Washington, DC, comes in \nat 25, which is after Denver; and slot controlled\n\n[[Page S11905]]\n\nNew York is way down the list at No. 42.\n  Clearly, there are factors beyond slot controls that weigh heavily in \ndetermining how expensive air travel is in a particular city. So simply \nadding more flights will not necessarily bring costs down.\n  Proponents of adding more slots at National may argue, nonetheless, \nthat their proposal is a slam-dunk win for consumers. But on closer \nexamination, more flights look less like a game-winning move and more \nlike dropping the ball.\n  Advocates of more flights ignore or downplay a central fact: More \nflights mean more delays, as the Senator from Illinois has so \neloquently pointed out. More flights mean more harm to consumers in the \nairline industry. This is the untold story of the impact of more \nflights at National.\n  The most recent GAO study downplays this issue in a passing reference \nto the impact of delays. According to the GAO:\n\n       [I]f the number of slots were increased . . . delays. . \n     .could cause the airlines to experience a decreased profit . \n     . . the costs [of delay] associated with the increase would \n     be partially offset by consumer benefits.\n\n  A 1999 National Research Council report acknowledges that delays \nresulting from more flights may hurt consumers:\n\n       [I]t is conceivable that many travelers would accept \n     additional delays in exchange for increased access to [slot-\n     controlled] airports. . . . Recurrent delays from heavy \n     demand, however, would prompt direct responses to relieve \n     congestion.\n\n  Later on the report suggests ``congestion pricing'' to prevent \ndelays. Congestion pricing would raise airport charges and, thus, \nairfares during busy times to reduce delays. In other words, the \nNational Research Council is suggesting that additional flights would \nforce consumers to either accept more delays or accept price hikes to \nmanage delays.\n\n  I understand the underlying bill says that additional slots shall not \ncause ``meaningful delay.'' The legislation does not define \n``meaningful delay,'' however, or provide any mechanism to protect \nconsumers from delays, should they occur.\n  While both the GAO and the NRC reports acknowledge we can expect \ndelays, neither report examines the specific impact of delays on \nconsumers.\n  The most detailed analysis that is available to us comes from a 1995 \nDOT study titled ``A Study of the High Density Rule.'' That report \nexamines the impact of several scenarios, including removing slots at \nNational completely, and allowing 191 new flights, the maximum the \nairport could safely accept according to their report.\n  According to experts at DOT:\n\n       [T]he estimated dollar benefit of lifting the slot rule at \n     National is substantially negative: minus $107 million.\n\n  This figure includes the benefits of new service and fare reductions, \nweighed against the cost of delays to consumers and airliners.\n  There is simply no getting around the fact that National has limits \non how many flights it can safely manage. As we try to get closer to \nthat maximum safe number, the more delays we will face.\n  The DOT report goes on to examine the specific impact of adding 48 \nnew slots, as proposed by the underlying legislation. The report finds \nthat the length of delays will nearly double from an average of \nsomething around 4.6 minutes to a delay of 8 minutes, on average. I \nwill discuss the costs of these delays at National Airport in a moment.\n  But in case some of my colleagues think that a few minutes of delay \nis not a problem for air travelers, the Air Transport Association has \nestimated that last year delays cost the industry $2.5 billion in \novertime wages, extra fuel, and maintenance. Indeed, yesterday I was \nflying up and down the east coast and all of those charges were clearly \nadding to the cost of the airline, which will ultimately be passed on \nto the consumer.\n  For consumers, there were 308,000 flight delays and millions of hours \nof time lost. For National in particular, the 1995 DOT report finds \nthat airlines would see $23 million in losses due to delays. For \nconsumers, 48 new slots would provide little benefit overall. Consumers \nwould see $53 million in new service benefits, but delays would cost \nconsumers $50 million.\n  The report assumes no benefits from fare reductions with 48 slots, \nbut, being generous, I have assumed an estimated fare reduction of $20 \nmillion from fare benefits listed elsewhere in the report. Consumer \nbenefits, therefore, are $53 million for new service; minus $50 million \nfor delays, plus $20 million for possible discounts, for a total of \nabout $23 million.\n  Considering the fact that about 16 million travelers use National \neach year, that works out to about $1.50 per person per trip in \nsavings.\n  That is not much benefit for the 48 slots. For 24 slots, as the \nGorton amendment provides, we don't have a good analysis of the cost of \ndelay. I suspect, however, the ultimate consumer benefits are similarly \nmodest.\n  We all value the free market and the benefit it provides to \nconsumers. At the same time, it is the job of Congress to weigh the \nbenefits of an unrestrained market against other cherished values. The \nfree market does not protect our children from pollution, guard against \nmonopolies, or preserve our natural resources. In this case, we are \nweighing a small benefit that would come from an additional 24 slots at \nNational against the virtues of a Government that keeps its word and \nagainst the peace of mind of thousands of Northern Virginians, as well \nas many in the District of Columbia and Maryland.\n  Elsewhere in this bill, we would restrain the market. The legislation \nwould restrict air flights over both small and large parks. I submit \nthat is the right thing to do. We should work to preserve the sanctity \nof our national parks. But while this bill abandons free market \nprinciples to shield our parks, it uses free market principles as a \nsword to cut away at the quality of life in our Nation's Capital. It is \nwrong to try to force Virginians and those who live in this area, \nMaryland and the District of Columbia and elsewhere, to endure more \nnoise from National Airport, especially when the consumer benefits are \nso small and so uncertain. Most troubling of all is the fact that this \nbill breaks a promise to the citizens of this region, a promise that \nthey would be left to manage their own airports without Federal \nmeddling. To give the context surrounding that promise, I must review \nsome of the history of the high density rule and the perimeter rule at \nNational.\n  National, as many of our colleagues know, was built in 1941. It was, \ntherefore, not designed to accommodate large commercial jets. As a \nresult, during the 1960s, as congestion grew, National soon became \novercrowded. To address chronic delays, in 1966, the airlines \nthemselves agreed to limit the number of flights at National. They also \nagreed to a perimeter rule to further reduce overcrowding. Long haul \nservice was diverted to Dulles. During the 1970s and early 1980s, \nimprovements were negligible or nonexistent at both National and \nDulles, as any of our colleagues who served in this body or the other \nbody at that time will recall, because there was no certainty to the \nairline agreements.\n  National drained flights from Dulles so improvements at Dulles were \nput on hold. Litigation and public protest over increasing noise at \nNational blocked improvements there. As my immediate successor as \nGovernor, Jerry Baliles, described the situation in 1986:\n\n       National is a joke without a punchline--National Airport \n     has become a national disgrace. National's crowded, noisy, \n     and incomprehensible. Travelers need easy access to the \n     terminal. What they get instead is a half marathon, half \n     obstacle course, and total confusion.\n\n  To address this problem, Congress codified the voluntary agreements \nthe airlines had adopted on flight limits and created an independent \nauthority to manage the airports. The slot rules limited the number of \nflights and noise at National, and the perimeter rule increased \nbusiness at Dulles. Together with local management of the airports, \nthese rules provided what we thought was long-term stability and growth \nfor both airports. More than $1.6 billion in bonds have supported the \nexpansion of Dulles. More than $940 million has been invested to \nupgrade National. These major improvements would not have taken place \nwithout local management and without the stability provided by the \nperimeter and slot rules.\n\n[[Page S11906]]\n\n  The local agreement on slot controls was not enacted into Federal law \nsimply to build good airports. Slot controls embodied a promise to the \ncommunities of Northern Virginia and Washington and Maryland.\n  In the 1980s, there was some discussion of shutting down National \ncompletely. Anyone who was here at the time will recall that discussion \nand the prospect that National might actually be shut down. We avoided \nthat fate and the resulting harm to consumer choice with an agreement \nto limit National's growth. I suspect some individuals in communities \naround National believe the agreement did not protect them enough and \nshould have limited flights even more. But by giving them some sense of \nsecurity that airport noise would not continue to worsen by giving them \na commitment, we were able to move ahead with airport improvements.\n  Congress and the executive branch recognized the community outrage \nthat had blocked airport work and affirmed that a Federal commitment in \nlaw would allow improvements to go forward.\n  In 1986 hearings on the airport legislation, Secretary of \nTransportation Elizabeth Dole stated:\n\n       With a statutory bar to more flights, noise levels will \n     continue to decline as quieter aircraft are introduced. Thus \n     all the planned projects at National would simply improve the \n     facility, not increase its capacity for air traffic. Under \n     these conditions, I believe that National's neighbors will no \n     longer object to the improvements.\n\n  As the Senate Committee on Commerce report noted at the time:\n\n       [I]t is the legislation's purpose to authorize the transfer \n     under long-term lease of the two airports ``as a unit to a \n     properly constituted independent airport authority to be \n     created by Virginia and the District of Columbia in order to \n     improve the management, operation and development of these \n     important transportation assets.''\n\n  Local government leaders, such as Arlington County Board member John \nMilliken, at that time noted that they sought a total curfew on all \nflights and shrinking the perimeter rule but, in the spirit of \ncompromise, would accept specific limitations on flights and the \nperimeter rule.\n  The airport legislation was not simply about protecting communities \nfrom airport noise. It was also about the appropriate role of the \nFederal Government. Members of Congress noted at the time that the \nFederal Government should not be involved in local airport management. \nIn short, local airports should be managed by local governments, not \nthrough congressional intervention.\n  At a congressional debate on the airport legislation, Senator Robert \nDole and Congressman Dick Armey affirmed that Federal management of the \nairports was harmful. According to Senator Dole:\n\n       There are a few things the Federal Government--and only the \n     Federal Government--can do well. Running local airports is \n     not one of them.\n\n  According to Congressman Dick Armey:\n\n       Transferring control of the airports to an independent \n     authority will put these airports on the same footing as all \n     others in the country. It gets the Federal Government out of \n     the day-to-day operation and management of civilian airports, \n     and puts this control into the hands of those who are more \n     interested in seeing these airports run in the safest and \n     most efficient manner possible.\n\n  I submit that local airports in Virginia have been well managed to \ndate. We shouldn't now start second-guessing that effort.\n  Again, the legislation before us reneges on the Federal commitment to \nthis region that the Federal Government would not meddle in airport \nmanagement and that we would not force additional flights on National. \nCongress repeated that commitment in 1990 with the Airport Noise \nCapacity Act which left in place existing noise control measures across \nthe country. That act, wherein Congress limited new noise rules and \nflight restrictions, also recognized that the Federal Government should \nnot overrule preexisting slot controls, curfews, and noise limits. The \n1990 act left in place preexisting rules, including flight limits at \nNational.\n  The bill before us contributes to the growing cynicism with which the \npublic views our Federal Government. Overruling protections that \nairport communities have relied on is fundamentally unfair.\n\n  Beyond the matter of fairness, forcing flights on National sets a \nprecedent that will affect communities across the Nation. Many \ncommunities, such as Seattle, WA, and San Diego, CA, are trying to \ndetermine how they will address growing aviation needs and how their \nactions will affect communities around their airports.\n  Those debates will determine how communities will treat their \nexisting airport, whether they will close the airport to prevent \npossible growth in excess noise or leave it open to preserve consumer \nbenefits, with the understanding that growth will be restrained.\n  Those debates will also determine the location of new airports, \nwhether a community will place the airport in a convenient location or \nfurther remove it from population centers to avoid noise impacts.\n  The action Congress takes today will shape those debates. Knowing \nthat Congress may intervene in local airport management will tip the \nbalance toward closing the more convenient local airports out of fear--\nfear that Congress will simply stamp out a local decision.\n  Unfortunately, for the citizens around National, they trusted the \nFederal Government. They hoped the Federal Government agreement that \nthey had to limit flights would protect them. As former Secretary of \nTransportation William Coleman noted in 1986, ``National has always \nbeen a political football.''\n  To summarize, the additional flights proposed in this bill are not \ndesigned to address some major restraint on aviation competition. Slot \ncontrols may respect competition, but there are clearly many factors \naffecting airfares. More importantly, the benefits to consumers of 24 \nadditional flights at National are very uncertain. We will clearly have \ndelays, and none of the studies supporting additional flights have \nexamined in detail the cost of those delays. The best study we have on \nthe subject, a 1995 DOT report, suggests that because of those delays, \nconsumers won't get much benefit--maybe $1.50 per person, on average.\n  We don't know how the delays at National--which we know will come if \nwe approve the new flights--will affect air service in other cities \nwith connecting flights to National. We are balancing these marginal \nbenefits against the quality of life in communities surrounding the \nNational Airport. We are pitting improved service for a few against \nquieter neighborhoods for many. We are also pitting a small, uncertain \nbenefit to consumers against the integrity of the Federal Government.\n  Forcing additional flights on National breaks an agreement that \nCongress made in 1986 to turn the airport over to a regional authority \nand leave it alone.\n  A vote for this amendment to strike is a vote against more delays for \nconsumers. A vote for this amendment is a vote in favor of a Federal \nGovernment that keeps its word. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment to strike and retain the bargain, both implied and explicit, \nthat we made in 1986 with the communities that surround the two \nairports in question.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Virginia. I \nunderstand his passion and commitment on this issue. On this particular \nissue, we simply have an honorable disagreement. He makes a very cogent \nargument, but with all due respect, I simply am not in agreement. I \nhave a different view and perspective. He and I have debated this issue \non a number of occasions in the past.\n  I want to make a few additional points. Twelve new round-trip flights \nat Reagan National is barely acceptable to me. Because of Senator \nRobb's intense pressures and that of Senator Warner, and others, we \nhave reduced it rather dramatically from what we had hoped to do. I \nknow the Senator from Virginia knows I won't give up on this issue \nbecause of my belief. But 12 additional round-trip flights are simply \nnot going to help, particularly the underserved airports all over \nAmerica.\n  The GAO has found on more than one occasion that significant barriers \nto competition still exist at several important airports, and both at \nReagan\n\n[[Page S11907]]\n\nNational Airport are slot controls and the perimeter rule.\n  The GAO is not the only one that assesses it that way. The National \nResearch Council's Transportation Research Board recently issued its \nown report on competition in the airline industry. This independent \ngroup also found that ``the detrimental effects of slot controls on \nairline efficiency and competition are well-documented and are too far-\nreaching and significant to continue.''\n  Based on its finding, the Transportation Research Board recommended \nthe early elimination of slot controls. They were equally critical of \nperimeter rules.\n  As I mentioned during my opening statement, the GAO came out last \nmonth with another study confirming that Reagan National is fully \ncapable of handling more flights without compromising safety or \ncreating significant aircraft delays. In fact, language in the bill \nrequires that any additional flights would have to clear the Department \nof Transportation's assessment so far as any impact on safety. The GAO \ndemonstrates that their arguments against these modest changes are not \npersuasive. I regret this legislation doesn't do more to promote \ncompetition at Reagan National Airport.\n  I earlier read a statement from one of Senator Robb's constituents \nwho alleged that he could not afford flights out of Reagan National \nAirport. Also, I got another letter that was sent to the FAA aviation \nnoise ombudsman and printed in his annual activity report. The noise \nombudsman deals almost entirely with complaints about noise.\n  The relevant section of that report reads as follows:\n\n       Very few citizens who are not annoyed by airplane noise \n     take the time to publicly or privately voice an opinion. The \n     Ombudsman received a written opinion from one such residence \n     in the area south of National Airport which said:\n       Recently, someone left a ``flyer'' in my mailbox urging \n     that I contact you to complain about aircraft noise into and \n     out of the airport. I am going to follow her format point by \n     point.\n       I have lived in (the area) for 35 years. I have not \n     experienced any increase in aircraft noise. I have noticed a \n     reduction in the loudness of the planes during that time.\n\n  That makes sense, Mr. President, since aircraft engines are quieter \nand quieter. The citizen says:\n\n       I do not observe aircraft flying lower. I have not observed \n     more aircraft following one another more closely. I have not \n     noticed the aircraft turning closer to the airport as opposed \n     to ``down river.'' My quality of life has not significantly \n     been reduced by aircraft noise. In fact, in the 1960s and \n     1970s, the noise was much louder. I am not concerned about \n     property values due to the level of aircraft noise. I would \n     be very concerned if there were no noise because it would \n     mean the airport was closed. A closure of the airport would \n     make my neighborhood less desirable to me and to many \n     thousands of others who like the convenience of Reagan \n     National Airport. I am concerned about safety and \n     environmental impacts, as everybody should be; but Reagan \n     National Airport has a good safety record and the \n     environmental impact is no greater here than elsewhere. I \n     have not heard any recent neighborhood ``upset''' about the \n     increase in airport noise. Reagan National Airport is the \n     most convenient airport that I have ever been in. I hope you \n     will do more to expand its benefit by expanding the range of \n     flights in and out of it.\n\n  This is certainly another resident of Northern Virginia who has, in \nmy view, the proper perspective. Most local residents don't get \nmotivated to write such letters as the one I just read. Apparently, \nthere are those who drop flyers in mailboxes asking people to write and \ncomplain.\n  I yield to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend from \nArizona, with whom I agree on so many issues but disagree on this \nparticular question. First of all, I will let the Senator know that I \nam not in any way affiliated or associated with an effort to get people \nto write the Senator from Arizona or anybody else. There may be others \nwith good intentions. But I submit to my friend from Arizona that the \nletter he just read makes the point we are trying to make; that is, the \nletter--which I haven't seen yet--talks about it was worse back in the \nearly 1960s when we had a slots agreement which limited the number of \nplanes. We had a decrease in noise because of the aircraft noise levels \nin the stage 3 aircraft. All of this is consistent with what has \nhappened. Why most of the individuals who live in these areas want to \ncontinue to have the protections that were afforded to them by the 1986 \nagreement is precisely what is included in the letter my friend from \nArizona just read.\n\n  I ask my friend from Arizona to react to my reaction to a letter \npreviously unseen, but it seems to me to be directly on point and makes \nthe point as to why we are pursuing an attempt to keep my friend from \nArizona from breaking that agreement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend.\n  First of all, the gentleman said 1960s and 1970s--not just 1960s, \n1970s. He said the noise was much louder in the 1970s.\n  In a report to Congress recently, Secretary Rodney Slater announced \nthat the Nation's commercial jet aircraft fleet is the quietest in \nhistory and will continue to achieve record low noise levels into the \nnext century. Obviously, with stage 3 aircraft, that noise would be \ndramatically lessened, thank God. I hope there is going to be a stage 4 \nthat will make it even quieter. Clearly, it is not, because actually \nthe number of flights have been reduced at Reagan National Airport \nsince the perimeter rule and the slot controls were put in--because, as \nthe Senator knows, the major airlines aren't making full use of those \nslots as they are really required to do by, if not the letter of the \nlaw, certainly the intent of the law.\n  I remind the Senator, the requirement is they all be stage 3 \naircraft. New flights would have to be stage 4 aircraft.\n  The Senator just pointed out how stage 3 aircraft are much quieter. \nThey would have to meet any safety studies done by the DOT before any \nadditional flights were allowed.\n  Again, the GAO and the Department of Transportation--literally every \nobjective organization that observes the situation at Reagan National \nAirport--say that increase in flights is called for. The perimeter \nrule, which was put in in a purely blatant political move, as we all \nknow--coincidentally, the perimeter rule reaches the western edge of \nthe runway at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport. We all know who the majority \nleader of the House was at that time. We all know it has been a great \nboon to the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport.\n  Why wasn't it in Jackson, MS? I think if my dear friend, the majority \nleader, had been there at the time, perhaps it might have.\n  But the fact is that the perimeter rule was artificially imposed for \nrestraint. The Senator knows that as well as I do.\n  But back to his question, again, the GAO, the DOT, the Aviation \nCommission, and every other one indicate clearly that this is called \nfor. I want to remind the Senator. I do with some embarrassment--12 \nadditional flights, 12 additional round-trip flights? I think my dear \nfriend from Virginia doth protest too much.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, will my friend from Arizona yield for an \nadditional question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I ask my friend from Arizona if he would \naddress the other two principal concerns that have been raised--delays \nand the breaking of a deal. He has in part addressed the breaking of a \ndeal. He says the deal in effect was political. Indeed, there are some \npolitical implications in almost anything that is struck, particularly \nas it affects jurisdictions differently in this body, as the Senator \nwell knows. But it was a deal entered into by the executive branch, \nCongress on both sides, the governments of the local jurisdictions \ninvolved, and all of the local communities. That was the deal that was \nentered into. Now we are concerned about the impact of breaking the \ndeal and the impact of additional delays.\n\n  As I mentioned just a few minutes ago, I myself was caught in delays \nthat were exacerbated by the fact that we had some planes waiting to \ntake off ``right now.'' That is without any additional flight \nauthorization during the time periods that are going to be sought.\n  Second, certainly the Senator from Illinois talked about the fact \nthat the mayor of Chicago came here for a specific reception that was \nin his honor to benefit Chicago and was inconvenienced to the point \nthat he didn't arrive until after the reception was over and he turned \nright around. I almost did that yesterday on another flight.\n  But the point is, more flights mean more delays and mean breaking the \ndeal that the Congress, the executive\n\n[[Page S11908]]\n\nbranch, and the local governments made with the people.\n  Will the distinguished Senator from Arizona address those two \nelements of my concern at this point? I agree certainly on the stage 3 \nengines and the continued noise reduction.\n  Mr. President, before he answers the question, let me thank him for \nhis accommodation in many areas. I am not in any way diminishing the \nnumber of changes the Senator from Arizona has made to try to address \nlegitimate concerns that he recognized could be addressed. And this is \na less bad bill than we had earlier with respect to this particular \ncomponent of it. But we are still not where the deal said we ought to \nbe. We are still not where we can represent to the people that we are \nnot going to be creating additional delays in an obviously constricted \narea.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be glad to respond very quickly. Does the Senator \nwant an up-or-down vote on this amendment?\n  Mr. ROBB. The Senator would definitely like it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to ask the majority leader. Perhaps we can \nschedule it right after the lunch along with the other votes. I will \nask the majority leader when he finishes his conversation. We are about \nto break for the lunch period. Would the majority leader agree to an \nup-or-down vote as part of the votes that are going to take place after \nthe lunch?\n  Mr. LOTT. That would be my preference, actually, Mr. President. If \nthe Senator will yield, I would like to get that locked in at this \npoint, if you would like to do so.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be glad to.\n  Could I just very briefly respond. We have been down this track many \ntimes. Delays are due to the air traffic control system, and obviously \nour focus and the reason why we have to pass this bill is to increase \nthe capability of the air traffic control system. Deals are made all \nthe time, my dear friend. The people of Arizona weren't consulted. The \npeople of California weren't consulted. It was a deal made behind \nclosed doors, which is the most unpleasant aspect of the way we do \nbusiness around here, where people were artificially discriminated \nagainst because they happened to live west of the Dallas-Fort Worth \nAirport. It is an inequity, and it is unfair and should be fixed.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a vote on the \nRobb amendment be included in the stacked sequence of votes after the \npolicy luncheon breaks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I may withhold for 1 second, I am \nconcerned that there might be another Senator who would want to be \nheard on this issue. If so, we will delay the vote momentarily. But I \ndon't know that that will be necessary, so let's go ahead and go \nforward with the stacked vote sequence.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2254, As Modified\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify amendment \nNo. 2254, which I filed earlier today, to conform to the previous \nunanimous consent agreement as it relates to aviation matters. I send \nthe modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Insert at the appropriate place:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Federal \nAviation Administration reauthorization bill and I am pleased we will \nhave this opportunity to consider the current state of the aviation \nindustry and some of the enormous challenges facing our air \ntransportation system over the next decade. I resisted efforts earlier \nthis year to bypass Senate consideration of this major transportation \nbill and go directly to conference with the House when the Senate \npassed a short term extension bill for the Airport Improvement Program. \nWe need to have a serious debate on the increasing demands for air \ntransportation, the capital requirements for our future air \ntransportation system, the availability of federal funding and whether \nthe current structure of the aviation trust fund will meet those needs, \nand finally, the lack of competition and minimal service that most \nsmall and medium sized communities are faced with in this era of \nairline deregulation.\n  I want to commend Senators McCain, Rockefeller and Gorton for their \nhard work in resolving so many issues prior to bringing this bill to \nthe floor. I am disturbed, however, by provisions in this bill which \nwould force even more planes into an already jammed system in New York \nas well as Washington's National Airport. At a time when delays are at \nan all-time high, we continue to authorize more flights into and out of \nthese already busy airports. I am even more perplexed at the timing of \nthe current call to privatize our Air Traffic Control System. While \ncertain segments of the industry support this effort, we often too \nquickly gravitate toward solutions such as privatization as cure all \nfor whatever ails the system, instead of simply ensuring that the FAA \nhas the tools and money it needs to do its job.\n  Aviation has become a global business and is an important part of the \ntransportation infrastructure and a vital part of our national economy. \nEvery day our air transportation system moves millions of people and \nbillions of dollars of cargo. While many predicted that an economy \nbased on advanced communications and technology would reduce our need \nfor travel, the opposite has proved true. The U.S. commercial aviation \nindustry recorded its fifth consecutive year of traffic growth, while \nthe general aviation industry enjoyed a banner year in shipments and \naircraft activity at FAA air traffic facilities. To a large extent, \ngrowth in both domestic and international markets has been driven by \nthe continued economic expansion in the U.S. and most world economies.\n  The FAA Aerospace Forecasts Report, Fiscal Years 1999-2010, was \nissued in March of this year and forecasts aviation activity at all FAA \nfacilities through the year 2010. The 12-year forecast is based on \nmoderate economic growth and inflation, and relatively constant real \nfuel prices. Based on these assumptions, U.S. scheduled domestic \npassenger emplanements are forecast to increase 50.4 percent--air \ncarriers increasing 49.3 percent and regional/commuters growing by 87.5 \npercent. Total International passenger traffic between the United \nStates and the rest of the world is projected to increase 82.6 percent. \nInternational passenger traffic carried on U.S. Flag carriers is \nforecast to increase 94.2 percent.\n  These percentages represent a dramatic increase in the actual number \nof people using the air system, even when compared to the increase in \nair travel that occurred over the last ten years. Daily enplanements \nare expected to grow to more than 1 billion by 2009. In 2010, there \nwill be 828 million domestic enplanements compared to last year's 554.6 \nmillion, and there will be 230.2 million international enplanements \ncompared to today's figure of 126.1 million. Respectively, this \nrepresents an annual growth of 3.4% and 4.95% per year. Regional and \ncommuter traffic is expected to grow even faster at the rate of 6.4%. \nTotal enplanements in this category should reach 59.7 million in 2010. \nAs of September 1997, there were 107 regional jets operating in the \nU.S. airline fleet. In the FAA Aviation Forecasts Fiscal years 1998-\n2009, the FAA predicts that there will be more than 800 of these in the \nU.S. fleet by FY2009.\n  Correspondingly, the growth in air travel has placed a strain on the \naviation system and has further increased delays. In 1998, 23% of \nflights by major air carriers were delayed. MITRE, the FAA's federally-\nfunded research and development organization, estimates that just to \nmaintain delays at current levels in 2015, a 60% increase in airport \ncapacity will be needed. As many of you may know, and perhaps \nexperienced first hand, delays reached an all-time high this summer. \nThese delays are inordinately costly to both the carriers and the \ntraveling public; in fact, according to the Air Transport Association, \ndelays cost the airlines and travelers $3.9 billion for 1997.\n  We cannot ignore the numbers. These statistics underscore the \nnecessity of properly funding our investment--we must modernize our Air \nTraffic Control system and expand our airport infrastructure. In 1997, \nthe National Civil Aviation Review Commission came out with a report \nstating the gridlock in the skies is a certainty unless the Air Traffic \nControl, ATC, system and National Air Space are modernized. A system-\nwide delay increase of just a few minutes per flight will bring \ncommercial operations to a halt. American Airlines published a separate \nstudy confirming these findings. A third, done by the White House \nCommission on Aviation Security and Safety, dated January 1997 and \ncommonly known as the Gore Commission, recommends that modernization of \nthe ATC system be expedited to completion by 2005 instead of 2015.\n  Regrettably, as the need to upgrade and replace the systems used by \nour air traffic controllers grows, funding has steadily decreased since \n1992. In FY '92 the Facilities and Equipment account was funded at $2.4 \nBillion. In l997, F was $l.938 Billion. In 1998, the account was \nfunded at 1.901 billion. Assuming a conservative 2015 completion date, \nthe modernization effort requires $3 billion per year in funding for \nthe Facilities and Equipment Account alone, the\n\n[[Page S11910]]\n\nmainspring of the modernization effort. Unfortunately, S.82 authorizes \n$2.689 billion for FY2000 while the Appropriations Committee has \nprovided only $2.075 billion. We are falling short every year and \nlosing critical ground in the race to update our national air \ntransportation system.\n  Increasing capacity through technological advances is crucial to the \nfunctionality of the FAA and the aviation industry. Today, a great deal \nof the equipment used by the Air Traffic Controllers is old and \nbecoming obsolete. Our air traffic controllers are the front line \ndefense and insure the safety of the traveling public every day by \nseparating aircraft and guiding takeoffs and landings. Our lives and \nthose of our families, friends, and constituents are in their hands. \nThese controllers and technicians do a terrific job. The fact that \ntheir equipment is so antiquated makes their efforts even more heroic.\n  We have the funds to modernize our air facilities but refuse to spend \nthem and by doing so Congress perpetuates a fraud on the traveling \npublic. The Airport and Airways Trust Fund, AAF, was created to provide \na dedicated funding source for critical aviation programs and the money \nin the fund is generated solely from taxes imposed on air travelers and \nthe airline industry. The fund was created so that users of the air \ntransportation system would bear the burden of maintaining and \nimproving the system. The traveling public has continued to honor its \npart of the agreement through the payment of ticket taxes, but the \nfederal government has not.\n  Congress has refused to annually appropriate the full amount \ngenerated in the trust fund despite the growing needs in the aviation \nindustry. The surplus generated in the trust fund is used to fund the \ngeneral operations of government, similar to the way in which Congress \nhas used surplus generated in the Social Security trust fund. At the \nend of FY 2000, the Congressional Budget Office predicts that there \nwill be a cash balance of $14.047 billion in the AATF, for FY2001, it \nwill be $16.499 billion. By FY2009, the balance will grow to $71.563 \nbillion. Instead of using these monies to fund the operation of the \ngeneral government, we should use them to fund aviation improvements, \nwhich is what we promised the American public when we enacted and then \nincreased the airline ticket tax.\n  Let's get our aviation transport system up to par and let's provide \nways to increase competition and maintain our worldwide leadership in \naviation. Let's follow the lead of Chairman Shuster and Congressman \nOberstar and vote to take the Trust Fund off-budget. I look forward to \na thoughtful debate on these issues and I intend to work with Senators \nMcCain, Rockefeller, and Gorton to accomplish this common goal of \nensuring that the safest and most efficient air transportation system \nin the world stays so.\n\n\n                       national airspace redesign\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a provision \nin S. 82, the FAA Reauthorization Bill, that will provide an additional \n$36 million over three years to the National Airspace Re-Design \nproject, and to thank Chairman McCain and Senators Hollings, and \nRockefeller for their critical role in securing this funding.\n  Many of my colleagues may not realize this, but the air routes over \nthe U.S. have never been designed in a comprehensive way, they have \nalways been dealt with regionally and incrementally. In order to \nenhance efficiency and safety, as well as reduce noise over many \nmetropolitan areas, the FAA is undertaking a re-design of our national \nairspace.\n  In an effort to deal with the most challenging part of this re-design \nfrom the outset, the FAA has decided to begin the project in the \n``Eastern Triangle'' ranging from Boston through New York/Newark down \nto Miami. This airspace constitutes some of the busiest in the world, \nwith the New York metropolitan area alone servicing over 300,000 \npassengers and 10,000 tons of cargo a day. The delays resulting from \nthis level of activity being handled by the current route structure \namount to over $1.1 billion per year.\n  While many of my constituents, and I am sure many of Senators \nHollings' and Rockefeller's as well, are pleased by the FAA's decision \nto undertake this difficult task, they are concerned by the timetable \nassociated with the re-design. The FAA currently estimates that it \ncould take as long as five years to complete the project. However, my \ncolleagues and I have been working with the FAA to expedite this \nprocess, and this additional funding will go a long way toward helping \nus achieve this goal.\n  In fact, I had originally offered an amendment to this legislation \nthat would have required the FAA to complete the re-design process in \ntwo years, but have withdrawn it because it is my understanding that \nthe Rockefeller provision will allow the agency to expedite this \nproject.\n  I want to recognize Senator Rockefeller again for including this \nfunding in the bill, and ask Chairman McCain and Senator Rockefeller if \nit is the Committee's hope that this additional funding will be used to \nexpedite the National Re-Design project, including the portion dealing \nwith the ``Eastern Triangle's'' airspace.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I begin by thanking my friend from New \nJersey for his comments, and reassure him that it is the Committee's \nhope that the funding included in this legislation will allow us to \nfinish the National Airspace Re-Design more expeditiously, including \nthe ongoing effort in the Eastern Triangle.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I hope this money will be used to \nspeed up the re-design project and finally bring some relief to the \nmillions of Americans who use our air transportation system and live \nnear our Nation's airports.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I am grateful to Chairman McCain and \nSenator Hollings and Rockefeller for their cooperation and support. I \nlook forward to collaborating with them again on this very important \nissue.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe actions taken by the Commerce Committee and in particular, Chairman \nMcCain, in crafting provisions that will allow exemptions to the \ncurrent perimeter rule at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. \nMr. Chairman, I commend you on creating a process which I believe \nfairly balances the interests of Senators from states inside the \nperimeter and those of us from western states without convenient access \nto Reagan National.\n  These limited exemptions to the perimeter rule will improve service \nto the nation's capital for dozens of western cities beyond the \nperimeter--while ensuring that cities inside the perimeter are not \nadversely impacted by new service. This is a fair balance which is \nconsistent with the overall intent of the bill to improve air service \nto small and medium-sized cities.\n  Throughout this bill, our goal has been to improve air service for \ncommunities which have not experienced the benefits of deregulation to \nthe extent of larger markets. The provision relating to improved access \nto Reagan National Airport is no different. Today, passengers from many \ncommunities in the West are forced to double or even triple connect to \nfly to Reagan National. My goal is to ensure that not just large city \npoint-to-point service will benefit, but that passengers from all \npoints west of the perimeter will have better options to reach \nWashington, DC via Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. This \nprovision is about using this restricted exemption process to spread \nimproved access throughout the West--not to limit the benefits to a few \nlarge cities which already have a variety of options.\n  Let me be clear, according to the language contained in this \nprovision, if the Secretary receives more applications for additional \nslots than the bill allows, DOT must prioritize the applications based \non quantifying the domestic network benefits. Therefore, DOT must \nconsider and award these limited opportunities to western hubs which \nconnect the largest number of cities to the national air transportation \nnetwork. In a perfect world, we would not have to make these types of \nchoices and could defer to the marketplace. This certainly would be my \npreference. However, Congress has limited the number of choices thereby \nrequiring the establishment of a process which will ensure that the \nmaximum number of cities benefit from this change in policy.\n  I commend the Chairman and his colleagues on the Commerce Committee\n\n[[Page S11911]]\n\nfor their efforts to open the perimeter rule and improve access and \ncompetition to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. As a part of \nmy statement, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nletter sent to Chairman McCain on this matter signed by seven western \nSenators.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed--the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 23, 1999.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman McCain: We are writing to commend you on your \n     efforts to improve access to the western United States from \n     Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. We support \n     creating a process which fairly balances the interests of \n     states inside the perimeter and those of western states \n     without convenient access to Reagan National.\n       These limited exemptions to the perimeter rule will improve \n     service to the nation's capital for dozens of western cities \n     beyond the perimeter--while at the same time ensuring that \n     cities inside the perimeter are not adversely impacted by new \n     service. This is a fair balance which is consistent with the \n     overall intent of the bill to improve air service to small \n     and medium-sized cities.\n       The most important aspect of your proposal is that the \n     Department of Transportation must award these limited \n     opportunities to western hubs which connect the largest \n     number of cities to the national transportation network. In \n     our view, this standard is the cornerstone of our mutual goal \n     to give the largest number of western cities improved access \n     to the Nation's capital. We trust that the Senate bill and \n     Conference report on FAA reauthorization will reaffirm this \n     objective.\n       In a perfect world, we would not have to make these types \n     of choices. These decisions would be better left to the \n     marketplace. However, Congress has limited the ability of the \n     marketplace to make these determinations. Therefore, we must \n     have a process which ensures that we spread improved access \n     to Reagan National throughout the West.\n       We look forward to working with you as the House and Senate \n     work to reconcile the differences in the FAA reauthorization \n     bills.\n           Sincerely,\n     Orrin G. Hatch,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Larry E. Craig,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Conrad Burns,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Craig Thomas,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Robert F. Bennett,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Mike Crapo,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Max Baucus,\n       U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Gorton-Rockefeller \namendment. This amendment makes important revisions to the underlying \nbill concerning the rules governing the allocation of slots at the \nnation's four slot-controlled airports--Chicago O'Hare, LaGuardia, \nKennedy, and Reagan National Airports. The issues surrounding the \napplication of the high density rule, and the perimeter rule, are both \ncomplex and delicate. They engender strong feelings on all sides. I \nbelieve that the bipartisan leadership of the aviation subcommittee, \nSenators Gorton and Rockefeller, performed a service to the Senate by \ncrafting a compromise that, while not satisfactory to all Senators, \nproposes a regime that is much improved over the one contained in the \ncommittee-reported bill.\n  Mr. President, when the Senate is in session, my wife and I reside in \nNorthern Virginia, not far from the flight path serving Reagan National \nAirport. I have had misgivings about proposals to tinker with the \nstatus quo in terms of the number of flights coming into Reagan \nNational Airport and the distances to which those flights can travel. \nDespite efforts to reduce the levels of aircraft noise through the \nadvent of quieter jet engines, I can tell my colleagues that the \naircraft noise along the Reagan National Airport flight path is often \ndeafening. It can bring all family conversation to a halt. Current \nflight procedures for aircraft landing at Reagan National Airport from \nthe north call on the pilots to direct their aircraft to the maximum \nextent possible over the Potomac River. The intent of this procedure is \nto minimize the noise impact on residential communities on both the \nMaryland and Virginia sides of the river. Notwithstanding this policy, \nhowever, too often the aircraft fail to follow that guidance. That is \nnot necessarily the fault of the pilots. During the busiest times of \nthe day, the requirement to stray directly over certain residential \ncommunities is necessary for safety reasons in order to maintain a \nminimum level of separation between the many aircraft queued up to land \nat Reagan National Airport. I invite my colleagues to glance up the \nriver during twilight one day soon. There is a high probability that \nyou will see the lights of no fewer than four aircraft, all lined up, \nwaiting to land, one right after the other.\n  I appreciate very much the earlier statements made by the \ndistinguished chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator McCain. The \nchairman pointed out that the Department of Transportation has \nindicated that safety will not be compromised through additional \nflights at Reagan National Airport. I remain concerned, however, \nregarding the current capabilities of the air traffic control tower at \nthat airport. The air traffic controllers serving in that facility have \nbeen quite outspoken regarding the deficiencies they find with the \naging and unreliable air traffic control equipment in the tower. \nIndeed, the situation has become so severe that our FAA Administrator, \nMs. Jane Garvey, mandated that the equipment in that facility be \nreplaced far sooner than was originally anticipated. Even so, the new \nequipment for that facility has, like so many other FAA procurements, \nsuffered from development problems and extended delays. Just this past \nweekend, I know many of my colleagues noticed the Washington Post \narticle discussing a further two-year delay in the FAA's deployment of \nequipment to minimize runway incursions--the very frightening \ncircumstance through which taxiing aircraft or other vehicles \nunknowingly stray onto active runways.\n  Given these concerns, Mr. President, I want to commend Senators \nGorton and Rockefeller for negotiating a reasonable compromise on this \nissue. The Gorton-Rockefeller amendment will reduce by half the \nincreased number of frequencies into Reagan National Airport than was \noriginally sought. It will also reserve half of the additional slots \nfor flights serving cities within the 1,250 mile perimeter. Most \nimportantly, Mr. President, these additional slots within the perimeter \nwill be reserved for flights to small communities, flights to \ncommunities without existing service to Reagan National Airport, and \nflights provided by either a new entrant airline, or an established \nairline that will provide new competition to the dominant carriers at \nReagan National.\n  As my colleague from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, knows well, \nno state has endured the ravages of airline deregulation like West \nVirginia. We have experienced a very severe downturn in the quality, \nquantity and affordability of air service in our state. Fares for \nflights to and from our state have grown to ludicrous levels. A \nrefundable unrestricted round-trip ticket between Reagan National \nAirport and Charleston, West Virginia, now costs $722. Conversely, Mr. \nPresident, I can buy the same unrestricted round-trip ticket to Boston, \nwhich is 100 miles farther away than Charleston, and pay less than half \nthat amount. By targeting the additional slots to be provided inside \nthe perimeter to underserved communities, the Gorton-Rockefeller \namendment has taken a small but important step toward addressing this \nproblem.\n  At the present time, the largest airport in West Virginia does have \nsome direct service to Reagan National. We face greater hurdles, \nfrankly, in gaining direct access to LaGuardia Airport in New York, as \nwell as improved service to Chicago O'Hare. The Gorton-Rockefeller \namendment expands slots at those airports as well. As a member of the \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee, I intend to diligently work \nwith Senator Rockefeller, Secretary Slater and his staff, to see that \nWest Virginia has a fair shot at the expanded flight opportunities into \nthese slot controlled airports.\n  Again, in conclusion, I want to rise in support of the Gorton-\nRockefeller amendment. It is a carefully crafted compromise that is a \ngreat improvement over the underlying committee bill, and gives \nappropriate attention to the needs of under-served communities.\n\n\n                 Keeping Aviation Trust Fund on Budget\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I understand that the Senator from New \nMexico and the Senator from Alabama had\n\n[[Page S11912]]\n\nfiled four amendments that they were considering offering during Senate \nconsideration of S. 82, the FAA reauthorization legislation. After \ndiscussions with them, with the managers of the bill and other \ninterested Members, I understand the Members no longer feel it \nnecessary to offer their amendments.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Leader's understanding is correct. After \ndiscussions with the managers of the reauthorization bill, I am \ncomfortable with the assurances of the Majority Leader and the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Commerce Committee on their commitment to \npreserve the current budgetary treatment for aviation accounts in the \nconferenced bill.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I, too, share the Senator's understanding, and would note \nthat there is much to praise in both H.R. 1000 and S. 82 without regard \nto changing budgetary treatment of the aviation accounts. I would be \nvery disappointed if the prospect of a multiyear reauthorization were \nfrustrated by the House's intransigence on changing the budgetary \ntreatment of the aviation accounts to the detriment of all other \ndiscretionary spending, including Amtrak, drug interdiction efforts of \nthe Coast Guard, as well as many of the domestic programs funded in \nappropriations bills other than the one I manage as the Chairman of the \nTransportation appropriations subcommittee.\n  According to the Administration, the budget treatment envisioned in \nH.R. 1000 would create an additional $1.1 billion in outlays, which if \nit were absorbed out of the DOT budget would mean: ``elimination of \nAmtrak capital funding, thereby making it impossible for Amtrak to make \nthe capital investments needed to reach self-sufficiency; and severe \nreductions to Coast Guard, the Federal Railroad Administration, Saint \nLawrence Seaway, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of the \nSecretary, and the Research and Special Programs Administration \nfunding, greatly impacting their operations.'' Clearly, firewalls or \noff-budget treatment for the aviation accounts is a budget buster that \nwould only further exacerbate the current budget problems we face \nstaying under the spending caps.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator from Alabama and the Chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee make a good point. There is more at stake here \nthan just aviation. Our experience over the last two years demonstrates \nthat mandated increases in certain transportation accounts makes it \nextraordinarily difficult to fund other transportation accounts. While \naviation investment is critical to the continued growth, development \nand quality of life of New Jersey and the Northeast, so is the \ncontinued improvement of Amtrak service and an adequately funded Coast \nGuard. Taking care of one mode of transportation with a firewall belies \nthe reality and the importance of providing adequate investment in \nother modes of transportation--not to mention investment in other \nsocial programs.\n  Mr. LOTT. I share the concerns of the Senator from New Jersey and \nwould mention that the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from \nAlabama have informed me on more than one occasion that if a change in \nthe budgetary treatment of the aviation accounts, whether off-budget or \na firewall, is included in the conference report, it would make it \nextraordinarily difficult to consider the conference report in the \nSenate. If that occurs the prospect of a multi-year aviation \nreauthorization may disappear and we may have to settle for a simple \none-year extension of the Airport Improvement Program.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I associate myself with the remarks of my Leader and \nwould also note that there has been much discussion by the proponents \nof changing the budgetary treatment of the FAA accounts because of the \nneed to spend more from the airport and airways trust fund. I would \nlike to set the record straight--for the last five years, we have spent \nmore on the aviation accounts than the airport and airways trust fund \nhas taken in. In addition, the Department of Transportation has \nestimated that we have spent in excess of $6 billion more on FAA \nprograms than total receipts into the Airport and Airways Trust Fund \nover the life of the trust fund.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. My colleagues have been very clear as to their position \non this issue. As a member of all three of the interested committees, \nBudget, Commerce, and Appropriations, I appreciate this issue from all \nthe different perspectives. In short, I believe that we need to spend \nmore on aviation infrastructure investment, but that increased \ninvestment should have to compete with other transportation and other \ndiscretionary spending priorities. I think the record shows that \nSenator Shelby, Senator Stevens, as well as the Senator from New Mexico \nand the Senator from Arizona are strong advocates for the importance of \ninvesting in airport and aviation infrastructure. I share their concern \nthat firewalling or taking the aviation trust fund off-budget would \nallow FAA spending to be exempt for congressional budget control \nmechanisms, providing aviation accounts with a level of protection that \nis not warranted and I will not support such a proposition in \nconference.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I appreciate the comment of the Senator from Washington \nand look forward to working with him on this important issue.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I, too, serve on more than one of the \ninterested committees. On Commerce with the Leader, the Senator from \nArizona, and the Senator from Washington, and on the Appropriations \nCommittee with the Senator from New Mexico, the Senator from Alabama, \nand the Senator from Washington. No member's state relies on aviation \nmore than does my state of Alaska. Yet, changing the budgetary \ntreatment of the aviation accounts is, in my estimation, shortsighted \nand irresponsible. The FAA is to be commended, along with the airlines, \nfor the level of safety they have contributed to achieving. However, \nthe FAA is not known as the most efficient of agencies. Unfortunately, \nthe FAA has had substantial problems on virtually every major, and \nminor, procurement and has been the subject of numerous audits and \nmanagement reports that invariably call for increased accountability \nand oversight. Changing budgetary treatment cannot have other than a \ndetrimental effect on the oversight efforts of the two committees of \njurisdiction that I serve on. For that reason as well as the reasons \nmentioned by the Leader, the Senators from Alabama, New Mexico and New \nJersey, I cannot support a change in budgetary treatment for the \naviation accounts.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I hear and share the views of my \ncolleagues on this issue. Clearly, I have been tasked by the Senate and \nthe Leader with successfully completing a conference with the House on \nmulti-year aviation reauthorization legislation. I, too, oppose any \nchange in budgetary treatment of the aviation accounts.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I note that the Administration strongly opposes any \nprovisions that would drain anticipated budget surpluses prior to \nfulfilling our commitment to save Social Security. The House bill asks \nus to do for aviation what isn't done for education, veterans' \nbenefits, national defense, or environmental protection. As important \nas aviation investment is, it would be fiscally irresponsible of us to \ngrant it a bye from the budget constraints we face with in funding \nvirtually every other program.\n  Mr. SHELBY. The assurances of my Leader and the distinguished \nChairman of the Commerce Committee are all this Senator needs, and I \nwithdraw my filed amendments.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will offer an amendment to give Reagan \nNational and Dulles International Airports equitable treatment under \nFederal law that is enjoyed today by all of the major commercial \nairports.\n  Congress enacted legislation in 1986 to transfer ownership of Reagan \nNational and Dulles Airports to a regional authority which included a \nprovision to create a Congressional Board of Review.\n  Immediately upon passage of the 1986 Transfer Act, local community \ngroups filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the board \nof review. The Supreme Court upheld the lawsuit and concurred that the \nCongressional Board of Review as structured as unconstitutional because \nit gave Members of Congress veto authority over the airport decisions. \nThe Court ruled\n\n[[Page S11913]]\n\nthat the functions of the board of review was a violation of the \nseparation of powers doctrine.\n  During the 1991 House-Senate conference on the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), I offered an amendment, which \nwas adopted, to attempt to revise the Board of Review to meet the \nconstitutional requirements.\n  Those provisions were also challenged and again were ruled \nunconstitutional.\n  In 1996, in another attempt to address the situation, the Congress \nenacted legislation to repeal the Board of Review since it no longer \nserved any function due to several federal court rulings. In its place, \nCongress increased the number of federal appointees to the MWAA Board \nof Directors from 1 to 3 members.\n  In addition to the requirement that the Senate confirm the \nappointees, the statute contains a punitive provision which denies all \nfederal Airport Improvement Program entitlement grants and the \nimposition of any new passenger facility charges to Dulles \nInternational and Reagan National if the appointees were not confirmed \nby October 1, 1997.\n  Regretfully, Mr. President, the Senate has not confirmed the three \nFederal appointees. Since October 1997, Dulles International and Reagan \nNational, and its customers, have been waiting for the Senate to take \naction. Finally in 1998, the Senate Commerce Committee favorably \nreported the three pending nominations to the Senate for consideration, \nbut unfortunately no further action occurred before the end of the \nsession because these nominees were held hostage for other unrelated \nissues. Many speculate that these nominees have not been confirmed \nbecause of the ongoing delay in enacting a long-term FAA \nreauthorization bill.\n  At the beginning of the 105th Congress in January 1997, Commerce \nCommittee held hearings and approved the three nominees for floor \nconsideration. Unfortunately, a hold was placed on them on the Senate \nfloor at the very end of the Congress. All three nominees were \nrenominated by the President in January 1999. Nothing has happened \nsince.\n  Mr. President, I am not here today to join in that speculation. I do \nwant, however, to call to the attention of my colleagues the severe \nfinancial, safety and consumer service constraints this inaction is \nhaving on both Dulles and Reagan National.\n  As the current law forbids the FAA from approving any AIP entitlement \ngrants for construction at the two airports and from approving any \nPassenger Facility Charge (PFC) applications, these airports have been \ndenied access to over $146 million.\n  These are funds that every other airport in the country receives \nannually and are critical to maintaining a quality level of service and \nsafety at our Nation's airports. Unlike any other airport in the \ncountry, the full share of federal funds have been withheld from Dulles \nand Reagan National for over two years.\n  These critically needed funds have halted important construction \nprojects at both airports. Of the over $146 million that is due, \napproximately $161 million will fund long-awaited construction projects \nand $40 million is needed to fund associated financing costs.\n  I respect the right of the Senate to exercise its constitutional \nduties to confirm the President's nominees to important federal \npositions. I do not, however, believe that it is appropriate to link \nthe Senate's confirmation process to vitally needed federal dollars to \noperate airports.\n  Also, I must say that I can find no justification for the Senate's \ndelay in considering the qualifications of these nominees to serve on \nthe MWAA Board. To my knowledge, no one has raised concerns about the \nqualifications of the nominees. We are neglecting our duties.\n  For this reason, I am introducing an amendment today to repeal the \npunitive prohibition on releasing Federal funds to the airports until \nthe Federal nominees have been confirmed.\n  Airports are increasingly competitive. Those that cannot keep up with \nthe growing demand see the services go to other airports. This is \nparticularly true with respect to international services, and low-fare \nservices, both of which are essential.\n  As a result of the Senate's inaction, I provide for my colleagues a \nlist of the several major projects that are virtually on hold since \nOctober, 1997. They are as follows:\n  At Dulles International there are four major projects necessary for \nthe airport to maintain the tremendous growth that is occurring there.\n  Main terminal gate concourse: It is necessary to replace the current \ntemporary buildings attached to the main terminal with a suitable \nfacility. This terminal addition will include passenger hold rooms and \nairline support space. The total cost of this project is $15.4 million, \nwith $11.2 million funded by PFCs.\n  Passenger access to main terminal: As the Authority continues to keep \npace with the increased demand for parking and access to the main \nterminal, PFCs are necessary to build a connector between a new \nautomobile parking facility and the terminal. The total cost of this \nproject is $45.5 million, with $29.4 million funded by PFCs.\n  Improved passenger access between concourse B and main terminal: With \nthe construction of a pedestrian tunnel complex between the main \nterminal and the B concourse, the Authority will be able to continue to \nmeet passenger demand for access to this facility. Once this project is \ncomplete, access to concourse B will be exclusively by moving sidewalk, \nand mobile lounge service to this facility will be unnecessary. The \ntotal cost of this project is $51.1 million, with $46.8 million funded \nby PFCs.\n  Increased baggage handling capacity: With increased passenger levels \ncome increase demands for handling baggage. PFC funding is necessary to \nconstruct a new baggage handling area for inbound and outbound \npassengers. The total cost of this project is $38.7 million, with $31.4 \nmillion funded by PFCs.\n  At Reagan National there are two major projects that are dependent on \nthe Authority's ability to implement passenger facility charges (PFCs).\n  Historic main terminal rehabilitation: Even though the new terminal \nat Reagan National was opened last year, the entire Capital Development \nProgram will not be complete until the historic main terminal is \nrehabilitated for airline use. This project includes the construction \nof nine air carrier gates, renovation of historic portions of the main \nterminal for continued passenger use and demolition of space that is no \nlonger functional. The total cost of this project is $94.2 million with \n$20.7 million to be paid for by AIP entitlement grants and $36.2 \nmillion to be funded with PFCs. Additional airfield work to accompany \nthis project will cost $12.2 million, with $5.2 million funded by PFCs.\n  Terminal connector expansion: In order to accommodate the increased \npassengers moving between Terminals B and C (the new terminal) and \nTerminal A, it is necessary to expand the ``Connector'' between the two \nbuildings. The total cost of the project is $4.8 million, with $4.3 \nmillion funded by PFCs.\n  Mr. President, my amendment is aimed at ensuring that necessary \nsafety and service improvements proceed at Reagan National and Dulles. \nLet's give them the ability to address consumer needs just like every \nother airport does on a daily basis.\n  This amendment would not remove the Congress of the United States, \nand particularly the Senate, from its advise-and-consent role. It \nallows the money, however, which we need for the modernization of these \nairports, to flow properly to the airports. These funds are critical to \nthe modernization program of restructuring them physically to \naccommodate somewhat larger traffic patterns, as well as do the \nnecessary modernization to achieve safety-most important, safety-and \ngreater convenience for the passengers using these two airports.\n  Under the current situation these funds have been held up. It is over \n$146 million, which is more or less held in escrow, pending the \nconfirmation by the Senate of the United States of three individuals to \nthis board.\n  For reasons known to this body, that confirmation has been held up. \nThe confirmation may remain held up. But this amendment will let the \nmoneys flow to the airports for this needed construction for safety and \nconvenience. It is my desire that at a later\n\n[[Page S11914]]\n\ndate, we can achieve the confirmation of these three new members to the \nboard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/05/senate-section/article/S11914-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from South \nDakota, the minority leader, in submitting for the Record and \nacknowledging the importance of a letter we received last week from 40 \nof our Nation's Governors. This letter is distinctly bipartisan and the \nsignatories represent both coastal and inland states. It unequivocally \ndemonstrates strong national support for reinvesting a substantial \nportion of federal outer continental shelf (OCS) oil and gas \ndevelopment revenues in coastal conservation and impact assistance; \nopen space and farmland preservation; development and maintenance of \nfederal, state and local parks and recreation areas; and wildlife \nconservation. The Governors also stressed the importance of recognizing \nthe role of state and local governments in planning and implementing \nthese conservation initiatives.\n  Although the signatories to this letter did not identify specific \nlegislation to which they are lending support, I believe that S. 25, \nthe Conservation and Reinvestment Act of 1999, of which I am a \ncosponsor along with 20 other Senators, most nearly achieves the \nobjectives outlined by the Governors. S. 25 has strong bipartisan \nsupport and offers Congress the best opportunity to pass legislation \nthis year.\n  I share the belief of these Governors that the 106th Congress has a \nhistoric opportunity to demonstrate our solid commitment to natural \nresource conservation for the benefit of future generations. I urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to join hands in advancing this \nnoble effort.\n  I thank the Governors for their letter. I invite the attention of my \ncolleagues to this very important area which is a win-win-win for those \nwho live in the coastal regions as I do, but also inland Governors who \nwill help us with conservation and preservation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               September 21, 1999.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Thomas Daschle,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. J. Dennis Hastert,\n     Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Richard Gephardt,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Lott and Daschle and Representatives Hastert \n     and Gephardt: The 106th Congress has an historic opportunity \n     to end this century with a major commitment to natural \n     resource conservation that will benefit future generations. \n     We encourage you to approve legislation this year that \n     reinvests a meaningful portion of the revenues from federal \n     outer continental shelf (OCS) oil and gas development in \n     coastal conservation and impact assistance, open space and \n     farmland preservation, federal, state and local parks and \n     recreation, and wildlife conservation including endangered \n     species prevention, protection and recovery costs.\n       Since outer continental shelf revenues come from \n     nonrenewable resources, it makes sense to permanently \n     dedicate them to natural resource conservation rather than \n     dispersing them for general government purposes. Around the \n     nation, citizens have repeatedly affirmed their support for \n     conservation through numerous ballot initiatives and state \n     and local legislation. We applaud both the Senate Energy and \n     Natural Resources committee and the House Resources Committee \n     for conducting a bipartisan and inclusive process that \n     recognizes the unique role of state and local governments in \n     preserving and protecting natural resources.\n       The legislation reported by the Committees should, to the \n     maximum extent possible, permanently appropriate these new \n     funds to the states, to be used in partnership with local \n     governments and non-profit organizations to implement the \n     various conservation initiatives. We urge the Congress to \n     give state and local governments maximum flexibility in \n     determining how to invest these funds. In this way, federal \n     funds can be tailored to complement state plans, priorities \n     and resources. State and local governments are in the best \n     position to apply these funds to necessary and unique \n     conservation efforts, such as preserving species, while \n     providing for the economic needs of communities. The \n     legislation should be neutral with regard to both existing \n     OCS moratoria and future offshore development, and should not \n     come at the expense of federally supported state programs.\n       We recognize that dedicating funds over a number of years \n     to any specific use is a difficult budgetary decision. \n     Nevertheless, we believe that the time is right to make this \n     major commitment to conservation along the lines outlined in \n     this letter.\n       We look forward to working with you to take advantage of \n     this unique opportunity and are available to help ensure that \n     this commitment is fiscally responsible. Thank you for your \n     consideration of these legislative principles as you proceed \n     to enact this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n         John A.

We recognize \nand applaud the desire of a number of groups and organizations in this \ncountry to take the proceeds from this non-renewable resource and \nreinvest a portion of these outer continental shelf revenues in the \nconservation and enhancement of our renewable resources.\n  When the Land and Water Conservation Fund was created more than \nthirty years ago, the intention was for revenues from off-shore oil and \ngas drilling to be deposited into the fund, allowing federal and state \ngovernments to protect green space, improve wildlife habitat and \npurchase lands for conservation purposes.\n  In my state of South Dakota this program has been particularly \nbeneficial, helping local and state governments to purchase park lands \nand develop facilities in municipal and state parks throughout the \nstate.\n  Unfortunately, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has rarely \nreceived adequate funding.\n  Congress has the opportunity this year to pass legislation that would \nfinally ensure consistent funding for the Land and Water Conservation \nFund and provide a permanent stream of revenue for conservation.\n  We applaud the efforts of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources as well as the House Committee on Natural Resources for \nconducting the process thus far in a fair and bi-partisan manner.\n  We encourage these committees to continue their progress so that \nCongress as a whole can debate and pass what may well be the most \nsignificant conservation effort of the century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/05/senate-section/article/S11914-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11914-S11915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is a great pleasure for me to support \nthe confirmation of a judicial candidate who is the epitome of good \ncharacter, broad experience, and a judicious temperament.\n  First, however, I think it appropriate that I spend a moment to \nacknowledge the minority for relenting in what I consider to have been \nan ill-conceived gambit to politicize the judicial confirmations \nprocess. My colleagues appear to have made history on September 21 by \npreventing the invocation of cloture for the first time ever on a \ndistrict judge's nomination.\n  This was--and still is--gravely disappointing to me. In a body whose \nbest moments have been those in which statesmanship triumphs over \npartisanship, this unfortunate statistic does not make for a proud \nlegacy.\n  My colleagues, who were motivated by the legitimate goal of gaining \nvotes on two particular nominees, pursued a short-term offensive which \nfailed to accomplish their objective and risked long-term peril for the \nnation's judiciary. There now exists on the books a fresh precedent to \nfilibuster judicial nominees with which either political party \ndisagrees.\n  I have always, and consistently, taken the position that the Senate \nmust address the qualifications of a judicial nominee by a majority \nvote, and that the 41 votes necessary to defeat cloture are no \nsubstitute for the democratic and constitutional principles that \nunderlie this body's majoritarian premise for confirmation to our \nFederal judiciary.\n  But now the Senate is moving forward with the nomination of Ted \nStewart. I think some of my colleagues realized they had erred in \ndrawing lines in the sand, and that their position threatened to do \nlasting damage to the Senate's confirmation process, the integrity of \nthe institution, and, of course, the judicial branch of Government.\n  The record of the Judiciary Committee in processing nominees is a \ngood one. I believe the Senate realized that the Committee will \ncontinue to hold hearings on those judicial nominees who are qualified, \nhave appropriate judicial temperament, and who respect the rule of law. \nI had assured my colleagues of this before we reached this temporary \nimpasse and I reiterate this commitment today.\n  This is not a time for partisan declarations of victory, but I am \npleased that my colleagues revisited their decision to hold up the \nnomination. We are proceeding with a vote on the merits on Ted \nStewart's nomination, and we will then proceed upon an arranged \nschedule to vote on other nominees in precisely the way that was \nproposed prior to the filibuster vote.\n  Ultimately, it is my hope for us, as an institution, that instead of \nsignaling a trend, the last 2 weeks will instead look more like an \naberration that was quickly corrected. I look forward to moving ahead \nto perform our constitutional obligation of providing advice and \nconsent to the President's judicial nominees.\n  And now, I would like to turn our attention to the merits of Ted \nStewart's nomination. I have known Ted Stewart for many years. I have \nlong respected his integrity, his commitment to public service, and his \njudgment. And I am pleased that President Clinton saw fit to nominate \nthis fine man for a seat on the United States District Court for the \nDistrict of Utah.\n  Mr. Stewart received his law degree from the University of Utah \nSchool of Law and his undergraduate degree from Utah State University. \nHe worked as a practicing lawyer in Salt Lake City for 6 years. And he \nserved as trial counsel with the Judge Advocate General in the Utah \nNational Guard.\n  In 1981, Mr. Stewart came to Washington to work with Congressman Jim \nHansen. His practical legal experience served him well on Capitol Hill, \nwhere he was intimately involved in the drafting of legislation.\n  Mr. Stewart's outstanding record in private practice and in the \nLegislative Branch earned him an appointment to the Utah Public Service \nCommission in 1985. For 7 years, he served in a quasi-judicial capacity \non the Commission, conducting hearings, receiving evidence, and \nrendering decisions with findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n  Mr. Stewart then brought his experience as a practicing lawyer, as a \nlegislative aide, and as a quasi-judicial officer, to the executive \nbranch in State government. Beginning in 1992, he served as Executive \nDirector of the Utah Departments of Commerce and Natural Resources. And \nsince 1998, Mr. Stewart has served as the chief of staff of Governor \nMike Leavitt.\n  Throughout Mr. Stewart's career, in private practice, in the \nlegislative branch, in the executive branch, and as a quasi-judicial \nofficer, he has earned the respect of those who have worked for him, \nthose who have worked with him, and those who were affected by his \ndecisions. And a large number of people from all walks of life and both \nsides of the political aisle have written letters supporting Mr. \nStewart's nomination.\n  James Jenkins, former President of the Utah State Bar, wrote, ``Ted's \nreputation for good character and industry and his temperament of \nfairness, objectivity, courtesy, and patience [are] without blemish.''\n  Utah State Senator, Mike Dmitrich, one of many Democrats supporting \nthis nomination, wrote, ``[Mr. Stewart] has always been fair and \ndeliberate and shown the moderation and thoughtfulness that the \njudiciary requires.''\n  I understand that the American Bar Association has concluded that Ted \nStewart meets the qualifications for appointment to the federal \ndistrict court. This sentiment is strongly shared by many in Utah, \nincluding the recent president of the Utah State Bar. For these \nreasons, Mr. Stewart was approved for confirmation to the bench by an \noverwhelming majority vote of the Judiciary Committee.\n  To those who contend Mr. Stewart has taken so-called anti-\nenvironmental positions, I say: look more carefully at his record. Mr. \nStewart was the director of Utah's Department of Natural Resources for \n5 years, and the fact is that his whole record has earned the respect \nand support of many local environmental groups.\n  Indeed, for his actions in protecting reserve water rights in Zion \nNational Park, Mr. Stewart was enthusiastically praised by this \nadministration's Secretary of the Interior.\n  Consider the encomiums from the following persons hailing from Utah's \nenvironmental community:\n  R.G. Valentine, of the Utah Wetlands Foundation, wrote, ``Mr. \nStewart's judgment and judicial evaluation of any project or issue has \nbeen one of unbiased and balanced results.''\n  Don Peay, of the conservation group sportsmen for Fish and Wildlife, \nwrote, ``I have nothing but respect for a man who is honest, fair, \nconsiderate, and extremely capable.''\n  Indeed, far from criticism, Mr. Stewart deserves praise for his major \naccomplishments in protecting the environment.\n  Ultimately, the legion of letters and testaments in support of Mr. \nStewart's nomination reflects the balanced and fair judgment that he \nhas exhibited over his long and distinguished career. Those who know \nTed Stewart know he will continue to serve the public well.\n  On a final note, Ted Stewart is needed in Utah. The seat he will be \ntaking has been vacant since 1997. So I am deeply gratified that the \nSenate is now considering Mr. Stewart for confirmation.\n  I am grateful to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who helped \nget this up and resolve what really was a very serious and I think \ndangerous problem for the Senate as a whole and for the judiciary in \nparticular.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Chair recognizes \nthe Senator from Iowa for up to 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/05/senate-section/article/S11915-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11915-S11916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             AIR TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT ACT--Continued\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the President for this time and his indulgence \nwhile\n\n[[Page S11916]]\n\nI take my 10 minutes when I know we are supposed to be recessing for \nour luncheon caucuses. I appreciate the indulgence of the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  I want to take a few minutes to talk about the managers' amendment, \nthe slot amendment that provides for a two-step process for the \nelimination of airline slots for landing and takeoff rights at O'Hare, \nKennedy, and LaGuardia Airports.\n  Senator Grassley and I have been working on this for quite awhile \ntogether. I am pleased we have been able to work closely with Chairman \nMcCain, with Senator Rockefeller, Senator Gorton, and others on the \ndevelopment of this proposal.\n  It is an important step toward eliminating a major barrier to airline \ncompetition. Not only must we eliminate the barrier, but we have to do \nit in a way that mitigates against the long-term effects of a \nGovernment-imposed slot rule. Under the current rules, most smaller \nairlines have, in effect, a far more difficult time competing, in part, \nbecause of the slot rule.\n  In the first phase of the proposal, in the managers' amendment, small \nairlines will be allowed immediate expanded access to the airports. \nAgain, this will help stimulate increased competition and lower ticket \nprices. Turboprop and regional jet aircraft will also be allowed \nimmediate slot exemptions when they serve smaller markets. This will \nincrease airline service available to smaller cities, especially cities \nwest of the Mississippi, such as the Presiding Officer's cities in \nWyoming, or Nebraska or the Dakotas or Iowa, or places such as that.\n  The two-step mechanism in the bill has the support of 30 attorneys \ngeneral, the Business Travel Coalition, and the Air Carrier Association \nof America which represents many of the smaller airlines.\n  After that first phase, in the final step--after a number of years \nwhen the new competitive airlines might get a chance to establish a \nfoothold and smaller cities would have established better service--the \nslot rules will be ended at O'Hare, Kennedy, and LaGuardia Airports.\n  Again, I commend Chairman McCain for working so closely with us on \nthis issue. Chairman McCain had a field hearing in Des Moines on April \n30 of this year to hear firsthand how the current system affects small- \nand medium-sized cities. Senator McCain has worked hard to move forward \na proposal which I believe will significantly increase competition.\n  I also thank Senator Gorton, and my colleague, Senator Rockefeller \nfrom West Virginia, for their considerable efforts. These Senators have \nshown a keen interest in the problems unique to smaller cities and \nrural areas where adequate service is a paramount issue.\n  The provision has a number of items that address the noise \nimplications of eliminating the slot rule near the three airports. I \nbelieve this final language is an excellent compromise. I am pleased \nthat the structure of our original proposal is largely intact. I was \nalso pleased that the House moved in June to eliminate the slot rule at \nthese airports. I think the Senate provision improves on that.\n  Access to affordable air service is essential to efficient commerce \nand economic development in States with a lot of small communities. \nAgain, Americans have a right to expect this. Airports are paid for by \nthe traveling public through taxes and fees charged by the Federal \nGovernment and local airport authorities. Unfortunately, when \nderegulation came through in 1978, there was no framework put in place \nto deal with anticompetitive practices. A lot of these outrageous \npractices have become business as usual.\n  What happened? We went through deregulation in 1978; and then in 1986 \nthe DOT gave the right to land and take off under these slots to those \nthat used them as of January 21, 1986. So what happened was, when the \nSecretary of DOT, in 1986 said, here, airlines, these are your slots, \nit locked them into those airports, and it effectively locked out \ncompetition in the future. It was, in fact, a give-away. I always said \nthis was a give-away of a public resource. These airports do not belong \nto the airlines. They belong to us. They belong to the people of this \ncountry.\n\n  So what has happened is that over the years these airlines have been \nable to lock them up. So we have this slot system. The slot system came \nin in the late 1960s because the air traffic control system was getting \noverwhelmed with the number of flights then being handled. So they had \na slot system.\n  Just the reverse is true today. With the modernization of our air \ntraffic control system--with global positioning satellites, GPSs, all \nof the other things we have, the communications systems, our air \ntraffic control system, and the ongoing modernization of it--we can \nhandle it. We do not need the slots any longer.\n  However, rather than just dropping them right away, we need to \nmitigate against the damage that has been caused by the slots. That is \nwhy we need to have a phaseout, a two-step phaseout--a phaseout that \nwould both phase out the slots but at the same time include, in that \nfirst phase, turboprops that serve smaller cities, new airlines that \nwould start up with small regional jets that would serve some of the \nsmaller cities that have been cut out of this for the last almost 20 \nyears--well, I guess 14 years now since 1986.\n  So, again, many airlines have monopolies in markets, especially if \nthey control a hub airport. Local airport authorities at major hub \nairports do very little to encourage small carriers to use hub \nairports. It is no surprise that big airlines would rather see gates \nempty than lease them to competitors. Dominant carriers flood the \nmarket with cheap seats to destinations served by small carriers. They \nmaintain the low price until the day the small carrier is gone.\n  This happened in Des Moines with Vanguard Airlines. We had a new \nairline that started. What happened? United and American, flying to \nChicago, dropped their fares by over half, dropped their fares down to \nbelow what Vanguard could do. The travelers were happy, but Vanguard \ncould only afford to do that for so long, and then they went out of \nbusiness. As soon as they went out of business, what did United and \nAmerican do? They upped their fares 83 percent. That is what they were \ndoing to stifle competition.\n  I believe that allowing new entrant carriers, such as Vanguard, \nAccess Air, and others that may be coming along, easier access to \nO'Hare from cities such Des Moines, and the Quad Cities--Moline, Rock \nIsland, Bettendorf, and Davenport and others, will be a step in the \nright direction toward helping economic development and growth and \nproviding for lower airfares for our people.\n  The amendment of the managers opens up the opportunity for direct \nservice into LaGuardia, important to cities such as Des Moines and \nCedar Rapids and the Quad Cities.\n  Again, the Quad Cities recently lost American Airlines' service to \nO'Hare because of the slot rule. American Airlines decided to fly their \nnew regional jet between Omaha and O'Hare. Normally, this would not \nhave had an impact on Quad Cities' service to O'Hare, but under the \nslot rule, Quad Cities lost American Airlines' service entirely. They \nentirely lost it.\n  Without the slot limitation, Quad Cities would be a profitable market \nfor American or any other airline. But the area did not make the cut \nwith a limited number of landing rights available under the existing \nslot rule. Again, economic decisions are not based upon what they can \nexpect to get from a market; it is based upon the slot rule. That is \nskewing the economic decisions made by airlines and by small community \nairports.\n  So again, for our area, for Iowa, for areas west of the Mississippi--\nI am sure for Wyoming and for West Virginia--we need to change this \nsystem, but we need to do it in a way that does not lock in the past \nanticompetitive activities of the larger airlines.\n  Right now, Sioux City, IA, does not have service to O'Hare. It is the \nNo. 1 destination of its business travelers. So, again, what is this \ndoing? It hurts economic development and stifles competition in Sioux \nCity.\n  Again, I urge the Senate to support the managers' amendment. Doing so \nwill lower airfares, it will improve air service to small- and medium-\nsized cities across the Nation, and it will allow for economic \ndecisions to be based on economics and not upon an outdated, outmoded, \nanticompetitive slot rule.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/05/senate-section/article/S11917-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11917-S11918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11917]]\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nstand in recess until the hour of 2:15 p.m.\n  Thereupon, the Senate, at 12:48 p.m., recessed until 2:16 p.m.; \nwhereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by the Presiding \nOfficer (Mr. Inhofe).\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to address the nomination of Judge \nRonnie Lee White, of Missouri, to the United States District Court for \nthe Eastern District of Missouri. We have heard thorough discussions of \nthe nominee by the distinguished Senators from Vermont and from \nMissouri. In coming to my decision on this nominee, I have considered \nthe fairness of the process under which Judge White has been reviewed, \nthe deference due to the President, and the deference due to the \nSenators from the nominee's home State. This is a very difficult case.\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I have conducted thorough \nhearings and reviewed nominees in a fair and even-handed manner. As a \nresult, we have seen a hearings process that does not include personal \nattacks on nominees and that maintains the institutional integrity of \nthe Senate. On numerous occasions, even when several of my Republican \ncolleagues voted against nominees, I maintained a fair process free \nfrom personal attacks on nominees. This was the case with Judge White. \nThe committee held a fair and objective hearing on Judge White and \nthoroughly reviewed his record.\n  In considering any nomination, I believe that the President, in whom \nthe Constitution vests the nominations power, is due a large degree of \ndeference. Even though there are a large number of the President's \nnominees that I would not have nominated had I been President, I have \nsupported these nominees in obtaining a floor vote because in my view, \nthe Constitution requires substantial deference to the President.\n  Of course, the more controversial a nominee is, the longer it takes \nto garner the consensus necessary to move such a nominee out of \ncommittee. Such is the case with Judge White. I supported Judge White \ncoming to the floor on two occasions. In the last vote in committee, no \nfewer than six of my Republican colleagues voted against reporting \nJudge White to the floor. At that point, however, I gave the President \nthe deference of allowing a vote on his nominee and voted to report \nJudge White.\n  I must say that I am deeply disappointed by the unjust accusations \nfrom some that this body intentionally delays nominees, such as Judge \nWhite, based on their race. As the administration is well aware, it is \nnot a nominee's race or gender that slows the process down, but rather \nthe controversial nature of a nominee based on his or her record.\n  Indeed, nominees such as Charles Wilson, Victor Marrero, and Carlos \nMurguia, minority nominees, and Marryanne Trump Barry, Marsha Pechman, \nand Karen Schrier, female nominees, had broad support and moved quickly \nthrough the committee and were confirmed easily on the floor. And, \nalthough the committee does not keep race and gender statistics, a \nbrief review of the committee's record so far this session shows that a \nlarge proportion of the nominees reported to the floor and confirmed \nconsists of minorities and women. I categorically reject the allegation \nthat race or gender, as opposed to substantive controversy, has ever \nplayed any role whatsoever in slowing down any nominee during my tenure \nas chairman.\n  After a fair and thorough review in committee and after paying the \ndeference to the President to obtain a vote on the floor, I consider \nthe position of a nominee's home State Senators. These Senators are in \na unique position to evaluate whether a nominee instills the confidence \nin the people of a State necessary to be a successful Federal judge in \nthat State. This is especially true for a district judge nominee whose \njurisdiction, if confirmed, would be wholly limited to that particular \nState. Thus, there has developed a general custom and practice of my \ngiving weight to the Senators from a nominee's home State.\n  There have been several instances where--notwithstanding some serious \nreservations on my part--I voted to confirm district court nominees \nbecause the Senators from the nominees home State showed strong, and in \nsome cases, bipartisan support. The nominations of Keith Ellison, Allen \nPepper, Anne Aiken, Susan Mollway, and Margaret Morrow are examples of \nwhere I supported contested district court nominees and relied on the \nview of the home-State Senators in reaching my decision.\n\n  While I have harbored great concerns on the White nomination, I \nwithheld my final decision until I had the benefit of the view of my \ncolleagues from Missouri. I was under the impression that one of my \ncolleagues might actually support the nomination, so I felt that the \nprocess should move forward--and it did.\n  Since the committee reported Judge White to the floor of the Senate, \nhowever, both of the Senators from Missouri have announced their \nopposition to confirming Judge White. Also, since the committee \nreported this nominee to the floor, the law enforcement community of \nMissouri has indicated serious concerns, and in some cases, open \nopposition to the nomination of Judge Ronnie White. And indeed, I have \nbeen informed that the National Sheriffs Association opposes this \nnomination. Opposition is mounting and it would perhaps be preferable \nto hold another hearing on the nomination. But if we must move forward \ntoday, it is clear to me that Judge White lacks the home-State support \nthat I feel is necessary for a candidate to the Federal district court \nin that State.\n  For me, this case has been a struggle. On the one hand, Judge White \nis a fine man and the President is due a fair amount of deference. On \nthe other hand, we are faced with the extremely unusual case in which \nboth home State Senators, after having reviewed the record, are \nopposing this nomination on the floor.\n  Of course, had the President worked more closely with the two \nSenators from Missouri and then nominated a less problematic candidate, \nwe would not be in this predicament. But the President did not.\n  When a nominee has a record of supporting controversial legal \npositions that call into question his, or her, respect for the rule of \nlaw, it takes longer to gain the consensus necessary to move the \nnominee. When the President has not adequately consulted with the \nSenate, it takes longer to gain the consensus necessary to move the \nnominee. And when both home State Senators of a nominee oppose as \nnominee on the floor of the Senate, it is almost impossible to vote for \nthe confirmation of that nominee.\n  Regretfully, such is the case with Judge White. Judge White has \nwritten some controversial opinions, especially on death penalty cases \nthat have caused some to question his commitment to upholding the rule \nof law. The President has not garnered broad support for Judge White. \nAnd both Senator Ashcroft and Senator Bond oppose this nomination. It \nwould have been better for all parties concerned--the President, the \nSenate, the people of Missouri, and Judge White, had we been able to \nreach this decision earlier. But I cannot rewrite the past.\n  After a painstaking review of the record and thorough consultation \nwith the nominee's home State Senators, I deeply regret that I must \nvote against the nomination of Judge White. This is in no way a \nreflection of Judge White personally. He is a fine man. Instead, my \ndecision is based on the very unusual circumstances in which the \nPresident has placed this body. I must defer to my colleagues from \nMissouri with respect to a nominee whose jurisdiction, if confirmed, \nwould be wholly limited to that State.\n  I call on the President to nominate another candidate for the Eastern \nDistrict of Missouri. He should do so, however, only after properly \nconsulting with both Missouri Senators and thus respecting the \nconstitutional advice and consent duties that this body performs in \nconfirming a nominee who will serve as a Federal judge for life.\n  Mr. BOND. After discussing this difficult decision with Missouri \nconstituents, the Missouri legal community, and the Missouri law \nenforcement community, I have determined that Ronnie White is not the \nappropriate candidate to serve in a lifetime capacity as a U.S. \ndistrict judge for eastern Missouri.\n\n[[Page S11918]]\n\n  The Missouri law enforcement community, whose views I deeply respect, \nhas expressed grave reservations about Judge White's nomination to the \nFederal bench. They have indicated to me their concern that Judge White \nmight use the power of the bench to compromise the strength of law \nenforcement efforts in Missouri.\n  Given the concerns raised by those in Missouri's law enforcement \ncommunity, who put their lives on the line on a daily basis, and those \nin Missouri's legal community, who are charged with protecting our \nsystem of jurisprudence, I am compelled to vote against Judge White's \nconfirmation.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am opposed to the \nnominations of Raymond Fisher to the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe Ninth Circuit and Ronnie White to the Eastern District of Missouri.\n  Our judicial system is supposed to protect the innocent and ensure \njustice, which is what it has done for the most part for over 200 \nyears. However, there have been glaring exceptions: the Dred Scott \ndecision, which ruled that blacks were not citizens and had no rights \nwhich anyone was bound to respect, and Roe versus Wade, which similarly \nruled that an entire class of people, the unborn, are not human beings \nand therefore are undeserving of any legal protection.\n  Both decisions, made by our Nation's highest court, violated two key \nconstitutional provisions for huge segments of the population. Dred \nScott, which legally legitimized slavery, deprived nearly the entire \nblack population of the right to liberty, while Roe has taken away the \nright to life of 35 million unborn children since 1973. Both created \nrights, the right to own slaves and the right to an abortion, that were \nnot in the Constitution. Of course, both are morally and legally wrong. \nSadly, only Dred has been overturned, by the 13th and 14th amendments. \nCongress and the courts have yet to reverse Roe.\n  The only requirement, the only standard that I have for any judicial \nnominees is that they not view ``justice'' as the majorities did in \nDred Scott and Roe, and that they uphold the standards and timeless \nprinciples so clearly stated in our Constitution.\n  Unfortunately, I do not believe that Mr. White and Mr. Fisher meet \nthose critical standards. During the committee hearings, Mr. Fisher \nfully indicated to me that he would uphold the constitutional and moral \ntravesties of Roe and Planned Parenthood versus Casey. Mr. White has \nalso given answers which strongly suggest that he believes Roe was \ncorrectly decided by the Supreme Court. In addition, Mr. White's \ndubious actions as chairman of a Missouri House committee when a pro-\nlife bill was before it further proves that he would enthusiastically \nenforce the pro-abortion judicial decree of Roe versus Wade.\n  The Framers of our Constitution believed we are endowed by our \nCreator with certain unalienable rights. Roe not only violates the 5th \nand 14th amendments, it violates the first and most fundamental right \nthat we have as human beings and no court, liberal or conservative, can \ntake away that right.\n  As a U.S. Senator, I recognize the awesome responsibility that we \nhave to confirm, or deny, judicial nominees. I recognize the solemn \nobligation that we have to make sure that our Federal courts are filled \nonly with judges who uphold and abide by the transcendent ideals \nexplicitly stated in our Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The \njudges we confirm or deny will be among the greatest and far-reaching \nof our legacies, and I for one do not ever want my legacy to be that I \nconfirmed pro-abortion judges to our Nation's courts.\n  This is why I will not support the nominations of Mr. White and Mr. \nFisher. I will not support any judges who deny the undeniable \nconnection that must exist, in a free and just civilization, between \nhumanity and personhood. Our judges should be the very embodiment of \njustice. How can we then approve of those who will deny justice to most \ndefenseless and innocent of us all?\n  But, further, I would add that these nominees propose a more general \nconcern in that they are liberal activists. In the case of Justice \nWhite, who now serves on the Supreme Court in Missouri, he has \ndemonstrated that he is an activist, and has a political slant to his \nopinions in favor of criminal defendants and against prosecutors. It is \nmy belief that judges should interpret the law, and not impose their \nown political viewpoints.\n  He is strongly opposed by the law enforcement community in Missouri, \nand was directly opposed by the Missouri Association of Police Chiefs \ndue to his activist record.\n  Senator Ashcroft spoke in more detail about Justice White's activist \nrecord. Coming from the same State, Senator Ashcroft is in an even \nbetter position to comment on Justice White's record. But, he laid out \na very disturbing record of judicial activism in Justice White's \ncareer, particularly on law and order matters, and I simply do not \nthink that this is the kind of person we need on the U.S. District \nCourt.\n  With regard to Mr. Fisher, this is a critical slot because of the \nnature of the Ninth Circuit. This circuit has gained such a bad \nreputation for its liberal opinions that it has been referred to as a \n``rogue'' circuit. It is controlled by an extreme liberal element and \nit is important that our appointments to this circuit be people who can \nrestore at least some level of constitutional scrutiny.\n  In the case of Mr. Fisher, this clearly will not be the case. He is \nnot a judge, and therefore, there is not the kind of judicial paper \ntrail that we have with Justice White. However, he has a long record of \nliberal political activism for causes that run contrary to the \nConstitution. If he is willing to thwart the Constitution in his \npolitical activism, what makes us think he will uphold it in his \njudicial opinions. He took an active role in supporting the passage of \nproposition 15 in California regarding registration of handguns. This \nkind of hostility to the second amendment will not make matters any \nbetter on the Ninth Circuit. He very actively supported employment \nbenefits for homosexual partners, and I found him to be very evasive in \nhis responses to questions during the Committee hearings. Given the \nimportance of this circuit and its demonstrated bias toward the left, \nthis nominee, who himself is a liberal activist, is not the right \nperson to help restore some constitutionality to this circuit.\n  So, I would urge my colleagues to vote against these two judges. We \nhave sworn duty to support and defend the Constitution. This is never \nmore critical than when we exercise our advise and consent role for \njudicial nominees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/05/senate-section/article/S11918-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11918-S11920]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n\n                     Nomination of Ronnie L.

Mr. President, I have to say this with my colleagues \npresent. When the full history of Senate treatment of the nomination of \nJustice Ronnie White is understood, when the switches and politics that \ndrove the Republican side of the aisle are known, the people of \nMissouri and the people of the United States will have to judge whether \nthe Senate was unfair to this fine man and whether their votes served \nthe interests of justice and the Federal courts.\n  I am hoping--and every Senator will have to ask himself or herself \nthis question--the United States has not reverted to a time in its \nhistory when there was a color test on nominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I use leader time for 1 minute in response.\n  With regard to nominations, judicial or otherwise, I am sure the \nSenate would never use any basis for a vote other than the \nqualifications and the record of the nominee. And just so the record \nwill be complete, as a matter of fact, of the 19 nominees who have been \nconfirmed this year, 4 of them have been women, 1 of them African \nAmerican, and 3 of them have been Hispanic. Their records and the kind \nof judges these men and women would make are the only things that have \nbeen a factor with the Senate and are the only things that should ever \nbe a factor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the remaining votes in the series be \nlimited to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise to express how saddened I am by \nthe party-line vote against Judge Ronnie White today. I had sincerely \nhoped that today would mark the beginning of a bipartisan attempt to \nclear the backlog of federal judicial nominees and begin to fill the \nvacancies that are rampant throughout the federal judiciary. I was \nmistaken. Instead, we got a party-line vote against a qualified \nminority judge coupled with a continued refusal to schedule votes on \nother qualified minority and women nominees.\n  Judge White is eminently qualified to sit on the federal bench. He is \na distinguished jurist and the first African-American to serve on the \nMissouri Supreme Court. Prior to his service on Missouri's Supreme \nCourt, Judge White served as a State Representative to the Missouri \nLegislature, where he chaired the Judiciary Committee. In his law \npractice, which he continued during his service as a legislator, White \nhandled a variety of civil and criminal matters for mostly low income \nindividuals. His nomination received the support of the St. Louis \nMetropolitan Police Department, the Saint Louis Post Dispatch, and the \nNational Bar Association. He is a fine man who has given his life to \npublic service and he deserved better than what he got from this \nSenate. He deserved better than to be kept waiting 27 months for a \nvote, and then to be used as a political pawn.\n  This vote wasn't about the death penalty. This vote wasn't about law \nand order. This vote was about the unfair treatment of minority \njudicial nominees. This vote tells minority judicial candidates ``do \nnot apply.'' And if you do, you will wait and wait, with no guarantee \nof fairness.\n  Judge Marsha Berzon, for instance, has been kept waiting more than 20 \nmonths for a vote. Judge Richard Paez has been waiting more than 44 \nmonths. These nominees deserve a vote. While I am totally dismayed by \nwhat happened here today with respect to Judge White's nomination, the \nSenate today functioned, albeit in a partisan, political manner.\n  As Chief Justice Rehnquist has recognized: ``The Senate is surely \nunder no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the \nnecessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.'' An \nup-or-down vote, that is all we ask for Berzon and Paez. And, after \nyears of waiting, they deserve at least that much. The Republican \nmajority should not be allowed to cherry-pick among nominees, allowing \nsome to be confirmed in weeks, while letting other nominations languish \nfor years. Accordingly, I vow today, that we Democrats just will not \nallow Paez and Berzon to be forgotten.\n  As I have in the past, I will again move to proceed to the \nnominations of Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon, and I intend to take this \naction again and again should unnamed Senators continue to block a \nvote. Particularly after today's vote, I must say, I find it simply \nbaffling that a Senator would vote against even voting on a judicial \nnomination. Today's actions prove that we all understand that we have a \nconstitutional outlet for antipathy against a judicial nominee--a vote \nagainst that nominee. What the Constitution does not contemplate is for \none or two Senators to grind a nomination to a halt on the basis of a \n``secret'' hold. This cowardly, obstructionist tactic is an anathema to \nthe traditions of the Senate. Thus, today, I implore, one more time, \nevery Senator to follow Senator Leahy's advice, and treat every nominee \n``with dignity and dispatch.'' Lift your holds, and let the Senate vote \non every nomination.\n  The business of judges is the simple but overwhelmingly important \nbusiness of providing equal justice to the poor and to the rich. \nAccordingly, the consequences of this confirmation process are awesome. \nIt is time that we all take it more seriously and it is time that we \nschedule votes on every nominee on the Calendar--including Judge Paez \nand Marsha Berzon. All we are asking of our Republican colleagues is to \ngive these nominees the vote--and hopefully the fair consideration--\nthey deserve. We will press this issue every day and at every \nopportunity until they get that vote.\n  Today is a dark day for the Senate. We have voted down a fully-\nqualified nominee but I hope we can do better in the future and that we \ncan move forward on the Paez and Berzon nominations in a fair and non-\npartisan manner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to congratulate Ray Fisher on his \nSenate confirmation. I will miss Ray and Nancy here in Washington, but \nknow that the Ninth Circuit will greatly benefit from his service \nthere.\n  Finally, I congratulate Ted Stewart on his confirmation and Senators \nHatch and Bennett, who have worked hard to get him confirmed \nexpeditiously. I trust that Mr. Stewart will honor the commitments that \nhe made to the Judiciary Committee to avoid even the appearance of \nimpropriety on matters on which he has worked while in State \ngovernment.\n  I said on the Senate floor last night that this body's recent \ntreatment of women and minority judicial nominees is a badge of shame. \nI feel that we added to that shame with today's vote of Justice Ronnie \nWhite.\n  In their report entitled ``Justice Held Hostage,'' the bipartisan \nTask Force on Federal Judicial Selection from Citizens for Independent \nCourts, co-chaired by Mickey Edwards and Lloyd Cutler, substantiated \nthrough their independent analysis what I have been saying for some \ntime: Women and minority judicial nominations are treated differently \nby this Senate and take longer, are less likely to be voted on and less \nlikely to be confirmed.\n  Judge Richard Paez has been stalled for 44 months, and the nomination \nof Marsha Berzon has been pending for 20 months. Other nominees are \nconfirmed in 2 months.\n  Anonymous Republican Senators continue their secret holds on the Paez \nand Berzon nominations. The Republican majority refuses to vote on \nthose nominations. In fairness, after almost 2 years and almost 4 \nyears, Marsha Berzon and Judge Richard Paez are entitled to a Senate \nvote on their nominations. Vote them up or vote them down, but vote. \nThat is what I have been saying, that is what the Chief Justice \nchallenged the Republican Senate to do back in January 1998.\n  I can assure you that there is no Democratic Senator with a hold on \nJudge Paez or Marsha Berzon. I can assure you that every Democratic \nSenator is willing to go forward with votes on Judge Paez and Marsha \nBerzon now, without delay.\n  Last Friday, Senator Lott committed to trying to ``find a way'' to \nhave these nominations considered by the Senate. I want to help him do \nthat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/05/senate-section/article/S11920-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11920]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before we return to the consideration of \nthe FAA reauthorization bill, I would like to make a couple of \ncomments. Raymond Fisher, just confirmed to the Ninth Circuit, is the \n323rd judge who has been confirmed since President Clinton has been in \noffice. 195 of those judges have been confirmed since Republicans took \ncontrol of the Senate in 1995.\n  Judge Ronnie White is the first nominee, I believe, to be rejected on \nthe floor since Republicans took control of the Senate. One of our \ncolleagues said that he hoped that we are not returning to a ``color \ntest.'' That is what was said. I am offended by that statement. Many \npeople on our side of the aisle didn't know what race Judge White is. \nWe did know that 77 of Missouri's 114 sheriffs were opposed to his \nnomination. We did find out that two State prosecutors' offices raised \ntheir objections. We did know there was a letter from the National \nSheriffs Association opposing his nomination.\n  I believe that we have been very consistent, at least on this side of \nthe aisle. We do not want to confirm a nominee where you have major law \nenforcement organizations and leading officials saying they are opposed \nto the nomination, regardless of what race he or she is. I do not \nbelieve the Senate has ever confirmed anyone when national law \nenforcement organizations or officials have stated that the nominee has \na poor or weak background in law enforcement. To my knowledge, I have \nnever voted to confirm any such nominee, nor have many other members.\n  I want to make it absolutely clear and understood that members voted \nno on Judge White's nomination because of the statements made by law \nenforcement officers, in addition to the respect that we have for the \ntwo Senators from the nominee's state who recommended a no vote. We \nrespect their recommendation to us. So I make mention of that.\n\n  I am bothered that somebody said I hope we are not returning to a \n``color test.'' That statement was uncalled for and, I think, not \nbecoming of the Senate. I want to make sure that point is made.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, will the Senator from Oklahoma yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator. I just want to say a few words not \nin response but maybe in contraposition to what the Senator said.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator. I appreciate that. I will ask my \nquestion.\n  It seems to me that whatever the intentions--I am not impugning any \nintentions of any person who voted the other way, but it seems to me \nthat the recent vote on the floor of the Senate\n\n[[Page S11921]]\n\nis going to create division and animus in this country of ours.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, regular order. I will answer a question. \nIf the Senator wants to make a speech, he can make the speech on his \nown time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will yield back my time to the Senator, retract my \nquestion, and ask unanimous consent that I might speak for 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I didn't know my colleague wanted to engage in this. I \nwas not clear that the Senator wanted to make a speech.\n  I want to say absolutely and positively that there is no ``color \ntest.'' No one raised that suggestion, that I am aware of, during the \nClarence Thomas confirmation. I want to clarify again. I had several \ncolleagues say they did not know what race Mr. White is. I think it is \nvery much uncalled for and incorrect for anybody to make that kind of \nimplication.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises that the pending business \nbefore the Senate is the vote on the Robb amendment. Unless there is \nunanimous consent to move beyond that vote, debate is not in order.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate for 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I respect the right of my friend from New \nYork. In behalf of the Senator from Connecticut, who is waiting, we \nhave pending business we are trying to finish today. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senator from New York be allowed to speak for 3 \nminutes. Hopefully, we can move on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I very much appreciate the courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Without objection, the vote on the Robb amendment is laid aside.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, could I ask for recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona may clarify his \nunanimous consent.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, prior to the Senator from New York being \nrecognized, I ask unanimous consent the vote on or in relation to the \nRobb amendment be postponed, to occur in the next stacked sequence of \nvotes, and, prior to the vote, Senators Robb, Warner, Bryan, and McCain \nbe given 5 minutes each for closing remarks and that the amendment now \nbe laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senators from Arizona, Oklahoma, and \nConnecticut for their courtesy, and the President as well.\n  I would like to make some remarks in contraposition to the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma. I say that without casting any impugning of any \nmotivations as to why people voted.\n  It seems to me that this being, as I understand it, the first time we \nhave this year rejected a Senate candidate on the floor--and I \nunderstand that there were recommendations from the home State--I still \nfind myself very troubled by that rejection. I find myself troubled \nbecause we do need diversity on our bench. We need to, in my judgment, \ntry to have more African Americans on the bench.\n  There is not an African American Member of this body. I find that \nregretful. The first impression I had the first day I walked on the \nfloor was that. And I guess what I would like to do is just call into \nquestion why this nomination was rejected. I would ask that we examine. \nI know one of the reasons was the opposition of this nominee to the \ndeath penalty. I happen to be for the death penalty. I wrote the death \npenalty law when I was in the House. But I would like to ask how many \nother nominees we have rejected because of opposition to the death \npenalty.\n  I am told that one of the Senators who objected from Missouri \nactually nominated judges on that State court who agreed with Ronnie \nWhite on the very case that has been brought into question.\n  So if we are not to be accused of maybe having two standards, I think \nwe ought to be very careful.\n  I respect each Senator's right to oppose nominations for judge. I \nrespect the idea that we often defer to our colleagues in their home \nStates. But I think there is a higher calling here. That is, because \nthis was one of the few African American nominees to reach this floor, \nwe ought to be extra careful to make sure the standard was not being \nused that we haven't used for some other nominees who have come before \nthis body this year.\n  I disagree with that nominee on the issue at hand. But I still think \nthat we should have extra sensitivity, given the long history of \ndivision in this country and the need to try to bring some equality \nonto our bench in the sense that we have a diverse and representative \njudiciary.\n  I hope my colleagues will examine those questions. I do not know the \nanswers to them. But my guess is, we have unanimously approved or \napproved overwhelmingly judges who have the same view as Judge Ronnie \nWhite on this very controversial issue.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. NICKLES. To my knowledge, we have never confirmed a nominee who \nwas opposed by the National Sheriffs Association or by a State \nFederation of Police Chiefs. I don't think we have done that in my \nSenate career.\n  Does the Senator know of any instance where we have ignored the \nrecommendations of major law enforcement officers?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 3 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds to respond to the \nSenator's question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator. I don't know of cases. But I would \nwant to have examined the record about those questions and the \nquestions I asked before we moved so hastily to reject this nominee. It \nso happened that there were votes on the other side in committee for \nthis nominee that abruptly reversed themselves without any explanation \nas to why.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/05/senate-section/article/S11921-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11921-S11932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              AIR TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT ACT--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, \nSenator Bennett, Senator McCain, Senator Rockefeller, and Senator \nHollings.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this proposal that would ground air \ncarriers that do not respond to the Federal Aviation Administration's \nrequest for information about their Y2K status. This information is \nobviously critical not only to Americans who are now making travel \nplans for the millennium period, but to all American businesses that \nrely on safe air transportation to keep their doors open, to pay \nemployees, and to contribute to the national economy.\n  Through our work on the Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology \nProblem, Senator Bennett and I have learned how hard it is for \nAmericans to determine what precautions they should take to prepare for \nthe year 2000. This task has been made unduly onerous by the failure of \ntoo many industries, including the aviation industry, to disclose \ninformation about their Y2K status.\n  The Y2K problem is a national challenge that requires all of us to do \nwhatever it takes to make the transition between this century and the \nnext one safe. The least any of us can do is to respond to surveys \nasking about the status of our Y2K preparations.\n  I suppose that you and others would assume that members of the \nsafety-conscious aviation community would be eager to reassure the \npublic by responding to the FAA's request for information about their \nY2K status. Mr. President, if you made that assumption, unfortunately, \nyou would be wrong.\n  At the committee's hearing last week on transportation and the Y2K \nissue, we learned that 1,900 of the 3,300 certificate holders, which \nincludes air carriers and manufacturers, failed to respond to the FAA's \nrequest. Bear in mind that this survey is only 4 pages long, and the \nFAA estimates it would take 45 minutes to fill it out at an average \ncost of $30. There is no excuse, in my view, for this high rate of \nnonresponsiveness to the FAA's survey inquiry of certificate holders.\n  The FAA did not conduct this survey as a mere exercise. Reviewing a \nY2K survey is often the only way the public can be sure an industry can \nkeep functioning safely into the new year. When such a high percentage \nof the aviation industry fails to respond, the public might as well be \nflying blind.\n  These nonrespondents are mostly smaller carriers and charter \nairlines--not major airlines, I would quickly point out. But all of us \nhave constituents who fly on these small carriers and rely on their \ncargo services. Their failure to respond to the request of their \nregulator is, I think, unacceptable, and I am sure my colleagues do as \nwell.\n  The FAA has given me an updated list of the members of the aviation \nindustry who have not responded to this survey. I made the request, \nalong with the chairman, last Thursday, to give time to the members of \ntheir representative organizations who were in the room until today to \ncomply with that survey. Of the 1,900 who had failed to comply last \nweek, roughly 600 have responded to the survey since last Thursday. The \nlist now contains 1,368 carriers and operators who have not complied \nwith the FAA's survey request on the Y2K issue. I told the people in \nthat hearing that, today, I would submit the names of the air carriers, \nmanufacturers, or others with FAA certificates who have not responded \nto the survey to the Senate and put them in the Congressional Record.\n  Today, I ask unanimous consent that a list of 1,368 carriers and \noperators who have not complied with these surveys be printed in the \nRecord. It lists the States they are from and the names of the \nbusinesses that have not complied. I hope that, in the coming days, \nthese businesses will comply and provide the information to the FAA as \nrequested.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this list at a cost of \n$3,122.00, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S11923]]\n\n\n\n  FAA FLIGHT STANDARDS SERVICE--YEAR 2000 READINESS QUESTIONNAIRE NON-\n                            RESPONDENTS LIST\n                         [As of October 4, 1999]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      State and company name          Designator          Aggregate\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nALASKA:\n    AIR LOGISTICS OF ALASKA INC..

Mr. President, lastly, all of us have a sense of \nresponsibility to our constituents and the people of this country to \nact when we have information that raises concerns about the safety of \nan industry over this new millennium period. Since so many air carriers \ndid not respond to the FAA survey, I have unanswered questions about \nthe safety of these companies to which we deserve the answers. The \nirresponsibility of these carriers and companies that fail to respond \nprompts me to offer this amendment which I have already sent to the \ndesk on behalf of Senator Bennett, myself, Senator McCain, Senator \nHollings, and Senator Rockefeller.\n  We realize the FAA already has the authority to suspend a carrier's \nflying privileges under appropriate circumstances. With this proposal, \nwe want to make it explicit that Y2K noncompliance is one of those \ncircumstances. Under the amendment, any air carrier that does not \nrespond by November 1 to the FAA's request for information about their \nY2K status may be required to surrender its operating certificate. It \nis simple. If you don't comply, you don't fly. The FAA will have the \nauthority to keep you grounded.\n  Air carriers do business not by right, but by privilege. Most fulfill \ntheir responsibilities with distinction, offering services unmatched by \nany country on the face of this Earth.\n  Since the Y2K noncompliance of air carriers may raise safety issues, \nCongress must ensure that the privilege of possessing a certificate can \nbe withdrawn from carriers and manufacturers that fail to give their \nregulator, the FAA, the information that is central to the safety of \nthe flying public. This amendment does just that. We hope it spurs \nthese carriers and manufacturers to respond to the survey before \nNovember 1, and we know it will reassure the public about the safety of \nthe aviation system as we enter this new millennium, just 87 days away.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the chairman of the full committee is \nhere. On the Democratic side, the amendment is acceptable, and I \nbelieve that is the case on the Republican side, but I will let the \nchairman of the full committee speak for himself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut for \nhis usual perspective on an important issue that had escaped the \nattention of this committee, and it is an important issue. His \ninvolvement in the Y2K issue clearly indicates he is qualified to \ndiscuss this issue, and this amendment will be extremely helpful. I \nthank the Senator from Connecticut.\n  I believe there is no further debate on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2241), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, for the benefit of my colleagues, we are \nworking through most of the amendments. We are close except for a \ncouple. We have a number that have been agreed to. I would like to \nclear some that have been agreed to by both sides.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2256\n\n (Purpose: to establish a commission to study the airline industry and \n    to recommend policies to ensure consumer information and choice)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

and\n       (ii) the effect on consumers of the use by the airline \n     industry of penalties and promotions to convince distributors \n     to use such systems, and the degree of consumer awareness of \n     such penalties and promotions.\n       (4) Legal impediments to distributors seeking relief for \n     anticompetitive actions.--The policies of the United States \n     with respect to the legal impediments to distributors seeking \n     relief for anticompetitive actions, including--\n       (A) Federal preemption of civil actions against airlines;

Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto en bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 1911, 1897, 1914, and 2238) were agreed to.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an amendment to \nS. 82, the Air Transport Improvement Act. This amendment will establish \na commission to study the future of the travel agent industry and \ndetermine the consumer impact of airline interaction with travel \nagents.\n  Since the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 was enacted, major \nairlines have controlled pricing and distribution policies of our \nnation's domestic air transportation system. Over the past four years, \nthe airlines have reduced airline commissions to travel agents in an \ncompetitive effort to reduce costs.\n  I am concerned the impact of today's business interaction between \nairlines and travel agents may be a driving force that will force many \ntravel agents out of business. Combined with the competitive emergence \nof Internet services, these practices may be harming an industry that \nemploys over 250,000 Americans.\n  This amendment will explore these concerns through the establishment \nof a commission to objectively review the emerging trends in the \nairline ticket distribution system. Among airline consumers there is a \ngrowing concern that airlines may be using their market power to limit \nhow airline tickets are distributed.\n  Mr. President, if we lose our travel agents, we lose a competitive \ncomponent to affordable air fare. Travel agents provide a much needed \nservice and without, the consumer is the loser.\n  The current use of independent travel agencies as the predominate \nmethod to distribute tickets ensures an efficient and unbiased source \nof information for air travel. Before deregulation, travel agents \nhandled only about 40% of the airline ticket distribution system. Since \nderegulation, the complexity of the ticket pricing system created the \nneed for travel agents resulting in travel agents handling nearly 90% \nof transactions.\n  Therefore, the travel agent system has proven to be a key factor to \nthe success of airline deregulation. I'm afraid, however, that the \ndemise of the independent travel agent would be a factor of \nderegulation's failure if the major airlines succeed in dominating the \nticket distribution system.\n  Travel agents and other independent distributors comprise a \nconsiderable portion of the small business sector in the United States. \nThere are 33,000 travel agencies employing over 250,000 people. Women \nor minorities own over 505 of travel agencies.\n  The assault on travel agents has been fierce. Since 1995, commissions \nhave been reduced by 30%, 14% for domestic travel alone in 1998. Since \n1995, travel agent commissions have been reduced from an average of \n10.8% to 6.9% in 1998. Travel agencies are failing in record numbers.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important to study this issue as well as \nthe related issues of the current state of ticket distribution \nchannels, the importance of an independent system on small, regional, \nstart-up carriers, and the role of the Internet. I would like to ask my \ncolleagues to support this important amendment.\n\n\n                        dekalb-peachtree airport\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, will the distinguished chairman of the \nSenate Commerce Committee yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be happy to yield to the senior Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the DeKalb-Peachtree Airport is the \nsecond busiest airport in Georgia, and this level of activity makes \nliving and working in this area noisy and dangerous. Businesses cannot \nexpand, and poorer residents cannot afford to move until a government \nbuy-out of these properties is completed. The Federal Aviation \nAdministration, commonly referred to as the FAA, has done studies which \nshow that increased operations at Dekalb-Peachtree Airport are too \nnoisy and unsafe for residents and businesses in the northern vicinity \nof the airport. While the FAA has provided some relief and been helpful \nin the purchasing of some homes, there needs to be a speedy conclusion \nto this buy-out process in order to allow these homes and businesses to \nmove to safer areas and give the airport the room it requires to meet \nan ever-increasing demand. Additional FAA funding is needed as soon as \npossible. to complete this task, would the Chairman be willing provide \nadditional federal funding in the FAA reauthorization bill to address \nthis situation?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I appreciate the efforts of the senior Senator from \nGeorgia on behalf of his constituents and for bringing this matter to \nthe attention of the Senate at the beginning of this Congress. As the \nSenator may know, there are a number of businesses and\n\n[[Page S11932]]\n\nresidents located near other airports across the country in a similar \nsituation to what is occurring at the Dekalb-Peachtree Airport. The \nCommerce Committee has authorized a significant increase in noise \nmitigation funding for the FAA to address this problem and accelerate \nthe buy-out process.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the chairman for his assistance. My staff and \nI look forward to working with him and the junior Senator from Georgia \non this important matter.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Will the chairman yield for another question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be happy to yield to the junior Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, the noise mitigation funding which this \nbill authorizes is very much needed--and appreciated--by communities \nlocated near our nation's airports. Over 10 years ago, Georgia's second \nbusiest airport, Dekalb-Peachtree Airport, began a runway expansion \nprogram to accommodate its increased traffic. Six years ago, the FAA \nbegan providing funding to relocate the residential homes located in \nthe Airport's Runway Protection Zone. Thanks to noise mitigation money, \n108 homes have had the opportunity to relocate. Unfortunately, after a \ndecade, 58 homes and 61 businesses are still in limbo, and still \nimpacted by the noise from 225,000 flights a year. This community near \nAtlanta--and I am sure there are communities in similar straights in \nArizona--has suffered for years, because the buy-out has gone on far \ntoo long. Don't you agree that in determining the need for noise money, \nthe FAA should take into consideration the harmful, drawn-out impact on \ncommunities from long-standing projects which have awaited completion \nover a number of years?\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator is correct. As the Senator knows, in the \nreport accompanying the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization \nbill, the Commerce Committee, at the instigation of the Junior Senator \nfrom Georgia, urges the FAA to take into consideration the negative \nimpact on communities, like DeKalb County, of such unresolved long-\nstanding projects when allocating noise mitigation money.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the chairman for his remarks, and I look forward \nto continuing to work with the Senator from Arizona and my colleague \nfrom Georgia to complete the Dekalb-Peachtree Airport buy-out.\n\n\n                           louisville airport\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I want to express my hope that Senators \nMcCain and Gorton will work to include language in the conference \nreport accompanying S. 82, which is of great importance to the Regional \nAirport Authority of Louisville and Jefferson County, KY. I would like \nto provide a brief explanation of the need for this provision and what \nit is intended to accomplish.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for his support of the \nlegislation and we are pleased to hear his views on this provision.\n  Mr. BUNNING. In 1991, the Regional Airport Authority of Louisville \nand Jefferson County entered into a letter of intent (LOI) with the \nFederal Aviation Administration for funding from the Airport \nImprovement Program for an ambitious expansion of the Louisville \nAirport. The LOI was for $126 million. When the new east runway was \ncompleted in 1995 and ready for operation, Louisville was informed that \nno funds were available in the FAA Facilities and Equipment Account \n(F) to provide an Instrument Landing System (ILS), thus rendering the \nnew runway inoperative. FAA advised Louisville that if they procured \nthe ILS, the FAA would later reimburse them for the expenditure of \n$5.68 million for the system.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I can appreciate the demands on the F account for these \nexpenditures and can well understand how such a regrettable situation \nmight occur.\n  Mr. BUNNING. We currently have a confusing situation where the FAA \nhas informed Louisville that $4.2 million in funds drawn down against \nthe LOI in 1998 were for reimbursement for the ILS.\n  Mr. McCAIN. As the Senator knows, the FAA routinely provides safety \nand navigational equipment to airports.\n  Mr BUNNING. Yes, indeed. That is precisely the purpose of the \nlanguage. The $4.2 million the FAA designated as reimbursement is money \nthe Louisville Airport would have received under the $126 million LOI \nanyway. The provision in the legislation simply directs the FAA to \namend the existing LOI with the Regional Airport Authority to increase \nit by $5.68 million, thus reimbursing Louisville the total cost of the \nILS.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is my understanding that a similar provision was \nincluded in the Statement of Managers accompanying the Transportation \nappropriations legislation for fiscal year 2000.\n  Mr. BUNNING. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator for his description of the situation, \nand I will be happy to continue to work to rectify this matter.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I thank the Senators for their assistance.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Stevens, I ask \nunanimous consent that Dan Elwell, a congressional fellow in Senator \nStevens' office, be granted the privilege of the floor for the pendency \nof the Senate consideration of S. 82.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding the agreement of yesterday referencing the filing of \namendments, Senator Fitzgerald be recognized and that it be in order \nfor him to offer an amendment not previously filed, and that the \namendment then be agreed to. Prior to that, if it is agreeable with \nSenator Fitzgerald, Senator Ashcroft wants to have 5 minutes to make a \nstatement. I ask unanimous consent that prior to that, Senator Ashcroft \nhave 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/05/senate-section/article/S11932-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11932-S11933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF RONNIE WHITE\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for \naffording me this opportunity to make some remarks regarding the vote \non the nomination of Ronnie White.\n  Yesterday, in accordance with the unanimous consent agreement entered \ninto last week, we set aside substantially over an hour to debate not \nonly the White nomination but a number of other nominations which came \nbefore the Senate today. I was here for that debate, I engaged in that \ndebate, and I outlined my opposition to Judge White, not my opposition \nbased on anything personal or based on my distaste in any way for the \njudge, but based on my real reservations about his record as it relates \nto law enforcement.\n  After the conclusion of the vote today, there were a number of \nindividuals who secured integrals of time to speak about that \nnomination and about that vote and raised questions that more properly \nshould have been raised in the debate, and, secondly, deserve a \nresponse. So I come to respond in that respect.\n  I want to explain why I believe Judge White should not have been \nconfirmed, and I believe the Senate acted favorably and appropriately \nin protecting the strong concerns raised by law enforcement officials.\n  The National Sheriffs Association expressed their very serious \nopposition to the nomination of Judge White. The Missouri Federation of \nChiefs of Police expressed their opposition. The Missouri Sheriffs \nAssociation raised strong concerns and asked for a very serious \nconsideration. In my conferences with law enforcement officials, \nprosecutors and judges, they raised serious concerns; so that when \nthose who come to the floor today talk about this nomination in a \ncontext that is personal rather than professional and is political \nrather than substantive, I think they miss the point.\n  There are very serious matters addressed in his record that deserve \nthe attention of the Senate and which, once having been reviewed by \nMembers of the Senate, would lead Senators to the conclusion that, \nindeed, the Senate did the right thing.\n  Judge White's sole dissent in the Missouri v. Johnson, a brutal cop \nkiller, an individual who killed three law enforcement officials over \nseveral hours, holding a small town in Missouri in a terrified \ncondition, that opinion which sought to create new ground for allowing \nconvicted killers who had the death\n\n[[Page S11933]]\n\npenalty ordered in their respect, allowing them new ground for new \ntrials, and the like, is something that ought to trouble us. We do not \nneed judges with a tremendous bent toward criminal activity or with a \nbent toward excusing or providing second chances or opportunities for \nthose who have been accused in those situations.\n  Missouri v. Kinder is another case where he was the sole dissenter, a \ncase of murder and assault, murder with a lead pipe, the defendant was \nseen leaving the scene of the crime with the lead pipe and DNA evidence \nconfirming the presence of the defendant with the person murdered.\n  The judge in that case wrote a dissent saying that the case was \ncontaminated by a racial bias of the trial judge because the trial \njudge had indicated that he opposed affirmative action and had switched \nparties based on that.\n  Another case, Missouri v. Damask, a drug checkpoint case. The sole \ndissent in the case was from Judge White who would have expanded \nsubstantially the rights of defendants to object to searches and \nseizures.\n  I believe that law enforcement officials had an appropriate, valid, \nreasonable concern. That concern was appropriately recognized and \nreflected in the vote of the Senate. Not only Missouri needs judges, \nbut the entire country needs judges whose law enforcement experience is \nsuch that it sends a signal that they are reliable and will support \nappropriate law enforcement.\n  I am grateful to have had this opportunity. No time was expected for \ndebate on this issue today, and as an individual who was involved in \nthis matter, I am pleased to have had this opportunity. I thank the \nSenate. I thank the Senator from Arizona for helping make this time \navailable to me.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/05/senate-section/article/S11933-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             AIR TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT ACT--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, recent comments by a political figure have \nunfairly and, I think, unjustly castigated American churches and \nmillions of American church-goers as ``. . . a sham and a crutch for \nweak-minded people who need strength in numbers. [meaning organized \nreligion] tells people to go out and stick their noses in other \npeople's business.'' Now these comments are being defended as the kind \nof outspoken honesty that people really seek in a politician. While I \nam totally in favor of greater candor from politicians, particularly in \nthese days of poll-driven and consultant-drafted mealy-mouthed pap \nmasquerading as ``vision,'' I am emphatically not in favor of rudeness. \nThere is far too much rude and divisive talk in this Nation these days, \nand it only exacerbates the kind of climate that encourages acts of \nviolence against anyone who is different or any organization that is \nnot mainstream--or maybe even if it is mainstream, as churches are \nstill mainstream, at least in my part of the world. We cannot and \nshould not let this kind of meanness be excused in the name of honesty \nand candor.\n  I do not question anyone's right to voice his opinion, whether I \nagree with it or not, but I also do not believe it is necessary to \ndemean or belittle or denigrate anyone in the process of voicing an \nopinion. I am pleased to see that I am not alone in my outrage, but \nthat many people have expressed similar feelings. I hope that we can \nall learn a lesson from this episode.\n  All of us ask for guidance from those we trust whenever we are faced \nwith difficult problems. We ask our parents, or our wives, we ask our \nhusbands, or our friends. So what is wrong with seeking the advice of \nsomeone who has\n\n[[Page S11934]]\n\nseen more troubles and received more training in counseling than \nourselves--someone who has a calling, a passion, for this role? Someone \nsuch as our pastor or priest or minister? Or what is wrong with asking \nthe One who knows and shares all of our troubles--in asking the Creator \nfor guidance and support? What is wrong with asking ourselves, ``What \nwould Jesus do?'' There is nothing wrong with using the spiritual \nguidance provided to us from God and His Son, and tested over nearly \n2,000 years of human experience. It is not weak-minded. It is not \nsheep-like to grow up within a framework of faith and to celebrate the \nrituals of the church. It does not mean that one has a weakness and \nneeds organized religion to ``strengthen oneself.''\n  Churches across this Nation provide millions of strong people with \nspiritual, emotional, and physical support. People who are active in \ntheir church may literally count their blessings when disaster strikes \nthem. Be it the sudden loss of a loved one, a fire, a flood, that \nperson will find himself surrounded with caring friends and helping \nhands. Insurance may provide a sense of financial security, but no \nmatter whose good hands your insurance may be in, an insurance company \ncannot hold your hand and offer a shoulder to lean on while your home \nis reduced to smoky ruins or washed downstream in a flood. A pastor, a \npriest, a minister, or friend from your church can do so, and will do \nso. And people in your church will offer you the clothes off of their \nbacks, or a place to stay, or food to eat when you are hungry, or help \nin many other small ways that are a balm on a hurting soul. Instead of \nfacing your loss alone, help arrives in battalions.\n  Churches have become, in many ways, the new centers of community in \nAmerica. We live in ever-expanding suburbs. We spend long hours each \nday commuting to jobs miles from our homes. Our children ride buses to \ndistant schools that may combine many neighborhoods or even many \ncommunities.\n  We may rarely see our neighbor, or may know the neighbor only to nod \nat as we back our cars out of our driveways. Air conditioning, \ntelevision, and other amenities have taken the place of sitting on the \nfront porch with a glass of lemonade. Now, if we are outside, we are \nlikely on a deck in the back yard, hidden by a fence or a hedge from \nthe prying eyes of our unseen neighbors. But in church on Sunday, one \nis encouraged to shake a neighbor's hand. One is asked to pray for \nneighbors who are sick or in distress. And one hears the word of God--a \nName that is above all other names--and participates in the observance \nof the liturgy that binds all of us in a seamless lineage to the \nheritage of man.\n  Churches are not for the weak-minded, Mr. President. They are for the \nstrong. They are for people who are not afraid to seek guidance, not \nafraid to show charity, not afraid to practice kindness. Tolerance for \nthe beliefs of others is one of the cornerstones on which this Nation \nis founded, and we in public life would be well-advised to remember \nthat.\n  Let me close these remarks, Mr. President, with a passage from George \nWashington's Farewell Address. Mr. President, George Washington, \ncommander of the American forces at Valley Forge, was not a weak-minded \nman. George Washington, the first President of the United States--and \nthe greatest President of all--was not a weak-minded man. Let's share \nwhat he had to say about religion. We might even class George \nWashington as a politician.\n  Here is what George Washington said. I suggest that all take note.\n\n       Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political \n     prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. \n     In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who \n     should labor to subvert these great pillars of human \n     happiness, these firmest props of the duties of men and \n     citizens.\n\n  Let me digress briefly to suggest that all politicians, whether at \nthe State or local or national level, take note of what George \nWashington said.\n\n       The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to \n     respect and to cherish them. A volume could not trace all \n     their connections with private and public felicity. Let it \n     simply be asked, where is the security for property, for \n     reputation, for life, if the sense of religious obligation \n     desert the oaths which are the instruments of investigation \n     in courts of justice? And let us with caution indulge the \n     supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. \n     Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined \n     education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and \n     experience both forbid us to expect, that national morality \n     can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I had no intention to speak on this matter. \nIt is purely coincidence--one might even suggest the hand of the \nAlmighty--that caused me just a few minutes ago to read a column that \nappeared in the Boston Globe in this particular case, a column that \npicks up on the very theme the distinguished senior Senator from West \nVirginia has addressed this afternoon.\n  I will read the column into the Congressional Record. I have rarely \never done this, but I found this column so compelling. It corresponds \nvery much to the eloquent words of our colleague from West Virginia and \nthe compelling words of our first American President, George \nWashington.\n  First of all, we live in a wonderful country that allows people to \nexpress their views, whether they be public people or not. The Governor \nof Minnesota has expressed his views in a national publication that \ncomes to the issue of organized religion. He certainly is entitled to \nhis views, but I think for those of us who disagree with him and, in \nfact, as public persons, we bear responsibility to challenge those \nwords when they are offensive to millions of Americans, be they \nChristians, Jews, Muslims, whether or not people who practice their \nreligion in a church, a synagogue, or a mosque. There is every reason \nto believe that organized religion, if you will, has contributed \nsignificantly to the strength and well-being of the Nation.\n  This morning, in a column by E.J. Dionne called the Gospel of Jesse \nVentura, he quotes the statements made by the Governor of Minnesota in \nwhich the Governor said:\n\n       Organized religion is a sham and a crutch for weak-minded \n     people who need strength in numbers. It tells people to go \n     out and stick their noses in other people's business.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, the column:\n\n       Well, Governor, I have to hand it to you. You've told us \n     over and over that you say what's on your mind and, because \n     of that, you're unlike the average politician. This statement \n     definitely justifies all your self-congratulation.\n       Because you're so honest and tough-minded, I figured you \n     wouldn't mind answering a few questions about your comments. \n     I ask them because none of your explanations after the \n     interview helped me understand your meaning. Perhaps I'm \n     thick-headed and you can bring me to your level of \n     enlightenment.\n       Martin Luther King Jr. was a pastor who led the Southern \n     Christian Leadership Conference. He organized church people \n     to fight for justice. Many who opposed him thought he was \n     sticking his nose into other people's business. In his first \n     major civil rights sermon at the Holt Street Baptist Church \n     in Montgomery, Ala., he declared: ``If we are wrong, Jesus of \n     Nazareth was merely a utopian dreamer and never came down to \n     earth! If we are wrong, justice is a lie!''\n       Please tell me, Governor, I want to know: Was Martin Luther \n     King Jr. ``weak-minded'' for working through ``organized \n     religion''? While you're at it, were all those civil rights \n     activists, so many motivated by religious faith, ``weak-\n     minded'' for risking their lives in the struggle?\n       Rabbi Abraham Heschel was a brilliant theologian and wrote \n     about the Hebrew prophets. He was moved by his sense of the \n     prophetic to become a leading ally of King's battle for \n     equality. Was he weak-minded?\n       Dietrich Bonhoffer was a German theologian moved by his \n     faith to oppose Hitler. He went to prison and was eventually \n     killed. ``I have discovered,'' he wrote a few weeks before \n     his execution, ``that only by living fully in the world can \n     we learn to have faith.'' Was Dietrich Bonhoffer using his \n     faith as a ``sham and a crutch?''\n       The Polish workers of the Solidarity trade union movement, \n     inspired by faith and helped immensely by their ``organized \n     religion,'' faced down the Communist dictatorship in Poland. \n     They risked jail and beatings and helped change the world. \n     Was that weak-minded of them?\n       What about those theologians who thought through religious \n     questions and the meaning of life on behalf of all those \n     churchy souls you say need crutches? Were Augustine and \n     Aquinas weak-minded? Were Luther and Calvin? What about 20th-\n     century prophets such as Reinhold Niebuhr and Martin Buber? \n     They were towering intellects, I've always thought, but \n     perhaps I'm blind and you can help me see.\n       I respect and admire the courage you demonstrated in \n     serving our country as a Navy SEAL. But just out of \n     curiosity: Do you think the military chaplains you met were \n     weak-minded?\n\n[[Page S11935]]\n\n       Father Andrew Greeley, the sociologist, has found that \n     ``relationships related to religion'' are clearly the major \n     forces mobilizing volunteers in America. We're talking here \n     about mentors for children, volunteers in homeless programs, \n     those who give comfort at shelters for battered women. Are \n     all these good volunteers just seeking strength in numbers?\n       While you were making money wrestling, Mother Teresa was \n     devoting her life to the poor of Calcutta. Maybe you think \n     she would have been better off in the ring with Disco \n     Inferno.\n       I don't want to get too personal, but I truly want to know \n     what you're trying to tell us. The nuns who taught me in \n     grade school and the Benedictine monks who taught me in high \n     school devoted the whole of their lives to helping young \n     people learn. Was their dedication to others a sign of \n     weakness? The parish I grew up in was full of parents--my own \n     included--whose religious faith motivated them to build a \n     strong community that nurtured us kids. I guess you're \n     telling me those parents I respected were only seeking \n     strength in numbers.\n       Somewhere around 100 million Americans attend religious \n     services in any given week. Sociologists agree we are one of \n     the most religiously observant countries in the world, \n     especially compared to other wealthy nations. Are we a weak-\n     minded country?\n       In explaining your comments afterward, you said: ``This is \n     Playboy; they want you to be provocative.'' Does that mean \n     you would have said something different to the editors of, \n     say, Christianity Today?\n       And, Governor, one last question: Are you tough-minded \n     enough to understand the meaning of the words: ``Your act is \n     wearing thin?''\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/05/senate-section/article/S11935-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ART FROM THE HEART\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thought I would use this time, before \nwe go forward in the Senate with some additional votes, to speak on two \nmatters. I am actually waiting for a few visuals, or pictures, I want \nto show regarding what I am going to say.\n  First of all, let me thank a pretty amazing group of young people \nfrom my State of Minnesota for coming all the way here to Washington, \nDC. These are high school students, and they have brought, if you will, \nart that is from the heart. It is an art display that will be on \nexhibit in the rotunda of the Russell Senate Office Building.\n  This month of October is an awareness of domestic violence month. \nPeople in the country should understand, if they don't already, that \nabout every 13 seconds, a woman is battered in her home--about every 13 \nseconds.\n  A home should be a safe place for women and children. What these \nstudents have done is--and I first saw their display at the Harriet \nTubman Center back home in Minnesota--they have presented some art \nthat, as I say, is really from the heart. This artwork, in the most \npowerful way, deals with the devastating impact of violence in homes, \nnot only on women and adults but on children as well.\n  Quite often, we have debates out here on the floor of the Senate \nabout the negative impact of television violence, or violence in \nmovies, on children. The fact is that for too many children--maybe as \nmany as 5 million children in our country--they don't need to turn on \nthe TV or go to a movie to see the violence; they see the violence in \ntheir homes.\n  We will have this really marvelous display of art by these students \nfrom Minnesota, and it will be in the Russell rotunda on display this \nweek. Tonight, for other Senators, at 6:30, there will be a reception \nfor these students. They should be honored for their fine work.\n  Mr. President, I commend Mr. Dionne. His words speak eloquently to \nthe emotions and feelings of many of us. Again, I respect the Governor \nof Minnesota in expressing his views, but we certainly have an \nobligation to express ours. E.J. Dionne has expressed them well with \nthis Member of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/05/senate-section/article/S11935-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11935-S11936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DISSIDENTS DISAPPEARING IN BELARUS\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the government of Belarus has \nsystematically intimidated and punished members of opposition political \ngroups for several years now. Ordinary citizens--some as young as \nfifteen--have been beaten, arrested, and charged with absurd criminal \noffenses all because they dared to speak out against the President of \nBelarus, Alex Lukashenko, and his crushing of basic human rights and \ncivil liberties there.\n  Recently, however, events have grown worse. Four dissidents, closely \nwatched by the government's omnipresent security police have vanished. \nThe government says it has no clues as to why. Up until now, the \nPresident only beat and jailed his opponents. The President now appears \nto be behind a series of disappearances by key opposition figures since \nApril, as reported in the New York Times. Last week, the State \nDepartment said that it was greatly concerned about the pattern of \ndisappearances and urged the government of Belarus to find and protect \nthose who had vanished. The disappearances coincide with the strongest \ncampaign yet launched by Belarus's pro-democracy movement to press the \ngovernment for reforms.\n  The first person to disappear was the former chairwoman of the \nCentral Bank (Tamara Vinnikova). She publicly supported the former \nprime minister, an opposition candidate, and was being held on trumped \nup charges under house arrest with an armed guard at the time she \nvanished. That she was held under house arrest, guarded at all times by \nlive-in KGB agents, her telephone calls and visitors strictly screened, \nstrongly suggests that her disappearance was orchestrated by the \nauthorities.\n  In May, Yuri Zakharenka, a former interior minister and an opposition \nactivist, disappeared as he was walking home. He was last seen bundled \ninto a car by a group of unidentified men. His wife said for two weeks \nprior to his abduction, he had complained of being tailed by two cars.\n  At the height of protests in July, another opposition leader, speaker \nof the illegally disbanded parliament, fled to Lithuania, saying that \nhe feared for his life.\n  Then two weeks ago, Victor Gonchar, a leading political dissident, \nand his friend, a publisher, vanished on an evening outing, even though \nMr. Gonchar was under constant surveillance by the security police. \nGonchar's wife reportedly contacted city law enforcement agencies, \nlocal hospitals and morgues without result. The government maintains \nthat it has no information on his whereabouts. Mr. Gonchar has been \ninstrumental in selecting an opposition delegation to OSCE-mediated \ntalks with the government, and was scheduled to meet with the U.S. \nambassador to Belarus on September 20. Earlier this year, police \nviolently assaulted and arrested him on charges of holding an illegal \nmeeting in a private cafe, for which he served ten days in jail.\n  Before President Lukashenko came to office in 1994, one could see \nimprovements in the human rights situation in Belarus. Independent \nnewspapers emerged, and ordinary citizens started openly expressing \ntheir views and ideas, opened associations and began to organize. The \nparliament became a forum for debate among parties with differing \npolitical agendas. The judiciary also began to operate more \nindependently.\n  After Mr. Lukashenko was elected president, he extended his term and \nreplaced the elected Parliament with his own hand-picked legislators in \na referendum in 1996, universally condemned as rigged. Since then, he \nhas held fast to his goal of strengthening his dictatorship. He has \nruthlessly sought to control and subordinate most aspects of public \nlife, both in government and in society, cracking down on the media, \npolitical parties and grass roots movements. Under the new \nconstitution, he overwhelming dominates other branches of government, \nincluding the parliament and judiciary.\n  The first president of democratic Belarus, Stanislav Shushkevich, and \nnow in the opposition, said recently that the government is resorting \nto state terrorism by abducting and silencing dissidents. He said, \n``the regime has gone along the path of eliminating the leaders against \nwhom it can't open even an artificial case. This is done with the goal \nof strengthening the dictatorship.''\n  I am deeply concerned that comments by senior government officials\n\n[[Page S11936]]\n\nthis past week which betray official indifference to those \ndisappearances.\n  I urge President Lukashenko to use all available means at his \ndisposal to locate the four missing--and to ensure the safety and \nsecurity of all living in Belarus, regardless of their political views. \nWhat is happening in Belarus now is an outrage. The world is watching \nwhat President Lukashenko does to address it.\n  Mr. President, I want the Government of Belarus to know that their \nblatant violation of the human rights of citizens is unacceptable. The \nreport several days ago of four prominent men and women who have had \nthe courage to stand up against this very repressive Government of \nBelarus raises very serious questions. As a Senator, I want to speak \nfrom the floor and condemn that Government's repressive actions. I want \nto make it clear to the Government of Belarus that these actions, the \nrepression and violation of citizens' rights in Belarus, is \nunacceptable, I think, to every single Senator.\n  I think many of us in the human rights community are very worried \nabout whether or not they are still alive. I would not want the \nGovernment of Belarus to think they can engage in this kind of \nrepressive activity with impunity. That is why I speak about this on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/05/senate-section/article/S11936-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ECONOMIC CONVULSION IN AGRICULTURE\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

For those of us in agricultural States, this is very \nimportant. I want to signal to colleagues that I will look for an \nopportunity, and the first opportunity I get, I will try to do \neverything I can to focus our attention on what can only be described \nas a depression in agriculture. I will try to focus the attention of \npeople in the Senate, Democrats and Republicans alike, on the \ntransition that is now taking place in agriculture, which I think, if \nit runs its full course, we will deeply regret as a Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/05/senate-section/article/S11936-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11936-S11949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             AIR TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT ACT--Continued\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

I join with Senator Leahy and Senator Thurmond in \nproposing this amendment, which will provide law enforcement with a \npotent weapon in the fight to protect the safety of the traveling \npublic. This is one piece of legislation which could truly help save \nhundreds of lives.\n  Current federal law does not specifically address the growing problem \nof the use of unapproved, uncertified, fraudulent, defective or \notherwise unsafe aviation parts in civil, military and public aircraft. \nThose who traffic in this potentially lethal trade have thus far been \nprosecuted under a patchwork of Federal criminal statutes which are not \nadequate to deter the conduct involved. Most subjects prosecuted to \ndate have received little of no jail time, and relatively minor fines \nhave been assessed. Moreover, law enforcement has not had the tools to \nprevent these individuals from reentering the trade or to seize and \ndestroy stockpiles of unsafe parts.\n  While the U.S. airline industry can take pride in the safety record \nthey have achieved thus far, trade in fraudulent and defective aviation \nparts is a growing problem which could jeopardize that record. These \nsuspect parts are not only readily available throughout the country, \nthey are being installed on aircraft as we speak. This problem will \ncontinue to grow as our fleet of commercial and military aircraft \ncontinues to age. Safe replacement parts are vital to the safety of \nthis fleet. When you consider that one Boeing 747 has about 6 million \nparts, you begin to understand the potential for harm caused by the \ndistribution of fraudulent and defective parts.\n  Where do these parts come from? Some are used or scrap parts which \nshould be destroyed, or have not been properly repaired. Others are \nsimply counterfeit parts using substandard materials unable to \nwithstand the rigors imposed through daily use on a modern aircraft. \nSome are actually scavenged from among the wreckage and broken bodies \nstrewn about after an airplane crash. For example, when American \nAirlines Flight 965 crashed into a mountain in Columbia in 1995, it \nwasn't long before some of the parts from that aircraft wound up back \nin\n\n[[Page S11937]]\n\nthe United States and resold as new by an unscrupulous Miami dealer who \nhad obtained them through the black market.\n  While the danger to passengers and civilians on the ground is \nsubstantial, this danger also jeopardizes the courageous men and women \nof our armed forces. The Army is increasingly buying commercial off-\nthe-shelf aircraft and parts for their growing small jet and piston-\nengine passenger and cargo fleets. The Department of Defense will buy \n196 such aircraft by 2005 and virtually every major commercial \npassenger aircraft is in the Air Force fleet, although the military \ndesignation is different. In addition, there are dozens of specially \nconfigured commercial aircraft that have frame modifications to serve \nspecial missions, such as reconnaissance and special operations forces. \nThe safety of all of these vehicles is dependent on the quality of the \nparts used to repair them and keep them flying.\n\n  The amendment we have proposed will criminalize: (1.) The knowing \nfalsification or concealment of a material fact relating to the \naviation quality of a part; (2.) The knowing making of a fraudulent \nmisrepresentation concerning the aviation quality of a part; (3.) the \nexport, import, sale, trade or installation of any part where such \ntransaction was accomplished by means of a fraudulent certification or \nother representation concerning the aviation quality of a part; (4.) An \nattempt or conspiracy to do the same.\n  The penalty for a violation will be up to 15 years in prison and a \nfine of up to $250,000, however, if that part is actually installed, \nthe violator will face up to 25 years and a fine of $500,000. And if \nthe part fails to operate as represented and serious bodily injury or \ndeath results, the violator can face up to life in prison and a \n$1,000,000 fine. Organizations committing a violation will be subject \nto fines of up to $25,000,000.\n  In addition to the enhanced criminal penalties created, the \nDepartment of Justice may also seek reasonable restraining orders \npending the disposition of actions brought under the section, and may \nalso seek to remove convicted persons from engaging in the business in \nthe future and force the destruction of suspect parts. Criminal \nforfeiture of proceeds and facilitating property may also be sought. \nThe Attorney General is also given the authority to issue subpoenas for \nthe purpose of facilitating investigations into the trafficking of \nsuspect parts, and wiretaps may be obtained where appropriate.\n  This amendment is supported by Attorney General Reno, Secretary \nSlater, Secretary Cohen and NASA Administrator Goldin, and OMB has \nindicated that this amendment is in accord with the President's \nprogram. I ask my fellow Senators to join with Senators Leahy, Thurmond \nand me in supporting this important piece of legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that relevant material, including a copy of \nthe amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Office of the Attorney General,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Enclosed is proposed legislation, ``The \n     Aircraft Safety Act of 1999.'' This is part of the \n     legislative program of the Department of Justice for the \n     first session of the 106th Congress. This legislation would \n     safeguard United States aircraft, space vehicles, passengers, \n     and crewmembers from the dangers posed by the installation of \n     nonconforming, defective, or counterfeit parts in civil, \n     public, and military aircraft. During the 105th Congress, \n     similar legislation earned strong bi-partisan support, as \n     well as the endorsement of the aviation industry.\n       The problems associated with fraudulent aircraft and \n     spacecraft parts have been explored and discussed for several \n     years. Unfortunately, the problems have increased while the \n     discussions have continued. Since 1993, federal law \n     enforcement agencies have secured approximately 500 criminal \n     indictments for the manufacture, distribution, or \n     installation of nonconforming parts. During that same period, \n     the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) received 1,778 \n     reports of suspected unapproved parts, initiated 298 \n     enforcement actions, and issued 143 safety notices regarding \n     suspect parts.\n       To help combat this problem, an interagency Law \n     Enforcement/FAA working group was established in 1997. \n     Members include the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); \n     the Office of the Inspector General, Department of \n     Transportation; the Defense Criminal Investigative Service; \n     the Office of Special Investigations, Department of the Air \n     Force; the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, Department \n     of the Navy; the Customs Service, Department of the Treasury; \n     the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and the \n     FAA. The working group quickly identified the need for \n     federal legislation that targeted the problem of suspect \n     aircraft and spacecraft parts in a systemic, organized \n     manner. The enclosed bill is the product of the working \n     group's efforts.\n       Not only does the bill prescribe tough new penalties for \n     trafficking in suspect parts; it also authorizes the Attorney \n     General, in appropriate cases, to seek civil remedies to stop \n     offenders from re-entering the business and to direct the \n     destruction of stockpiles and inventories of suspect parts so \n     that they do not find their way into legitimate commerce. \n     Other features of the bill are described in the enclosed \n     section-by-section analysis.\n       If enacted, this bill would give law enforcement a potent \n     weapon in the fight to protect the safety of the traveling \n     public. Consequently, we urge that you give the bill \n     favorable consideration.\n       We would be pleased to answer any questions that you may \n     have and greatly appreciate your continued support for strong \n     law enforcement. The Office of Management and Budget has \n     advised us that, from the perspective of the Administration's \n     program, there is no objection to the submission of this \n     legislative proposal, and that its enactment would be in \n     accord with the program of the President.\n           Sincerely,\n     Janet Reno,\n       Attorney General.\n     Rodney E. Slater,\n       Secretary of Transportation.\n     William S. Cohen,\n       Secretary of Defense.\n     Daniel S. Goldin,\n       Administrator, National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration.\n       Enclosures.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                          Proposed Legislation\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America, in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Aircraft Safety Act of \n     1999.''\n\n     SEC. 2.

CONFORMING AMENDMENT.\n\n       Section 2516(1)(c) of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended by inserting ``section 38 (relating to aircraft parts \n     fraud),'' after ``section 32 (relating to destruction of \n     aircraft or aircraft facilities),''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n     SECTION 1.\n\n       This section states the short title of the legislation, the \n     ``Aircraft Safety Act of 1999.''\n\n     SECTION 2. PREVENTION OF FRAUDS INVOLVING AIRCRAFT OR \n                   SPACEVEHICLE PARTS IN INTERSTATE OR FOREIGN \n                   COMMERCE.\n\n       This section, whose primary purpose is to safeguard U.S. \n     aircraft and spacecraft, and passengers and crewmembers from \n     the dangers posed by installation of nonconforming, \n     defective, or counterfeit frames, assemblies, components, \n     appliances, engines, propellers, materials, parts or spare \n     parts into or onto civil, public, and military aircraft. \n     Thus, even though the section is cast as an amendment to the \n     criminal law, it is a public safety measure.\n       The problems associated with nonconforming, defective, and \n     counterfeit aircraft parts have been explored and discussed \n     in a number of fora for several years. For example, in 1995, \n     the Honorable Bill Cohen, then Chairman of the Senate \n     Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management and the \n     District of Columbia (now Secretary of Defense), said: \n     ``Airplane parts that are counterfeit, falsely documented or \n     manufactured without quality controls are posing an increased \n     risk to the flying public, and the federal government is not \n     doing enough to ensure safety.'' Similarly, Senator Carl \n     Levin, in a 1995 statement before the same Subcommittee, \n     said: ``A domestic passenger airplane can contain as many as \n     6 million parts. Each year, about 26 million parts are used \n     to maintain aircraft. Industry has estimated that as much as \n     $2 billion in unapproved parts are now sitting on the shelves \n     of parts distributors, airlines, and repair stations.''\n       Notwithstanding increased enforcement efforts, the \n     magnitude of the problem is increasing: according to the June \n     10, 1996, edition of Business Week magazine, ``Numerous FAA \n     inspectors . . . say the problem of substandard parts has \n     grown dramatically in the past five years. That's partly \n     because the nation's aging airline fleet needs more repairs \n     and more parts to keep flying--increasing the opportunities \n     for bad parts to sneak in. And cash-strapped startups \n     outsource much of their maintenance, making it harder for \n     them to keep tabs on the work.'' According to Senator Levin's \n     1995 statement, ``over the past five years, the Department of \n     Transportation Inspector General and the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation have obtained 136 indictments, 98 convictions, \n     about $50 million in criminal fines, restitutions and \n     recoveries in cases involving unapproved aircraft parts. . . \n     . The bad news is that additional investigations are underway \n     with no sign of a flagging market in unapproved parts.''\n       Yet, no single Federal law targets the problem in a \n     systemic, organized manner. Prosecutors currently use a \n     variety of statutes to bring offenders to justice. These \n     statutes include mail fraud, wire fraud, false statements and \n     conspiracy, among others. While these prosecutorial tools \n     work well enough in many situations, none of them focus \n     directly on the dangers posed by nonconforming, defective, \n     and counterfeit aircraft parts. Offenders benefit from \n     this lack of focus, often in the form of light sentences. \n     One incident reveals the inherent shortcomings of such an \n     approach.\n       ``In 1991, a mechanic at United [Airlines] noticed \n     something odd about what were supposed to be six Pratt & \n     Whitney bearing-seal spacers used in P's jet engines--\n     engines installed on Boeing 727s and 737s and McDonnell-\n     Douglas DC-9s world-wide. The spacers proved to be \n     counterfeit, and P determined that they would have \n     disintegrated within 600 hours of use, compared with a \n     20,000-hour service life of the real part. A spacer failure \n     in flight could cause the total failure of an engine. \n     Investigators traced the\n\n[[Page S11939]]\n\n     counterfeits to a broker who allegedly used unsuspecting \n     small toolmakers and printers to fake the parts, as well as \n     phony Pratt & Whitney boxes and labels. The broker . . . pled \n     guilty to trafficking in counterfeit goods and received a \n     seven-month sentence in 1994.'' (June 10, 1996, Edition of \n     Business Week Magazine.)\n       Given the potential threat to public safety, a focused, \n     comprehensive law is needed to attack this problem.\n       Prevention of Frauds Involving Aircraft or Spacecraft Parts \n     in Interstate or Foreign Commerce remedies the problems noted \n     above by amending Chapter Two of Title 18, United States \n     Code. Chapter Two deals with ``Aircraft and Motor Vehicles,'' \n     and currently contains provisions dealing with the \n     destruction of aircraft or aircraft facilities, and violence \n     at international airports but says nothing about fraudulent \n     trafficking in nonconforming, defective, or counterfeit \n     aircraft parts.\n       Subsection (a) builds on the existing framework of Chapter \n     Two by adding some relevant definitions to Section 31. The \n     subsection defines ``aviation quality,'' when used with \n     respect to aircraft or aircraft parts, to mean aircraft or \n     parts that have been manufactured, constructed, produced, \n     repaired, overhauled, rebuilt, reconditioned, or restored in \n     conformity with applicable standards, specified by law, \n     regulation, or contract. The term is used in Section 38(b) of \n     the Act, which sets forth the maximum penalties for violation \n     of the offenses prescribed by Section 38(a). If the \n     misrepresentation or fraud that leads to a conviction under \n     Section 38(a) concerns the ``aviation quality'' of an \n     aircraft part, then Section 38(b)(2) enhances the maximum \n     punishment by 10 years imprisonment and doubles the potential \n     fine.\n       This subsection also defines ``aircraft.'' This definition \n     essentially repeats the definition of aircraft already \n     provided in Section 40102 of Title 49.\n       ``Part'' is defined to mean virtually all aircraft \n     components and equipment.\n       ``Spacevehicle'' is defined to mean any man-made device, \n     manned or unmanned, designed for operation beyond the earth's \n     atmosphere and would include rockets, missiles, satellites, \n     and the like.\n       Subsection (b) adds a totally new Section 38 to Chapter Two \n     of Title 18. Subsection 38(a)(1)-(3) sets out three new \n     offenses designed to outlaw the fraudulent exportation, \n     importation, sale, trade, installation, or introduction of \n     nonconforming, defective, or counterfeit aircraft or aircraft \n     parts into interstate or foreign commerce. This is \n     accomplished by making it a crime to falsify or conceal any \n     material fact, to make any materially fraudulent \n     representation, or to use any materially false documentation \n     or electronic communication concerning any aircraft or \n     spacecraft part, or to attempt to do so.\n       The three provisions, overlap to some extent but each \n     focuses upon a different aspect of the problem to provide \n     investigators and prosecutors with necessary flexibility. All \n     are specific intent crimes; that is, all require the accused \n     to act with knowledge, or reason to know, of his fraudulent \n     activity.\n       Proposed subsection (b) prescribes the maximum penalties \n     that attach to the offenses created in Subsection (a). A \n     three-pronged approach is taken in order to both demonstrate \n     the gravity of the offenses and provide prosecutors and \n     judges alike with flexibility in punishing the conduct at \n     issue. A basic 15-year imprisonment and $250,000 fine maximum \n     punishment is set for all offenses created by the new \n     section; however, the maximum punishment may be escalated if \n     the prosecution can prove additional aggravating \n     circumstances. If the fraud that is the subject of a \n     conviction concerns the aviation quality of the part at issue \n     and the part is actually installed in an aircraft or \n     spacevehicle, then the maximum punishment increases to 25 \n     years imprisonment and a $500,000 fine. If, however, the \n     prosecution is able to show that the part at issue was the \n     probable cause of a malfunction or failure leading to an \n     emergency landing or mishap that results in the death or \n     injury of any person, then the maximum punishment is \n     increased to life imprisonment and a $1 million fine. \n     Finally, if a person other than an individual is convicted, \n     the maximum fine is increased to $25 million.\n       New subsection (c) authorizes the Attorney General to seek \n     appropriate civil remedies, such as injunctions, to prevent \n     and restrain violations of the Act. Part of the difficulty in \n     stopping the flow of nonconforming, defective, and \n     counterfeit parts into interstate or foreign commerce is the \n     ease with which unscrupulous individuals and firms enter and \n     re-enter the business; ``Moreover, even when they are caught \n     and punished, these criminals can conceivably go back to \n     selling aircraft parts when their sentences are up.'' (See, \n     1995 Statement of Senator Joe Lieberman before the Senate \n     Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management and the \n     District of Columbia.) In addition to providing a way to \n     maintain the status quo and to keep suspected defective or \n     counterfeit parts out of the mainstream of commerce during an \n     investigation, this provision adds important post-conviction \n     enforcement tools to prosecutors. The ability to bring such \n     actions may be especially telling in dealing with repeat \n     offenders since a court may, in addition to imposing \n     traditional criminal penalties, order individuals to divest \n     themselves of interests in businesses used to perpetuate \n     related offenses or to refrain from entering the same type of \n     business endeavor in the future. Courts may also direct the \n     disposal of stockpiles and inventories of parties not shown \n     to be genuine or conforming to specifications to prevent \n     their subsequent resale or entry into commerce. It is \n     envisioned that the prosecution would seek such relief only \n     when necessary to ensure aviation safety.\n       Proposed subsection (d) provides for criminal forfeiture \n     proceedings in cases arising under new section 38 of Title \n     18.\n       Proposed subsection (e) discusses how the Act is to be \n     construed with other laws relating to the subject of \n     fraudulent importation, sale, trade, installation, or \n     introduction of aircraft or aircraft parts. The section makes \n     clear that other remedies, whether civil or criminal, are not \n     preempted by the Act and may continue to be enforced. In \n     particular, the Act is not intended to alter the jurisdiction \n     of the U.S. Customs Service, which is generally responsible \n     for enforcing the laws governing importation of goods into \n     the United States.\n       Proposed subsection (f) deals with the territorial scope of \n     the Act. To rebut the general presumption against the \n     extraterritorial effect of U.S. criminal laws, this section \n     provides that the Act will apply to conduct occurring both in \n     the United States and beyond U.S. borders. Clearly the U.S. \n     will apply the law to conduct occurring outside U.S. \n     territory only when there is an important U.S. interest at \n     stake. If, however, an offender affects the safety of U.S. \n     aircraft, spacevehicles, or is a U.S. person, this section \n     would provide for subject matter jurisdiction even if the \n     offense is committed overseas.\n       Subsection (g) of new section 38 authorizes administrative \n     subpoenas to be issued in furtherance of the investigation of \n     offenses under this section. Under this provision, the \n     Attorney General or designee may issue written subpoenas \n     requiring the production of records relevant to an authorized \n     law enforcement inquiry pertaining to offenses under the new \n     section. Testimony concerning the production and \n     authentication of such records may also be compelled. The \n     subsection also sets forth guidance concerning the service \n     and enforcement of such subpoenas and provides civil immunity \n     to any person who, in good faith, complies with a subpoena \n     issued pursuant to the Section.\n       The subsection is modeled closely on an analogous provision \n     found in Section 3486(a)(1) of Title 18, pertaining to health \n     care fraud investigations. Like the health care industry, the \n     aviation industry--including the aviation-parts component of \n     the industry--is highly regulated since the public has an \n     abiding interest in the safe and efficient operation of all \n     components of the industry. The public also has concomitant \n     interest in access to the records and related information \n     pertaining to the industry since, often, the only evidence of \n     possible violations of law may be the records of this \n     regulated industry. Thus, companies and individuals doing \n     business in this industry are in the public limelight by \n     choice and have reduced or diminished expectations of privacy \n     in their affairs relating to how that business is conducted. \n     In such situations, strict probable cause requirements \n     regarding the production of records, documents, testimony, \n     and related materials make enforcement impossible. This \n     provision recognizes this but also imposes some procedural \n     rigor and related safeguards so that the administrative \n     subpoena power is not abused in this context. The provisions \n     rquires the information sought to be relevant to the \n     investigation, reasonably specific, and not unreasonably \n     burdensome to meet.\n\n     SECTION 3. CONFORMING AMENDMENT.\n\n       This section would add the new offenses created by the Act \n     to the list of predicate offenses for which oral, wire, and \n     electronic communications may be authorized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the amendment has been agreed to by both \nsides. There is no further debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1927) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2240\n\n(Purpose: To preserve essential air services at dominated hub airports)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Dorgan, I send an \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for Mr. Dorgan, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2240.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. PRESERVATION OF ESSENTIAL AIR SERVICE AT DOMINATED HUB \n                   AIRPORTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subchapter II of chapter 417 is amended by \n     adding at the end thereof the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 41743. Preservation of basic essential air service at \n       dominated hub airports\n\n       ``(a) In General.--If the Secretary of Transportation \n     determines that extraordinary circumstances jeopardize the \n     reliable\n\n[[Page S11940]]\n\n     and competitive performance of essential air service under \n     this subchapter from a subsidized essential air service \n     community to and from an essential airport facility, then the \n     Secretary may require the air carrier that has more than 50 \n     percent of the total annual enplanements at that essential \n     airport facility to take action to enable an air carrier to \n     provide reliable and competitive essential air service to \n     that community. Action required by the Secretary under this \n     subsection may include interline agreements, ground services, \n     subleasing of gates, and the provision of any other service \n     to facility necessary for the performance of satisfactory \n     essential air service to that community.\n       ``(b) Essential Airport Facility Defined.--In this section, \n     the term `essential airport facility' means a large hub \n     airport (as defined in section 41731) in the contiguous 48 \n     states at which 1 air carrier has more than 50 percent of the \n     total annual enplanements at that airport.''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Dorgan for this amendment. \nSenator Dorgan has been, for at least 10 years I know, deeply concerned \nabout this whole issue of essential air service. Although essential air \nservice has increased funding, still we are not having medium-sized and \nsmall markets being served as they deserve.\n  I thank Senator Dorgan for the amendment.\n  It has been agreed to by both sides. I don't believe there is any \nfurther debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2240) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the modified Baucus \namendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1898), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Thank you, Mr. President. All we have now remaining is \nthe managers' amendment, which will be arriving shortly. Then I will \nhave a request on behalf of the leader for FAA passage, and the \nparliamentary procedures for doing so.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wonder if I might use a few moments \nwhile the manager is waiting to give general observations. I am totally \nin favor of the bill. I just want to talk generally about the Airport \nand Airways Trust Fund.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  Over the last several years, there has been a lot of talk and support \non the House side for the idea of changing the budgetary status of the \nAirport and Airways Trust Fund. In fact, the House's FAA \nReauthorization bill, the so-called AIR-21, would take the Airport and \nAirways Trust Fund off-budget. Some say the House's real intent is to \ncreate a new budgetary firewall for aviation, similar to those created \nfor the highway and mass transit trust funds under the Transportation \nEquity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21).\n  I've been hearing distant, low rumbles from a minority of my \ncolleagues on this side of the Capitol. They, too, would like an off-\nbudget status or firewall for the Aviation Trust Fund.\n  Let me reiterate my response to these proposals--These proposals are \ndangerous and fiscally irresponsible. They undermine the struggle to \ncontrol spending, reduce taxes, and balance the budget.\n  Taking the Aviation Trust Fund off-budget would allow FAA spending to \nbe exempt from all congressional budget control mechanisms. It would \nprovide aviation with a level of protection now provided only to Social \nSecurity. Important spending control mechanisms such as budget caps, \npay-as-you-go rules, and annual congressional oversight and review \nwould no longer apply.\n  A firewall scenario has very similar problems. A firewall would \nprevent the Appropriations Committee from reducing trust fund spending, \neven if the FAA was not ready to spend the money in a given year. If \nthe Appropriations Committee wanted to increase FAA spending above the \nfirewall, it would have to come from the discretionary spending cap, a \nvery difficult choice given the tight discretionary caps through 2002.\n  These proposals would also create problems in FAA management and \noversight. Both an off-budget or firewall status would reduce \nmanagement and oversight of the FAA by taking trust fund spending out \nof the budget process. Placing the FAA and the trust fund on autopilot \nby locking-up funding would result in fewer opportunities to review and \neffect needed reforms. This is very dangerous. There would be little \nleverage to induce the FAA to strive for higher standards of \nperformance. Now is the time for more management and oversight by both \nthe Authorizing and Appropriations committee, not less.\n  The Budget Enforcement Act and other budget laws were created to keep \nrunaway spending in check. I oppose, as we all should, budgetary \nchanges that would make it more difficult to control spending, weaken \ncongressional oversight, create a misleading federal budget, and \nviolate the spirit of the law.\n  Some of my colleagues object to the building of money in the Aviation \nTrust Fund. They contend that all of the revenues should be spent on \nairport improvements. They say that all of the aviation related user \ntaxes should be dedicated to aviation, and should not be used for other \nspending programs, deficit reduction, or tax cuts.\n  On the contrary, total FAA expenditures have far exceeded the \nresources flowing into the trust fund. Since the trust fund was created \nin 1971 to 1998, total expenditures have exceeded total tax revenues by \nmore than $6 billion.\n  This is because the Aviation Trust Fund resources have been \nsupplemented with General Revenues. The purpose of the General Fund \ncontribution is that the federal government should reimburse the FAA \nfor the direct costs of public-sector use of the air traffic control \nsystem. The FAA estimated in 1997 that the public-sector costs incurred \non the air traffic control system is 7.5 percent.\n  In 1999, a total of 15 percent of federal aviation funding came from \nthe General Fund. Since the creation of the Aviation Trust Fund, the \nGeneral Fund subsidy for the FAA is 38 percent of all spending. This \nfar exceeds the 7.5 percent public-sector costs that FAA estimated. \nTherefore, over the life of the trust fund, the public sector has \nsubsidized the cost of the private-sector users of the FAA by $46 \nbillion.\n  Let this Congress not make the fiscally irresponsible decision to \ninsulate aviation spending from any fiscal restraint imposed by future \nbudget resolutions; to make aviation spending off-limits to \nCongressional Appropriations Committees. Let us not grant aviation a \nspecial budgetary privilege, and make it more difficult for future \nCongresses and Administrations to enact major reforms in airport and \nair traffic control funding and operations.\n  Taking the Aviation Trust Funds off-budget or creating a firewall--\nthese proposals are not fit to fly!\n  I yield the floor. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2265\n\n   (Purpose: To make available funds for Georgia's regional airport \n                          enhancement program)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof Senator Coverdell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for Mr. Coverdell, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2265.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the Manager's substitute \n     amendment, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS FOR GEORGIA'S REGIONAL AIRPORT \n                   ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM.\n\n       Of the amounts made available to the Secretary of \n     Transportation for the fiscal year 2000 under section 48103 \n     of title 49, United States Code, funds may be available for \n     Georgia's regional airport enhancement program for the \n     acquisition of land.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, there is no further debate on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2265) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I know of no further amendments to be \noffered to S. 82 other than the managers' package.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the debate and \nvote\n\n[[Page S11941]]\n\nin relation to the Robb amendment. I further ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing the vote in relation to the Robb amendment, the managers' \namendment be in order, and following its adoption, the bill be advanced \nto third reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wonder whether I could ask my \ncolleague, how long will the debate be on the Robb amendment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. According to the previous unanimous consent amendment, \nthere was 5 minutes for Senators Bryan, Warner, Robb, and 5 minutes for \nme. I don't intend to use my 5 minutes because I know that the Senator \nfrom Nevada can far more eloquently state the case.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I shall not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the unanimous-consent \nrequest is agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder to ask for the yeas and nays on passage of the House bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I now ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, therefore, two back-to-back votes will \noccur within a short period of time, the last in the series being final \npassage of the FAA bill.\n  I thank all Senators for their cooperation.\n  Before I move on to the debate on the part of Senator Bryan, Senator \nRobb, Senator Warner, and myself, I will ask that the Chair appoint \nRepublican conferees on this side of the aisle as follows: Senators \nMcCain, Stevens, Burns, Gorton, and Lott; and from the Budget \nCommittee, Senators Domenici, Grassley, and Nickles.\n  I hope the other side will be able to appoint conferees very shortly \nas well so that we can move forward to a conference on the bill. I \nunderstand the Democratic leader has not decided on the conferees. But \nwe have decided ours.\n  I see the Senator from Nevada.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2259\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I would like to accommodate the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona, the chairman. The Senator from \nNevada would like to use 2 minutes of his time at this point and \nreserve the remainder.\n  I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by our distinguished \ncolleague from Virginia. I do so because the effect of his amendment \nwould leave us with the perimeter rule unchanged.\n  Very briefly, the perimeter rule is a rule enacted by statute by the \nCongress of the United States which prohibits flights originating from \nWashington National to travel more than 1,250 miles and prohibits any \nflights originating more than 1,250 miles from Washington National from \nlanding here.\n  The General Accounting Office has looked at this and has found that \nit is anticompetitive. It tends to discriminate against new entrants \ninto the marketplace, and it cannot be justified by any rational \nstandard.\n  As is so often the case, a page of history is more instructive than a \nvolume of logic. The history of this dates back to 1986 when there was \ndifficulty in getting long-haul carriers to move to Washington Dulles. \nAt that point in time, the perimeter rule, which was then something \nlike 750 miles, was put into effect to force air service for long-haul \ncarriers out of Dulles. As we all know, that is no longer the case. \nDulles has gone to a multibillion-dollar expansion and the original \nbasis for the rule no longer exists.\n  The effect, unfortunately, of the amendment offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia is to leave that perimeter rule in \nplace unchanged. The Senator from Arizona has recommended a compromise. \nHe and I would prefer to abolish the rule in its entirety. Yielding to \nthe reality of the circumstances, he has provided a compromise to \nprovide for 24 additional slots: 12 to be made available for carriers \nthat would serve outside of the perimeter; that is, beyond the 1,250 \nmiles, and 12 within the 1,250 miles.\n  This is a very important piece of legislation, and I urge my \ncolleagues to defeat it on the basis that it is anticompetitive, \nunnecessary, and no longer serves any useful purpose.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in light of the fact that Senator Warner \njust arrived and Senator Robb has not arrived, I ask unanimous consent \nthat we stand in a quorum call for approximately 5 minutes, and that \nwill give Senator Warner time to collect his thoughts. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield 3 minutes of my time to the Senator from West \nVirginia, Mr. Rockefeller.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, each Member of the Senate will vote \non the Robb amendment as they see fit. I want to simply make a \nphilosophical statement, which I made earlier but will make it again.\n  The fact that passengers, planes, parcels, international flight \nactivities, planes in the air, and planes on the ground are either \ngoing to be doubling, tripling, or quadrupling over the next 10 years \nis obviously not now in effect but has everything to do with the future \nof what it is that our airports are willing to accept and what it is \nthat those who live around our airports are willing to accept.\n  To stop aviation growth, to stop aviation traffic, passengers, \npackages, new airlines, and new international flight activity is to try \nto stop the Internet. It is something you might wish for, but it is not \ngoing to happen. In fact, it is not something we wish for because it is \ngood economic activity. Ten million people work for the airline \naviation industry, and many of those people work in and around the \nairports where those airplanes land and take off.\n  My only point is, we cannot expect to have progress in this country \nwithout there being a certain inconvenience that goes along with it. We \nhave become accustomed to having our cake and eating it, too, and that \nis having our airports but then having a relatively small number of \nflights landing or a slotted number, in the case of four of our major \nairports, landing, but then the thought of others landing becomes very \ndifficult.\n  Atlanta, Newark, and many other large airports do not have any slots \nat all. The people who live around them survive. They hear the noise. \nThey do not like it. The noise mitigation is getting much better as \ntechnology improves, and the safety technology, if the Congress will \ngive the money, will get even better than it is. It is virtually a \nperfect record.\n\n  I simply make the observation that slots are a difficult subject. \nThey are very controversial because people prefer quietness to noise. \nBut in a world that grows more complex in commerce, in which the \nstandard of living is increasing enormously, one cannot have the \nconvenience of travel, the convenience of packages, the convenience of \nletters, the convenience of getting around internationally, and the \nconvenience of many new airplanes and expect to have everything the way \nit was 30 years ago hold until this day.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and the chairman of the committee and \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be \ncounted against my time under a quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S11942]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I just attended a ceremony at the \nDepartment of Defense, at which time the President signed the \nauthorization bill for the Armed Forces of the United States for the \nyear 2000. I was necessarily delayed in returning to the floor. My \ncolleague, Senator Robb, accompanied me, and he will be here \nmomentarily. We worked together on this amendment, as we worked \ntogether on this project from the inception, a project basically to try \nto get National Airport and Dulles Airport into full operation.\n  Our aim all along has been to let modernization go forward and, to \nthe extent we can gain support in this Chamber, limit any increase in \nthe number of flights. We do this because of our concerns regarding \nsafety, congestion, and other factors. I say ``other factors'' because \nat the time the original legislation was passed whereby we \ndefederalized these airports and allowed a measure of control by other \nthan Federal authorities, giving the State of Virginia, the State of \nMaryland, and the District of Columbia a voice in these matters, it was \nclear that Congress should not micromanage these two airports.\n  We went through a succession of events to achieve this objective, and \nwe are here today hopefully to finalize this legislation--and I have \nalready put in an amendment to allow the modernization to go forward--\nand to do certain other things in connection with the board, to let the \nboard be appointed.\n  Now we come to the question of the increased flights, and I support \nthe amendment by my distinguished colleague.\n  I want to cover some history.\n  My remarks today will focus on the unwise provisions included in this \nbill which tear apart the perimeter and high density rules at Reagan \nNational Airport. These rules have been in effect--either in regulation \nor in statute--for nearly 30 years. Since 1986, these rules have been a \ncritical ingredient in providing for significant capital investments \nand a balance in service among this region's three airports--Dulles \nInternational, Reagan National, and Baltimore-Washington International.\n  First and foremost, I believe these existing rules have greatly \nbenefitted the traveling public--the consumer.\n  Mr. President, to gain a full understanding of the severe impact \nthese increased slot changes will have on our regional airports, one \nmust examine the recent history of these three airports.\n  Prior to 1986, Dulles and Reagan National were federally owned and \nmanaged by the FAA. The level of service provided at these airports was \ndeplorable. At National, consumers were routinely subject to traffic \ngridlock, insufficient parking, and routine flight cancellations and \ndelays. Dulles was an isolated, underutilized airport.\n  For years, the debate raged within the FAA and the surrounding \ncommunities about the future of Reagan National. Should it be improved, \nexpanded or closed? This ongoing uncertainty produced a situation where \nno investments were made in National and Dulles and service continued \nto deteriorate.\n  A national commission, now known as the Holton Commission, was \ncreated in 1984. It was led by former Virginia Governor Linwood Holton \nand former Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth Dole and charged with \nresolving the longstanding controversies which plagued both airports. \nThe result was a recommendation to transfer federal ownership of the \nairports to a regional authority so that sorely needed capital \ninvestments to improve safety and service could be made.\n  I was pleased to have participated in the development of the 1986 \nlegislation to transfer operations of these airports to a regional \nauthority. It was a fair compromise of the many issues which had \nstalled any improvements at both airports over the years.\n  The regulatory high density rule was placed in the statute so that \nneither the FAA nor the Authority could unilaterally changes it. The \nprevious passenger cap at Reagan National was repealed, thereby ending \ngrowth controls, in exchange for a freeze on slots. Lastly, the \nperimeter rule at 1,250 miles was established.\n\n  For those interested in securing capital investments at both \nairports, the transfer of these airports under a long-term lease \narrangement to the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority gave MWAA \nthe power to sell bonds to finance the long-overdue work. The Authority \nhas sold millions of dollars in bonds which has financed the new \nterminal, rehabilitation of the existing terminal, a new control tower \nand parking facilities at Reagan National.\n  These improvements would not have been possible without the 1986 \nTransfer Act which included the high density rule, and the perimeter \nrule. Limitations on operations at National had long been in effect \nthrough FAA regulations, but now were part of the balanced compromise \nin the Transfer Act.\n  For those who feared significant increases in flight activity at \nNational and who for years had prevented any significant investments in \nNational, they were now willing to support major rehabilitation work at \nNational to improve service. They were satisfied that these guarantees \nwould ensure that Reagan National would not become another ``Dulles or \nBWI''.\n  Citizens had received legislative assurances that there would be no \ngrowth at Reagan National in terms of permitted scheduled flights \nbeyond on the 37-per-hour-limit. Today, unless the Robb amendment is \nadopted, we will be breaking our commitments.\n  These critical decisions in the 1986 Transfer Act were made to fix \nboth the aircraft activity level at Reagan National and to set its role \nas a short/medium haul airport. These compromises served to insulate \nthe airport from its long history of competing efforts to increase and \nto decrease its use.\n  Since the transfer, the Authority has worked to maintain the balance \nin service between Dulles and Reagan National. The limited growth \nprinciple for Reagan National has been executed by the Authority in all \nof its planning assumptions and the Master Plan. While we have all \nwitnessed the transformation of National into a quality airport today, \nthese improvements in terminals, the control tower and parking \nfacilities were all determined to meet the needs of this airport for \nthe foreseeable future based on the continuation of the high density \nand perimeter rules.\n  These improvements, however, have purposely not included an increase \nin the number of gates for aircraft or aircraft capacity.\n  Prior to the 1986 Transfer Act, while National was mired in \ncontroversy and poor service, Dulles was identified as the region's \ngrowth airport. Under FAA rules and the Department of Transportation's \n1981 Metropolitan Washington Airports Policy, it was recognized that \nDulles had the capacity for growth and a suitable environment to \naccommodate this growth.\n\n  Following enactment of the Transfer Act, plans, capital investments \nand bonding decisions made by the Authority all factored in the High \nDensity and Perimeter rules.\n   Mr. President, I provide this history on the issues which stalled \nimprovements at the region's airports in the 1970s and 1980s because it \nis important to understanding how these airports have operated so \neffectively over the past 13 years.\n  Every one of us should ask ourselves if the 1986 Transfer Act has met \nour expectations. For me, the answer is a resounding yes. Long-overdue \ncapital investments have been made in Reagan National and Dulles. The \nsurrounding communities have been given an important voice in the \nmanagement of these airports. We have seen unprecedented stability in \nthe growth of both airports. Most importantly, the consumer has \nbenefited by enhanced service at Reagan National.\n  For these reasons, I have opposed an increase in slots at Reagan \nNational. There is no justification for an increase of this size. It is \nnot recommended by the administration, by the airline industry, by the \nMetropolitan Washington Airports Authority or by the consumer.\n  The capital improvements made at Reagan National since the 1986 \nTransfer Act have not expanded the 44 gates or expanded airfield \ncapacity. All of the improvements that have been made\n\n[[Page S11943]]\n\nhave been on the land side of the airport. No improvements have been \nmade to accommodate increased aircraft capacity. Expanding flights at \nReagan National will simply ``turn back the clock'' at National to the \ndays of traffic gridlock, overcrowded terminal activity and flight \ndelays--all to the detriment of the traveling public.\n  This ill-advised scheme is sure to return Reagan National to an \nairport plagued by delays and inconvenience. This proposal threatens to \noverwhelm the new facilities, just as the previous facilities were \noverwhelmed.\n   Mr. President, it is completely inappropriate for Congress to act as \n``airport managers'' to legislate new flights. Those decisions should \nbe made by the local airport authority with direct participation by the \npublic in an open process. Today, we will be preventing local \ndecisionmaking.\n  I know that my colleagues readily cite a recent GAO report that \nindicates that new flights at Reagan National can be accommodated. This \nreport, however, plainly includes an important disclaimer. That \ndisclaimer states:\n\n       This study did not evaluate the potential congestion and \n     noise that could result from an increase in operations at \n     Reagan National. Ultimately, . . . the Congress must balance \n     the benefits that additional flights may bring to the \n     traveling public against the local community's concerns about \n     the effect of those flights on noise, the environment, and \n     the area's other major airports.\n\n  Surely, we cannot make this important decision in a vacuum. \nDetermining how many flights serve Reagan National simply by measuring \nhow quickly we can clear runway space is not sound policy.\n  For these reasons I urge the adoption of the Robb amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 5 minutes allocated to the Senator have \nexpired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Robb's \namendment to strike the exceptions to the high-density slot limit and \nthe flight perimeter rule at Reagan National Airport.\n  I have serious concerns about increasing the number of flights and \ngranting exemptions to the 1,250 mile nonstop perimeter rule at Ronald \nReagan Washington National Airport. In my judgment, the bill provisions \ncreating new slots at DCA and allowing for nonstop flights beyond the \nairport's existing 1,250 mile perimeter are fundamentally flawed for \nfour reasons: first, they contravene longstanding federal policy; \nsecond, they undermine regional airport plans and programs; third these \nprovisions will not have any significant impact on service for most \nconsumers or competition in the Washington metropolitan region; and \nfinally the provisions will subject local residents to an unwarranted \nincrease in overflight noise.\n  First, the slot and perimeter rules have been in place for more than \nthirty years. And they were codified in the 1986 legislation that \ncreated the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. Both rules were \npivotal in reaching the political consensus among federal, regional, \nstate, and local interests that allowed for passage of the 1986 \nlegislations. The rules, as codified, were designed to carefully \nbalance the benefits and impacts of aviation in the Washington \nmetropolitan area. The bill now before us would overturn more than \nthirty years of federal policies and upset the balance struck in 1986.\n  Second, the slot and perimeter rules are among the most fundamental \nair traffic management and planning tools available to the Metropolitan \nWashington Airports Authority. The Washington-Baltimore regional \nairport system plan and Reagan National Airport's master plan both rely \non the slot and perimeter rules. By eliminating these tools, the bill \nbefore us would inappropriately override the authority and control \nvested in the Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority and would \naffect local land use plans. One of the main purposes of the 1986 \nMetropolitan Washington Airports Authority Act was to remove the \nfederal government from the business of micro managing the operation of \nNational Airport. The bill before us puts the federal government right \nback in the business of making decisions about daily operations and \nlocal community impacts--issues that should be left to local decision-\nmakers.\n  Third, if the Washington region were not served by two other \nairports, Dulles and BWI, specifically designed to handle the kind of \nlong-haul commercial jet operations never intended to use National, \nthen the argument that the slot and perimeter rules are somehow \ninherently ``anti-competitive,'' might have some validity. However, \nbecause consumers have access to so many choices, the rules do not \ninjure competition in the Washington-Baltimore region. Far from being \nan anemic market, the Washington-Baltimore market today is one of the \nhealthiest and most competitive markets in the country. Consumers can \nchoose between three airports and a dizzying number of flights and \nflight times. Indeed, GAO recently reported that even if the perimeter \nrule were removed ``only a limited number of passengers will switch'' \nfrom Dulles or BWI to National, underscoring my contention that the \nproposed new slots will yield no significant benefit to local consumers \nor otherwise improve the local market.\n  Finally, let me address the very important issue of noise, which is \nof principal concern to my constituents. Anyone who lives in the flight \npath of National Airport knows what a serious problem aircraft noise \nposes to human health and even performing daily activities. Citizens \nfor the Abatement of Aircraft Noise (CAAN), a coalition of citizens and \ncivic associations which has been working for more than 14 years to \nreduce aircraft noise in the Washington metropolitan area, has analyzed \ndata from a recent Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority report \nwhich shows that between 31% and 53% of the 32 noise monitoring \nstations in the region have a day-night average sound level which is \nhigher than the 65 decibel level that has been established by the EPA \nand the American National Standards Institute as the threshold above \nwhich any residential living is incompatible. New slots will add to the \nnoise problem.\n  Mr. President, I support this amendment because I believe Congress \nshould defer to the FAA and local airport officials on this issue. I \nalso believe that Congress should not be asking hundreds of thousands \nof local residents to tolerate more aircraft noise merely to benefit a \nhandful of frequent flyers and fewer than a handful of airlines. I urge \nmy colleagues to support the amendment as well.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank my senior colleague. He and I were \naway from the Senate floor for the signing of the defense authorization \nbill, which was the work of my colleague from Virginia and the \ncommittee he chairs. I thank him for his kind comments.\n  Very simply, this amendment is about a 1986 agreement, on which the \nsenior Senator from Virginia and I both worked, as well as many others. \nIt was an agreement between the Federal Government and the local \ngovernments and the State governments involved to make sure that we \naddressed the serious concerns that were then holding up any progress \non improvements on National Airport.\n  At that time, we recognized that the two airports, Dulles Airport and \nRonald Reagan Washington National Airport, work in tandem; they should \nbe viewed as a single airport. Together, they serve consumers and the \nWashington region well. It was agreed that a local authority would best \nmanage the airports, just as all other airports across the nation.\n  In this particular case, if we were to approve an increase in flights \nat National Airport, we would be breaking that deal.\n  We would also increase the delay and increase the disruption to local \ncommunities. Most importantly, we would be going back on a deal--we \nwould be reneging on a deal that was made so the Federal Government \nwould stay out of the business of trying to micromanage the only two \nairports in the area.\n  I hope the Members will respect the agreement that this body, the \nFederal Government, and the State governments and the local governments \nentered into in 1986, and move to strike the additional slots that are \nin an otherwise meritorious bill.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Virginia yield the \nremainder of the time? You have 2 minutes left.\n\n[[Page S11944]]\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Unless my senior colleague has additional remarks or the \nSenator from Arizona, I would yield back.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have no additional remarks. My colleague has handled \nit. Our statements are very clear. We have worked together now for \nthese many months. We did our very best on behalf of our State for this \nissue.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has no more time.\n  Mr. ROBB. The Senator from Virginia yields back any time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has 2 minutes 55 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, it is tempting to engage my colleagues in \ndebate, both of whom are good friends, but I shall refrain from doing \nso, knowing the merits of this will result in the rejection of this \namendment; therefore, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Under the previous order, the question is on agreeing to the Robb \namendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  Excuse me. The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I hope the Senator will forgive me. I am \nasking for order, and I am going to insist on it. I want to help the \nChair to get order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is entitled to be heard.\n  Mr. BYRD. I hope the Chair will break that gavel so that Senators \nwill hear him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senators in the well holding \nconversations please take them out.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, the Senator from New Jersey has insisted \non his rights, which he has as a Senator, to propose an amendment, for \nwhich he seeks half an hour of discussion, followed by a vote on his \namendment. He has another amendment which he has agreed to include in \nthe managers' package, which is agreeable to both sides.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Lautenberg amendment No. 1921 \nconcerning pets be included in the managers' package and that the \npackage be accepted at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I add to that unanimous consent request that immediately \nfollowing that, the Senator from New Jersey be recognized for half an \nhour, and following this half hour we will vote on his second \namendment, and that be immediately followed by final passage.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am not going to object. But I will \ntry to wrap that up in less than half an hour to move the process.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 2266 and 1921) were agreed to.\n  (The text of the amendments is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the underlying Gorton \namendment No. 1892 is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1892) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that no further \namendments be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor. I thank the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  As a courtesy to the Senator from New Jersey, all those having \nconversations will please take them off the floor.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, there is still a fair amount of \ncommotion in the Chamber, and if I might ask that the Chamber be in \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is entitled to be heard.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I hate to talk above the din, but I \nwill take the liberty of doing so if that competition continues to \nexist.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, there is no reason the Senator from New \nJersey has to insist on order. I ask that the Chair get order in the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If each Senator holding a conversation could \ngive the Senator from New Jersey their attention or take the \nconversation out of the Chamber, it would be appreciated.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the keeper of sanity in the Senate, the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, for his ever available \ncourtesy.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1922\n\n (Purpose: To state requirements applicable to air carriers that bump \n                       passengers involuntarily)\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S11945]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title IV, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 454. REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO AIR CARRIERS THAT BUMP \n                   PASSENGERS INVOLUNTARILY.\n\n       (a) In General.--If an air carrier denies a passenger, \n     without the consent of the passenger, transportation on a \n     scheduled flight for which the passenger has made a \n     reservation and paid--\n       (1) the air carrier shall provide the passenger with a one-\n     page summary of the passenger's rights to transportation, \n     services, compensation, and other benefits resulting from the \n     denial of transportation;\n       (2) the passenger may select comparable transportation (as \n     defined by the air carrier), with accommodations if needed, \n     or a cash refund; and\n       (3) the air carrier shall provide the passenger with cash \n     or a voucher in the amount that is equal to the value of the \n     ticket.\n       (b) Delays in Arrivals.--If, by reason of a denial of \n     transportation covered by subsection (a), a passenger's \n     arrival at the passenger's destination is delayed--\n       (1) by more than 2 hours after the regularly schedule \n     arrival time for the original flight, but less than 4 hours \n     after that time, then the air carrier shall provide the \n     passenger with cash or an airline voucher in the amount equal \n     to twice the value of the ticket; or\n       (2) for more than 4 hours after the regularly schedule \n     arrival time for the original flight, then the air carrier \n     shall provide the passenger with cash or an airline voucher \n     in the amount equal to 3 times the value of the ticket.\n       (c) Delays in Departures.--If the earliest transportation \n     offered by an air carrier to a passenger denied \n     transportation as described in subsection (a) is on a day \n     after the day of the scheduled flight on which the passenger \n     has reserved and paid for seating, then the air carrier shall \n     pay the passenger the amount equal to the greater of--\n       (1) $1,000; or\n       (2) 3 times the value of the ticket.\n       (d) Relationship of Benefits.--\n       (1) General and delay benefits.--Benefits due a passenger \n     under subsection (b) or (c) are in addition to benefits due a \n     passenger under subsection (a) with respect to the same \n     denial of transportation.\n       (2) Delay benefits.--A passenger may not receive benefits \n     under both subsection (b) and subsection (c) with respect to \n     the same denial of transportation. A passenger eligible for \n     benefits under both subsections shall receive the greater \n     benefit payable under those subsections.\n       (e) Civil Penalty.--An air carrier that fails to provide a \n     summary of passenger's rights to one or more passengers on a \n     flight when required to do so under subsection (a)(1) shall \n     pay the Federal Aviation Administration a civil penalty in \n     the amount of $1,000.\n       (f) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Airline ticket.--The term ``airline ticket'' includes \n     any electronic verification of a reservation that is issued \n     by the airline in place of a ticket.\n       (2) Value.--The term ``value'', with respect to an airline \n     ticket, means the value of the remaining unused portion of \n     the airline ticket on the scheduled flight.\n       (3) Without consent of the passenger.--The term ``without \n     consent of the passenger'', with respect to a denial of \n     transportation to a passenger means a passenger, is denied \n     transportation under subsection (a) for reasons other than \n     weather or safety.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I first want to thank the managers of \nthe bill and acknowledge their hard work. The distinguished Senator \nfrom Arizona and the distinguished Senator from West Virginia have \nperformed an extremely arduous task to get this bill to the place that \nit is. I don't enjoy holding the work back. I don't think I am doing \nthat. By some quirk in the process, our amendment was not offered at an \nearlier time because of a procedural mixup. I thank them. I commend \nthem for their understanding. I know they want to see this bill get \ninto law. It is very important that we do.\n  I offer an amendment on an issue that is, unfortunately, becoming \nmore and more of a problem for American travelers. That is the \nexperience of reserve paid passengers being bumped from overbooked \nairline flights.\n  I have talked to Members, and I speak from direct personal experience \nwhere airlines said: Sorry, seats are filled--even though you have \narrived on time, paid for your reservation--that is life, and we are \nsorry, and you can get there by going first to Boston, or Cincinnati, \nor what have you.\n  Our skies are more crowded than ever. People need to move quickly \nbetween different cities to do business and also to attend to a wide \nvariety of personal functions. As this need has grown, people who fly \nfind themselves increasingly at the mercy of the airlines. The airlines \nare not quite as user friendly as they used to be when they were \nscraping to get the revenues and the profits. They do not always treat \ntheir customers as they should.\n  They are pretty good. I give them credit. But in 1998, almost 45,000 \ncustomers--44,797, to be precise--were bumped from domestic flights on \nthe 10 largest carriers; 45,000 people to whom word was given, well, \nyou have lost your seat, and maybe you can get to your business \nappointment tomorrow; maybe you can miss the flight you were going to \ntake to India; or maybe the funeral that was going to be held that you \nwere going to attend can be held over for a couple of days until you \nget there.\n  Mr. President, it is not pleasant news when it happens. This year, \nthe numbers have increased. For the first 6 months, 29,213 customers \nhave been involuntarily bumped. If the trend continues, this year over \n58,000 people could be involuntarily bumped--paid for, reserved, and \njust not able to get on the airplane.\n  People with a paid reservation have a right to expect a seat on the \nflight they booked. But too often they discover that having a ticket \ndoesn't mean much when they get to the gate.\n  For the first half of the year, the number of people bumped from \nairlines has increased. Nothing ruins a business trip or a vacation \nmore thoroughly than being bumped from a flight. It is sometimes \nimpossible to make up for the lost hours and the frustration of \nrearranging longstanding business or personal plans.\n  The airlines ought not to be able to act as an elitist business. They \nhave to treat their customers with respect, just as any other seller of \nservices or products would have to do. They are the only business I \nknow of that deliberately oversells their products.\n  Can you imagine, if you go to your doctor and you have an \nappointment, it is urgent that you see him, and you get bumped because \nsomeone else took your place; or you go to buy furniture, you paid for \nit, for 3 months you want to go down and see the final product, and \nthey say, sorry, someone else took your place.\n\n  The airlines have a unique position. They also are users of a \ncommodity that belongs to the American people; that is, our airspace. \nThey use our airports that are paid for by others. They have lots of \ncommunity services that accompany this process of handling passengers. \nWhen people hold a valid ticket to a sporting event or a concert, they \nknow when they get there they are going to have a seat. They deserve \nthe same assurances when they try to fly.\n  Current practices don't go far enough. There are regulations, but \nthey don't have the teeth to get the airlines to respect passengers who \nhold paid for and reserved tickets. The regulations are out of date. \nThey don't provide incentives for the airlines to pay attention to this \noverbooking problem. The amount of compensation has not been increased \nfor those who are bumped since the early 1980s. The dollar amounts are \nnot enough to have any impact on the airlines and their decisions to \noverbook flights.\n  I do not want to see them flying with empty seats. I do not think \nthat is a good idea. People ought not to take advantage and make two, \nthree, and four reservations and then do not show up. But the airlines \nare smart enough to figure out a different way to do it. Perhaps they \nwill have to have some kind of a deposit on a reservation that is \nhonored as part of the cost of the ticket. If not, then it becomes a \nreminder to the passenger, as well as to the airline, as well as a \nbenefit to the airline, that they lost their seat.\n  While there are regulations now, we need to make this a matter of \nstatutory law so the airlines step up to this serious issue. The Senate \nneeds to send a strong message to the airlines that it cannot treat our \nconstituents as second-class citizens when they fly. We need to put \nstrong measures into law to protect consumers, and that is what this \namendment does.\n  Very simply, my amendment is not out to get the airlines. It is to \nmake sure that people are treated fairly, and we are going to have a \nchance to see whether my colleagues agree with me.\n  My amendment will make the airlines act more responsibly by allowing \ntravelers who are bumped from a flight to first choose between \nalternative travel plans or receiving a full refund. Every traveler who \nis bumped will receive cash or a travel voucher at least\n\n[[Page S11946]]\n\nequal to the amount they paid for the flight. The amount of \ncompensation would increase based on how long the person is delayed \nfrom his or her destination.\n  If a passenger is delayed more than 2 hours, he or she would receive \n200 percent of the value of his or her ticket. If a passenger cannot \ndepart that day, then he or she would receive 300 percent of the value \nof the ticket, or $1,000, whichever is greater. This will remind the \nairlines they have, after all, already sold that seat. They have \nalready gotten the income from that seat.\n\n  My amendment would also require the airlines to disclose these rights \nto passengers in a one-page, simple-language summary. The burden should \nnot be on the customer to read up on the latest Federal regulation or \nlaw to know their rights.\n  My goal is not to sponsor a ticket giveaway. The goal is to hold the \nairlines accountable when they put profits ahead of respect and service \nfor their customers.\n  I will cut short my presentation. I ask my colleagues to recognize on \nwhat we are voting. We are voting on whether or not a passenger who \ngets bumped is entitled to compensation for being refused that flight \nor whether we are going to protect the airline's ability to continue to \nsell more than one person the same seat and hope they will be able to \nget away with it.\n  That, Mr. President, concludes my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I see the majority leader on the floor. It \nis the intention of the two leaders to finish debate on this, have a \nvote on this amendment, and then have final passage by voice vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to vitiate the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I object.\n  Mr. McCAIN. On final passage.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Lautenberg amendment.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I want to speak a moment to my \ncolleagues. The Senator from New Jersey has indicated he wants to send \na strong message to the airlines. I do, too. In fact, over a period of \na number of months, a number of us have negotiated a strong message. \nWhat we did not do, however, is prescribe exactly what it was that \nwould take place with each and every one of the problems. We forced \nthem to report to us through the Department of Transportation with the \ninspector general monitoring and watching.\n  I have no objection to part of what is in this amendment, but what \nthe Senator from New Jersey gets into is the most careful kind of \nmandating: If it is more than 2 hours late, such and such; if it is 4 \nhours late, such and such penalty. It goes on. Sometimes it is three \ntimes the value of the ticket--it just depends for what it might be.\n  In other words, it is precisely the opposite of what we approached \nthe airlines to negotiate with in a very hard fashion. For example, \nthey are going to have to reply to us on notification of known delays, \ncancellations, diversions, and a lot of other subjects, and they are \ngoing to have to do it within a prescribed amount of time, to which \nthey have agreed.\n  We are going to increase penalties for consumer violations under \nwhich this amendment falls. I say to the Senator, I do not have any \nproblem with him putting forward the purpose of his amendment. I do \nhave a problem and urge my colleagues to have a problem with \nprescribing exactly how much would be paid according to which number of \nhours and how long the delay was. That is what we have tried to avoid.\n  The Senator, from the beginning, has not been for that approach, but \nthat approach is what we have agreed to with the airlines. I ask the \nSenator if he will be willing to take out on page 2, from line 9 \nthrough page 3, line 6--if he will be willing to modify his amendment \nto that extent?\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I believe under the unanimous consent \nagreement, it is now time for the vote on the Lautenberg amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I agree with the exception of one \nthing that happened I am sure was inadvertent. As I understood it, the \nunanimous consent agreement did not call for rebuttal in any way. Since \nthe distinguished Senator from West Virginia chose to rebut, I would \nlike to make a couple of sentences to respond to that, and I assume \nthere will be no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Is there objection? \nThe Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, GAO has reviewed voluntary customer \nservice plans and the GAO concluded many of the new measures that the \nairlines volunteered to do were already required in law or regulation. \nThe problem is the voluntary customer service plan says nothing on the \ntopic of involuntary bumping. Whatever there is already on the books \ndoes not do it.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this reminder to the airlines that \nthey have to take better care of the passengers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, following the Lautenberg vote, I ask \nunanimous consent that H.R. 1000 be discharged from the Commerce \nCommittee, that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration, all \nafter the enacting clause be stricken, the text of S. 82, as amended, \nbe inserted in lieu thereof, the bill be read a third time, and a voice \nvote then occur on passage of H.R. 1000. Finally, I ask consent that \nfollowing the vote, S. 82 be placed back on the calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Lautenberg amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1922. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Florida (Mr. Mack) and \nthe Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. Chafee) are necessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 30, nays 68, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 311 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--30\n\n     Baucus\n     Boxer\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Reed\n     Sarbanes\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--68\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Chafee\n     Mack\n       \n  The amendment (No. 1922) was rejected.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the importance of \ntoday's passage of S. 82, the Federal Aviation Administration \nReauthorization bill. Today is a great day for rural America's air \npassengers. This legislation, now known as the Air Transportation \nImprovement Act of 1999, will bring much needed air service to under \nserved communities throughout the Nation. It will grant billions of \ndollars in federal funds to our Nation's small\n\n[[Page S11947]]\n\nairports for upgrades, through the Airport Improvements Program (AIP).\n  Senator McCain, Chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science and \nTransportation, is to be commended for his superb leadership on this \ncomplex and contentious measure. Together with Senator Hollings, their \njoint efforts moved this bill through the committee, to the Senate \nfloor, and to conference.\n  Also, Senator Slade Gorton's leadership role in this legislation was \nvital. My friend and Colleague from the State of Washington proved \nhimself pivotal earlier during S. 82 floor consideration. His \ncounterpart, Senator Jay Rockefeller, should also be commended for his \nefforts to move this bill forward.\n  Rural Americans are the biggest winners with the passage of S. 82. \nCitizens of under served communities will no longer have to travel \nhundreds of miles and several hours to board a plane. This legislation \ngives incentives to domestic air carriers and its affiliates to reach \nout to these people and serve them conveniently near their homes. Many \nAmericans will be able to travel a reasonable distance to gain access \nto our Nation's skies and, from there, anywhere they wish to go.\n  I also applaud the hard work of Senator Frist of Tennessee. He added \nprovisions to S. 82 to expand small community air service. His \ndedicated efforts ensured that under served cities like Knoxville, \nChattanooga and Bristol/Johnson are now in a position to receive \nadditional or expanded air service. Likewise, his efforts will ensure \nthat several under served regions in my home state of Mississippi, such \nas Gulfport-Biloxi, Tupelo, or Jackson, will become eligible to compete \nfor more flights.\n  The major policy changes in S. 82 led to hard fought, but honest \ndisagreements. I have enormous respect for the efforts of Senators John \nWarner and Charles Grassley as they diligently advocated for their \nconstituents and their respective states. This honest debate and \nwillingness to work together to achieve common goals is what makes it \nexciting to serve in the United States Senate.\n  Throughout the last twelve months, my home state of Mississippi has \nreceived federal support from the AIP to make needed physical \nimprovements. A portion of these funds went to the Meridian Airport \nAuthority to rehabilitate the taxiway pavement. Other funds were \nallocated to the John C. Stennis International Airport in Hancock \nCounty to extend and light existing taxiways. These enhancements are \nneeded. And this bill will ensure that the AIP will continue \nuninterrupted for the next three years. AIP's reauthorization within S. \n82 will allow Mississippi to continue to receive funds for essential \nenhancements for the upcoming year. I look forward to working with the \nairport authorities in my home state to make sure that the right \nimprovements are made at the right airports. This is essential to \naviation safety and economic growth.\n  S. 82, through the Gorton-Rockefeller amendment, begins the process \nof evaluating current Air Traffic Control (ATC) management problems and \nimplements initial change to begin to address these problems. I hope \nthe Gorton/Rockefeller amendment will be a starting point for an \nintensive review of the ATC system next year. The delays experienced \nthis past summer will return until a long-term solution to the Nation's \nATC problems is implemented.\n  Once my Colleagues initiate ATC review, I encourage them to include \nall relevant stakeholders in this issue including officials from the \ngeneral aviation community, Department of Defense, commercial airlines \nindustry, and airports. Likewise, I hope the Senate will review other \nmodels of air traffic management, such as Nav Canada and others to \nexamine ways that other countries are addressing this matter.\n  No legislative initiation is ever possible without the dedicated \nefforts of staff, and I want to take a moment to identify those who \nworked hard to prepare S. 82 for consideration by the full Senate.\n  From the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation: \nMarti Allbright; Lloyd Ator; Mark Buse; Ann Choiniere; Julia Kraus; \nMichael Reynolds; Ivan Schlager; Scott Verstandig; and Sam Whitehorn.\n  The following staff also participated on behalf of their Senators: \nDavid Broome; Steve Browning; Jeanne Bumpus; John Conrad; Brett Hale; \nAmy Henderson; Ann Loomis; Randal Popelka; Jim Sartucci; and Lori \nSharpe.\n  These individuals worked very hard on S. 82, and the Senate owes them \na debt of gratitude for their dedicated service to this legislation.\n  Mr. President, our Nation's small communities are a step closer to \nreceiving long-sought air service. Also, America's smaller, yet \nimportant airstrips and airports will be enhanced. This is good for all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to voice my support for S. \n82, the Air Transportation Improvement Act. I would also like to take \nthis opportunity to commend Senator McCain, the Chairman of the Senate \nCommerce Committee, and Senator Hollings, the Ranking Member of that \ncommittee, for their leadership and their willingness to accommodate \nmany of our colleagues who raised concerns about various provisions in \nthe bill.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Gorton, the Chairman of the \nAviation Subcommittee, and Senator Rockefeller, the Ranking Member of \nthat committee. They truly have been tireless advocates for improving \naviation safety, security and system capacity. I would also like to \nthank the Majority Leader, Senator Lott, for the cooperation he has \nshown on this bill and for recently leading the way on another aviation \nbill that allowed the FAA to release FY99 funds for airport \nconstruction projects. Finally, I would like to thank all of my \ncolleagues for their willingness to allow timely Senate consideration \nof this must-pass legislation.\n  If it seems like the Senate has already considered legislation bill \nto authorize programs at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) \nincluding the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), that is because it \nhas. More than a year ago, the Senate passed S. 2279, the Wendell H. \nFord National Air Transportation System Improvement Act. Although there \nwas overwhelming support for this legislation in the Senate last year, \nHouse and Senate negotiators could not agree on a multi-year FAA \nauthorization bill. In October of last year, Congress passed a six-\nmonth authorization of the FAA instead. The FAA has been operating \nunder short-term extensions ever since.\n  Mr. President, this is no way to fund the FAA. Short-term extension \nafter short-term extension disrupts long-term planning at the FAA and \nat airports around the country that rely on federal funds to improve \ntheir facilities and enhance aviation safety. Perhaps the only thing \nworse than passing a short-term extension is allowing the AIP program \nto lapse all together. Unfortunately, that is exactly what Congress did \nbefore the August recess when the House failed to pass a 60-day \nextension previously approved by the Senate. Almost two months later, \nCongress passed a bill authorizing the FAA to release $290 million for \nairport construction projects just before the funds were set to expire \nat end of the fiscal year.\n  Airports around the country came within one day of losing federal \nfunds they need for construction projects. The numerous short-term \nextensions could have been avoided if Congress would have simply passed \na multi-year FAA preauthorization bill. We had our chance last year, \nand we have had more than enough time to carry out that responsibility \nthis year. The Senate Commerce Committee approved S. 82, the Air \nTransportation Improvement Act of 1999 on February 11--almost eight \nmonths ago. As my colleagues know, this legislation is almost identical \nto S. 2279, the Wendell H. Ford National Air Transportation System \nImprovement Act.\n  With the amendment offered by the managers of the bill, S. 82 would \nauthorize programs at the FAA including the AIP program through FY02. \nSpecifically, it would provide more than $2.4 billion a year for \nairport construction projects and more than $2 billion a year for \nfacilities and equipment upgrades. It would also provide between $5.8 \nbillion and $6.3 billion for the FAA's operations in FY00 through FY02.\n  S. 82 includes a number of provisions to encourage competition among \nthe\n\n[[Page S11948]]\n\nairlines and quality air service for communities. For instance, it \nwould authorize $80 million for a four-year pilot program to improve \ncommercial air service in small communities that have not benefitted \nfrom deregulation. Specifically, the bill calls for the establishment \nof an Office of Small Community Air Service Development at the \nDepartment of Transportation (DoT) to work with local communities, \nstates, airports and air carriers and develop public-private \npartnerships that bring commercial air service including regional jet \nservice to small communities.\n  I have often commented about how critical the Essential Air Service \nProgram has been to small communities in South Dakota and around the \ncountry to retain air service. Although the Small Community Aviation \nDevelopment Program would not provide a similar per passenger subsidy, \nit would give DoT the authority to provide up to $500,000 per year to \nas many as 40 communities that participate in the program and agree to \npay 25 percent in matching funds. In addition, the legislation would \nestablish an air traffic control service pilot program that would allow \nup to 20 small communities to share in the cost of building contract \ncontrol towers. I am hopeful that South Dakota will have the \nopportunity to participate in the Small Community Aviation Development \nProgram.\n  Mr. President, some have suggested that we should use S. 82 as a \nvehicle to reform the air traffic control (ATC) system. Due to a number \nof factors, including bad weather, flight delays reached record levels \nthis summer. Last month, Senator Rockefeller noted on the Senate floor \nthat air traffic control delays increased by 19 percent from January to \nJuly of this year and by 36 percent from May to June when compared to \nthe same time periods last year. The Air Transport Association \nestimates that the cost of air traffic control delays is $4.1 billion \nannually.\n  The Administrator of the FAA, Jane Harvey, recently announced a \nnumber of short-term plans to reduce air traffic control delays. \nEnsuring aviation safety must always be the FAA's top priority. But I \nthink Administrator Harvey should be commended for working with the \nairlines to determine ways to reduce air traffic control delays while \nmaintaining the FAA's commitment to safety. Although these short-term \nimprovements may help reduce flight delays, Administrator Harvey and \nSecretary of Transportation, Rodney Slater, insist that more must be \ndone to modernize the AT for the long-term.\n  Last week, Senators Rockefeller and Gorton introduced a bill with a \npackage of ATC improvements, and I am pleased that they plan to offer \nthis proposal as an amendment to Air Transportation Improvement Act. \nTheir proposal would create a Chief Operating Officer position with \nresponsibility for funding and modernizing the ATC system. It would \nalso create public-private joint ventures to purchase air traffic \ncontrol equipment. Under their proposal, FAA seed money would be \nleveraged with money from the airports and airlines to purchase and \nfield ATC modernization equipment more quickly. Although more may need \nto be done to improve the ATC system in the future, I think the plans \nannounced by Administrator Harvey and the amendment offered by Senators \nRockefeller and Gorton are steps in the right direction.\n  Mr. President, I know some of our colleagues oppose provisions in \nthat bill that would increase the number of flights at the four slot-\ncontrolled airports. The proposal to increase the number of flights at \nRonald Reagan Washington National Airport has been particularly \ncontroversial, and I would like to commend Senator Robb for being a \nstrong advocate for his constituents in Northern Virginia. Although the \namendment offered by the managers of the bill would reduce the increase \nfrom 48 to 24 new flights into Ronald Reagan Washington National \nAirport, I understand from Senator Robb that many Virginians continue \nto find that increase objectionable. I know my distinguished colleague \nfrom Virginia will continue to make persuasive arguments against the \nincrease, and I look forward to that debate.\n  Although there may be different provisions in this bill that each of \nus of may find objectionable, I hope my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting S. 82, the Air Transportation Improvement Act. We simply \ncannot continue to fund the FAA and the AIP program with short-term \nextensions. It is unfair to the FAA, and it is unfair to airports in \nSouth Dakota and throughout the country. I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport S. 82, the Air Transportation Improvement Act.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I have filed an amendment dealing with child \nexploitation which I will not press at this time. However, during the \nconference on the FAA bill, I intend to pursue the matter further. It \nis my understanding that Senator McCain will be willing to entertain \nsoon an amendment during conference. Is that correct?\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Senate struck the portion of the \nGorton slots amendment concerning O'Hare Airport and inserted a portion \nof the language that had appeared in last years measure. I understand \nthat was not done because the Chairman and Senator Rockefeller \nsupported the substance of the change. I understand there was a concern \nwith the filing of over 300 amendments on the issue. It was clear that \nwe would have had difficulty finishing the bill if the Senate was \nforced to consider those amendments. Now we can move this measure to \nconference. I am hopeful that we will see the slot rule eliminated in \ntwo phases in the conference. I believe that the O'Hare elements of the \nGorton Amendment are solid and would be an excellent position for the \nSenate to push for, given that the House has proposed to eliminate \nslots at O'Hare.\n  We need a two-step elimination of the slot rule to provide time for \nmitigation against the adverse effects of the rule. These include: the \nneed to provide for improved turboprop service for our small cities, \nthe need to provide for regional jets for our mid-sized cities, the \nneed to provide for balance between the major carriers and we need an \nability to provide for new entrant carriers to competitively compete. I \nam pleased that Senator Grassley is expected to be a conferee on the \nentire measure.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I agree with the remarks of my fellow \nSenator from Iowa. We need to eliminate the slot rule which is \ndetrimental to the air service for cities in Iowa and throughout the \nMidwest. But, the elimination of slots does need to be done in the \nproper way. Otherwise the major carriers will absorb all of the \ncapacity of the airport, not [providing sufficient service for small \nand medium sized cities. We need to provide for service by new entrant \ncarriers that can provide for real competition on the price of tickets, \nincreased ability to provide for turboprops so our smaller cities can \nhave proper service, and regional jets for improved service to mid \nsized cities. While I am pleased with the action by the House, I do \nbelieve that it is important that the conferees support the content of \nthe original Gorton proposal.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I do agree with the comments of both \nSenators from Iowa about the need to eliminate the slot rule in two \nphases at O'Hare. As I stated this morning, I am a supporter of the \nGorton slot amendment before its modification by Senator Fitzgerald. I \nintend to do what I can to have the conference report on the bill \ncontain the provisions of that measure regarding O'Hare which I believe \nis good policy.\n  Providing for a 40 month first phase during which regional jets and \nturboprop aircraft to airports with under two million enplanements, as \nwell as exemption of new entrant carriers, all under the limitations \nset out in the original amendment would be exempt from the slot rule is \ncrucial. These are key elements of a first phase in the elimination of \nslots at O'Hare. I will also support the increased service provisions \nthat allow for improved service in conference.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I fully agree with Senators Harkin \nand Grassley and Chairman McCain. It is very important that service to \nsmall and mid-sized cities be improved. I believe that the Gorton slot \nprovisions as originally proposed was good policy that I intend to \nsupport in conference. Both Senators Harkin and Grassley\n\n[[Page S11949]]\n\nhave worked hard toward the development of the slot amendment \nconcerning O'Hare and the New York Airports and their interest is well \nnoted and I intend to do what I can in conference to provide for a \nmechanism along the lines that they proposed be agreed to in the \nconference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The question is on the \nengrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport H.R. 1000 by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1000) to amend title 49, United States Code, \n     to reauthorize programs of the Federal Aviation \n     Administration, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all after the \nenacting clause of H.R. 1000 is stricken and the text of S. 82, as \namended, is inserted in lieu thereof. The question is on third reading \nof the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill (H.R. 1000), as amended, was ordered to a third reading and \nwas read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The bill (H.R. 1000), as amended, was passed, as follows:\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. S. 82 is returned to the calendar.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer. I want \nto thank some folks because this is important to do. I thank Senators \nHollings, Gorton, McCain, Daschle, Majority Leader Lott, and Senator \nDodd, obviously, on the slot question. I thank very much Senators \nSchumer, Durbin, Harkin and Robb for their cooperation.\n  On the Democratic Commerce staff, I thank Sam Whitehorn, Kevin Kayes, \nJulia Kraus and Kerry Ates, who works with me; and on the GOP Commerce \nstaff, Ann Choiniere and Michael Reynolds; and on Senator Gorton's \nstaff, Brett Hale. They have all done wonderful work and I thank them.\n  Mr. CRAPO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am sure that by now Senators have heard \nthe news that this past weekend a key element of our national missile \ndefense system was successfully tested when a self-guided vehicle \nintercepted and destroyed an intercontinental ballistic missile in \nouter space some 140 miles above the Pacific Ocean.\n  This test was another in a string of successes of our new missile \ndefense technology. The test last Saturday evening follows two \nconsecutive successful intercepts each for the PAC-3 and THAAD theater \nmissile defense systems.\n  The timing of this good news is fortunate, coming as it does a few \nweeks after our intelligence community released an unclassified summary \nof a new intelligence estimate which shows both theater and long-range \nballistic missile threats continue to grow. That summary states:\n\n       The proliferation of [Medium Range Ballistic Missiles]--\n     driven primarily by North Korean No-Dong sales--has created \n     an immediate, serious, and growing threat to U.S. forces, \n     interests and allies in the Middle East and Asia and has \n     significantly altered the strategic balances in those \n     regions.\n\n  Our new theater missile defense systems such as PAC-3, THAAD, and the \nairborne laser, and the Navy's area and theaterwide systems will help \nredress those balances and ensure the security of our forces and our \nallies.\n  The summary of the new intelligence estimate also discloses that new \nICBM threats to the territory of the United States could appear in a \nfew years and that those threats may be more sophisticated than \npreviously estimated. The summary states:\n\n       Russia and China each have developed numerous \n     countermeasures and probably are willing to sell the \n     requisite technologies.\n\n  It states that countries such as North Korea, Iran, and Iraq could \n``develop countermeasures based on these technologies by the time they \nflight-test their missiles.\n  The Washington Times reported recently that China's recent test of \nthe DF-31 ICBM employed such countermeasures, and if the Chinese are \nwilling to share this technology with rogue states such as North Korea, \nas the intelligence summary estimates, the threat we face may be more \nsophisticated than previously anticipated.\n  The intelligence summary notes a related trend that was also \nillustrated in a recent news report. It states:\n\n       Foreign assistance continues to have demonstrable effects \n     on missile advances around the world. Moreover, some \n     countries that have traditionally been recipients of foreign \n     missile technology are now sharing more amongst themselves \n     and are pursuing cooperative missile ventures.\n\n  Recently, the Jerusalem Post reported Syria is, with the help of \nIran, developing a new 500 kilometer-range missile based on the North \nKorean Scud C. According to the summary of the National Intelligence \nEstimate, Iran is receiving technical assistance from Russia, and North \nKorea from China.\n  These disturbing trends suggest the ballistic missile threat--both to \nour forces deployed overseas and to our homeland--continue to increase, \nand it makes the recent successes all the more important. I \ncongratulate the Army, the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, and \nthe contractor teams on their successes.\n  Saturday's success does not mean all the technical problems in our \nmissile defense programs are solved, but the successful intercepts do \nconfirm that the test programs are proving the technology of missile \ndefense is maturing and that, with the appropriate resources, the \ntalented men and women in our military and defense industries who are \nworking on these programs are making very impressive progress on the \ndevelopment of workable theater and national missile defense systems. \nWe should be very pleased with these successes and continue to support \na robust missile defense program.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/05/senate-section/article/S11949-3", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11949-S11950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MILLENNIUM DIGITAL COMMERCE ACT\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I wonder if the Chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, Senator Gramm, would agree to a short colloquy with respect \nto the issues we are currently addressing in S. 761, the Millennium \nDigital Commerce Act.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am pleased to discuss this legislation with my colleague \nfrom Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. It is my understanding that the Banking Committee is \ncurrently reviewing this legislation and the impact it might have on \nbanking regulations and law.\n  Mr. GRAMM. As I understand it, one proposed amendment to S. 761 \ncontains language which would preclude the use of electronic records by \nbusiness in instances where there is a state law or regulation \naffecting that record and that notification and disclosure requirements \nin particular would be precluded from being sent electronically.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRAMM. That, Mr. President, is what causes some concern. I would \nsay to the Senator from Michigan that I understand what your \nlegislation intends to do and I support the goals of this bill, but \nnotification and disclosure requirements are the responsibility of the \nBanking Committee. At this time, the Federal Reserve is formulating \nregulations for the use of electronic records by banks and mortgage \nproviders, and notification and disclosure requirements will be a part \nof the proposed rules.\n  For that reason, I believe the Banking Committee should have the \nopportunity to consider this matter.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank my colleague for explaining his thoughts on\n\n[[Page S11950]]\n\nthis bill. While I would note that the opportunities presented by \nelectronic records go beyond banks, it is certainly not my intention to \nhave this bill interfere in the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. \nTherefore, I would ask the Chairman whether the portion of the language \npertaining to records would best be removed from the bill and left for \nfurther work by the Banking Committee.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes it would. I would also say to the Senator from \nMichigan that, with this modification, I would have no further \nobjection to the consideration of this bill. Also, I want to once again \nexpress my support for what the Senator is seeking to accomplish and \npledge to assist him in this effort.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the distinguished Chairman for his input.\n  Mr. GRAMM.

Mr. President, I speak today in support of Senator \nDaschle's bill titled the Medicare Beneficiary Access to Care Act, \nS.1678. I am proud to cosponsor this important bill because it will \nprovide relief for health care providers suffering under drastic cuts \nresulting from the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997. That legislation \nhas had a very negative impact on the Medicare program and the \nfinancial viability of our medical establishments providing care under \nthat program. The Senate Minority Leader's legislation will scale back \nsome of the BBA reductions and therefore provide the necessary \nreimbursement for providers who give needed medical services to \npatients. Let me be clear, patients will be the ultimate beneficiaries \nwhen this bill is enacted. A basic fact is that any person seeking \nmedical attention will likely visit a medical establishment currently \nbeing affected by BBA payment reductions. If medical facilities close \ndue to BBA cuts, it will adversely impact not only Medicare \nbeneficiaries, but all of the citizens in that same community who need \naccess to health care.\n  Back in 1997, I did not support the Balanced Budget Act. In fact, \nwhen this came up for consideration back then I said ``Mr. President, \nthis is a huge mistake - a huge mistake.'' Realizing the vital role of \nMedicare in our country, I thought that we should be going in the \nopposite direction - providing the opportunity for all Americans to \naccess decent healthcare. Although BBA passed, I did hope that it would \nnot severely impact Medicare beneficiaries or the healthcare \nestablishments that provide their care. Unfortunately, my worst fears \nhave come true.\n  I have had an almost continuous stream of people from Minnesota come \ninto my office and tell me about the dramatic, draconian effects that \nBBA has had on the ability of medical establishments to provide needed \nmedical services to people in my state. We have heard from large \nacademic teaching hospitals, small rural clinics, home healthcare \nagencies, skilled nursing facilities, hospices and physicians. It is \nhard to think of a medical establishment that has not been impacted by \nthese cuts. According to the hospitals in my state, the total impact of \nBBA cuts for Minnesota over 5 years will be $908 million. The prognosis \nis really disturbing. We hear many service providers tell us they can \nnot continue their operations because of these cuts. They are going to \nclose their doors and shut down. Some of these establishments are \nlocated in rural settings where they are the only hospital or clinic or \nnursing facility within dozens and dozens of miles. What is going to \nhappen when these facilities close? The answer is that peoples' health \nwill suffer and the communities will suffer economically. The \ncommunities will suffer because they don't have a hospital. Businesses \nwill be reluctant to locate in a community that does not have access to \nhealthcare.\n  It doesn't have to be this way. In the United States Senate, we have \nthe opportunity to fix some of the problems created by BBA. Senator \nDaschle's bill will lessen the impact of the BBA cuts on providers, \nthus benefitting patients. I think this package will make a substantial \ndifference.\n  This bill will help our teaching hospitals by limiting further \ndecreases in the Indirect Medical Education payments. Teaching \nhospitals are important not only because they train future physicians, \nbut also because they treat a large number of Medicare beneficiaries. \nFor skilled nursing facilities, this bill will repeal the $1500 therapy \ncaps for three years until a new system can be implemented. For Home \nHealthcare Agencies, this bill postpones the 15% cut in payments for 2 \nyears. For physicians, this bill would smooth out the fluctuations in \nphysician payment rates. For Medicare Plus Choice, this bill provides \nenrollees with additional time to switch plans if their plan \nterminates. For clinics, this bill will create a new payment system \nthat is linked to 1999 costs along with subsequent updates. For \nhospices, this bill will increase hospice payments by the full market \nbasket updates.\n  This bill will allow many medical facilities in my state to continue \noperating. I'm sure the same holds true for most states. We need to \npass this bill now. Health care is too important an issue. Even though \nnot everybody has access to it, we do have a great health care system \nand it needs to be preserved. The BBA was a mistake, and now is the \ntime to limit some of the resulting adverse consequences. I hope that \nmy colleagues will join me in support of this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/05/senate-section/article/S11950-3", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to provide for the conveyances of land interests to \nChugach Alaska Corporation to fulfill the intent, purpose, and promise \nof the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n      CHUGACH ALASKA NATIVES SETTLEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President. This morning I rise to introduce \nlegislation to implement a settlement agreement between the Chugach \nAlaska Corporation (CAC) and the United States Forest Service. This \nlegislation will fulfill a long overdue commitment of the Federal \ngovernment made to certain Alaska Natives.\n  I am terribly troubled and disappointed that Congress must once again \nstep in to secure promises to Alaska Natives that at best have been \nunnecessarily delayed by this Administration and at worst have been \ntrampled by them.\n  This legislation will accomplish three goals:\n  It will direct the Secretary of Agriculture to, not later than 90 \ndays after enactment, grant CAC the access rights they were granted \nunder the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act.\n  It will return to CAC cemetery and historical sites they are entitled \nto under section 14(h)(1) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.\n  It will require the Secretary of Agriculture to coordinate the \ndevelopment, maintenance, and revision of land and resource management \nplans for units of the National Forest System in Alaska with the plans \nof Alaska Native Corporations for the utilization of their lands which \nare intermingled with, adjacent to, or dependent for access upon \nNational Forest System lands.\n\n\n                               Background\n\n  Pursuant to section 1430 of the Alaska National Interest Lands \nConservation Act (ANILCA), the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary \nof Agriculture, the State of Alaska, and the CAC, were directed to \nstudy land ownership in and around the Chugach Region in Alaska. The \npurpose of this study was twofold. The first purpose was to provide for \na fair and just settlement of the Chugach people and realizing the \nintent, purpose, and promise of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act \nby CAC. The second purpose was to identify lands that, to the maximum \nextent possible, are of like kind and character to those that were \ntraditionally used and occupied by the Chugach people and, to the \nmaximum extent possible, those that provide access to the coast and are \neconomically viable.\n  On September 17, 1982, the parties entered into an agreement now \nknown as the 1982 Chugach Natives, Inc. Settlement Agreement that set \nforth a fair and just settlement for the Chugach people pursuant to the \nstudy directed by Congress. Among the many provisions of this agreement \nthe United States was required to convey to CAC not more than 73,308 \nacres of land in the vicinity of Carbon Mountain. The land eventually \nconveyed contained significant amounts of natural resources that were \ninaccessible by road. A second major provision of the Settlement \nAgreement granted CAC rights-of-way across Chugach National Forest to \ntheir land and required the United States to also grant an easement for \nthe purpose of constructing and using roads and other facilities \nnecessary for development of that tract of land on terms and conditions \nto be determined in accordance with the Settlement Agreement. It is \nobvious that without such an easement the land conveyed to CAC could \nnot be utilized or developed in a manner consistent with the intent of \nCongress as expressed in ANILCA and ANCSA.\n  More than seventeen years after the Settlement Agreement was signed \nthe much needed easement still has not been granted and CAC remains \nunable to make economic use of their lands. It seems absurd to me that \nCongress passed a Settlement Act for the Benefit of Alaska Natives; \nthen the federal government entered into a Settlement Agreement to \nimplement that Act where the CAC was concerned; and today, we find \nourselves once again in a position of having to force the government to \ncomply with these agreements.\n  I have spoken directly to the Chugach Forest Supervisor, the Regional \nForester, and to the Chief of the Forest Service about this issue. Just \nlast month I facilitated a meeting between the Forest Service and CAC \nto work out final details. While the parties thought they had an \nagreement in principle it fell apart once it reached Washington, D.C. \nTherefore, I find it necessary to once again have Congress rectify \ninaction on behalf of the Forest Service.\n  It is my intent to hold a hearing on this issue in the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee as soon as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 1687. A bill to amend the Federal Trade Commission Act to \nauthorize appropriations for the Federal Trade Commission; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n          federal trade commission reauthorization act of 1999\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Federal Trade \nCommission Reauthorization Act. The bill will authorize funding for the \nCommission for fiscal years 2001 and 2002. The measure sets spending \nlevels at $149 million in FY 2001 and increases that amount for \ninflation and mandatory pay benefits to $156 for FY 2002.\n  The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has two primary missions: (1) the \nprevention of anticompetitive conduct in the marketplace; and (2) the \nprotection of consumers from unfair or deceptive acts or practices. The \nCommission accomplishes its anticompetitive mission primarily through \npremerger reviews under that Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. Under that Act, \nmerger and acquisitions of a specified size are reviewed for \nanticompetitive impact. During the 1990's, the number of mergers that \nmet these size requirements tripled. This has placed an increased \nburden on the Commission.\n  Additionally, the Commission pursues claims of unfair or deceptive \npractices or acts--essentially fraud. As electronic commerce on the \nInternet increases, fraud will certainly increase with it and the FTC \nshould and will play a role in protecting consumers on the Internet, as \nthey do in the traditional market place. The Commission's performance \nof these dual missions is vital to the protection of consumers.\n  The Commission was last reauthorized in 1996. That legislation \nprovided for funding levels of $107 million in FY 1997 and $111 million \nin FY 1998. The bill I introduce today increases the previous \nauthorization by $37 million. In general, the increase is necessary to \nmeet the rising number of merger reviews under the Hart-Scott-Rodino \nAct and to protect consumers in the expanding world of e-commerce. \nAccording to the Commission's justification, the new authorization \nwould fund 25 additional employees to work on merger and Internet \nissues. It will also help the Commission upgrade its computing \nfacilities and fund increased consumer education activities.\n  The authorization, however, does not provide for the full amount \nrequested by the Commission. In a recent request, the Commission asked \nfor $176 million in FY2002. While I agree the Commission plays an \nimportant role in protecting consumers, their request represents more \nthan a 50% increase in their authorization over a four-year period. At \nthis point, I am not convinced that such a dramatic increase is \nwarranted.\n  As we move through the authorization process, I look forward to \nhearing further from the FTC as to why such\n\n[[Page S11953]]\n\nan increase is needed to meet its statutory functions. I also hope to \nexplore other ways we can improve the Commission's ability to protect \ncustomers without increasing spending.\n  For example, I was very interested in the comments of the FTC nominee \nThomas Leary during his confirmation hearing regarding the Commission's \nmerger review process. I know over the past few years, the Commission \nhas taken steps to simplify this process reducing its own costs and the \ncosts to the business community. Mr. Leary indicated, however, that \nmore work could be done to change the internal procedures of the FTC to \nfurther reduce the number of reviews without harming competition. I \nlook forward to exploring this topic with Mr. Leary and the other \ncommissioners.\n  I look forward to working with the members of the Commerce Committee, \nthe full Senate, and the Commission as we move through the \nauthorization process.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 1688. A bill to amend chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code, \nrelating to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, to enable \nthe Federal Government to enroll an employee and the family of the \nemployee in the program when a State court orders the employee to \nprovide health insurance coverage for a child of the employee, but the \nemployee fails to provide the coverage, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n    federal employees health benefits children's equity act of 1999\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce, along with my \ndistinguished colleague Senator Akaka, the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Children's Equity Act of 1999.\n\n  This legislation concerns Federal employees who are under a court \norder to provide health insurance to their dependent children. If a \nFederal employee is under such a court order and his dependent children \nhave no health insurance coverage, the Federal government would be \nauthorized to enroll the employee in a ``family coverage'' health plan. \nIf the employee is not enrolled in any health care plan, the Federal \ngovernment would be authorized to enroll the employee and his or her \nfamily in the standard option of the service benefit plan. The bill \nwould also prevent the employee from canceling health coverage for his \ndependent children for the term of the court order.\n  This bill would close a loophole created by the 1993 Omnibus Budget \nReconciliation Act. The 1993 bill required each State to enact \nlegislation requiring an employer to enroll a dependent child in an \nemployee's group health plan when an employee is under a court order to \nprovide health insurance for his or her child but neglects to do so. \nThis legislation simply provides Federal agencies with the same \nauthority granted to the states.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1688\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, \n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Employees Health \n     Benefits Children's Equity Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ENROLLMENT OF CERTAIN EMPLOYEES AND FAMILY.\n\n       Section 8905 of title 5, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsections (f) and (g) as subsections \n     (g) and (h), respectively; and\n       (2) by inserting after subsection (e) the following:\n       ``(f)(1)(A) An unenrolled employee who is required by a \n     court or administrative order to provide health insurance \n     coverage for a child who meets the requirements of section \n     8901(5) may enroll for self and family coverage in a health \n     benefits plan under this chapter.\n       ``(B) The employing agency of an employee described under \n     subparagraph (A) shall enroll the employee in a self and \n     family enrollment in the option which provides the lower \n     level of coverage under the service benefit plan if the \n     employee--\n       ``(i) fails to enroll for self and family coverage in a \n     health benefits plan that provides full benefits and services \n     in the location in which the child resides; and \n       ``(ii) does not provide documentation demonstrating that \n     the required coverage has been provided through other health \n     insurance.\n       ``(2)(A) An employee who is enrolled as an individual in a \n     health benefits plan under this chapter and who is required \n     by a court or administrative order to provide health \n     insurance coverage for a child who meets the requirements of \n     section 8901(5) may change to a self and family enrollment \n     in--\n       ``(i) the health benefits plan in which the employee is \n     enrolled; or\n       ``(ii) another health benefits plan under this chapter.\n       ``(B) The employing agency of an employee described under \n     subparagraph (A) shall change the enrollment of the employee \n     to a self and family enrollment in the plan in which the \n     employee is enrolled if--\n       ``(i) such plan provides full benefits and services in the \n     location where the child resides; and\n       ``(ii) the employee--\n       ``(I) fails to change to a self and family enrollment; and\n       ``(II) does not provide documentation demonstrating that \n     the required coverage has been provided through other health \n     insurance.\n       ``(C) The employing agency of an employee described under \n     subparagraph (A) shall change the coverage of the employee to \n     a self and family enrollment in the option which provides the \n     lower level of coverage under the service benefit plan if--\n       ``(i) the plan in which the employee is enrolled does not \n     provide full benefits and services in the location in which \n     the child resides; or\n       ``(ii) the employee fails to change to a self and family \n     enrollment in a plan that provides full benefits and services \n     in the location where the child resides.\n       ``(3)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), an employee who is \n     subject to a court or administrative order described under \n     this section may not discontinue the self and family \n     enrollment in a plan that provides full benefits and services \n     in the location in which the child resides for the period \n     that the court or administrative order remains in effect if \n     the child meets the requirements of section 8901(5) during \n     such period.\n       ``(B) Enrollment described under subparagraph (A) may be \n     discontinued if the employee provides documentation \n     demonstrating that the required coverage has been provided \n     through other health insurance.''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to require a report on the current United States \npolicy and strategy regarding counter-narcotics assistance for \nColombia, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n\n\n           colombian counter-narcotics assistance legislation\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I share many of my colleagues \nconcerns about the need to do more to aid Colombia. But I also believe \nthat our aid must be based on a clear and consistent plan, not on good \nintentions. We do Colombia no favors by throwing money at the problem. \nWe do not help ourselves. Too often, throwing money at a problem is the \nsame thing as throwing money away. For that reason, I, along with \nSenator Helms and Senator DeWine, am introducing legislation today \ncalling on the U.S. Administration to present a plan.\n\n  Colombia is the third largest recipient of U.S. security aid behind \nIsrael and Egypt. It is also the largest supplier of cocaine to the \nUnited States. But, we seem to find ourselves in the midst of a muddle. \nOur policy appears to be adrift, and our focus blurred.\n  This past Tuesday, the Caucus on International Narcotics Control held \na hearing to ask the Administration for a specific plan and a detailed \nstrategy outlining U.S. interests and priorities dealing with counter-\nnarcotics efforts in Colombia. Before we in Congress get involved in a \ndiscussion about what and how much equipment we should be sending to \nColombia, we need to discuss whether or not we should send any and why. \nRecent press reports indicate that the Administration is preparing a \nsecurity assistance package to Colombia with funding from $500 million \ndollars to somewhere around $1.5 billion dollars.\n  And yet, Congress hasn't been able to evaluate any strategy. That's \nbecause there is none. From the hearing, it seems the Administration is \nincapable of thinking about the situation with\n\n[[Page S11954]]\n\nany clarity or articulating a strategy with any transparency. It seems \nconfused as to what is actually happening in Colombia.\n  At Tuesday's hearing, representatives from the Department of State \nand the Department of Defense assured me they were currently working on \na detailed strategy to be unveiled at some future point. So far there \nhave been difficulties in creating a detailed and coherent strategy and \npresenting it to Congress. Today we are introducing a bill that \nrequires the Secretary of State to submit to Congress within 60 days a \ndetailed report on current U.S. policy and strategy for counter-\nnarcotics assistance for Colombia.\n  This is an issue that will not just simply disappear. Before we begin \nappropriating additional funding for Colombia, we need strategies and \ngoals, not just piecemeal assistance and operations. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MACK (for himself, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. DeWine, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n        Dodd, and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 1690. A bill to require the United States to take action to \nprovide bilateral debt relief, and improve the provision of \nmultilateral debt relief, in order to give a fresh start to poor \ncounties; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n               debt relief for poor countries act of 1999\n\n Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nMaryland, Mr. Sarbanes, to introduce the Debt Relief for Counties Act \nof 1999. This bill simply forgives much of the debt owed to us by the \nworld's poorest countries in exchange for commitments from these \ncountries to reform their economies and work toward a better quality of \nlife for their people. Our effort today is premised on the fact that we \nmust help these poverty-stricken nations break the vicious cycle of \ndebt and give them the economic opportunity to liberate their futures. \nI ask my colleagues to join me in this worthwhile effort.\n  Today, the world's poorest countries owe an average of $400 for every \nman, woman, and child within their borders. This is much more than most \npeople in these countries make in a year. Debt service payments in many \ncases consume a majority of a poor country's annual budget, leaving \nscarce domestic resources for economic restructuring or such vital \nhuman services as education, clean water and sanitary living \nconditions. In Tanzania, for example, debt payments would require \nnearly four-fifths of the government's budget. In a country where one \nchild in six dies before the age of five, little money remains to \nfinance public health programs. Among Sub-Saharan African countries, \none in five adults can't read or write, and it is estimated that in \nseveral countries almost half the population does not have access to \nsafe drinking water.\n  Mr. President, the problems that yield such grim statistics will \nnever be solved without a monumental commitment of will from their \nleaders, their citizens, and the outside world. That is not what we \npropose to do here today. Our bill is only a small step in the right \ndirection, but it is one we can do quickly and for relatively little \ncost.\n  The effort to forgive the debts of the world's poorest countries has \nbeen ongoing for more than a decade. During this time the international \ncommunity and the G7 came to the realization that the world's poorest \ncountries are simply unable to repay the debt they owe to foreign \ncreditors. The external debt for many of the developing nations is more \nthan twice their GDP, leaving many unable to even pay the interest on \ntheir debts. We must accept the fact that this debt is unpayable. the \nquestion is not whether we'll ever get paid back, but rather what we \ncan encourage these heavily indebted countries to do for themselves in \nexchange for our forgiveness.\n  Our bill requires the President to forgive at least 90 percent of the \nentire bilateral debt owed by the world's heavily indebted poor \ncountries in exchange for verifiable commitments to pursue economic \nreforms and implement poverty alleviation measures. While roughly $6 \nbillion is owed to the United States by these poor countries, it is \nestimated the cost of forgiving this debt would be less than ten \npercent of that amount. The U.S. share of the bilateral debt is less \nthan four percent of the total, but our action would provide leadership \nto the rest of the world's creditor nations and provide some savings \nbenefits to these countries as well.\n  Our bill also requires a restructuring of the IMF and World Bank's \nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC). This program was \nbegun in 1996, but to date only three countries have received any \nrelief. While the premise of HIPC is sound, its shortcomings have \nbecome evident during the implementation. It promises much, but in \nreality it benefits too few countries, offers too little relief, and \nrequires too long a wait before debt is forgiven. A process of \nreforming the HIPC was begun this year during the G7's meeting in \nCologne, and our bill meets or exceeds the standards set out in the \nCologne communique.\n\n  Specifically, we shorten the waiting period for eligibility from six \nto three years. We extend the prospect of relief to more countries. And \nwe ensure that savings realized from the relief will be used to enhance \nongoing economic reforms in addition to initiatives designed to \nalleviate poverty. This is a sound and balanced approach to help these \npoor countries correct their underlying economic problems and improve \nthe standard of living of their people.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is not a handout to the developing \nworld. Rather, it is an investment in these countries' commitment to \nimplementing sound economic reforms and helping their people live \nlonger, healthier and more prosperous lives. In order to receive debt \nrelief under our bill, countries must commit the savings to policies \nthat promote growth and expand citizens' access to basic services like \nclean water and education.\n  We have included a strict prohibition in our bill on providing relief \nto countries that sponsor terrorism, spend excessively on their \nmilitaries, do not cooperate on narcotics matters, or engage in \nsystematic violations of their citizens' human rights. We are not \nproposing to help any country that is not first willing to help itself.\n  Mr. President, the debt accumulated in the developing world \nthroughout the Cold War and into the 1990s has become a significant \nimpediment to the implementation of free-market economic reforms and \nthe reduction of poverty. We in the developed world have an interest in \nremoving this impediment and providing the world's poorest countries \nwith the opportunity to address their underlying economic problems and \nset a course for sustainability.\n  I believe our bill is an important first step in this process and I \nlook forward to the support of my colleagues in the Senate.\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with \nmy colleague from Florida, Mr. Mack, in introducing the ``Debt Relief \nfor Poor Countries Act of 1999.'' This bill is the companion \nlegislation to H.R. 1095, offered in the House by Representatives Leach \nand LaFalce and cosponsored by 116 other Members.\n  The purpose of the bill is to provide the world's poorest countries \nwith relief from the crippling burden of debt and to encourage \ninvestment of the proceeds in health, education, nutrition, sanitation, \nand basic social services for their people.\n  All too often, payments on the foreign debt--which account for as \nmuch as 70 percent of government expenditures in some countries--mean \nthere is little left to meet the basic human needs of the population. \nIn effect, debt service payments are making it even harder for the \nrecipient governments to enact the kinds of economic and political \nreforms that the loans were designed to encourage, and that are \nnecessary to ensure broad-based growth and future prosperity.\n  To address this problem the World Bank and the IMF began a program in \n1996 to reduce $27 billion in debt from the most Heavily Indebted Poor \nCountries, known as the ``HIPC Initiative.'' But the program created a \nnumber of stringent criteria and provided only partial relief, which \nmeant that only a small number of countries actually qualified for \nparticipation and the ones who did received only marginal benefits \nafter an extended period of time.\n  Following calls by non-government organizations, religious groups and \nmember governments for faster and\n\n[[Page S11955]]\n\nmore flexible relief, the G-7 Finance Ministers, meeting this past June \nin Cologne, Germany, proposed alternative criteria that would make \nexpanded benefits available quicker and to more countries. Last week, \nat the annual World Bank-IMF meetings here in Washington, President \nClinton pledged to cancel all $5.7 billion of debt owed to the U.S. \ngovernment by 36 of the poorest countries, and he sent a supplemental \nrequest for $1 billion over 4 years to pay the U.S. portion of the \nmultilateral initiative. Canceling the debt will not cost the full $5.7 \nbillion because many of the loans would never have been repaid and are \nno longer worth their full face-value. I commend the President for \nexercising international leadership on this important issue and for \nmaking it a foreign policy priority.\n  The legislation we are offering today goes even further by requiring \nthe President to forgive at least 90 percent of the U.S. non-\nconcessional loans and 100 percent of concessional loans to countries \nthat meet the eligibility guidelines. To qualify, the countries must \nhave an annual per capita income of less than $925, have public debts \ntotaling at least 150 percent of average annual exports, and agree to \nuse the savings generated by debt relief to facilitate the \nimplementation of economic reforms in a way that is transparent and \nparticipatory, to reduce the number of persons living in poverty, to \npromote sustainable growth and to prevent damage to the environment.\n  Countries that have an excessive level of military expenditures, \nsupport terrorism, fail to cooperate in international narcotics control \nmatters, or engage in a consistent pattern of gross violations of \ninternationally recognized human rights are not eligible for debt \nrelief under this legislation.\n  In addition, the bill urges the President to undertake diplomatic \nefforts in the Paris Club to reduce or cancel debts owed bilaterally to \nother countries, and to work with international financial institutions \nto maximize the impact of the HIPC Initiative. The United States \naccounts for less than 5 percent of the total debt burden, so it is \nessential that relief is provided in a coordinated and comprehensive \nfashion.\n  Mr. President, countries should not be forced to make a tradeoff \nbetween servicing their debt and feeding their people. And once debt is \nrelieved, we should ensure that the savings are being used to reduce \npoverty and improve living standards, so that the benefits are widely \nshared among the population. This bill achieves both objectives, and I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to ensure its prompt \nconsideration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. Graham, and Mr. Voinovich):\n  S. 1691. A bill to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \nEmergency Assistance Act to authorize programs for predisaster \nmitigation, to streamline the administration of disaster relief, to \ncontrol the Federal costs of disaster assistance, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                    disaster mitigation act of 1999\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nDisaster Mitigation Act of 1999. As the chairman of the Senate \nSubcommittee with jurisdiction over FEMA, I have been working on this \nlegislation for the last couple of years. I am joined in the \nintroduction today with my ranking member Senator Bob Graham. I \nappreciate his commitment to this legislation and I look forward to \nworking with him to shepherd this Bill through the process.\n  We have been witness to several major natural disasters already this \nyear. And, we have three more months to go. We have seen devastating \ntornadoes ravage Oklahoma City and Salt Lake City. We have also seen \nthe destruction brought on the East Coast by hurricanes Dennis and \nFloyd. Our hearts go out to the victims of these natural disasters. I \nwas in Oklahoma City the morning of May 4, the day after the tornadoes \nmoved through the Oklahoma City metro area. I have never seen \ndestruction like that any place in the world. I was moved by the \nstories I heard and saw as we traveled through the remains of entire \nneighborhoods.\n  Now a few months later, I see and hear stories of the destruction \nbrought by the flooding in North Carolina and I know the problems that \nlie ahead as they begin to recover. As the recovery effort begin, our \nhearts and our prayers go out to the people of North Carolina.\n  The Federal government, through FEMA, has been there to help people \nand their communities deal with the aftermath of disasters for over a \ngeneration. As chairman of the oversight Subcommittee I want to ensure \nthat FEMA will continue to respond and help people in need for \ngenerations to come. Unfortunately, the costs of disaster recovery have \nspiraled out of control. For every major disaster Congress is forced to \nappropriate additional funds through Supplemental Emergency Spending \nBills. This not only plays havoc with the budget and forces us to spend \nfunds which would have gone to other pressing needs, but sets up \nunrealistic expectations of what the federal government can and should \ndo after a disaster.\n  For instance, following the Oklahoma City tornadoes, there was an \nestimated $900 million in damage, with a large portion of that in \nfederal disaster assistance. Now, in the aftermath of hurricane Floyd \nin North Carolina, estimates of $1 billion or more in damages are being \ndiscussed. This problem is not just isolated to Oklahoma City or North \nCarolina. In the period between fiscal years 1994 and 1998, FEMA \ndisaster assistance and relief costs grew from $8.7 billion to $19 \nbillion. That marks a $10.3 billion increase in disaster assistance in \njust five years. To finance these expenditures, we have been forced to \nfind over $12 billion in rescissions.\n  The Bill I am introducing today will address this problem from two \ndifferent directions. First, it authorizes a Predisaster Hazard \nMitigation Program, which assists people in preparing for disasters \nbefore they happen. Second, it provides a number of cost-saving \nmeasures to help control the costs of disaster assistance.\n\n  In our bill, we are authorizing PROJECT IMPACT, FEMA's natural \ndisaster mitigation program. PROJECT IMPACT authorizes the use of small \ngrants to local communities to give them funds and technical assistance \nto mitigate against disasters before they occur. Too often, we think of \ndisaster assistance only after a disaster has occurred. For the very \nfirst time, we are authorizing a program to think about preventing \ndisaster-related damage prior to the disaster. We believe that by \nspending these small amounts in advance of a disaster, we will save the \nfederal government money in the long-term. However, it is important to \nnote that we are not authorizing this program in perpetuity. The \nprogram, as drafted, is set to expire in 2003. If PROJECT IMPACT is \nsuccessful, we will have the appropriate opportunity to review its work \nand make a determination on whether to continue program.\n  We are also proposing to allow states to keep a larger percentage of \ntheir federal disaster funds to be used on state mitigation projects. \nIn Oklahoma, the state is using its share of disaster funds to provide \na tax rebate to the victims of the May 3 tornadoes who, when rebuilding \ntheir homes, build a ``safe room'' into their home. Because of limited \nfunding, this assistance is only available to those who were \nunfortunate enough to lose everything they owned. We seek to give \nstates more flexibility in determining their own mitigation priorities \nand giving them the financial assistance to follow through with their \nplans.\n  While we are attempting to re-define the way in which we respond to \nnatural disasters, we must also look to curb the rising cost of post-\ndisaster related assistance. The intent of the original Stafford Act \nwas to provide federal assistance after States and local communities \nhad exhausted all their existing resources. As I said earlier, we have \nlost sight of this intent.\n  To meet our cost saving goal, we are making significant changes to \nFEMA's Public Assistance program. One of the most significant changes \nin the PA program focuses on the use of insurance. FEMA is currently \ndeveloping an insurance role to require States and local government to \nmaintain private or self-insurance in order to qualify for the PA \nprogram. We applaud their efforts and are providing them with some \nparameters we expect them to follow in developing any insurance rule.\n\n[[Page S11956]]\n\n  Second, we are providing FEMA with the ability to estimate the cost \nof repairing or rebuilding projects. Under current law, FEMA is \nrequired to stay in the field and monitor the rebuilding of public \nstructures. By requiring FEMA to stay afield for years after the \ndisaster, we run up the administrative cost of projects. Allowing them \nto estimate the cost of repairs and close out the project will bring \nimmediate assistance to the State or local community and save the \nFederal government money.\n  We have spent months working closely with FEMA, the States, local \ncommunities, and other stakeholders to produce a bill that gives FEMA \nthe increased ability to respond to disasters, while assuring States \nand local communities that the federal government will continue to meet \nits commitments.\n  In closing, I want to thank Senator Graham for his help and the \nleadership he has taken on this important issue. Without his help, \ninput, and insight, this legislation would be little more than an idea. \nAs we continue to move this bill forward in the process, I look forward \nto continuing to work with him to make this legislation a \nreality.\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to join my distinguished \ncolleague from Oklahoma in introducing legislation that creates public \nand private incentives to reduce the cost of future disasters.\n  On June 1st, the start of the 1999 Hurricane Season, the National \nWeather Service predicted that the United States would face three or \nfour intense hurricanes during the next six months.\n  We did not have a long wait to experience the accuracy of that \nforecast. From September 12-15, 1999, Hurricane Floyd dragged 140 mph \nwinds and eight foot tidal surges along the eastern seaboard. Floyd \ncaused flooding, tornadoes, and massive damage from Florida to New \nJersey. Evacuations were conducted as far north as Delaware. This \ndisaster claimed the lives of 68 people. Initial damage estimates \nsuggest that Floyd could cost the federal government more than $6 \nbillion. Just days later, Tropical Storm Harvey struck Florida's west \ncoast. We are still assessing the combine effects of these storms.\n  Coming just seven years after Hurricane Andrew damaged 128,000 homes, \nleft approximately 160,000 people homeless, and caused nearly $30 \nbillion in damage, this year's developments remind us of the \ninevitability and destructive power of Mother Nature. We must prepare \nfor natural disasters if we are going to minimize their devastating \neffects.\n  It is impossible to stop violent weather. But Congress can reduce the \nlosses from severe weather by legislating a comprehensive, nationwide \nmitigation strategy. Senator Inhofe and I have worked closely with \nFEMA, the National Emergency Management Association, the National \nLeague of Cities, the American Red Cross, and numerous other groups to \nconstruct a comprehensive proposal that will make mitigation--not \nresponse and recovery--the primary focus of emergency management.\n  Our legislation amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \nEmergency Assistance Act. It will: Authorize programs for pre-disaster \nemergency preparedness; streamline the administration of disaster \nrelief; restrain the Federal costs of disaster assistance; and provide \nincentives for the development of community-sponsored mitigation \nprojects.\n  Mr. President, history has demonstrated that no community in the \nUnited States is safe from disasters. From tropical weather along the \nAtlantic Coast to devastating floods in the Upper Midwest to \nearthquakes in the Pacific Rim, we have suffered as a result of Mother \nNature's fury. She will strike again. But we can avoid some of the \nexcessive human and financial costs of the past by applying what we \nhave learned about preparedness technology.\n\n  Florida has been a leader in incorporating the principles and \npractice of hazard mitigation into the mainstream of community \npreparedness. We have developed and implemented mitigation projects \nusing funding from the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, the Flood \nMitigation Assistance Program and other public-private partnerships.\n  Everyone has a role in reducing the risks associated with natural and \ntechnological related hazards. Engineers, hospital administrators, \nbusiness leaders, regional planners and emergency managers and \nvolunteers are all significant contributors to mitigation efforts.\n  An effective mitigation project may be as basic as the Miami Wind \nShutter program. The installation of shutters is a cost-effective \nmitigation measure that has proven effective in protecting buildings \nfrom hurricane force winds, and in the process minimizing direct and \nindirect losses to vulnerable facilities. These shutters significantly \nincrease strength and provide increased protection of life and \nproperty.\n  In 1992, Hurricane Andrew did $17 million worth of damage to Baptist, \nMiami South, and Mercy Hospitals in Miami. As a result, these hospitals \nwere later retrofitted with wind shutters through the Hazard Mitigation \nGrant Program.\n  Six years after Hurricane Andrew, Hurricane Georges brushed against \nSouth Florida. The shutter project paid dividends. Georges' track \nmotivated evacuees to leave more vulnerable areas of South Florida to \nseek shelter. The protective shutters allowed these three Miami \nhospitals to serve as a safe haven for 200 pregnant mothers, prevented \nthe need to evacuate critical patients, and helped the staff's families \nto secure shelter during the response effort.\n  In July of 1994, Tropical Storm Alberto's landfall in the Florida \nPanhandle triggered more than $500 million in federal disaster \nassistance. State and local officials concluded that the direct \nsolution to the problem of repetitive flooding was to remove or \ndemolish the structures at risk. A Community Block Grant of $27.5 \nmillion was used to assist local governments in acquiring 388 extremely \nvulnerable properties.\n  The success of this effort was evident when the same area experienced \nflooding again in the spring of 1998. While both floods were of \ncomparable severity, the damages from the second disaster were \nsignificantly lower in the communities that acquired the flood prone \nproperties. This mitigation project reduced their vulnerability.\n  We have an opportunity today to continue the working partnership \nbetween the federal government, the states, local communities and the \nprivate sector. In mitigating the devastating effects of natural \ndisasters, it is also imperative that we control the cost of disaster \nrelief. Our legislation will help in this effort. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support this initiative.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAMS:\n  S. 1693.

ANNIVERSARY OF THE FORCE\n\n  By Mr. WARNER (for himself and Mr. Dodd) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 196\n\n       Whereas the submarine force of the United States was \n     founded with the purchase of the U.S.S. HOLLAND on April 11, \n     1900;\n       Whereas in overcoming destruction resulting from the attack \n     of United States forces at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December \n     7, 1941, and difficulties with defective torpedoes, the \n     submarine force destroyed 1,314 enemy ships in World War II \n     (weighing a cumulative 5,300,000 tons), which accounts for 55 \n     percent of all enemy ships lost in World War II;\n       Whereas 16,000 United States submariners served with \n     courage during World War II, and 7 United States submariners \n     were awarded Congressional Medals of Honor for their \n     distinguished gallantry in combat above and beyond the call \n     of duty;\n       Whereas in achieving an impressive World War II record, the \n     submarine force suffered the highest casualty rate of any \n     combatant submarine service of the warring alliances, losing \n     375 officers and 3,131 enlisted men in 52 submarines;\n       Whereas from 1948 to 1955, the submarine force, with \n     leadership provided by Admiral Hyman Rickover and others, \n     developed an industrial base in a new technology, pioneered \n     new materials, designed and built a prototype reactor, \n     established a training program, and took to sea the world's \n     first nuclear-powered submarine, the U.S.S. NAUTILUS, thus \n     providing America undersea superiority;\n       Whereas subsequent to the design of the U.S.S. NAUTILUS, \n     the submarine force continued to develop and put to sea the \n     world's most advanced and capable submarines, which were \n     vital to maintaining our national security during the Cold \n     War;\n       Whereas the United States Navy, with leadership provided by \n     Admiral Red Raborn, developed the world's first operational \n     ballistic missile submarine, which provided an invaluable \n     asset to our Nation's strategic nuclear deterrent capability, \n     and contributed directly to the eventual conclusion of the \n     Cold War; and\n       Whereas in 1999, the submarine force provides the United \n     States Navy with the ability to operate around the world, \n     independent of outside support, from the open ocean to the \n     littorals, carrying out multimission taskings on tactical, \n     operational, and strategic levels: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n       (a) That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the past and present personnel of the \n     submarine force of the United States Navy for their technical \n     excellence, accomplishments, professionalism, and sacrifices; \n     and\n       (B) congratulates those personnel for the 100 years of \n     exemplary service that they have provided the United States.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that, in the next \n     millennium, the submarine force of the United States Navy \n     should continue to comprise an integral part of the Navy, and \n     to carry out missions that are key to maintaining our great \n     Nation's freedom and security as the most superior submarine \n     force in the world.\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my colleague from the great state \nof Connecticut Senator Dodd and I rise today to pay tribute to the \nNaval Submarine Force and to submit a resolution to commemorate the \n100th anniversary of this outstanding institution.\n  In the year 2000 the United States Navy Submarine Force celebrates \nits one hundredth anniversary.\n  The Submarine Force began with the purchase of U.S.S. Holland on \nApril 11, 1900. The past 100 years have witnessed the evolution of a \nforce that mastered submersible warfare, introduced nuclear propulsion \nto create the true submarine, and for decades patrolled the deep ocean \nfront line: the hottest part of an otherwise cold war.\n  Beginning in World War I the Submarine Force began to support \nnational interests through offensive and defensive operations in the \nAtlantic. Using lessons learned from German U-boat design, the US \nSubmarine Force developed advanced diesel submarine designs during the \ninter-war years. In spite of a hesitant beginning due to Pearl Harbor \nand difficulties with defective torpedoes, the World War II submarine \nforce destroyed 1,314 enemy ships (5.3 million tons), which translated \ninto 55 percent of all enemy ships lost. Out of 16,000 submariners, the \nforce lost 375 officers and 3,131 enlisted men in fifty-two submarines, \nthe highest casualty rate of any combatant submarine service on any \nside in the conflict. Seven Congressional Medals of Honor were awarded \nto submariners during World War II for distinguished gallantry in \ncombat.\n  Mr. DODD. After World War II the Submarine Force began experimenting \nwith high speed, sophisticated silencing techniques, sensitive sonic \ndetection, and deeper diving designs. Admiral Hyman G. Rickover lead \nthe effort which resulted in the world's first nuclear powered \nsubmarine, USS Nautilus, commissioned in 1955. The advent of nuclear \npropulsion resulted in the first true submarine, a vessel that was \ntruly free to operate unrestricted below the surface of the ocean.\n  Continued development of advanced submarine designs lead to the most \ncapable submarine fleet in the world. The United States Navy, led by \nAdmiral Red Raborn, also fielded the world's first operational \nsubmarine launched ballistic missile platform in the world. This force \nprovided invaluable support to our national security and strategic \nnuclear deterrence. The end of the cold war has been credited in part \nto the deterrent role that the strategic ballistic submarine played in \nour nuclear triad.\n  Through the 1980's and 1990's the submarine force has continued to \ncontribute to all aspects of our country's national security strategy \nfrom Desert Storm to Yugoslavia. The sailors who have taken our \nsubmarines to sea over the years should be commended for their \noutstanding service and performance. Always on the cutting edge, the \nsubmarine force will help the Navy sustain the adaptability necessary \nto maintain our national security in and around the oceans of our \nworld.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, Senator Dodd and I would like to \ncongratulate the Naval Submarine Force on its 100th anniversary and on \nall the accomplishments it has achieved during that time.\n  On a personal note, I wish to acknowledge the contributions of the \nSubmarine Force Senior Leadership since its inception, many of whom I \nam proud to have known and worked closely with over the years. And for \nthe next 100 years, may our Submarine Force run silent, run deep.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/05/senate-section/article/S11958-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11958-S11980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED ON OCTOBER 4, 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   AIR TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 McCAIN (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 1891\n\n  Mr. GORTON (for Mr. McCain (for himself, Mr. Gorton, and Mr. \nRockefeller)) proposed an amendment to the bill (S. 82) to authorize \nappropriations for the Federal Aviation Administration, and for other \npurposes; as follows:\n\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

and\n       (C) creating a toll-free, private-sector operated, \n     telephone number, staffed by multilingual operators, to \n     provide assistance to international tourists coping with an \n     emergency;\n       (9) by establishing a satellite system of accounting for \n     travel and tourism, the Secretary of Commerce could provide \n     Congress and the President with objective, thorough data that \n     would help policymakers more accurately gauge the size and \n     scope of the domestic travel and tourism industry and its \n     significant impact on the health of the Nation's economy; and\n       (10) having established the United States National Tourism \n     Organization under the United States National Tourism \n     Organization Act of 1996 (22 U.S.C. 2141 et seq.) to increase \n     the United States share of the international tourism market \n     by developing a national travel and tourism strategy, \n     Congress should support a long-term marketing effort and \n     other important regulatory reform initiatives to promote \n     increased travel to the United States for the benefit of \n     every sector of the economy.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are to provide \n     international visitor initiatives and an international \n     marketing program to enable the United States travel and \n     tourism industry and every level of government to benefit \n     from a successful effort to make the United States the \n     premiere travel destination in the world.\n       (c) International Visitor Assistance Task Force.--\n       (1) Establishment.--Not later than 9 months after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Commerce shall \n     establish an Intergovernmental Task Force for International \n     Visitor Assistance (hereafter in this subsection referred to \n     as the ``Task Force'').\n       (2) Duties.--The Task Force shall examine--\n       (A) signage at facilities in the United States, including \n     airports, seaports, land border crossings, highways, and bus, \n     train, and other public transit stations, and shall identify \n     existing inadequacies and suggest solutions for such \n     inadequacies, such as the adoption of uniform standards on \n     international signage for use throughout the United States in \n     order to facilitate international visitors' travel in the \n     United States;\n       (B) the availability of multilingual travel and tourism \n     information and means of disseminating, at no or minimal cost \n     to the Government, of such information; and\n       (C) facilitating the establishment of a toll-free, private-\n     sector operated, telephone number, staffed by multilingual \n     operators, to provide assistance to international tourists \n     coping with an emergency.\n       (3) Membership.--The Task Force shall be composed of the \n     following members:\n       (A) The Secretary of Commerce.\n       (B) The Secretary of State.\n       (C) The Secretary of Transportation.\n       (D) The Chair of the Board of Directors of the United \n     States National Tourism Organization.\n       (E) Such other representatives of other Federal agencies \n     and private-sector entities as may be determined to be \n     appropriate to the mission of the Task Force by the Chairman.\n       (4) Chairman.--The Secretary of Commerce shall be Chairman \n     of the Task Force.

Mr. President, I rise today to propose an amendment \nto the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization bill \nbecause our nation has experienced an explosion in air travel this past \ndecade. Air transportation is now as much a means of mass transit as \nautomobiles and trains. Indeed, our economic good fortune and increased \ncompetition from air carriers has led to a buyer's market for \npassengers looking for affordable fares to countless destinations. \nWhile we are all amazed by the dramatic growth in the airline industry, \nwe must also consider the ramifications that increased flights and \naircraft noise have on the communities surrounding airport facilities.\n  In my home state of Rhode Island, T.F. Green State Airport, our \nstate's only major airport, has experienced tremendous expansion over \nthe past several years. With more than 4 million passengers flying into \nand out of Rhode Island each year, representing a 100 percent increase \nover three years ago, the number of take offs and landings has likewise \nclimbed. This has led to intolerable noise pollution for the airport's \nneighbors. Of course, this problem is not isolated to Rhode Island. In \nfact, cities and towns across the country are dealing with similar \ngrowing pains. While T.F. Green and numerous airport authorities in our \nnation are taking steps to insulate homes and other structures from the \neffects of aircraft noise, the problem cannot be eliminated entirely. \nAnd, we must not forget that there is only so much we can do on the \nground to reduce noise. We must also deal with noise at its point of \norigin by researching and developing quieter jet engine technology.\n  On December 31 of this year, the FAA will require that all civil \naircraft comply with Stage 3 noise regulations. This requires that jet \nengines emit less noise through hushkit adaptations on older, noisier \nengines, or that air carriers invest in new and quieter Stage 3 \ncompliant engines. While this is a big step in the right direction, the \ndeadline for compliance with Stage 3 must not end progress toward \nquieter jet engines, but mark the beginning of Stage 4 research.\n  Currently, the FAA is working in cooperation and consultation with \nthe International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to define Stage 4 \nnoise levels and reach an agreement with ICAO member states on a plan \nfor implementation of Stage 4 regulations. While this research is in \nits preliminary stages, our nation's aviation infrastructure must be \nready to adopt Stage 4 rules to ensure quieter communities in which \nresidents can enjoy their open spaces and where learning at schools is \nnot interrupted every several minutes to defer to the roar of passing \nplanes.\n  Mr. President, my amendment would direct the Secretary of \nTransportation to report to Congress no later than December 31, 2002 \nthe findings of a study on aircraft noise problems in the United \nStates, the status of negotiations between the FAA and ICAO on Stage 4 \nnoise levels, and the feasibility of proceeding with development and \nimplementation of a timetable for air carrier compliance with Stage 4 \nnoise requirements.\n  This amendment will ensure that both airport authorities and air \ncarriers are aware of developments regarding Stage 4 activities, and \nthat we move in an expeditious and deliberate manner to maintain the \nmomentum we have gained toward making quieter both jet engines and the \ncommunities over which they fly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        VOINOVICH AMENDMENT 1906\n\n  Mr. McCAIN (for Mr. Voinovich) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. \n82, supra; as follows:\n\n       Strike section 437.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                COLLINS (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 1907\n\n  Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Burns, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Robb, Mr. \nHollings, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Grassley, Mr. \nJohnson, and Mr. Thomas) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 82, \nsupra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. ____01.

QUIET COMMUNITIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1)(A) for too many citizens of the United States, noise \n     from aircraft, vehicular traffic, and a variety of other \n     sources is a constant source of torment; and\n       (B) nearly 20,000,000 citizens of the United States are \n     exposed to noise levels that can lead to psychological and \n     physiological damage, and another 40,000,000 people are \n     exposed to noise levels that cause sleep or work disruption;\n       (2)(A) chronic exposure to noise has been linked to \n     increased risk of cardiovascular problems, strokes, and \n     nervous disorders; and\n       (B) excessive noise causes sleep deprivation and task \n     interruptions, which pose untold costs on society in \n     diminished worker productivity;\n       (3)(A) to carry out the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et \n     seq.), the Noise Control Act of 1972 (42 U.S.C. 4901 et \n     seq.), and section 8 of the Quiet Communities Act of 1978 (92 \n     Stat. 3084), the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency established an Office of Noise Abatement \n     and Control;\n       (B) the responsibilities of the Office of Noise Abatement \n     and Control included promulgating noise emission standards, \n     requiring product labeling, facilitating the development of \n     low emission products, coordinating Federal noise reduction \n     programs, assisting State and local abatement efforts, and \n     promoting noise education and research; and\n       (C) funding for the Office of Noise Abatement and Control \n     was terminated in 1982, and no funds have been provided \n     since;\n       (4) because of the lack of funding for the Office of Noise \n     Abatement and Control, and because the Noise Control Act of \n     1972 (42 U.S.C. 4901 et seq.) prohibits State and local \n     governments from regulating noise sources in many situations, \n     noise abatement programs across the United States lie \n     dormant;\n       (5) as the population grows and air and vehicle traffic \n     continues to increase, noise pollution is likely to become an \n     even greater problem in the future; and\n       (6) the health and welfare of the citizens of the United \n     States demands that the Environmental Protection Agency once \n     again assume a role in combating noise pollution.\n       (b) Transfer of Noise Abatement Duties.--Section 402 of the \n     Noise Pollution and Abatement Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. 7641) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)--\n       (A) in paragraph (2), by redesignating subparagraphs (A) \n     through (G) as clauses (i) through (vii) and indenting \n     appropriately;

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) animals are live, sentient creatures, with the ability \n     to feel pain and suffer;\n       (2) it is inappropriate for animals transported by air to \n     be treated as baggage;\n       (3) according to the Air Transport Association, over \n     500,000 animals are transported by air each year and as many \n     as 5,000 of those animals are lost, injured, or killed;\n       (4) most injuries to animals traveling by airplane are due \n     to mishandling by baggage personnel, severe temperature \n     fluctuations, insufficient oxygen in cargo holds, or damage \n     to kennels;\n       (5) there are no Federal requirements that airlines report \n     incidents of animal loss, injury, or death;\n       (6) members of the public have no information to use in \n     choosing an airline based on its record of safety with regard \n     to transporting animals;\n       (7) the last congressional action on animals transported by \n     air was conducted over 22 years ago; and\n       (8) the conditions of cargo holds of airplanes must be \n     improved to protect the health, and ensure the safety, of \n     transported animals.\n\n                       Subtitle A--Animal Welfare\n\n     SEC. __11. DEFINITION OF TRANSPORT.\n\n       Section 2 of the Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. 2132) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(p) Transport.--The term `transport', when used with \n     respect to the air transport of an animal by a carrier, means \n     the transport of the animal during the period the animal is \n     in the custody of the carrier, from check-in of the animal \n     prior to departure until the animal is returned to the owner \n     or guardian of the animal at the final destination of the \n     animal.''.\n\n     SEC. __12.

BUDGET TREATMENT OF AVIATION PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) In order to enforce Congressional Budget Resolutions \n     and help control Federal spending, there are currently at \n     least 22 different points of order in the Congressional \n     Budget Act of 1974. Many of these points of order require a \n     supermajority vote in the Senate.\n       (2) With the exceptions of Social Security and the Postal \n     Service, all Federal Government spending is on-budget. On-\n     budget treatment is the most appropriate way to account for \n     spending the taxpayers' money.\n       (3) Since 1990, the existence of the discretionary spending \n     limits has been an extremely useful tool in Congress battle \n     against explosive Federal Government spending and the \n     deficit. Their existence has appropriately forced Congress \n     and the President to revisit the effectiveness of programs \n     and prioritize the use of taxpayers' money.\n       (4) Funding for Federal aviation programs is a high \n     priority for this Congress and sufficient funding is \n     available within the existing discretionary spending limits \n     to adequately address the aviation needs of our country.\n       (5) Creating additional budgetary constraints or points of \n     order--designed to dictate the outcome of future spending \n     debates--is unnecessary and unwise. To do so would require \n     the affirmative vote of a supermajority for final passage in \n     the Senate and would prevent future Congresses from making \n     the best spending decisions appropriate to our rapidly \n     changing world.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the current budgetary treatment of aviation programs \n     represents sound fiscal policy and encourages the best \n     decisionmaking; and\n       (2) this Act or any other legislation which provides for \n     the reauthorization of funding for programs of the Federal \n     Aviation Administration shall not contain special budgetary \n     treatment including off-budget status, separate categories of \n     spending within the existing discretionary spending limits--\n     also known as firewalls--or any new points of order.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   ABRAHAM AMENDMENTS NOS. 2247-2251\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. ABRAHAM submitted 5 amendments intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill S. 82, supra; as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 2247\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, I rise to extend my sincerest \ncongratulations to the town of Oakland, Maryland, as it enters its \nSesquicentennial Year on October 10, 1999. Oakland, the county seat of \nGarrett County, enjoys a long and proud history in the State of \nMaryland.\n  Nestled in the Appalachian Mountains, Oakland is blessed with a \nnatural beauty all four seasons, from snowy hills in winter to pastel \nflowers in spring to lush foliage in summer to gorgeous red, orange and \ngold trees in autumn. Even Oakland's early name, ``Yough Glades,'' \nconjures up images of river and forest, natural beauty and abundant \nresources.\n  Oakland's rich history tells a story of a small farming community \nwhich grew with the opening of the first sawmill, expanded with the \narrival of the railroad and continues to grow with old and new \nlivelihoods alike, all the while treasuring those qualities which make \nit special--beauty, peacefulness and small town charm.\n  ``A Brief History of Oakland, Maryland'' by John Grant describes the \npeople, forces and events which shaped the town of Oakland. Three \nIndian trails met in a meadow on the western edge of Oakland and formed \nan entrance into the Yough Glades where Native Americans hunted in the \nforest and fished in the Youghiogheny River for hundreds and hundreds \nof years. White settlers followed in the 1790s as the fertile soil in \n``Glades\" country attracted more and more farmers.\n  Around 1830, the first combination gristmill and sawmill provided \nlumber for the homes and shops in the growing community. On October 10, \n1849, the town which had been known by several different names \nincluding Yough Glades became ``Oakland.''\n  The arrival of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1851 triggered a \ngrowth spurt in Oakland. Business and tradesmen frequented the newly \nbuilt Glades Hotel and more people moved to the town. In 1862, Oakland \nincorporated a regular town government and in 1872 Oakland was selected \nas the County Seat of the newly formed Garrett County. The B Railroad \ncontinued its influence on the growth of the town with its construction \nof the Oakland Hotel in 1875. The hotel attracted many summer visitors, \nseveral of whom later built summer homes in Oakland.\n  Tragedy has struck Oakland more than once, and each time the town \nbounced back. The Wilson Creek flooded in 1896 and periodically over \nthe next 70 years before a series of dams built in the late 1960s \ncontrolled the flooding. A devastating fire destroyed the business \nsection of Oakland in 1898. The town used brick fire walls when \nrebuilding the downtown area, a farsighted decision which paid off in \n1994 when fire struck again. This time only two buildings were \ndestroyed.\n  Natural resources and beauty have long contributed to Oakland's \neconomy and continue to do so today. The lumber industry, which began \nin the late 1800s, still provides jobs in Oakland. Coal, another \nnatural resource, is found in the mountains near Oakland and adds to \nthe economy of the town. And Oakland's natural beauty, which drew \nvisitors to the Oakland Hotel in 1875, continues to attract people from \nall over the country seeking not only its beautiful vistas, but also \nits myriad of recreational opportunities all year round. Today, \nvisitors to Oakland can choose from a variety of activities including \nhiking, biking, fishing, boating and skiing.\n  The town of Oakland reminds us of all that is good in our country. \nOakland is a place where fire and rescue services are still staffed by \nvolunteers, where folks greet each other with a friendly wave and \nhello, where people work together to support their schools and \ncommunity, and where patriotism runs deep. In so many ways, Oakland is \ntruly a ``Main Street Community,'' as the State of Maryland has so \nfittingly designated it.\n  Once again, I extend my congratulations to Oakland on their 150th \nanniversary and I invite all my colleagues to visit this Maryland \ntreasure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/05/senate-section/article/S12046-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12046-S12047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ALBERT ENGELKEN\n\n Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, for 28 years Albert Engelken was \nthe man behind the scenes at the American Public Transit Association \n(APTA), a Washington-based member organization advancing and \nrepresenting the interests of public transit systems and industry \nsuppliers across North America.\n  He was the creative force for the vast majority of APTA's ``People \nPrograms,'' including the innovative International Bus Roadeo, where \ndrivers and mechanics compete in events that test\n\n[[Page S12047]]\n\ntheir skills at operating and maintaining public transit vehicles. His \nefforts at this endeavor also spawned the equally competitive \nInternational Rail Roadeo.\n  Albert Engelken was the originator of ``Transit Appreciation Day,'' \nwhich later became ``Try Transit Week,'' an annual fixture that \nencourages people to ride public transit, and salutes those who make \nthe systems work. His creativity also extended to judging and selecting \nthose systems that demonstrated excellence in transit advertising, a \nprogram now known as ``AdWheel,'' an important event held at the \nAssociation's annual meeting.\n  Albert Engelken's education programs developed transit information \nmodules for thousands of grade school teachers throughout the United \nStates. And, until his retirement in 1997, Albert Engelken produced the \nAmerican Public Transit Association's Grant Awards Ceremony, an event \nthat honors transit systems, individuals, and achievements in the \npublic transit industry.\n  That ceremony continues today, and while lacking the unique skills \nAlbert brought to directing the national and local arrangements that \npublicized the winners, the ceremony this year will honor him by \nelecting him to the prestigious APTA Hall of Fame.\n  He was also the long-time editor of the Association's ``Passenger \nTransport'' weekly newspaper, and directed the industry's successful \ncommunications strategy in the important formative years of the federal \ntransit program. Over his entire career with APTA, Albert's behind-the-\nscenes work--from speechwriting to the orchestration of presentations \nand the stage management of events--were critical to the success of \nAPTA's member programs and the smooth functioning of APTA's many \nconferences.\n  Albert is known by his family, colleagues, and peers as a person who \nwould always go the extra mile to help them out. No task was too small \nor too complicated to be turned away. He is a gentleman, trusted \nfriend, and caring confidant. Yet he has never sought the spotlight not \ntaken a bow over his work in public transit and APTA.\n  Those are just some of the reasons to honor Albert Engelken, Mr. \nPresident. At work and in the community he has touched thousands of \nlives, and made life safer and easier for hundreds of thousands of \ntransit users and providers across our nation.\n  He is a also great family man. His wife Betsy, children Jane, \nElizabeth and Richard and their spouses, and his five grandchildren can \ncertainly attest to that.\n  Mr. President, I join them and his colleagues in congratulating \nAlbert Engelken for a job well done, and in applauding his induction \ninto the American Public Transit Hall of Fame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/05/senate-section/article/S12047-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN RECOGNITION OF JOAN FLATLEY\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an \noutstanding woman in the State of New Jersey. Joan Flatley is being \nhonored with the prestigious Spirit of Asbury Award for her activism \nand commitment to the Asbury Park community. Joan is recently retired \nas the Executive Director of the Asbury Park Chamber of Commerce, and \nher legacy in the community will be felt for years to come.\n  For over twelve years, John used her depth of knowledge and breadth \nof experience to contribute to the successful functioning of the \nChamber. It is through her effort that the Chamber became a dynamic \nforce in the Asbury Park business community, and the State of New \nJersey as a whole. Joan has been the main force behind the Chamber's \ndevelopment and growth. She has consistently been receptive to the \ncommunity's need, and has responded to them under the auspices of the \nChamber. The Chamber is now a respected source of information, both in \nAsbury Park and across the country, for business and community events. \nWithout Joan's unyielding commitment, the Chamber's development would \nnot have been as pronounced.\n  Joan's continued and unwavering service to the people of Asbury Park \nis indicative of her love of the community in which she lives. Whether \nshe was giving out travel information, sending out newsletters or \norganizing a business meeting, Joan met every task with an unbridled \nenthusiasm and pleasantness that made the community around her a better \nplace to live. Indeed it is a testament to her service that New \nJerseyans from every walk of life from across the state have come to \ncelebrate the end of her distinguished career.\n  Joan's dedication to community service has always been clear, and the \npeople of Asbury Park have benefitted from her involvement. I can think \nof few individuals more worthy of this distinguished award than Joan \nFlatley, and I am pleased to extend my congratulations to her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/05/senate-section/article/S12047-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN HONOR OF EVA B. ISRAELSEN\n\n Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I was sad to learn of the death of \nMrs. Eva Israelsen of North Logan, Utah this past week. As one of Cache \nValley's oldest living residents, she was a remarkable woman.\n  Eva May Butler Israelsen was born October 5, 1894, in Butlerville, \nUtah. She attended Butlerville School as a young girl. A diligent \nstudent throughout her life, she was Valedictorian of the first \ngraduating class of Jordan High School in 1915. I find it remarkable \nthat just nine years ago, she and the other surviving class member, \nThomas J. Parmley celebrated their 75th class reunion. In 1991 she was \ninvited to be the featured speaker at Jordan High School's graduation.\n  She attended the Utah Agricultural College (now Utah State \nUniversity) where she met her husband Victor Eugene Israelsen. They \nwere married in the Salt Lake LDS Temple in 1917. After college, she \nand her husband farmed, eventually establishing the North Logan \nButtercup Dairy where she lived for 63 years. That dairy became a \nlandmark in Cache Valley.\n  Eva was known throughout Cache Valley simply as ``Grandma \nIsraelsen.'' She kept numerous journals and granted countless \ninterviews to young people in the community who sought her out for her \nperspective and historical knowledge. She remained active in her \ncommunity and her church throughout her life. With support from her \nchildren, she attended nearly every funeral, wedding and baby blessing \nin the community. She was active in the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers \nand blessed the lives of her neighbors through her charitable example \nand her Christian life.\n  Grandma Israelsen had a remarkable memory, often recalling details \nabout not only her own family members and grandchildren but of the \nfamilies of her neighbors and acquaintances. It was common for her to \nask her neighbors about their children by name, even though she may not \nhave seen them for years. The residents of North Logan will miss that, \njust as they miss waiving to her on her morning walks which she used to \ntake back when she was a young woman of just 101.\n  She and her husband had eleven children, eight of which are living. \nHer husband Victor passed away in 1967. Her progeny includes 67 \ngrandchildren, 271 great-grandchildren and 40 great-great \ngrandchildren. Including the 97 spouses, she is survived by 483 family \nmembers.\n  Grandma Israelsen would have been 105 years old today. So on her \nbirthday, I want to pay tribute to her life and express my condolences \nto her family on her passing. She was a remarkable woman who led a \nremarkable life. Sophocles once said ``One must wait until the evening \nto see how splendid the day has been.'' In her passing, I am sure that \nthe community agrees that it was indeed splendid to spend the day with \nEva Israelsen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/05/senate-section/article/S12047-3", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12047-S12048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO JAMES ARTHUR GAY III\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to James \nArthur Gay III, a pioneer black civic leader from Las Vegas. Through \nhis tireless efforts, he was instrumental in the fight to desegregate \nLas Vegas. Jimmy Gay was one of the first black hotel executives in Las \nVegas in the 1950s at a time when his longtime friends Sammy Davis Jr., \nNat ``King'' Cole and others were not allowed to stay overnight in \nstrip hotels.\n  Mr. Gay was one of the best known and respected local black leaders \nof his generation. Among his accomplishments are many ``firsts''. He \nwas the\n\n[[Page S12048]]\n\nfirst black to obtain a mortician's license in the state of Nevada, the \nfirst black to be appointed to the Nevada Athletic Commission, and the \nfirst black in the United States to be certified as a water safety \ninstructor by the Red Cross. He also was a national record holder in \nthe 100-yard dash and an alternate on the 1936 U.S. Olympic track team.\n  Born in Fordyce, Arkansas in 1916, Jim was the youngest of three \nchildren. When he was just 3 years old, Jim was orphaned. Beginning his \nexperience with work at age 7 as a house boy, Jim developed a strong \ncommitment to work at an early age. He moved to Las Vegas in 1946 as a \ncollege-educated man having earned his degree from the University of \nArkansas. Although he was educated and ambitious, getting a job in Las \nVegas was virtually impossible at the time. He started out as a cook at \nSills Drive-In, a popular restaurant in the area of Charleston and Las \nVegas Boulevard working hard to prove himself. In the late 1940s, \npeople became aware of Jimmy's many talents. Jim's first break in Las \nVegas came when the city opened the Jefferson Recreation Center in West \nLas Vegas. He was hired as the Director and among other things also \ncoached football, swimming and basketball. His break in business came \nwhen he was hired as the Sands hotel-casino Director of Communications \nwhich was one of the highest posts held by a black at that time. During \nthis period, the Sands was one of the Las Vegas Strips finest.\n  In 1941, Jimmy married Hazel Gloster and together they raised a \nfamily of five children, 10 grand-children and 17 great-grandchildren. \nAlways finding time for his community, he was an active member of the \nexecutive board of the NAACP. He also was active in local politics \nserving as a member of the Clark County Democratic Central Committee \nand on the executive board of Culinary Local 226.\n  Jimmy discovered the world of the hotel industry and opened \nopportunities for many. Over the years, Jimmy served as an executive at \nthe Sands, Union Plaza, Fremont, Aladdin and Silverbird hotels. He \nearned the respect of many for his tireless efforts and his love for \nthe city of Las Vegas.\n  Deservingly, the state of Nevada has honored Jimmy Gay by naming him \na Distinguished Nevadan in 1988 and a few years before, the city of Las \nVegas named a park after him. In 1985, the city of Las Vegas and the \nstate of Nevada honored him with ``Jimmy Gay Day.'' For his civic \nefforts, Jimmy was named Las Vegas Jaycees Man of the Year in 1952 and \nreceived a City of Hope commendation in 1959. On numerous occasions he \nwas named NAACP Man of the year. His contributions have not only left a \nlasting impression on many, but also served as an inspiration to \ngenerations of young people growing up in Nevada. Over the years, Jimmy \nhelped many deserving black students receive scholarships to his alma \nmater.\n  It was once written that ``Some people walk through our life and \nleave after a few seconds. Others come in and stay there for a very \nlong time leaving marks that will never be forgotten.'' Jimmy Gay is \none of those whose legacy will remain for the countless Nevadans whose \njourney will be easier because of his pioneering efforts. Las Vegas is \na better place because Jimmy Gay went above and beyond to advance the \ncause of social justice. The best one can hope for life is to make a \ndifference with their time on earth. There is no doubt that Jimmy Gay \nmade a tremendous difference.\n  On September 10, 1999 at the age of 83 Jimmy Gay died of \ncomplications of a stroke. He will be missed but will remain one of the \nmost admired and respected local Las Vegas leaders to have graced the \ncity. This U.S. Senator is a better person because of the friendship he \nenjoyed with Jimmy Gay and Nevada is a better state because of his \nlifelong effort to ensure equality for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/05/senate-section/article/S12048-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12048-S12049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CORNELIUS HOGAN\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to \nstand before my esteemed colleagues and speak of my good friend, \nCornelius Hogan, who is retiring as Secretary of the Vermont Agency of \nHuman Services. His work in leading state government to improve the \nwell-being of Vermonters stands as a example for us all.\n  The Vermont Agency of Human Services includes the departments of \nSocial Welfare, Corrections, Social and Rehabilitation Services, Mental \nHealth, Alcohol and Drug Abuse, Aging and Disabilities. Secretary Hogan \nhas not only administered these vital services through extraordinary \nchanges, but has provided outstanding leadership, recognized throughout \nthe Nation. This agency, with the State's largest budget, must have a \nhuman face in its efforts to improve the lives of Vermonters. Con Hogan \nis that face.\n  Secretary Hogan has served as Vermont's Secretary of Human Services \nsince 1991 when then-Governor Richard Snelling enticed him back into \npublic service from his successes in the private sector. Previously, \nHogan served as Commissioner of Corrections.\n  Throughout his eight year tenure, Con has been remarkably effective \nand always gracious in his approach to each challenge. When Vermonters \nin need have a problem, Con has been the person that folks turned to \nwhen all else had failed. As Chris Graff, a Vermont journalist, noted:\n\n       Hogan is a legend. And for the past eight years, when \n     people knew that Con Hogan was coming, they had hope. And \n     confidence. Confidence that whatever the trouble, whatever \n     the problem, whatever the need, someone who cared deeply \n     would do what ever it took to help.\n\n  As a result of Con's work, Vermont families and communities have \nimproved educational opportunities, a better health care system, \nincreased employment for the disabled and an expanded network of family \nsupport services. By demanding that government define, seek, and \nevaluate its efforts, Con has set a new example for public service in \nVermont and the country.\n  More Vermont children have health care coverage, and have had it for \nlonger, than almost any state in the country. The state is offering \nmore home and community based care options for the elderly and \ndisabled. Disabled Vermonters are working and, thereby, supporting \nthemselves and their families. Con Hogan's ultimate legacy will be the \nthousands of lives that have been directly touched by the work of the \nAgency of Humans Services under his stewardship.\n  He, of course, will describe his work as collaborative and the \nconsequence of others' good will and efforts. He is right, as he has \nled efforts to open government to the ideas, hopes, and information \nfrom citizens, industry and business. He has fostered a real public \ndebate about the well-being of Vermonters and the responsibilities of \ngovernment and its citizens to participate, evaluate, and dream for \nbetter things.\n  Secretary Hogan's vision is alive and full of vibrant change. Con has \nchanged our ways of thinking. He is the mastermind of dozens of \npartnerships in which human services providers now collaborate with \nothers in state and local governments, and communities to deliver \nlocally-based services. Con recognizes and encourages citizen \nparticipation as essential to this process. He has convinced service \nproviders that they should listen to real people - that the child, the \nelder or the youth needs to be the center of their concerns.\n  Over the last several weeks, many Vermonters have written to their \nlocal papers, touting Con Hogan's work as Secretary. Con has \nsignificantly changed thousands of Vermonters lives, both through \npolicy and through his own untiring advocacy. The results have \nimpressed his colleagues and friends alike.\n  I was moved when I read a commentary in the Burlington Free Press by \nmy good friend, David S. Wolk, Superintendent of Schools in Rutland \nCity. David pointed out that it was Con Hogan's success in the private \nand public sectors, as well as his impeccable reputation as both a \nmanager and a leader, that led then-Governor Snelling to appoint him as \nthe state's premier advocate for Vermonters in need.\n  David aptly notes that Con's relentless advocacy has been coupled \nwith his unique capacity to reach out to the wider community. His \nstrong and effective leadership has presented important dualities:\n\n       Con Hogan could have remained in the private sector to seek \n     his fortune and fame. Instead, he offered a selfless \n     contribution to public service, an emphasis on accountability \n     with measurable outcomes and an impressive brand of \n     leadership, combining pressure and support, characterized by \n     candor\n\n[[Page S12049]]\n\n     and courage. . .. If the ultimate goal of the consummate \n     public citizen is to improve our collective lot, and to enjoy \n     the privilege of making one's personal mark on Vermont's \n     well-being, then no other public citizen called to service in \n     our wonderful state has achieved that pinnacle more than \n     Cornelius D. Hogan of Plainfield.\n\n  On a personal note, I have enjoyed witnessing Con's talents, not only \nin public service but on the stage, as an accomplished bluegrass \nmusician. Con's passion and zeal for life is evident in all that he \ndoes.\n  Mr. President, I'm sure I could stand here all day, and regale my \ncolleagues with stories and tributes to this remarkable man and still, \nCon's contribution would not be described adequately. For us to \nthoroughly understand the impacts of his sage and exemplary leadership, \nthe outcomes of Con Hogan's service to Vermonters will need to be \nmeasured far into the new millennium.\n  I join my fellow Vermonters in offering my most heartfelt \ncongratulations and gratitude to Con Hogan for his years of public \nservice, and I wish him all the best in his new endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/05/senate-section/article/S12049-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 1692\n\n  Mr. CRAPO.

Mr. President, I appreciate the fact that the Democratic \nleader is still here. I know he had urgent meetings he had to go to. We \nneeded to get that final recorded vote and pass that bill. I appreciate \nhis patience on that. Also, I think he and I both agree that we want to \nadvise Members on both sides of the aisle and all concerned that we are \ndiscussing how to proceed with the vote that is now in place on the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  After we discussed our concerns about how and when to proceed on \nthat, then there started to be a lot of speculation on both sides of \nthe aisle and all around town. I think it is important for Members to \njust calm down and relax. We need to have the ability to communicate \nwith each other and think about what is in the best interest of the \nSenate and our country and weigh all of the evidence that is now \navailable to us.\n  We do have a unanimous consent agreement that we will proceed to this \nissue, and we will have a vote after the requisite number of hours, \nprobably on the 12th, or perhaps the morning of the 13th before we get \nto final passage. Nothing more than that has been done.\n  We will have to work through this, and we will certainly have to work \nwith our respective caucuses and the White House, because this is a \nvery important national security and foreign policy issue, and we will \nalso have to be involved in the consideration in how we proceed on this \nissue.\n\n  I think that is what we need to say at this point. Nothing beyond \nthat has been agreed to, suggested, or called for by the President, or \nby any Senator, and all we are trying to do is communicate and see if \nwe are proceeding in the best interests of all concerned.\n  Would the Senator like to add to that?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I agree with the characterization made \njust now by the majority leader. I think all we can do is continue to \ndiscuss the matter to see if we might proceed in a way that would \naccommodate the concerns and needs of both caucuses. I think what the \nmajority leader said, especially about rumors, and how all this began \nis irrelevant. In fact, the more rumors, the more this matter is \nexacerbated. If we really want to try to proceed successfully, we need \nto quell the rumors and get on with trying to talk with dispassionate \nvoices and make sure we make the right decisions. We are prepared to do \nthat, and I know the majority leader is prepared to do that. That is \nall that needs to be said at this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/05/senate-section/article/S12049-3", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 6, 1999\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
