The Senate will now hear you.\n  The Presiding Officer recognizes Mr. Manager McCollum to resume the \npresentation of the case for the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. Manager McCOLLUM. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, and my colleagues in the Senate, I drove in this \nmorning to this Capitol. I drove up the George Washington Parkway, and \nI looked at the magnificent display of ice that was all over the trees, \nall over the grass, all over the foliage--a beautiful panorama.\n  And just before I got to the 14th Street Bridge, I saw this \nincredible number of geese--I guess in the hundreds--that were lined up \ntogether between the highway and the Potomac River. It looked like they \nwere an invading army. I thought of the awe of this, the awe of the \nbeauty of it, the awe of Mother Nature, the awe of God. And I thought, \nalso, of the awe of the responsibility we have to our children and our \ngrandchildren about what we are commencing today. This is an awesome \nundertaking for all of us.\n  I am here today to summarize for you what you heard yesterday. I do \nnot want to bore you. I do not intend to do that. I am going to be as \nbrief as I can. I am also here to help you digest the voluminous \nquantities of material that you have before you. There is a huge record \nout there. And I am also here to prepare you for the law discussion \nthat is going to come after me about the law of the crimes of perjury \nand obstruction of justice and witness tampering.\n  First of all, I want you to know I bear no personal animosity toward \nour President. But I happen to believe that if the President--if any \nPresident--commits the crimes of perjury, obstruction of justice, and \nwitness tampering, he should not be allowed to remain in office, for if \nhe is allowed to do so, it would undermine our courts and our system of \njustice.\n  But that is for you to determine in the end, really, not me. That is \nmy opinion. But you will have to weigh the evidence, you are going to \nhave to hear the arguments, and ultimately make that decision. In fact, \nthe first thing you have to determine is whether or not the President \ncommitted crimes. It is only if you determine he committed the crimes \nof perjury, obstruction of justice, and witness tampering that you will \nmove on to the question of whether he is removed from office. In fact, \nno one, none of us, would argue to you that the President should be \nremoved from office unless you conclude he committed the crimes that he \nis alleged to have committed--not every one of them necessarily, but \ncertainly a good quantity, and there are a whole bunch of them that \nhave been charged.\n  I would like to call your attention to a couple of things. First of \nall, I don't want to be a schoolteacher; I just want to relate my own \nexperience to you so you can understand it. I have been involved with \nthis a lot longer than most of you have probably been dealing with the \ndetails. I constantly have to refer back to things. Every time I read \nsomething, there is so much detail here, I learn something new.\n  While I go over the evidence with you, we will summarize the evidence \none more time. As you are deliberating, as you are thinking about it, I \nwant to call a couple of places to your attention that are the easiest \nplaces to refer back to, to find the facts and evidence. First of all, \nthere is the official report that is in the record of the House's \nconsideration of this, the Judiciary Committee report. In that report, \nright in the first couple of pages, there is a table of contents. While \na couple of the articles did not come over to you that are listed in \nhere, there are detailed discussions you can get from this table of \ncontents as to every single count and every single part of these \narticles so you can figure out what we are talking about today.\n  Secondly, I would like to bring to your attention that there is a \nStarr Report, and I know that has been maligned by some people. This \nthing is so dogeared--I have underlined it, torn it apart, done all \nkind of things with it. It is a good reference source. You can find \nfrom the footnotes where else to check it out. There are two parts. \nThese are the appendices. In the first part, you can find the \ntranscript of all the key depositions, all the key testimony, all of \nthe evidence that we are talking about, and read it for yourselves.\n  I don't want to leave here today having summarized this evidence, as \nlong as I may take--and I don't want to take a long time, but I will \ntake a little while--and have you go away and think, gosh, what all did \nMcCollum or Hutchinson or Rogan or Bryant say yesterday. You can find \nand refresh yourself through that and through whatever information you \nhave--trial briefs and all that you have.\n  Let's look at what the record shows. President Clinton was sued by \nPaula Jones in a sexual harassment civil rights lawsuit. To bolster her \ncase, she was trying to show that the President engaged in a pattern of \nillicit relations with women in his employment, where he rewarded those \nwho became involved with him and disadvantaged those who rejected him, \nas Paula Jones did.\n  Whatever the merits of that approach, on May 27, 1997, the U.S. \nSupreme Court ruled in a unanimous decision that ``like every other \ncitizen''--and that is a quote--``like every other citizen, Paula Jones \nhas a right to an orderly disposition of her claims.'' Then on December \n11 of 1997, Judge Susan Webber Wright issued an order that said Paula \nJones was entitled to information regarding any State or Federal \nemployee with whom the President had sexual relations, proposed sexual \nrelations, or sought to have sexual relations.\n  The record shows that President Clinton was determined to hide his \nrelationship with Monica Lewinsky from the Jones court. His lawyers \nwill argue to you next week, I am sure, that he did everything to keep \nthe relationship hidden and he did it in a legal way. They will say \nthat he may have split a few hairs and evaded answers and given \nmisleading answers but that it was all within the framework of \nresponses and actions that any good lawyer would advise his client to \ndo.\n  They will also say if he crossed the line technically somewhere, he \ndidn't do it knowingly or intentionally. Oh, how I wish that were true. \nWe wouldn't be here today. But, alas, that is not so.\n  If you believe the sworn testimony of Monica Lewinsky, if you believe \nher testimony that is in the record--and she is very credible--the \nPresident knowingly, intentionally, and willfully set out on a course \nof conduct in December 1997 to lie to the Jones court, to hide his \nrelationship, and to encourage others to lie and hide evidence and to \nconceal the relationship with Monica Lewinsky from the court. He \nengaged in a pattern of obstruction of justice, perjury, and witness \ntampering designed to deny the court what Susan Webber Wright, the \njudge in that court, had determined Paula Jones had the right to \ndiscover in order to prove her claim. If you believe the testimony of \nMonica Lewinsky, you cannot believe the President or accept the \nargument of his lawyers. You simply can't.\n  The record is so clear on this that if you have any significant doubt \nabout Monica Lewinsky's credibility or testimony, you should bring her \nin here and let us examine her face to face so you can judge her \ncredibility for yourself.\n  As you will hear explained later this afternoon, the same acts can \nconstitute both the crimes of obstruction of justice and perjury, and \nthe same acts can constitute the crimes of obstruction of justice and \nwitness tampering. They are all cut from the same cloth. They are all \ncrimes that obstruct the administration of justice and keep our courts \nfrom being able to get the evidence that they need to decide cases. \nSuch obstruction is so detrimental to our system of justice that the \nFederal Sentencing Guidelines provide for a greater punishment for \nperjury and obstruction of justice than they do for bribery.\n  I want to show that to you. I know everybody can't see the chart. I \nthink you have a handout of them. I will not show many charts today, \nbut this is\n\n[[Page S261]]\n\none about the sentencing guidelines. The guidelines rate these, in \nfact, in sequence. The most serious sentencing is a higher number; the \nlower number is the lower sentencing: Plain old vanilla bribery rights \nat a 10; other things are 8, 7, 4. Murder is way up there, much higher \nin the numbers. You will see that witness tampering is a 12, not a 10. \nObstruction of justice is a 12, not a 10. Perjury is a 12, not a 10. \nAll of them are the same. Interestingly enough, although I didn't put \nit on this chart, bribing a witness is different from plain vanilla \nbribery. If you try to bribe somebody in a business deal, that is one \nkind; if you go out and bribe a witness, that is another. Bribing a \nwitness is also a 12.\n  Now, I want to point that out right up front because the most \nimportant point that makes is that when you read the phrase in the \nConstitution that what is impeachable is treason, bribery, and other \nhigh crimes and misdemeanors, bribery is not considered by our court \nsystem. Pure bribery, plain old bribery, is not considered as serious \nin sentencing as perjury, witness tampering, obstruction of justice, \nand of course bribing a witness. They are all of the same cloth. Why? \nBecause that interferes with the administration of justice. Because we \ncan't have justice if people block the courts from getting at the \ntruth. And if you go about doing it intentionally, you have committed \nthese crimes.\n  It should be pointed out that lies under oath in a court proceeding, \nwhether or not they rise to the level of crimes of perjury, can be \nobstruction of justice. So when the President lied in the Jones \ndeposition, this was part of the obstruction of justice charged under \narticle II that is before you today, even though there is no separate \ncount. And he lied a lot in that deposition. We will talk about that a \nlittle later. The fact that the House did not send you the article of \nimpeachment for perjury in the Jones deposition does not keep you from \nconsidering the lies in that deposition as an obstruction of justice \ncrime under article II that is before you. And you know that it is also \nincorporated in article I, because it is one of the four items \nspecifically listed as the perjury that he lied about lying in the \ndeposition.\n  Now, having said that, think about all of this as one big \nobstruction, because perjury can be obstruction. Just plain lying can \nbe obstruction. Witness tampering, by the way, is a separate crime \nbecause it is titled that way, but it is one of two separate \nobstruction of justice sections in the United States Criminal Code. It \nis just another version of obstruction of justice. So don't be \nconfused. Witness tampering is obstruction of justice--literally, \nfiguratively, and in every other way. But people think about it \nseparately because it has a separate element, a lesser element of proof \nactually than obstruction of justice. But it is all part of the same \nfabric, again.\n  To put the essence of all of this in a nutshell for you, think back \non the evidence presented yesterday. I would suggest that President \nClinton thought his scheme out well. He resented the Jones lawsuit. He \nwas alarmed when Monica Lewinsky's name appeared on the witness list, \nand he was more alarmed when Judge Wright issued her orders signaling \nthat the court would hear the evidence of other relationships. To keep \nhis relationship with Monica Lewinsky from the court, once Judge Wright \nissued her ruling, he knew he would have to lie to the court. To \nsucceed at this, he decided that he had to get Monica Lewinsky to file \na false affidavit, to try to avoid having her testify. And he needed to \nget her a job to make her happy, to make sure she executed that false \naffidavit, and then stick with her lies when she was questioned about \nit.\n\n  Then the gifts were subpoenaed and he had to have her hide the \ngifts--the only tangible evidence of his relationship with her that \nwould trigger questions. She came up with the idea of giving them to \nBetty Currie, and the President seized on it. Who would think Betty \nCurrie should be called to produce the gifts? Nobody would. Then he \nwould be free to lie in his deposition, and that is, of course, what he \ndid. But after he did this, he realized that he had to make sure that \nBetty would lie and cover for him.\n  He got his aides convinced to repeat the lies to the grand jury and \nto the public, and all of this worked--until the dress showed up. Then \nhe lied to the grand jury to try to cover up and explain away his prior \ncrimes.\n  That is the case in a nutshell. That is why we are here today. That \nis what this evidence in the record shows, I believe, in an \nexceptionally compelling way.\n  Now, let's review what happened and, as we do, I ask you to think \nback to what Mr. Bryant said to you yesterday. Always ask yourself what \nare the results of the act, and who benefited. I think you will find \neach time that it is the President who benefited. Now we are going to \ngo over the facts.\n  On December 5, 1997, a year ago, about a week before Judge Wright \nissued her order making it clear that the President's relationship with \nMonica Lewinsky was relevant to the Jones case. Ms. Lewinsky's name \nappeared on the Jones witness list. The President learned this fact the \nnext day, December 6. The President telephoned Monica Lewinsky at about \n2 a.m. on December 17 and informed her about her name being on the \nwitness list. That was about 10 days after he learned about it and \nabout 5 days after Judge Wright's order. It was the order that made it \nclear that his relationship with Monica was discoverable by the Jones \nattorneys in that case.\n  Long before this, though, long before the President was called to \ngive a deposition or Monica Lewinsky was named on the witness list in \nthe Jones case, the evidence shows she and the President had concocted \ncover stories. They had an understanding that she would lie about the \nrelationship, and so would he, if anybody asked about it.\n  During a telephone conversation on the 17th of December, the \nPresident told Monica she might be called as a witness, and he at that \ntime suggested that she might file an affidavit to avoid being called \nas a witness to testify in person in that case. In the same \nconversation, they reviewed these cover stories that they had concocted \nto conceal their relationship. He brought them up. They went over them \nagain.\n  Why do you think they did that? In her grand jury testimony, Monica \nsaid the President didn't tell her to lie, but because of their \nprevious understanding she assumed that they both expected that she \nwould lie in that affidavit. In this context, the evidence is \ncompelling that the President committed both the crimes of obstruction \nof justice and witness tampering right then and there on December 17.\n  Now, Monica Lewinsky's testimony is so clear about this that the \nPresident's lawyers probably won't spend a lot of time with you on \nthis; they didn't in the Judiciary Committee. I could be wrong, and \nthey probably will just to show me I am wrong.\n  I want us to look at this and specifically look at her testimony \ntogether because it is so compelling. On pages 123 and 124 of her \ntestimony--you can find it in Part 1 of the Starr Report. I know you \ncan't see all of this that well back there, but you should have the \ncharts. I point out in red on this chart the most important part of it. \nThis is where she described the December 17 telephone conversation. I \nam going to read you part of it.\n  She said here in red:\n\n       At some point in the conversation, and I don't know if it \n     was before or after the subject of the affidavit came up, he \n     sort of said, ``You know, you can always say you were coming \n     to see Betty or that you were bringing me letters,'' which I \n     understood was really a reminder of things that we had \n     discussed before.\n       Question: So when you say things you had discussed, sort of \n     ruses that you developed?\n       Answer: Right. I mean, this was--this was something that--\n     that was instantly familiar to me.\n       Question: Right.\n       Answer: And I knew exactly what he meant.\n       Question: Had you talked with him earlier about these false \n     explanations about what you were doing visiting him on \n     several occasions?\n       Answer: Several occasions throughout the entire \n     relationship. Yes. It was the pattern of the relationship, to \n     sort of conceal it.\n\n  Now, let's look at another chart. Monica Lewinsky's August 6 grand \njury testimony, on pages 233 and 234. Both are from the August 6 grand \njury testimony, where in the context of the affidavit she makes the now \nfamous statement, ``No one asked or encouraged me to lie.'' She did say \nthat, but let's look at how she said that:\n\n\n[[Page S262]]\n\n\n\n       For me, the best way to explain how I feel what happened \n     was, you know, no one asked or encouraged me to lie, but no \n     one discouraged me either.\n\n  ``. . . but no one discouraged me either.'' I don't know how many \ntimes anybody said that to you when they made their arguments, but that \nis what she said and the context.\n  Later on, she says in her testimony on the same pages:\n\n     . . . it wasn't as if the President called me and said, ``You \n     know, Monica, you're on the witness list, this is going to be \n     really hard for us, we're going to have to tell the truth and \n     be humiliated in front of the entire world about what we've \n     done,'' which I would have fought him on probably. That was \n     different. And by him not calling me and saying that, you \n     know, I knew what that meant. . . .\n       Question: Did you understand all along that he would deny \n     the relationship, also?\n       Answer: Mm-hmm. Yes.\n       Question: And when you say you understood what it meant \n     when he didn't say, ``Oh, you know, you must tell the \n     truth,'' what did you understand that to mean?\n       Answer: That--that--as we had on every other occasion and \n     every other instance of this relationship, we would deny it.\n\n  After reading this, if you believe Monica Lewinsky, can there be any \ndoubt that the President was suggesting that she file an affidavit that \ncontains lies and falsehoods that might keep her from ever having to \ntestify in the Jones case and give the President the kind of protection \nhe needed when he testified?\n  And, of course, in that same December 17 conversation, the President \nencouraged Monica to use cover stories and tell the same lies as he \nexpected her to do in the affidavit if and when she was called to \ntestify live and in person. Both of those would be obstruction of \njustice and witness tampering. Taken together--encouraging her to file \nthis false affidavit that she clearly describes here, and the \nencouraging of her to lie if she is ever called as a witness--both of \nthese are counts 1 and 2 of the obstruction of justice charge.\n  If I don't leave you with any other impression walking away from here \ntoday, I want you to think about this. This is the clearest, boldest, \nmost significant obstruction of justice charge. I don't see how anybody \ncan walk away from it and explain it away. It is a pattern. It should \nnot be looked at in isolation. Think about it. It is the kickoff to \nwhat really happened. It is why we got involved in this in the first \nplace. The President had a scheme and he went through this process. And \nit all ties together with the rest of it.\n\n  Two days later, Monica Lewinsky was subpoenaed and contacted Vernon \nJordan who put her in touch with Attorney Frank Carter. That is the \nattorney he picked out. As we all know, this very false affidavit that \nFrank Carter prepared--and, of course, knowing it was false when he \nprepared it, but Monica knew it and the President knew it--was filed \njust before the President's deposition in the Jones case January 17. \nThe record shows that the President was kept abreast of the \nparticipation by Vernon Jordan and all of its contents, and Jordan \nadvised the President when Monica signed the affidavit on January 7. He \nadvised the President of that fact. Two days before Monica says in a \nconversation she asked the President if he wanted to see the draft \naffidavit, he replied--you recall from yesterday--he replied that he \ndidn't need to see it because he had already seen ``15 others.''\n  I doubt seriously he was talking about 15 other affidavits of \nsomebody else and didn't like looking at affidavits anymore. I suspect \nand I would suggest to you that he was talking about 15 other drafts of \nthis proposed affidavit since it had been around the horn a lot of \nrounds.\n  The circumstantial evidence makes it clear the President knew the \ncontext of the Lewinsky affidavit and he knew it was false.\n  During the President's deposition in the Jones case on January 17, \nhis attorney, Robert Bennett, at one point tried to stop the Jones \nlawyers from asking the President about his relationship with Monica \nLewinsky by pointing out the affidavit she had signed.\n  I think we all remember that because there was a lot of that on TV up \nhere yesterday. Mr. Bennett asserted at the time that the affidavit \nindicated ``there is no sex of any kind, manner, shape or form.'' That \nis what he said. After a warning from Judge Wright, Mr. Bennett stated, \n``I'm not coaching the witness. In preparation of the witness for this \ndeposition, the witness is fully aware of Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit, so \nI have not told him a single thing he doesn't know.'' The President did \nnot say anything to correct Mr. Bennett, even though he knew the \naffidavit was false. The judge allowed the questioning to proceed and \nlater Mr. Bennett read to the President a portion of paragraph 8 of \nMonica Lewinsky's affidavit in which she denied having a ``sexual \nrelationship'' with the President and asked him if Ms. Lewinsky's \nstatement was true and accurate, to which the President responded, \n``That is absolutely true.''\n  I am not going back over and put that on the screen again. But I do \nwant to put up here before you what you have in front of you, paragraph \n8 of Monica Lewinsky's affidavit.\n  Paragraph 8 of her affidavit was absolutely false and the President \nknew it.\n  I want to go over that a little bit. What it says up here at the \nbeginning of it is, ``I have never had a sexual relationship with the \nPresident. He did not propose that we have a sexual relationship,'' and \nso on. And we have a lot about that. But look at what it says down at \nthe end of this. What is down at the end of this--you have it in front \nof you. It says down here, ``The occasions that I saw the President \nafter I left my employment at the White House in April 1996 were \nofficial receptions, formal functions, or events related to the United \nStates Department of Defense, where I was working at the time. There \nwere other people present on those occasions.''\n  I just want to point out to you that paragraph 8, which was the \nsubject of a lot of discussions, which the President certainly was \nfully aware of--which you watched where he was intensely responding, \nwith regard to Mr. Bennett yesterday in that deposition--didn't just \ncontain a lie about a sexual relationship where you quibble over a \nword. It is a full-fledged lie and a cover story about this. None of \nthat is true. Monica Lewinsky saw him a lot of other times, and the \nPresident certainly knew that. They weren't all official events or \nanything else. This is a complete falsehood, paragraph 8, and the \nPresident knew it.\n  At that point in time when he allowed his attorney on the day of the \ndeposition to make a false and misleading statement to the judge--and \nthe attorney didn't know that--but it was a false and misleading \nstatement to the judge characterizing this affidavit, he knew better. \nAnd the President at that point in time committed the crime of \nobstruction of justice. And that is count 5 of article II.\n  Now the President's lawyers are going to argue that he sat silent \nbecause he wasn't paying attention, and he didn't hear or appreciate \nwhat Mr. Bennett was saying. We have already seen the video. And you \nknow that he was looking so intently. Remember he was intensely \nfollowing the conversation with his eyes. I don't know if you watched \nit on TV yesterday and observed that. It was played twice. I don't know \nhow anybody can say this man wasn't paying attention. He certainly \nwasn't thinking about anything else. That was very obvious from looking \nat the video.\n  The President's other defense also falls apart on its face. During \nhis grand jury testimony, the President argued that when Mr. Bennett \ncharacterized the Lewinsky affidavit as indicating ``there is no sex of \nany kind, in any manner, shape or form'' that it was a completely true \nstatement because at that particular time, at that moment, when the \nstatement was being made on January 17, 1998, there was no sex going \non. That was when the President made his famous utterings to the jury, \n``It depends on what the meaning of the word `is' is.'' That is when he \nsaid that. Of course the President knew perfectly well that the context \nof Mr. Bennett's discussions with the judge and characterization of the \nLewinsky affidavit was referring to the denial in paragraph 8 of the \naffidavit that there had never been any sexual relationship at any \ntime, not that there was no sex or sexual relationship going on on \nJanuary 17, the day of the deposition.\n  I implore you not to get hung up on some of the details. It is \nabsurd, some of the arguments that are being made and have been made by \nthe President and his attorneys to try to explain this.\n\n[[Page S263]]\n\n  This is a perfect example of that. When we start looking around at \nthis, you can't see the forest sometimes for the trees. The big picture \nis what you need to keep in mind, not the compartmentalized portion. \nThere will be a lot of effort, I am sure, to try to go and pick at one \nthing or another. But this is an extraordinarily good example of how \nthe argument failed when put in that situation. And we shouldn't play \nword games.\n  When Monica Lewinsky was subpoenaed to testify, she was also \nsubpoenaed to produce any gifts that the President had given her. When \nshe met with Vernon Jordan the day she received the subpoena, she told \nhim of her concerns about the gifts and she asked him to tell the \nPresident about the subpoena.\n\n  Early in the morning on December 28, near the end of the year, they \nmet, the President and Monica, in his office, and they exchanged gifts \nand discussed the gifts being subpoenaed. According to Mrs. Lewinsky, \nshe suggested that maybe she should put the gifts away outside of her \nhouse somewhere or give them to somebody like Betty Currie. She says he \nresponded--the President responded--with an ``I don't know,'' or ``let \nme think about that.'' She was very clear that at no point did he ever \ngive her the impression that she should turn the gifts over to the \nJones attorneys.\n  That is consistent with their cover stories--the one later and later \nin the perjury where the count discusses his lying to the grand jury. \nConsistent with their cover stories and all the plans for denying the \nrelationship, her testimony in this regard is very believable.\n  On the other hand, the President's testimony in front of the grand \njury that encouraged her to turn all of the gifts over to the Jones \nattorneys is not believable. How can nobody believe that. When he said \nthat to the grand jury, he committed perjury. When a few hours later, \naccording to Monica Lewinsky, Betty Currie called her on the telephone \nand said, ``I understand you have something to give me,'' or maybe she \nsaid, ``the President said you have something to give me,'' and Betty \nCurrie came over and got the gifts and took them back and hid them \nunder her bed. At that moment, the President's crime of obstruction of \njustice as described in count 3 of article II was complete.\n  Remember by its nature obstruction of justice charges in crimes are \nmost frequently proven by circumstantial evidence. As somebody said \nhere the other day, we don't tell people we are going to go out under \nthe elm tree and lie and obstruct things. Usually it is a lot more \ncircuitous than that. In the context of all that was going on at the \ntime and the general truthfulness of Monica Lewinsky's testimony, and \nother respects, how can anyone come to any other conclusion than that \nthe President collaborated with Monica and Betty to hide these gifts on \nDecember 28? How can they? The sequence is there.\n  The President's lawyers may spend a lot of time attacking this \nparticular obstruction of justice charge. They may question why the \nPresident would have given Monica Lewinsky more gifts on December 28 if \nhe was expecting her to hide the gifts. Monica's explanation and her \ntestimony is ``from everything he said to me,'' he expected her to \nconceal the gifts, including the ones being given that day. When Ms. \nCurrie's call came, wasn't it the logical thing for Monica to conclude \nthat this was the result of the President's having thought about what \nto do with the gifts, which he said he was going to do according to \nher, and deciding to have Ms. Currie hide them?\n  That is the logical thing.\n  The President's attorney's will no doubt also question the veracity \nof Ms. Lewinsky with regard to who made the phone call, since Mrs. \nCurrie's recollection isn't very good. And at first she says she \nrecalls Monica made it. Of course, the phone records indicate that Ms. \nCurrie called Ms. Lewinsky. That is the much more logical sequence.\n  Also it doesn't make sense that the President's secretary, who is so \nclose to him--think about it--that she would have taken the gifts and \nwould have hidden them under her bed and never talked with the \nPresident about doing so before or after she did so. That doesn't make \nsense.\n\n  It is also noteworthy that the President did everything he could in \nhis January 17 deposition to conceal the true nature of his \nrelationship with Monica Lewinsky. This is consistent with the \narguments that he never intended the gifts be kept from the Jones \nattorneys. He never intended them to be given to the Jones attorneys. \nIf he had intended to give these gifts to the Jones attorneys, or have \nthem given, why would he have gone through this elaborate series of \nlies in that deposition? Common sense tells us if he knew these gifts \nwere revealed, questions would be raised and his relationship revealed.\n  So all the logic is there. I don't know how you refute it.\n  Another obstruction count the President's attorneys are likely to \nspend time on is one concerning the job search. There is no question \nthat Monica Lewinsky was looking for a job in New York a long time \nbefore we get to December of 1997 and when the affidavit and all of \nthis took place, long before the President had reason to be concerned \nthat she would have to testify or he would have to testify in the case. \nThere is no question about that. That is not the issue. The question is \nwhether or not the President intensified his efforts to get her a job \nand make sure she got one after it became clear to him that he would \nneed her to lie, sign a false affidavit, and stick with her lies in any \nquestioning. That is what counts. That is what is important. Did he \nintensify his efforts and really go after it? Was it part of that \npattern I described to you earlier which Mr. Hutchinson described \nyesterday? That is what is important.\n  In other words, as count 34 of article II alleges, did she make sure \nshe was rewarded with sticking with him in a scheme of concealment in \nanticipation that this reward would keep her happy and keep her from \nturning on him? Did the President make sure Monica Lewinsky signed a \nfalse affidavit by getting her a job?\n  The record shows that while she did give some interviews from earlier \ncontacts, including one involving the job with the U.S. Ambassador to \nthe United Nations, no one of real influence around the President put \non a full court press to get her a job and she had not had any success \nas of December 6.\n  She had not been able to get in touch with Vernon Jordan in her \nrecent efforts. He had met with her once in November, but as you recall \nfrom yesterday's discussions, something he didn't even have a good \nmemory of. He certainly wasn't very focused on it, and she wasn't \ngetting where she wanted to get.\n  And so on December 6th she mentioned that fact to the President. \nRemember, that is one day after she was named on a witness list. In \nfact, that is the day that he learned or may have learned--we know he \nlearned of her being on that witness list. The President met with \nVernon Jordan the next day, but he apparently didn't mention Ms. \nLewinsky, according to Jordan's testimony. The record shows that not \nonly on December 11th did Mr. Jordan act to help Ms. Lewinsky find a \njob when he met with her and gave her a list of contact names on \nDecember 11th, Mr. Jordan that same day made calls to contacts at \nMacAndrews & Forbes, the parent corporation of Revlon, and two other \nNew York companies. He also telephoned the President to keep him \ninformed of his efforts.\n  Keep in mind that on this day, this very same day, December 11th, \nJudge Wright issued her order in the Jones case entitling Jones' \nlawyers to discover the President's sexual relations. Is that a mere \ncoincidence?\n  Later in December, Monica Lewinsky interviewed with New York-based \ncompanies that had been contacted by Mr. Jordan. She discussed her move \nto New York with the President during that meeting on December 28th. On \nJanuary 5th, she declined a United Nations offer. On January 7th, Ms. \nLewinsky signed the false affidavit. The next day, on January the 8th, \nshe interviewed in New York with MacAndrews & Forbes, but the interview \nwent very poorly. Learning of this, Vernon Jordan, that very day, \ncalled Ronald Perelman, the chairman of the board of MacAndrews & \nForbes. She was interviewed the next morning again, and a few hours \nlater she received an informal offer. She told Jordan about it. He \nimmediately told\n\n[[Page S264]]\n\nBetty Currie about it, and he personally told the President about it \nlater.\n  On January 13th, her job offer at Revlon was formalized, and within a \nday or so President Clinton told Erskine Bowles that Ms. Lewinsky had \nfound a job in the private sector. It was a big relief to him.\n  Then her false affidavit was filed, and on January 17th the President \ngave a deposition relying on the false affidavit and using their cover \nstories to conceal their relationship.\n  Was this full court press in December and early January to assure \nMonica Lewinsky had a job just a coincidence? Logical common sense says \nno; the President needed her to continue to cooperate in his scheme to \nhide their relationship, keeping her happy so he could control her and \nshe would be--he would be assured that she had filed this false \naffidavit and testifying untruthfully if she was called. It is the only \nplausible rationale for this stepped up job assistance effort at this \nparticular time. In doing so, the President committed the crimes of \nobstruction of justice and witness tampering as set forth in count 4 of \narticle II.\n  Well, we have gone through quite a few of these, and I am trying to \nbe brief with you, but I think each one of them is important. Each one \nof them entangles the President further in a web that fits together, \nand it is kind of sticky just like the spider weaves.\n  During his deposition in the Jones case, the President referred to \nBetty Currie several times and suggested that she might have answers to \nsome of the questions. He used the cover story, the same ones he and \nMonica talked about, and he talked about Betty Currie a good deal \nbecause she was a part of those cover stories. When he finished the \ndeposition, he telephoned Ms. Currie, and he asked her to come to his \noffice the next day and talk with him. Betty Currie told the grand jury \nwhen she came in the next day the President raised his deposition with \nher and said there were several things he wanted to know, then rattled \noff what you heard yesterday in succession: You were always there when \nshe was there, right? We never were really alone. You can see and hear \neverything. Monica came on to me, and I never touched her, right? She \nwanted to have sex with me, and I can't do that.\n\n  All of those weren't true. They were all falsehoods. They were all \ndeclaratory statements. They weren't questions. It is clear from the \nrecord that Ms. Currie always tried her best to be loyal to the \nPresident, her boss. That is normal. That is natural.\n  In answering the questions in her testimony, she tried to portray the \nevents and the President's assertions in the light most favorable to \nhim, even though she acknowledges that she could not hear and see \neverything that went on between Monica and the President and that she \nwasn't actually present in the same room with them on any number of \noccasions, so they were alone. And she could not say what they might \nhave been doing or saying.\n  On January 20th or 21st, the President again met with Ms. Currie and, \naccording to her, recapitulated what he said on Sunday, a day or two \nbefore, right after the deposition. In the context of everything, it \nseems abundantly clear that the President was trying to make sure that \nBetty Currie corroborated his lies and cover stories from the \ndeposition if she was ever called to testify in the Jones case or grand \njury or any other court proceeding. That is what he was doing. In doing \nso, the President committed the crimes of witness tampering and \nobstruction of justice.\n  Later, the President testified, rather disingenuously, in my \njudgment, that he was simply trying to refresh his memory when he was \ntalking to Ms. Currie. Ms. Currie's confirmation of false statements \nthat the President made in his deposition could not in any way remind \nhim of the facts. They were patently untrue. The idea that he was \ntrying to refresh his recollection is implausible.\n  Recognizing the weakness of their client's case on this, the \nPresident's attorneys have suggested that he was worried about what Ms. \nCurrie might say if the press really got after her. That is what we \nheard, at least over in the Judiciary Committee. Of course, it is \npossible the President was worried about the press. I would suspect so. \nBut common sense says he was much more worried about what Betty Currie \nmight say to a court, after he had just named her several times and \ntalked about her, if she were called as a witness.\n  As those who follow me will tell you, the arguments by the \nPresident's lawyers that Betty Currie wasn't on the Jones witness list \nat the time and the window of opportunity to call her as a witness in \nthat case closed shortly thereafter is irrelevant. They are going to \nargue--they argued to us that Betty Currie's name wasn't on the witness \nlist. That is a big deal, they say. They say. But it is irrelevant. It \ndoesn't matter; witness tampering law doesn't even require that \na pending judicial proceeding be going on for it to be a crime. So \nwhether her name was on the witness list or not makes no difference.\n\n  There are two types of obstruction of justice. One does require a \npending proceeding. I submit--and you will hear more about this later \nin the law--that in this instance the President committed both of them. \nHe certainly should have anticipated that she would be called in the \npending proceeding that was going on in the Jones case, but even if \nthere was no pending proceeding--and you will, again, hear more about \nthis later--for the witness tampering part of the obstruction of \njustice, it doesn't require there to have been an ongoing judicial \nproceeding.\n  Within 4 or 5 days of his Jones deposition, the President not only \nexplicitly denied the true nature of his relationship with Monica \nLewinsky to key White House aides, he also embellished the story when \nhe talked with Sidney Blumenthal. To Sidney Blumenthal, he portrayed \nMonica Lewinsky as the aggressor, attacked her reputation by portraying \nher as a stalker and presented himself as the innocent victim being \nattacked by the forces of evil. Certainly he wanted his denial and his \nassertions to be spread to the public by these aides, but at the same \ntime he knew that the Office of Independent Counsel had recently been \nappointed to investigate the Monica Lewinsky matter. He knew that at \nthe time.\n  In the context of everything else that he was doing to hide his \nrelationship, it seems readily apparent that his false and misleading \nstatements to his staff members, whom he knew were potential witnesses \nbefore any grand jury proceeding, were designed in part to corruptly \ninfluence their testimony as witnesses. In fact, the President actually \nacknowledged this in his grand jury testimony, that he knew his aides \nmight be called before the grand jury. And one of the aides testified \nhe expected to be called. Sure enough, they were, and they repeated the \nfalse and misleading information he had given them. In this, the \nPresident committed the crimes of witness tampering and obstruction of \njustice as set forth in count 7 of article II.\n  Now, that is the obstruction of justice. Let's briefly review the \ngrand jury perjury for a minute.\n  If you believe Monica Lewinsky, the President lied to the grand jury \nand committed perjury. If you believe her--and I think this one is very \nimportant, not that they all aren't. There was the web of the \nobstruction that I just described and then there is the grand jury \nperjury on top of it. I told you earlier, perjury and just plain lying \ncan be all obstruction of justice as well. But the grand jury part is \nmuch later. It is after the President had time to really reflect on all \nof this, a long time later.\n  If you believe Monica Lewinsky, the President lied to the grand jury \nand committed perjury in denying he had sexual relations with Monica \nLewinsky even if you accept his interpretation of the Jones court's \ndefinition of sexual relations. That is really important. There isn't \nanything clearer in the whole darned matter than that. Just look at the \nPresident's grand jury testimony. And I am not going to go over all of \nthat, but it is on pages 93 and 96 of his grand jury testimony. It is \nlaid out in this chart which you have in front of you, and I encourage \nyou to read every page of it carefully. Specifically, I call your \nattention to the fact--again, I am not going to read all of this--but \nthey asked him about touching certain parts of the body that are \ndefined in the definition that you have had repeated many times, \npublicly and otherwise. And two of those body parts he acknowledges, \nthe breast and genitalia, were in fact part of the definition. And at \nthe end of this, and\n\n[[Page S265]]\n\nI think this is very important and I am going to read it because it is \npart of his testimony, he answers the question that is the compelling \nbottom line crime. This is where he perjured himself above all else.\n\n       You are free to infer that my testimony is that I did not \n     have sexual relations, as I understood this term to be \n     defined.\n       Question: Including touching her breasts, kissing her \n     breasts, or touching her genitalia?\n       Answer: That's correct.\n\n  In her sworn testimony, Monica Lewinsky described nine incidents of \nwhich the President touched and kissed her breasts and four incidents \ninvolving contact with her genitalia. On these matters, Lewinsky's \ntestimony is corroborated by the sworn testimony of at least six \nfriends and counselors to whom she related these incidents \ncontemporaneously.\n  Again, if you believe the testimony of Monica Lewinsky, and it \ncertainly is credible here--I think it is credible throughout but it is \ncertainly credible, with all the corroboration you have got in the \nrecord--there is nothing clearer in all of this, in all of this you \nhave before you, than that the President committed the crime of perjury \nin testifying before the grand jury regarding the nature and details of \nhis relationship with Monica Lewinsky.\n  On the other hand, there is plenty here to indicate the President \ncleverly created his own narrow definition of sexual relations to \ninclude only sexual intercourse, absent the explicit definition of the \ncourt, after he had already lied in responding to the interrogatories \nand other pleadings and perhaps even in the depositions themselves in \nthe Jones case. In other words, you are free to deduce that he knew \nfull well what most people would include as sexual relations, oral sex \nand the other intimate activities that he was engaged in with Ms. \nLewinsky, before he contrived his own definition. In that case, you \ndon't even have to rely on Monica Lewinsky's testimony to conclude that \nhe committed the crime of perjury in testifying before the grand jury \non the nature of his relationship with her.\n  There are other perjurious lies the President's grand jury testimony \ncontains regarding the nature and details of his relationship with her. \nI am not going to outline all of those. I want to call your attention \nto one. The President's prepared statement, given under oath, said, ``I \nregret that what began as a friendship came to include this conduct.'' \nYou may remember that from Mr. Rogan, I think, yesterday. ``I regret \nthat what began as a friendship came to include this conduct.'' That is \nwhat he said in the grand jury. The evidence indicates that he lied. As \nMs. Lewinsky testified, her relationship with the President began with \nflirting, including Ms. Lewinsky showing the President her underwear, \nand just a couple of hours later they were kissing and engaging in \nintimacies. That is a little bit more than friendship. He lied when he \nsaid that to the grand jury.\n  Before the grand jury, the President swore that he testified \ntruthfully at his deposition. Remember, I told you I was going to come \nback to this. It is important because the grand jury--I mean the Paula \nJones deposition testimony is relevant to obstruction of justice but it \nis also relevant to the perjury here, because one of the portions of \nthe perjury article that you have before us includes this issue of \nlying in the deposition. The perjury in this case is not the lying in \nthe deposition, it is the lying to the grand jury about whether he lied \nin the deposition. He didn't have to have committed perjury. We didn't \nsend you the perjury count over from the deposition. But if he lied--\nlying can be less than perjury. If he lied in the deposition and then \nhe told the grand jury that he didn't lie, he committed perjury in \nfront of the grand jury.\n\n  The evidence indicates that he did lie. He testified before the grand \njury that ``my goal in this deposition was to be truthful, but not \nparticularly helpful . . . I was determined to walk through the \nminefield of this deposition without violating the law and I believe I \ndid.''\n  Contrary to this testimony, the President was alone with Ms. Lewinsky \nwhen she was not delivering papers, which he even conceded in his grand \njury statement. So he lied in the deposition then when he said he \nwasn't alone with her.\n  In the deposition the President swore he could never recall being in \nthe Oval Office hallway with Ms. Lewinsky except when she was perhaps \ndelivering pizza. The evidence indicates that he lied.\n  The President swore in the Jones deposition that he could not recall \ngifts exchanged between Monica Lewinsky and himself. The evidence \nindicates that he lied.\n  He swore in the deposition that he did not know whether Monica \nLewinsky had been served a subpoena to testify in the Jones case at the \nlast time that he saw her in December 1997. The evidence indicates that \nhe lied.\n  In his deposition, the President swore that the last time he spoke to \nMonica Lewinsky was when she stopped by before Christmas 1997 to see \nBetty Currie at a Christmas party. The evidence indicates that he lied.\n  In his deposition in the Jones case, the President swore that he \ndidn't know that his personal friend, Vernon Jordan, had met with \nMonica Lewinsky and talked about the case. The evidence indicates that \nhe lied.\n  The President in his Paula Jones deposition indicated that he was \n``not sure'' whether he had ever talked to Monica Lewinsky about the \npossibility that she might be asked to testify in the Jones case. Can \nanybody doubt the evidence indicates that he lied?\n  The President in his deposition swore that the contents of the \naffidavit executed by Monica Lewinsky in the Jones case, in which she \ndenied they had a sexual relationship, were ``absolutely true.'' The \nevidence indicates that he lied.\n  In other words, when the President swore in the grand jury testimony \nthat his goal in the Jones deposition was to be truthful but not \nparticularly helpful, the evidence is clear that he lied and committed \nthe crime of perjury, inasmuch as he had quite intentionally lied on \nnumerous occasions in his deposition testimony in the Jones case. His \nintention in that deposition was to be untruthful. That is what it was \nall about, to be untruthful. So he committed the crime of perjury in \nfront of the grand jury--big time.\n  The third part of article I concerning grand jury perjury relates to \nhis not telling the truth about false and misleading statements his \nattorney, Robert Bennett--unintentionally, Mr. Bennett, by the way, but \nnonetheless false and misleading statements--Robert Bennett made to \nJudge Wright during the President's Jones case deposition. We have been \non that a lot. I don't want to bore you with going over all those \ndetails again, but this is the third part of the perjury count as well \nas an obstruction of justice count.\n  During the President's deposition in the Jones case, Mr. Bennett, \nhowever unintentional on his part, misled the court when he said, \n``Counsel [counsel for Ms. Jones] is fully aware that Ms. Lewinsky has \nfiled, has an affidavit which they are in possession of saying that \nthere is no sex of any kind, of any manner shape or form, with \nPresident Clinton . . .'' Judge Wright, as you recall again, \ninterrupted Mr. Bennett and expressed her concern that he might be \ncoaching the President to which Mr. Bennett responded, ``in preparation \nof the witness for this deposition, the witness is fully aware of Ms. \nLewinsky's affidavit, so I have not told him a single thing he doesn't \nknow . . .''\n  In his grand jury testimony about these statements by Mr. Bennett to \nthe judge in the Jones case, the President testified:\n\n       I'm not even sure I paid attention to what he was saying. . \n     . . I didn't pay much attention to this conversation which is \n     why, when you started asking me about this, I asked to see \n     the deposition . . . I don't believe I ever even focused on \n     what Mr. Bennett said in the exact words he did until I \n     started reading this transcript carefully for this \n     hearing. That moment, the whole argument just passed me \n     by.\n\n  In so testifying before the grand jury, the President lied and \ncommitted the crime of perjury. As you saw yesterday in the video, \nduring this portion of that deposition when Mr. Bennett was discussing \nthis matter with Judge Wright, the President directly looked at Mr. \nBennett, paying close attention to his argument to Judge Wright. He \nlied about that to the grand jury. He committed perjury when he said \nthat he wasn't paying attention and he didn't know what Mr. Bennett was \nsaying.\n  Several of the most blatant examples of grand jury perjury are found \nin that\n\n[[Page S266]]\n\nportion of his testimony cited in the fourth part, the last part of \narticle I which goes to his efforts, the President's efforts, to \ninfluence the testimony of witnesses and to impede the discovery of \nevidence in the Jones case. The President swore during the grand jury \ntestimony that he told Ms. Lewinsky that if the Jones lawyers requested \nthe gifts exchanged between them, she should provide them. If you \nbelieve Monica Lewinsky's testimony, the President lied and committed \nperjury.\n  In her grand jury testimony, Ms. Lewinsky discussed in detail the \nDecember 28 meeting where gifts were discussed which preceded by a \ncouple of hours Ms. Currie coming to her apartment and taking the gifts \nand hiding them under a bed. As you recall, she said she raised with \nthe President the idea of removing her gifts from her house and giving \nthem to somebody like Betty Currie and that his response was something \nto the effect of, ``Let me think about that.''\n  She went on to say that from everything he said to her, they were not \ngoing to do anything but keep these gifts private. In a separate sworn \nstatement, she testified she was never under the impression from \nanything the President said that she should turn over the gifts to the \nJones attorneys, and obviously she didn't have the idea that she should \ndo that because she gave them all to Betty Currie to hide under the \nbed.\n  When the President told the grand jurors that he was simply trying to \n``refresh'' his recollection when he made a series of statements to \nBetty Currie the day after his deposition, he lied and committed \nperjury. As I have already pointed out to you today, the evidence is \ncompelling that those statements, such as ``I was never really alone \nwith Monica, right?'' were made to try to influence Betty Currie's \npossible testimony, so that she would corroborate his cover stories and \nother false statements and lies that he had given the previous day in \nthe Jones deposition, if she was called as a witness.\n  If you conclude that these series of statements constitute witness \ntampering and obstruction of justice, then you must also conclude that \nthe President committed perjury when he asserted that the sole purpose \nof these statements to Betty Currie was to ``refresh'' his \nrecollection. You have to. Even if you were to buy the President's \ncounsel's suggestion these statements might have been made to influence \nher in order for her to corroborate him, not in actual testimony in a \ncourt case but with the press, which they have said again to us--I \ndon't know if they will say it to you--you would still conclude he was \nlying when he said that this was simply only to refresh his own \nrecollection.\n  In the context of all of this, the idea that he was refreshing his \nrecollection by firing off these declarative statements doesn't make \nsense. It just doesn't make sense. If you read the statements and think \nabout them on their face, they are inherently inconsistent with \nrefreshing his recollection.\n  Also, the President told the grand jury that the things he told his \ntop aides about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky may have been \nmisleading but they were true. If you believe the aides testified \ntruthfully to the grand jury about what the President told them about \nhis relationship, the President told them many falsehoods, absolute \nfalsehoods. So when the President described them under oath to the \ngrand jury as truths, he lied and committed the crime of perjury.\n  One example of this comes from Deputy Chief John Podesta in his \ntestimony before the grand jury on January 23 that the President \nexplicitly told him that he and Monica Lewinsky had not had oral sex. \nAnother is Sidney Blumenthal. His testimony was that on January 23 the \nPresident told him that Monica Lewinsky ``came at me and made a sexual \ndemand on me'' and that he rebuffed her. And also Blumenthal's \ntestimony that the President told him that Lewinsky threatened him and \nsaid that she would tell people that they had had an affair and that \nshe was known as a stalker among her peers.\n  In short, the President lied numerous times before the grand jury, my \ncolleagues; he lied numerous times under oath last August 17. He \ncommitted perjury numerous times under oath. He certainly wasn't caught \nby surprise by any of this, by any of the questions that were asked him \nduring the grand jury appearance, and he was given a lot of latitude. \nHe was given latitude normally that grand jury witnesses don't have--to \ngive a prepared statement, to have his counsel present, to refuse to \nanswer questions without taking the fifth amendment.\n  It is hard to imagine a case where it is clear that the lies meet the \nthreshold of the crime of perjury. But I will leave the discussion of \nthe elements and the law to the next group that is going to come up \nhere.\n  The facts are clear that the President lied about having sexual \nrelations with Monica Lewinsky even under his understanding of the \ndefinition of the Jones case if you believe Monica.\n  He lied when he said he gave truthful testimony in his Jones \ndeposition.\n  He lied when he said he wasn't paying attention to his attorney's \ndiscussion of Monica Lewinsky's false affidavit during his deposition \nin the Jones case.\n  He lied when he said he told Monica Lewinsky she should turn over the \ngifts to the Jones lawyers if they asked for them.\n  He lied when he told the grand jury that he made the declaratory \nstatements to Betty Currie to refresh his recollection.\n  And he lied when he told the grand jury that he only told the truth \nto his White House aides, such as John Podesta who testified the \nPresident told him he had not had oral sex with Lewinsky, and to Sidney \nBlumenthal who testified he told him very exaggerated and highly untrue \ncharacterizations of Monica Lewinsky's role in all of this.\n  These impeachment proceedings aren't before you because of one or two \nlies about a sexual relationship. This is not about sex. This is about \nobstruction of justice. This is about a pattern. This is about a \nscheme. This is about a lot of lies. This is about a lot of perjury. \nThey are before you because the President lied again and again in a \nperjurious fashion to a grand jury and tried to get a number of people, \nother people, to lie under oath in the Jones lawsuit and to the grand \njury and encouraged the concealment of evidence.\n  In a couple of days the President's lawyers are going to have their \nchance to talk to you, and I suspect they will try to get you to focus \non 10, 15, or 20 or 30, maybe even 100 specific little details. They \nare going to argue that these details don't square with some of the \nfacts about this presentation. But I would encourage you never to lose \nsight of the totality of this scheme to lie and obstruct justice; never \nlose sight of the big picture. Don't lose sight of the forest for the \ntrees. It is easy to do because there are a lot of facts in this case.\n  I suggest you avoid considering any of this stuff in isolation and \ntreating it separately. The evidence and the testimony needs to be \nviewed as a whole. The weight, we call it in law--and you are going to \nhear that in a few minutes--the weight of the evidence in this case is \nvery great, it is huge in its volume, that the President engaged in a \nscheme starting in December 1997 to conceal from the court in the Jones \ncase his true relationship with Monica Lewinsky and then cover up his \nacts of concealment which he had to know by that time were serious \ncrimes.\n  The case against the President rests to a great extent on whether or \nnot you believe Monica Lewinsky. But it is also based on the sworn \ntestimony of Vernon Jordan, Betty Currie, Sidney Blumenthal, John \nPodesta, and corroborating witnesses. Time and again, the President \nsays one thing and they say something entirely different. Time and \nagain, somebody is not telling the truth. And time and again, an \nanalysis of the context, the motivation, and all of the testimony taken \ntogether with common sense says it is the President who is not telling \nthe truth. But if you have serious doubts about the truthfulness of any \nof these witnesses, I, again, as all my colleagues do, encourage you to \nbring them in here. Let's examine Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan, Betty \nCurrie and the other key witnesses, let you examine the testimony, \ninvite the President to come, judge for yourself their credibility.\n\n  But on the record, the weight of the evidence, taken from what we \nhave\n\n[[Page S267]]\n\ngiven you today, what you can read in all of these books back here, \neverything taken together is huge that the President lied. It is \nrefutable, but it is not refutable if somebody doesn't come in here \nbesides just making an argument.\n  I don't know what the witnesses will say, but I assume if they are \nconsistent, they'll say the same that's in here. But you have a chance \nto determine whether they are telling the truth. The only way you will \never know that, other than just accepting it if you think the evidence \nand the weight is that huge--and it may be--is by looking them in the \neye and determining their credibility.\n  I believe that when you finish hearing and weighing all of the \nevidence, you will conclude, as I have, that William Jefferson Clinton \ncommitted the crimes of obstruction of justice, witness tampering, and \nperjury, that these in this case are high crimes and misdemeanors, that \nhe has done grave damage to our system of justice, and leaving him in \noffice would do more, and that he should be removed from office as \nPresident of the United States.\n  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n\n\n                                 Recess\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that there now \nbe a recess in the proceedings for 15 minutes. Please return to your \npositions within 15 minutes.\n  There being no objection, at 2:11 p.m., the Senate recessed until \n2:30 p.m.; whereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by \nthe Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, as all Senators return to the Chamber, I \nbelieve now we are going to go to a segment where we will hear from \nthree of the managers, including Congressmen Gekas, Chabot, and Cannon, \nand then we will take another break shortly after 3:30.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Gekas.\n  Mr. Manager GEKAS. Mr. Chief Justice, counsel for the President, my \ncolleagues from the House, and Members of the Senate, up to now you \nhave been fully informed of the state of the record in this case in \nmany different ways, in very many different tonalities uttered by the \nmanagers, who so magnificently, in my judgment, wove the story that \nbegan in 1997 and has not ended yet.\n  But the narrative that the managers were able to produce for you and \nput on the record has met, even as we speak, with commentary in the \npublic that ``we have all known all of this before.'' The big \ndifference is that now it is part of the history of the country. It is \nlodged in the records of the Senate of the United States. And together \nwith the Congressional Record of the proceedings that preceded these in \nthe House, we now have the dawning of the final chapters of this \nparticular incident involving the President, in which you will have the \nfinal word. But that is what the importance is of what you have heard \nup until now--the complete record woven together, step by step, so that \nno one in this Chamber at this juncture does not know all the facts \nthat are pertinent to this case. That is a magnificent accomplishment \non the part of the managers.\n  But the record is not yet complete, and that is where I and \nRepresentative Chabot, Representative Cannon, and Representative Barr \ncome in, so that now we can take the next step in fulfillment of the \nrecord, and that is, to try to apply the statutory laws, the laws of \nour Nation as they obtain to the facts that you now have well ingrained \ninto your consciences. To do that, we have to repeat some of the facts. \nSome of these matters overlap, and just as you have given your \nattention to the matters at hand up until now, your undivided attention \nis needed continuously.\n  For instance, we cannot discuss even the application of these \nstatutes to the facts unless we repeat the series of events that \ncatapulted us to this moment in history. And we must begin, as you have \nheard countless times now on and off this floor, in my judgment, with \nthe Supreme Court of the United States, with all due deference to the \nChief Justice, because the Supreme Court at one point in this saga \ndetermined in a suit brought by Paula Jones that indeed an average, \nday-to-day, ordinary citizen of our Nation would have the right to have \na day in court, as it were, even against the President of the United \nStates. It is there that all of this began.\n  That fellow American, Paula Jones--no matter how she may have been \ndescribed by commentators and pundits and talking heads, et cetera--did \nhave a bundle of rights at her command. Those rights went into the core \nof our system of justice to bring the President into the case as a \ndefendant. That is an awesome and grand result of the Supreme Court \ndecision at that juncture. This is what is being overlooked, in my \njudgment, as we pursue what we believe. If perjury indeed was \ncommitted--and the record is replete that it in fact was--and if \nindeed obstruction of justice was finally committed by the President of \nthe United States--as the evidence abundantly demonstrates--then we \nmust apply the rights of Paula Jones to what has transpired.\n\n  We are not saying that the President--even though the weight of the \nevidence demonstrates it amply--should be convicted of the impeachment \nwhich has brought us to this floor just because he committed perjury or \nobstructed justice, but because as a result of his actions both in \nrendering falsehoods under oath, as the evidence demonstrates amply, or \nin obstructing justice, that because of his conduct, he attempted to, \nor succeeded in, or almost succeeded in--it doesn't matter which of \nthese results finally emerges--and attempted to destroy the rights of a \nfellow American citizen. That is what the gravamen of all that has \noccurred up to now really is.\n  In attempting to obstruct justice, we mean by that obstructing the \njustice of whom? It was an attempt, a bold attempt, one that succeeded \nin some respects, to obstruct the justice sought by a fellow American \ncitizen. That is heavy. That is soul searching in its quality. That \ngoes beyond those who would say, ``He committed perjury about sex. So \nwhat?'' That goes beyond saying that, ``This is just about sex. So \nwhat? Everybody lies about sex.'' But when you combine all the features \nof the actions of the President of the United States and you see that \nthey are funneled and tunneled and aimed and targeted toward \nobliterating from the landscape the rights of Paula Jones, a fellow \nAmerican citizen, then you must take a second look at your own \nassertion that, ``So what? It's just a question of fact about sex.''\n  Many of the Members of this Chamber and others have already \nacknowledged that the President has lied under oath. But then they are \nquick to add, ``So what?'' which is so disturbing in view of the \nresults of what has happened in this case.\n  Before the House of Representatives, as part of our record, we had a \ngroup of academicians, professors, testifying. Professor Higgenbotham--\nwho, sadly I must relate, has passed away since his appearance--was \ntrying to show how futile it was for us to even attempt to append \nperjury to an indictable, prosecutable offense, and that nowhere in the \ncountry is it prosecuted regularly, and that it is so trivial because \nit is based on sex. He went on to give an example of how trivial it is. \nI am paraphrasing it, but he said: Would you expect to indict the \nPresident of the United States for perjury if he lied about a 55-mile-\nan-hour speed limit, even though he was going 56? If he would say, ``I \nwas only going 51,'' would you indict him on that?\n  In the repertoire that I had with him at that juncture, I asked him \nwould he feel the same if as a result of that perjurious testimony \nabout only going 51 miles an hour if there was a victim in the case, \nthat this might be a tort case, an involuntarily case, a negligence \ncase in which someone died as a result of an automobile accident case, \nand the issue at hand would be the speed limit, would he feel the same \nway if as a result of the perjury committed as to the rate of speed, \nthat someone's rights were erased in the case by virtue of that \nperjury, the gentleman acknowledged that that made a difference.\n  That is what the difference is here. The perjury per se, that being a \nphrase that we lawyers can adopt, the perjury per se is almost a given \npursuant to the commentaries that we have heard from the people in and \nout of that Chamber. But when you add to it the terrible\n\n[[Page S268]]\n\nconsequences of seeing a fellow citizen pursuing justice thwarted, \nstopped in her tracks as it were by reason of the actions of the \nPresident, that is what the core issue here is.\n  To take it, then, from the status of what consequence it had to that \nfellow American citizen to the next step is, in my judgment, an issue--\nto go to the determination of whether or not there was an impeachable \noffense--my colleagues will show you how the law of perjury and the law \nof obstruction of justice relates to this pattern of factual \ncircumstance that we bring to you. But in the meantime we must recount, \neven at the risk of overlapping some of the testimony, that following \nthe initial recognition by the President that there was going to be a \nwitness list and that Monica Lewinsky would eventually appear as she \ndid on that witness list. This occurred, which is little examined thus \nfar in the world of the scandal in which we are all participants, and \nthat is this: The first item of business on the part of the Jones \nlawyers in pursuing the rights of Paula Jones was to issue a set of \ninterrogatories, a discovery procedure that is well recognized in our \ncourts all over the land, that a set of interrogatories arrived at the \nPresident's desk.\n  At this juncture--this is way before the President appeared at the \ndeposition about which you know everything now. The facts have been \nrelated to you in a hundred different ways and you know that pretty \nwell. I know you do. But did you know, can you fasten your attention \nfor a moment knowing that this happened at the deposition on a month \nbefore, on December 23rd, 1997, when the President had in front of him \ninterrogatories that asked did he ever have sexual relations with \nanyone other than his spouse during the time that he was Governor of \nArkansas or President of the United States, and there the President \nanswered--or I think that the interrogatory stated, Name any persons \nwith whom you have had sexual relations other than your wife. And the \nanswer that the President rendered in those interrogatories under oath \nwas none.\n  I say to the ladies and gentleman of the Senate that this was the \nfirst falsehood stated under oath which became a chain reaction of \nfalsehoods under oath, and even without the oath, all the way to the \nnuclear explosion of falsehoods that were uttered in the grand jury in \nAugust of 1998.\n  This little innocuous piece of paper called interrogatories was \nplaced before the President presumably with or without counsel. Let's \neven presume with counsel. And it was a straight question, not with any \ndefinitions, no confusing colloquy between a judge and a gaggle of \nlawyers, no interpretation being put on any particular word in the \ninterrogatories, but whether or not sexual relations had been urged or \nparticipated in by the President of the United States, and the answer \nwas none in naming those persons.\n\n  What does that mean to you? What does that not mean to you, that when \nconfronted right at the outset with the phrase ``sexual relations'' \nthat the President adopted and determined the common usage, well-\nunderstood definition of sexual relations that everybody in America \nrecognizes as being the true meaning of sexual relations, meaning sex \nof any kind. Did not the President answer that under the common \nunderstanding that all of us entertain when we discuss, more so in the \nlast year than ever before in our lives, the phrase ``sexual \nrelations''? To me that is a telling feature of this case because when \nyou leap over that and get to the depositions and everything that the \nPresident might have said in those depositions, as his counsel have \nrepeatedly asserted to us was true, that he did not lie, that he did \nnot commit perjury, that he did not evade the truth, that some of it, \npuzzling to them even, but it did not amount to perjury, can they say \nabout that the statement one month before on December 23rd in \ninterrogatories?\n  That is extremely important. That is my recollection. Yours is the \none that will have to predominate, of course.\n  But the weight that I put on it, I urge you to at least evaluate as \nyou begin to level your weight on the evidence that has been presented.\n  If that were not enough, on January 15th, again before the \ndeposition, another interrogatory--this one a request for documents--\nwas submitted to the President, and again the question there was--you \nwill see it in the record; it is in the record--the request of \ndocuments says to submit anything that pertained to Monica Lewinsky, \nthe intern or employee, Monica Lewinsky, of whatever description--\nnotes, gifts, whatever, and the President in that particular instance \nagain said none. I am willing to give the President a reasonable doubt \non that and even ask you if you do not place as much weight on it as I \ndo to forget all about that. But the point is that these assertions \nunder oath were made before the Jones deposition was ever even \nconceived, let alone undertaken on January 17th.\n  So he cannot, the President cannot use the lawyer talk and judge \nbanter and the descriptions and definitions of sexual relations to \ncloud the answers that he gave at that time, and all of this in the \ncontinuous effort to destroy the rights of Paula Jones, a fellow \nAmerican citizen.\n  That brings up the question. If someone, a member of your family, or \nsomeone who is a witness to these proceedings has a serious case in \nwhich one's self, one's property, one's family has been severely \ndamaged, would you suffer without a whimper perjurious testimony given \nagainst you? Would you, knowing down deep that at the end of the day it \nhad caused you to lose your chance at retribution and a chance to be \ncompensated for damages, to restore your family life?\n  Isn't that what our system is all about? Isn't that what the adverse \nconsequence is of the attempt to obliterate the Paula Jones civil suit?\n  That is what it is, not that he committed perjury. So what? It is \nwhat the end result of that perjury might be that you should weigh. \nSkip over the fact that he committed perjury. We all acknowledge that \nit is said. But now tell me what that does to Paula Jones, or \npotentially could do to Paula Jones, or to one of you, or to one of \nyour spouses, or to one of the members of your community who wants to \nhave justice done in the courts.\n  Obstruction of justice is obstruction of justice to an individual, to \na family. You can take it from Paula Jones and telescope it upward to \nevery community, in every courthouse, and every State and every \ncommunity in our land, and there is a Paula Jones eager to assert \ncertain rights and then confronted with someone who would tear it down \nby false testimony, by lies under oath.\n  That is what the gravamen of all this really is.\n  One more thing. The counsel for the President have repeatedly and \nvery authoritatively, professionally, have asserted, as many of you \nhave, that this is not an impeachable offense, for after all, they say, \nan impeachable offense is one in which there is a direct attack on the \nsystem of government; not perjury, not obstruction of justice.\n  So what, on those, they imply. They say it does not--perjury, \nespecially about sex--attack the system of Government. I must tell you \nthat as an 8- or 9- or 10-year-old, I would accompany my mother to \nnaturalization school three or four nights a week where my mother was \nintent on learning the English language and learning about the history \nof the United States, as the teachers for naturalization were preparing \nthese prospective citizens, and she was so proud that she learned that \nthe first President of the United States was George Washington, was \nprepared to answer that question if it was posed to her in \nnaturalization court, and she was so proud when I was testing her, \npreparing. Each time I would say, ``Mom, what are the three branches of \nGovernment?'' And she would say, ``The `Exec' and the `legislate' and \nthe `judish,' '' in her wonderful, lovable accent. She knew the system \nof Government. And she did have to answer that in naturalization court. \nAnd she knew that one wall of the creed that protects our rights is the \n``judish.'' She knew that the courthouse and the rights of citizens \nwhich are advanced in that courthouse are the system of Government. Can \nanyone say that purposely attempting to destroy someone's case in the \ncourthouse is not an attack on the system of Government of our country?\n  Mr. Chabot will elucidate on perjury.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Chabot.\n  Mr. Manager CHABOT. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, distinguished \ncounsel for the President, I am Steve Chabot.\n\n[[Page S269]]\n\n I represent the First District of Ohio. Prior to my election to \nCongress, I practiced law in Cincinnati for about 15 years. As I stand \nbefore you today, I must admit that I feel a long way away from that \nsmall neighborhood law practice that I had. Though, while this arena \nmay be somewhat foreign to me, the law remains the same. As one of the \nmanagers who represents the House, I am here to summarize the law of \nperjury. While today's discussion of the law may not be as captivating \nas yesterday's discussion of the facts, it is nevertheless essential \nthat we thoroughly review the law as we move forward in this historic \nprocess. I will try to lay out the law of perjury as succinctly as I \ncan without using an extraordinary amount of the Senate's time but beg \nyou to indulge me.\n  In the United States Criminal Code, there are two perjury offenses. \nThe offenses are found in sections 1621 and 1623 of title 18 of the \nUnited States Criminal Code. Section 1621 is the broad perjury statute \nwhich makes it a Federal offense to knowingly and willfully make a \nfalse statement about a material matter while under oath. Section 1623 \nis the more specific perjury statute which makes it a Federal offense \nto knowingly make a false statement about a material matter while under \noath before a Federal court or before a Federal grand jury.\n  It is a well-settled rule that when two criminal statutes overlap, \nthe Government may charge a defendant under either one. As you know, \nthe President's false statements covered in the first impeachment \narticle were made before a Federal grand jury. Therefore, section 1623 \nis the most relevant statute. However, section 1621 is applicable as \nwell.\n  The elements of perjury. There are four general elements of perjury. \nThey are an oath, an intent, falsity, and materiality. I would like to \nwalk you through each of those elements at this time.\n  First, the oath.\n  The oath need not be administered in a particular form, but it must \nbe administered by a person or body legally authorized to do so. In \nthis case, there has been no serious challenge made about the \nlegitimacy of the oath administered to the President either in his \ncivil deposition in the Jones v. Clinton case or before the Federal \ngrand jury. Let's, once again, witness President Clinton swearing to \ntell the truth before a Federal grand jury.\n\n  (Videotape presentation.)\n  The oath element has clearly been satisfied in this case.\n  The next element is intent. To this day, the President has refused to \nacknowledge what the vast majority of Americans know to be true--that \nhe knowingly lied under oath. The President's continued inability to \ntell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth has forced \nthis body, this jury, to determine the President's true intent.\n  The intent element requires that the false testimony was knowingly \nstated and described. This requirement is generally satisfied by proof \nthat the defendant knew his testimony was false at the time it was \nprovided. As with almost all perjury cases, you will have to make a \ndecision regarding the President's knowledge of his own false \nstatements based on the surrounding facts and, yes, by circumstantial \nevidence. This does not in any way weaken the case against the \nPresident. In the absence of an admission by the defendant, relying on \ncircumstantial evidence is virtually the only way to prove the crime of \nperjury.\n  The Federal jury instructions which Federal courts use in perjury \ncases can provide helpful guidance in understanding what is meant by \nthe requirement that the false statement must be made knowingly. Let me \nquote from the Federal jury instructions:\n\n       When the word ``knowingly'' is used, it means that the \n     defendant realized what he was doing and was aware of the \n     nature of his conduct, and did not act through ignorance, \n     mistake or accident.\n\n  So as you reflect on the President's carefully calculated statements, \nremember the Federal jury instructions and ask a few simple questions: \nDid the President realize what he was doing, what he was saying? Was he \naware of the nature of his conduct or did the President simply act \nthrough ignorance, mistake or accident?\n  The answers to these questions are undeniably clear even to the \nPresident's own attorneys. In fact, Mr. Ruff and Mr. Craig testified \nbefore the Judiciary Committee that the President willfully misled the \ncourt. Let's listen to Mr. Ruff.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Mr. Ruff. I'm going to respond to your question. I have no \n     doubt that he walked up to a line that he thought he \n     understood reasonable people--and you maybe have reached this \n     conclusion--could determine that he crossed over that line \n     and that what for him was truthful but misleading or \n     nonresponsive and misleading or evasive was in fact false.\n\n  In an extraordinary admission, the President's own attorney has \nacknowledged the care, the intention, the will of the President to say \nprecisely what he said.\n  The President's actions speak volumes about his intent to make false \nstatements under oath. For example, the President called his secretary, \nBetty Currie, within hours of concluding his civil deposition and asked \nher to come to the White House the following day. President Clinton \nthen recited false characterizations to her about his relationship with \nMs. Lewinsky. As you have already heard, Ms. Currie testified that the \nPresident made the following statements to her:\n\n       You were always there when she was there, right? We were \n     never really alone. You could see and hear everything. Monica \n     came on to me, and I never touched her, right? She wanted to \n     have sex with me, and I can't do that.\n\n  This is not the conduct of someone who believed he had testified \ntruthfully. It is not the conduct of someone who acted through \nignorance, mistake or accident. Rather, it is the conduct of someone \nwho lied, knew he had lied, and needed others to modify their stories \naccordingly.\n  Finally, it is painstakingly clear during the President's grand jury \ntestimony that he, again, knows exactly what he is doing. Let's again \nwatch the following excerpt from that testimony.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       . . . was an utterly false statement. Is that correct?\n       A It depends on what the meaning of the word ``is'' is.\n\n  In this instance, and in many others that have been presented to you \nover the last 2 days, the facts and the law speak plainly.\n  The President's actions and demeanor make the case that President \nClinton knowingly and willfully lied under oath in a grand jury \nproceeding and in a civil deposition. The compelling evidence in this \ncase satisfies the intent element required under both sections 1621 and \n1623 of the Federal Criminal Code.\n  The next element, falsity. The next element of perjury is falsity. In \norder for perjury to occur in this case, the President must have made \none or more false statements. Yesterday my colleagues went through the \nevidence on this matter in great detail and clearly demonstrated that \nthe President did, in fact, make false statements while under oath. \nBecause of the evidence that was presented to date, without question \nthe President's falsity and his false statements have been shown, so I \nam going to move forward to the final element of perjury, which is \nmateriality.\n  The test for whether a statement is material, as stated by the \nSupreme Court in Kungys v. United States, is simply whether it had a \n``natural tendency to influence'' or was ``capable of influencing'' the \nofficial proceeding. The law also makes clear that the false statement \ndoes not have to actually impede the grand jury's investigation for the \nstatement to be material.\n  The law regarding the materiality of false statements before a grand \njury is very straightforward. Because a grand jury's authority to \ninvestigate is broad, the realm of declarations regarded as material is \nbroad. The President's false statements to the grand jury were material \nbecause the grand jury was investigating whether the President had \nobstructed justice and committed perjury in a civil deposition.\n  Now let's look at potential legal smokescreens. The President's \nattorneys will try to distract you from the relevant law and facts in \nthis case. To help you stay focused on the law, I would like to preview \nsome of the arguments that may be made by the President's attorneys.\n  Legal smokescreen No. 1, the Bronston case. You will probably hear\n\n[[Page S270]]\n\nopposing counsel argue that the President did not technically commit \nperjury, and appeal to the case of Bronston v. United States. This is a \nlegal smokescreen. In the Bronston case, the Supreme Court held that \nstatements that are literally truthful and nonresponsive cannot by \nthemselves form the basis for a perjury conviction. This is the \ncornerstone of the President's defense. However, the Court also held \nthat the unresponsive statements must be technically true in order to \nprevent a perjury conviction; such statements must not be capable of \nbeing conclusively proven false.\n  As we have seen, none of the President's perjurious statements before \nthe grand jury, covered in the first impeachment article, are \ntechnically true. So, when the President's counsel cites the Bronston \ncase, remember the facts. Ask yourselves, are the President's answers \nliterally true? And remember, to be literally true they must actually \nbe true.\n  It is also important to note that, consistent with the Bronston case, \nthe response, ``I don't recall,'' is not technically true if the \nPresident actually could recall. The factual record in the case, \nconsisting of multiple sworn statements contradicting the President's \ntestimony and highly specific corroborating evidence, demonstrates that \nthe President's statements were not literally true or legally accurate. \nOn the contrary, the record establishes that the President repeatedly \nlied, he repeatedly deceived, he repeatedly feigned forgetfulness.\n\n  There are other clear and important limitations on the Bronston \ncase's scope. In United States v. DeZarn, handed down just 3 months ago \nby the 6th circuit court of appeals, the court made an important ruling \nthat is directly on point in this case. The court of appeals stated:\n\n       Because we believe that the crime of perjury depends not \n     only upon the clarity of the questioning itself, but also \n     upon the knowledge and reasonable understanding of the \n     testifier [President Clinton] as to what is meant by the \n     questioning, we hold that a defendant may be found guilty of \n     perjury if a jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt from \n     the evidence presented that the defendant knew what the \n     question meant and gave knowingly untruthful and materially \n     misleading answers in response.\n\n  The Bronston case has further limitations. For example, in United \nStates v. Swindall, the court held that the jury can convict for \nperjury even if the questions or statements involved are capable of \nmultiple interpretations where only one interpretation is reasonable \nunder the circumstances surrounding their utterances.\n  In United States v. Doherty, the court held that the prosecution for \nperjury is not barred under Bronston, ``whenever some ambiguity can be \nfound by an implausibly strained reading of the question'' posed. I \nwould submit to this body that ``implausibly strained reading of the \nquestion'' posed is precisely what confronts us time and again in the \ncase of the President before the grand jury.\n  Legal smokescreen No. 2, the two-witness rule. In the coming days you \nmay hear opposing counsel argue that the President did not commit \nperjury by appealing to the so-called two-witness rule. Again, this is \nnothing but a legal smokescreen. This common law rule requires that \nthere be either two witnesses to a perjurious statement or, in the \nalternative, that there be one witness and corroborating evidence of \nthe perjury. Opposing counsel may suggest that, because there were not \ntwo witnesses present for some of the President's false statements, he \ndid not technically commit perjury. Such an appeal to the two-witness \nrule is wrong for several reasons.\n  First, the two-witness rule is not applicable under section 1623, \nonly under 1621. The language of 1623 expressly provides, ``it shall \nnot be necessary that such proof be made by any particular number of \nwitnesses or by documentary or other type of evidence.''\n  Congress passed section 1623 back in 1970 to eliminate the two-\nwitness requirement and to facilitate the prosecution of perjury and \nenhance the reliability of testimony before Federal courts and Federal \ngrand juries. The legislative history establishes this as the \nfundamental purpose of the statute.\n  Additionally, substantial evidence has been presented over the last 2 \ndays to satisfy the requirements of the two-witness rule under section \n1621. Remember, when the two-witness rule applies, it does not actually \nrequire two witnesses. Indeed, it requires either two witnesses or one \nwitness and corroborating evidence. As you know, there is a witness to \neach and every one of the President's false statements and there is \nvoluminous evidence which corroborates the falsehood of his statements.\n  Finally, case law tells us that the two-witness rule is not \napplicable under certain circumstances, when the defendant falsely \nclaims an inability to recall a material matter.\n  Another possible legal smokescreen, the drafting of article I, \narticle I being the first article of impeachment.\n  As you know, impeachment article I says:\n\n       Contrary to that oath, William Jefferson Clinton willfully \n     provided perjurious, false and misleading testimony to the \n     grand jury . . .\n\n  You may hear opposing counsel argue that section 1621 is the only \napplicable statute because the article of impeachment accuses the \nPresident of willfully committing perjury. This is another legal \nsmokescreen.\n  Following that reasoning, one could just as easily make the argument \nthat 1623 was contemplated here because the term ``false'' does not \nappear in 1621 but does appear in 1623. However, that is not the point. \nThe point is that the language of the impeachment article did not use \nthese terms as terms of art as they are defined and used in various \ncriminal statutes.\n  While the article of impeachment does not draw a distinction between \nthe standards, evidence has been presented over the last 2 days that \ndemonstrates that the President did knowingly and willfully lie under \noath regarding material matters before a grand jury, and that satisfies \nboth 1623 and 1621.\n  Again, in the context of perjury law, the distinction between a \nknowing falsehood and a willful falsehood is almost a distinction \nwithout a difference. In American Surety Company v. Sullivan, the \nSecond Circuit stated that ``the word `willful,' even in a criminal \nstatute, means no more than the person charged with the duty knows what \nhe is doing.''\n  So that, in essence, is the law of perjury.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, throughout this long and \ndifficult process, apologists for the President have maintained that \nhis actions might well have been reprehensible but are not necessarily \nworthy of impeachment and removal from office. I submit, however, that \ntelling the truth under oath is critically important to our judicial \nsystem and that perjury, of which I believe a compelling case is being \nmade, strikes a terrible blow against the machinery of justice in this \ncountry.\n  The President of the United States, the chief law enforcement officer \nof this land, lied under oath. He raised his right hand and he swore to \ntell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, and then he \nlied. Pure and simple.\n  Why is perjury such a serious offense? Under the American system of \njustice, our courts are charged with seeking the truth. Every day, \nAmerican citizens raise their right hands in courtrooms across the \ncountry and take an oath to tell the truth. Breaking that oath cripples \nour justice system. By lying under oath, the President did not just \ncommit perjury, an offense punishable under our criminal code, but he \nchipped away at the very cornerstone of our judicial system.\n  The first Chief Justice of the United States of the Supreme Court, \nJohn Jay, eloquently stated why perjury is so dangerous over 200 years \nago. On June 25, 1792, in a charge to the grand jury of the Circuit \nCourt for the District of Vermont, the Chief Justice said:\n\n       Independent of the abominable Insult which Perjury offers \n     to the divine Being, there is no Crime more extensively \n     pernicious to Society. It discolours and poisons Streams of \n     Justice, and by substituting Falsehood for Truth, saps the \n     Foundations of personal and public Rights--Controversies of \n     various kinds exist at all Times, and in all Communities. To \n     decide them, Courts of Justice are instituted--their \n     Decisions must be regulated by Evidence, and the greater part \n     of Evidence will always consist of the Testimony of \n     witnesses. This Testimony is given under those solemn \n     obligations which an appeal to the God of Truth impose; and \n     if oaths\n\n[[Page S271]]\n\n     should cease to be held sacred, our dearest and most valuable \n     Rights would become insecure.\n\n  Why has the President been impeached by the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives? Why is he on trial here today in the U.S. Senate? \nBecause he lied under oath. Because he committed perjury. Because if \nthe oaths cease to be held sacred, our dearest and most valuable rights \nwill become insecure.\n  During the course of this trial, Members of this distinguished body, \nthe jurors in this case, will have to consider the law and the facts \nvery carefully. It is a daunting task and an awesome responsibility, \none that cannot be taken lightly. I humbly suggest to those sitting in \njudgment of the President that we must all weigh the impact of our \nactions, not only on our beloved Nation today, but on American history. \nIt is my belief that if the actions of the President are ultimately \ndisregarded or minimized, we will be sending a sorry message to the \nAmerican people that the President of the United States is above the \nlaw. We will be sending a message to our children, to my children, that \ntelling the truth doesn't really matter if you have a good lawyer or \nyou are an exceptionally skilled liar. That would be tragic.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, let us instead send a message to the \nAmerican people and to the boys and girls who will be studying American \nhistory in the years to come that no person is above the law and that \nthis great Nation remains an entity governed by the rule of law. Let us \ndo what is right. Let us do what is just. Thank you.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Cannon.\n  Mr. Manager CANNON. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, distinguished \ncounsel of the President, my name is Chris Cannon. I represent Utah's \nThird Congressional District.\n  John Locke once said, ``Wherever law ends, tyranny begins.'' And \nspeaking to our American experience, Teddy Roosevelt added, ``No man is \nabove the law and no man is below it; nor do we ask any man's \npermission when we require him to obey it. Obedience to the law is \ndemanded as a right; not as a favor.''\n  This case is about the violation of law. My task is to clarify what \nthe law states pertaining to obstruction of justice and what legal \nprecedent is applicable to the charges against William Jefferson \nClinton.\n  While both the laws and the violations in this case are clear and \ndirect, the presentation I am about to make will not be simple. I ask \nyour indulgence and attention as I walk you through case history and \nstatutory elements. I promise to be brief--probably less than a half-\nhour--and direct.\n  I will present the legal underpinnings of the law of obstruction of \njustice. You should have before you the full text of this speech, \nincluding full citations to cases and copies of the charts I will use \nin this presentation.\n  Article II of the articles of impeachment alleges that the President \nprevented, obstructed, and impeded the administration of justice, both \npersonally and through his subordinates and agents, and that he did so \nas part of a pattern designed to delay, impede, cover up, and conceal \nthe existence of evidence and testimony related to a Federal civil \nrights action brought against him.\n  Article II specifies seven separate instances in which the President \nacted to obstruct justice. The House believes the evidence in this case \nproves that each of the seven separate acts which comprise the \nPresident's scheme constitutes obstruction of justice.\n  I would like to draw your attention at this time to the chart on my \nright, and the first page in your packet, which depicts elements of \nsection 1503:\n\n       (a) Whoever . . . corruptly . . . influences obstructs or \n     impedes; or endeavors to influence, obstruct or impede, the \n     due administration of justice, shall be punished as provided \n     in subsection (b).\n       (b) The punishment for an offense under this section is . . \n     .\n       (3) . . . imprisonment for not more than 10 years, a fine \n     under this title, or both.\n\n  Section 1503 is often referred to as the general obstruction statute. \nIt describes obstruction simply as an impact on the due administration \nof justice.\n  Section 1503 deems it criminal to use force or threats, or to \notherwise act corruptly, in order to influence, obstruct, or impede the \ndue administration of justice.\n  Federal court rulings clarify that it is not necessary for a \ndefendant to succeed in obstructing justice. Again, I direct your \nattention to the chart, or the accompanying chart, in your package.\n  Russell and Aguilar each ruled that it is not necessary that a \ndefendant's endeavor succeed for him to have violated the law. Rather, \nsimply attempting to influence, obstruct, or impede the due \nadministration of justice violates the statute.\n  Maggitt clearly stated, ``it is the endeavor to bring about a \nforbidden result and not the success in actually achieving the result, \nthat is forbidden.''\n  For the Government to prove a section 1503 crime, it must demonstrate \nthat the defendant acted with intent. This can be shown through use of \nforce, threats by the defendant, or by simply showing that the \ndefendant acted ``corruptly.'' The following chart gives three case \nhistories regarding the term ``acting corruptly.''\n  Haldeman and Sprecher held that a defendant acts corruptly by having \nan evil or improper purpose or intent.\n  Barfield defined ``acting corruptly'' as knowingly and intentionally \nacting in order to encourage obstruction.\n  Sprecher also ruled the Government need not prove the actual intent \nof the defendant, but, rather, the intent to act corruptly can be \ninferred from that proof that the defendant knew corrupt actions would \nobstruct the justice being administered.\n  Under section 1503, the Government must also prove that the defendant \nendeavored to influence, obstruct or impede the due administration of \njustice. The statute is broadly applicable to all phases of judicial \nproceedings.\n  Brenson described due administration of justice as ``providing a \nprotective cloak over all judicial proceedings, regardless of the stage \nin which the improper activity occurs.''\n  Section 1503 is also intended to protect the discovery phase of a \njudicial proceeding, stating that the phrase ``due administration of \njustice'' is intended to provide a ``free and fair opportunity to every \nlitigant in a pending case in Federal court to learn what he may learn \n. . . concerning the material facts and to exercise his option as to \nintroducing testimony of such facts.''\n  The House believes that the facts of this case make it very clear \nthat the President did, corruptly, impair the ability of a litigant in \nFederal court to learn all of the facts that she was entitled to learn. \nIn doing so, the President committed obstruction of justice under \nsection 1503.\n  The other Federal crime which the President committed was witness \ntampering under section 1512 of title 18. Again, I refer you to the \nchart on my right, and to the second page in the package, which depicts \nthe elements of the section.\n\n       (b) Whoever knowingly . . . corruptly persuades another \n     person, or attempts to do so, or engages in misleading \n     conduct toward another person, with intent to--\n       (1) influence, delay or prevent the testimony of any person \n     in an official proceeding; or\n       (2) cause or induce any person to--\n       (A) withhold testimony, or withhold a . . . document . . . \n     or an object . . . from an official proceeding;\n       . . . shall be fined under this title, or imprisoned for \n     not more than ten years or both.\n\n  Sections 1503 and 1512 differ in an important way. There does not \nneed to be a case pending at the time the defendant acts to violate the \nlaw under section 1512. The statute specifically states that ``for the \npurpose of this section, an official proceeding need not be pending or \nabout to be instituted at the time of the offense . . .'' for the crime \nto be committed.\n  Putting it another way, a person may attempt to tamper with a witness \nand commit the crime of witness tampering before such a person is \ncalled as a witness and even before there is a case underway in which \nthat person might be called to testify.\n  For the Government to prove the crime of witness tampering, it must \nprove that the defendant acted with the intent to cause one of several \nresults. The defendant can be convicted if he acted to influence, delay \nor prevent the testimony of any person in an official proceeding; or \nthe defendant can be convicted if he acted to cause another person to \nwithhold an object from an official proceeding.\n  In the case before us, the evidence proves that the President \nendeavored to cause both of these results on several occasions. And the \nGovernment\n\n[[Page S272]]\n\nmay show intent on the part of the defendant in several ways. It may \nprove the use of intimidation, physical force or threats; or it may \nprove intent by showing the use of corrupt persuasion or misleading \nconduct.\n  In this case, the evidence shows that on several occasions the \nPresident acted corruptly to persuade some witnesses, and engaged in \nmisleading conduct toward others, in order to influence their testimony \nand cause them to withhold evidence or give wrongful testimony. In each \ninstance, the President violated the witness tampering statute.\n  How does acting corruptly to persuade a witness differ from engaging \nin misleading conduct? Section 1515 in title 18 states:\n\n       (a) as used in section 1512 [the witness tampering section] \n     . . . of this title and this section--\n       (3) the term ``misleading conduct'' means--\n       (A) knowingly making a false statement; or\n       (B) intentionally omitting information from a statement and \n     thereby causing a portion of such statement to be misleading, \n     or intentionally concealing a material fact, and thereby \n     creating a false impression by such statement; or\n       (C) with intent to mislead, knowingly submitting or \n     inviting reliance on a writing or recording that is false, \n     forged, altered or otherwise lacking in authenticity;\n\n  The difference between corruptly persuading a witness and engaging in \nmisleading conduct toward the witness depends on the witness' level of \nknowledge about the truth of the defendant's statement.\n  Rodolitz held that misleading conduct involves a situation ``where a \ndefendant tells a potential witness a false story as if the story were \ntrue, intending that the witness believe the story and testify to it \nbefore the grand jury.''\n  Let me clarify this detail: If a defendant simply asks a witness to \nlie and the witness knows that he is being asked to lie, then the \ndefendant is corruptly persuading the witness. In contrast, if a \ndefendant lies to a witness, hoping the witness will believe his story, \nthis is misleading conduct. They are different, but they are both \ncriminal.\n  Some may ask if it is necessary that the witness who is influenced or \ntampered with know that he or she might be called to testify? The \nanswer is no.\n  And both sections 1503 and 1512 answer this question:\n  The witness tampering statute can be violated even if the victim has \nnot been subpoenaed or listed as a potential witness in an ongoing \nproceeding.\n  In Shannon, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reviewed \nthe conviction of a defendant under section 1503 who had attempted to \ninfluence the testimony of a person who had not yet been subpoenaed or \nplaced on a witness list. On appeal, the defendant argued that because \nthe target of the obstruction had not yet become an official witness in \nthe case, it was impossible for the defendant to have engaged in \nobstruction toward her. The court of appeals rejected that assertion. \nIn affirming the conviction, the court held ``neither must the target \nbe scheduled to testify at the time of the offense nor must he or she \nactually give testimony at a later time. It is only necessary that \nthere is a possibility that the target of the defendant's activities be \ncalled on to testify in an official proceeding.''\n  The witness tampering statute can be violated even when no case is \npending.\n  Therefore, it will not always be clear to whom the defendant intended \nthe individual to testify--and the statute does not require proof of \nthis.\n  In Morrison, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia explained that section 1512 is violated if the defendant asks \na person to lie ``to anyone who asks.'' The court held that it is not \nnecessary that the defendant even use the words ``testify'' or \n``trial'' when he tries to influence the testimony of the other person. \nIn such a case, there are no subpoenas, there are no witness lists.\n  The mere attempt to influence the person to lie, if asked, is the \ncrime.\n  So, under either section 1503 or 1512, the fact that the target of a \ndefendant's actions is not named as a witness, or whether the person is \nnot ever called to be a witness, is immaterial.\n  The focus of both statutes is on what the defendant believed.\n  If the defendant believes that it is possible that some person might \nsome day be called to testify at some later proceeding and then acted \nto influence, delay or prevent his or her testimony, the defendant \ncommits the crime.\n  Now, some have asserted that an obstruction of justice charge cannot, \nor should not, be made against the President because some of his acts \noccurred in the context of a civil trial. There is simply no merit to \nthis view.\n  There is no question that the obstruction and witness tampering \nstatutes can be violated by acts that occur in civil proceedings. And, \ncase law is consistent in upholding that any attempt to influence, \nobstruct or impede the due administration of justice in a civil \nproceeding violates section 1503.\n  Lundwall, which I referred to earlier, is a perfect example, as it \nbegan as a civil case.\n  The actual language of the witness tampering statute makes it clear \nthat it also applies to civil cases.\n  The statute provides for enhanced penalties in criminal proceedings--\na provision that would be unnecessary if the law were only to apply to \ncriminal cases.\n  In short, the fact that some instances of the President's misconduct \noccurred in the course of a civil proceeding does not absolve him of \ncriminal liability.\n  As Mr. Barr will demonstrate, the President of the United States \nendeavored and did obstruct justice and tamper with witnesses in \nviolation of the law of the United States.\n  On numerous occasions he acted with an improper purpose with the \nintent to interfere with the due administration of justice in the \nFederal civil rights lawsuit filed by Paula Jones.\n  President Clinton corruptly endeavored to persuade witnesses to lie. \nIn some cases, he succeeded. In every case, he violated the law.\n  President Clinton engaged in misleading conduct in order to influence \nthe testimony of witnesses in judicial proceedings. He succeeded. In \neach case, he violated the law.\n  President Clinton acted with an improper purpose to persuade a person \nto withhold objects from a judicial proceeding in which that person was \nrequired to produce them. He succeeded and in so doing he violated the \nlaw.\n  President Clinton made misleading statements for the purpose of \ndeterring a litigant from further discovery that would lead to facts \nwhich the judge ordered relevant in a Federal civil rights case. In so \ndoing, he obstructed the due administration of justice in that case and \nviolated the law.\n  Whether attempting to persuade a person to testify falsely, or to \nignore court orders to produce objects; whether suggesting to an \ninnocent person a false story in hopes that he or she will repeat it in \na judicial proceedings; or testifying falsely in the hopes of blocking \nanother party's pursuit of the truth--all these acts obstruct justice; \nall these acts are Federal felony crimes; all these acts were committed \nby William Jefferson Clinton.\n  Thank you.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n\n\n                                 Recess\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that there now \nbe a recess again of the proceedings for 15 minutes. Please return \npromptly to the Chamber.\n  There being no objection, at 3:29 p.m., the Senate recessed until \n3:47 p.m.; whereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by \nthe Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I believe we are ready for the final \nsubject today, from Manager Barr.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Barr.\n  Mr. Manager BARR. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, learned counsel for the President, and \nfellow managers, on behalf of the House of Representatives, I thank the \nSenate for the opportunity to appear today and to present this \nargument. The House--and I, especially--greatly appreciate the time and \neffort the Senate has taken on this most important and notable matter.\n  You have heard the facts summarized by my colleagues. They have \ndescribed for you the law of perjury and the law of obstruction. I will \ndiscuss several of the specific instances in which William Jefferson \nClinton violated these laws as set forth in the articles of impeachment \npresented to you.\n\n[[Page S273]]\n\n  The process facing you as jurors, of fitting the Federal law of \nobstruction of justice and of witness tampering and of perjury into the \nfacts of the case against President William Jefferson Clinton, is not a \ncase in which there is nor should be a great deal of difficulty. It is \nnot a problem of fitting a round peg into a square hole. Quite the \ncontrary. We have a case here, you have a case here, for consideration \nin which the fit between fact and law is as precise as the finely tuned \nmechanism of a Swiss watch or as seamless a process as the convergence \nand confluence of two great rivers such as flow through many of the \ncities which you represent. The evidence that President William \nJefferson Clinton committed perjury and obstruction of justice is \noverwhelming. These are pattern offenses.\n\n  I beg your attention to the following exposition of facts and law, \nbut before commencing, I would like to address three issues that have \ncome up during the course of the proceedings, which I believe might be \nhelpful for all of us to keep in mind as we proceed not only through \ntoday's final presentations, but tomorrow's and those that will be made \nby learned counsel for the President.\n  First, by way of background on the process--that is, the process that \nbrings us, the House managers, to the well of this great body and the \ntrial of the President of the United States of America--as has been \nindicated previously by one of my colleague House managers, and as \neveryone here knows full well, the responsibilities, the jurisdiction, \nand the process between the House of Representatives and the Senate is \nvery different in all three of those respects. Therefore, while coming \nas no surprise to all of you, all of us in this room, but perhaps to \nsome in America, the steps that each body takes, and should take and \nmust take, are very different.\n  Just as one example, one might ask, ``Why were no witnesses called in \nthe House of Representatives?'' A valid question. It deserves a valid \nanswer. That valid answer can be found not simply in impeachment \nproceedings and the history thereof, but also in the day-in/day-out \nproceedings in our Federal courts and in our State courts. It can be \nfound in the difference between the body which has responsibility and \njurisdiction for charging a crime and the jurisdiction and \nresponsibility of the body that has responsibility for trying a crime, \nor an alleged crime. The House of Representatives, though it is not in \nevery respect like a grand jury, operates much more like a grand jury \nthan a petite jury. As something akin to a grand jury, we had in mind--\nand I know you have in mind--being very mindful and knowledgeable about \nthe difference in procedure between the House and Senate on matters of \nimpeachment, that frequently in court cases presented to Federal grand \njuries--and I suspect similarly to State grand juries--the evidence to \nthe grand jurors themselves is not presented through a long array, a \nrepetitive array of witnesses themselves--witnesses, that is, with \nfirsthand knowledge of each and every fact, which would later be proved \nat trial. Rather, it is the more standard procedure--certainly in \nFederal courts, with which I am more familiar--for the Government to \npresent its case to the grand jury by way of summary witnesses. \nNormally, that would mean case agents that have been working with the \nassistant U.S. attorneys, or with the U.S. attorney, in gathering and \nevaluating the evidence that will eventually be brought to bear in the \ntrial of the case.\n  If one were to be a fly on the wall of a Federal grand jury, one \nwould normally see witnesses for the Government that would come in and \ndiscuss the general parameters and the specific evidence of the case \nthat they would present in court, frequently summarizing the actual \nevidence that would be presented in court by the witnesses themselves. \nThat is the standard operating procedure. That is not to say that there \nis also not presented voluminous written evidence, documentary \nevidence. That is frequently the case as well. Nor is that to say that \nthere are not, from time to time, cases presented to Federal grand \njuries in which there are actual witnesses with firsthand knowledge.\n  I will simply make a point of which we are all aware. I think as we \nbegin, or in anticipation of your process of sifting through all of \nthis procedure, this evidence, all of this law, we should keep in mind \nthat our job in the House was to approach it necessarily very different \nfrom the way you approach your job as jurors, as triers of fact. We, in \nfact, presented to the House of Representatives, through the work on \nour Judiciary Committee, a large volume of evidence presented to us and \nthrough us to the House of Representatives as the charging body, not \nthe trier of fact body. That is, to essentially summarize and discuss \nthrough the words, through the opinions of the independent counsel, as \nakin to the chief investigative officer in a grand jury in Federal \ndistrict court, through the words of many expert witnesses, as it were, \nwho placed all of that in context.\n\n  We did not want to usurp your duty, your responsibility given to you \nby the Constitution as the trier of fact. We are not that presumptuous. \nIt is your responsibility, it is your solemn duty to be the trier of \nfact. That is very different from our solemn duty, which I believe the \nHouse performed admirably in essentially reaching the conclusion that \nthere is probable cause to convict the President of perjury and \nobstruction of justice. And we did so in a way that is mindful and \nrespectful of your responsibilities, that carried out our \nresponsibilities, and that is familiar to citizens all across this \nland, because it is essentially the same process that operates in \nFederal courts where you see also, as here, a very clear distinction \nbetween the body that charges the crime, the grand jury, and the body \nthat tries the crime--that is, the jury, and in this case it is the \nSenate of the United States of America.\n  A second point that may very well come up, perhaps, in the \npresentation of the defense by the President's learned counsel, which \nalthough very familiar to those of us, as there are many in this \nChamber with a legal background, but which I think also is important to \nkeep in mind as you reflect on and later deliberate on the evidence \nitself in this case; and that is that there are, indeed, two types of \nevidence. In virtually every case, whichever finds its way to a court \nof law and results in a trial, both types of evidence are found, used, \nconsidered, and form the basis, legitimately, for the eventual \nrendering of a decision by a jury. Those two types of evidence are \ndirect and circumstantial.\n  Frequently--and I know this from actual experience--defense lawyers \nwill attack the Government's case, and one of the standard attacks that \nthey level against the Government's case is that it is based on \ncircumstantial evidence. You even hear that by the folks out there \ntoday--not in this room--that are saying, ``Oh, all we are seeing is \ncircumstantial evidence and that is not as good as direct evidence.''\n  Now, to the lay person who is unfamiliar with the ways of our laws, \nour courts, and the work of this great body, that may have some \ncurrency, it may have some surface appeal. They may say, ``Well, that \ncommentator was right, and that White House spokesman was right. If all \nthey are doing is talking about circumstantial evidence, they can't \nhave a very strong case, because if they had a strong case, they would \nhave direct evidence.''\n  Well, the fact of the matter is, it is a principle of long and \nconsistent standing in every Federal court in our land, and I suspect \nevery State court in our land, and as directed by every Federal judge \nto every Federal jury taking evidence, circumstantial evidence is to \nbe, and shall not be afforded any less weight than direct evidence. And \ntriers of fact are directed by judges in every case not to accord less \nweight to one type of evidence as opposed to the other. That is, in the \nwords of one of my fellow managers, a smokescreen, a red herring if \nsomebody raises as a defense in a case--this case or other cases--that \nthe case is weakened somehow because there is a reliance on \ncircumstantial evidence and it is not found solely on direct evidence.\n  That is a very important principle. I would appreciate your \nindulgence in that small foray into some basic precepts that I think \nall of us, certainly most of you included, need to keep in mind.\n  Finally, there is one other sort of process argument that one hears \nsort of floating around in the ether out there that I think also is \nimportant for\n\n[[Page S274]]\n\nall of us to keep in mind; that is, facts and the law do bear \nrepeating--not endless, not pointless, but appropriate repetition. Even \ntoday, even yesterday in the first round of presentations to this body, \nthere was in fact repetition of certain facts, certain aspects of the \nlaw. That is not presented to you simply to emphasize a point, simply \nto make it appear stronger because we say it five times instead of two. \nThere is a very important reason for appropriate repetition.\n  For example, in a case such as this where you have two sets of laws \nalleged to have been violated--perjury laws and obstruction of justice \nlaws--each one of those has several different elements. And, in \naddition to that, it is legitimate as presenters of facts in the law \nfor managers, for prosecutors, or plaintiff's attorneys to take a \nparticular fact, a particular note, and use it to illustrate several \ndifferent points. For example, one particular fact may provide evidence \nof motive. It may also provide one of the substantive elements of \nperjury or obstruction of justice, or it may go to the state of mind of \na declarant, a witness. It may provide important evidence with regard \nto a course of conduct, prior knowledge, and the list goes on.\n  That is why, Senators, frequently in the course of these particular \npresentations--and, again, no different from the course of presentation \nin Federal and, I suspect, State courts throughout the land--in trials \nthere necessarily is and should be, in order to responsibly present all \nof the evidence in all of its elements, certain repetition. Our job as \nmanagers is to make sure we do not abuse that necessity and that we do \nnot in fact offer repetitive notion, repetitive references, without \nhaving a very clear and specific purpose such as I mentioned for that \nprocess.\n  Finally, before turning to that merger of the law and the facts, \nwhich I believe will illustrate conclusively that this President has \ncommitted and ought to be convicted on perjury and obstruction of \njustice, I would respectfully ask that you remember that, under the law \nof impeachment based on our Constitution, proof beyond a reasonable \ndoubt that the President committed each and every element of one or \nmore violations of provisions of the Federal Criminal Code has never \nbeen required to sustain a conviction in any prior impeachment trial in \nthe Senate. However--and I can say confidently that I speak for all \nHouse managers in relating to you our belief that the record and the \nlaw applicable to these two articles of impeachment clearly establish \nthat President William Jefferson Clinton did in fact violate several \nprovisions of title 18 of the United States Code--that is the criminal \ncode--including perjury, obstruction, and tampering with witnesses.\n  At this point, a lawyer would face, a fortiori--I will not, but I \nwill say at this point that it therefore goes without saying that \nindeed exists--under every historical standard, every historical \nbenchmark which this Chamber has used, there is more than sufficient \ngrounds on which you might face a conviction as to both articles.\n  Beginning then in looking at how the facts and the law, both of which \nyou have heard through the words and exhibits of my colleagues and the \nevidence that you already have, let us look first at the submission of \nthe false affidavit in the Jones case.\n  We believe the evidence presented clearly establishes that on \nDecember 17, 1997, the President encouraged a witness in a Federal \ncivil rights action brought against him, that witness being Monica \nLewinsky, to execute a sworn affidavit in that proceeding which he knew \nto be perjurious, false, and misleading. As other managers have \noutlined, Monica Lewinsky filed a sworn affidavit in the Jones case \nthat denied the relationship between her and the President. That \naffidavit was false.\n  Ms. Lewinsky testified under oath before the grand jury that the \nscheme to file this false affidavit was devised or hatched during a \ntelephone conversation with the President on December 17, 1997, a call \nthe President initiated to Ms. Lewinsky at 2 or 2:30 a.m. ostensibly to \ngive her the bad news that Betty Currie's brother had been killed in a \ncar accident but apparently, since it consumed the vast majority of the \ntime of that conversation, more importantly, for the President to tell \nMs. Lewinsky her name was on the witness list filed in the Jones case \nand to thereafter discuss during that conversation the President's \nsuggestion to her that she could file an affidavit in the Jones case in \norder for the purpose of avoiding having to testify in that case--not \nto cover up but in order to avoid having to testify in an ongoing legal \nproceeding in U.S. district court.\n  She testified that both she and the President understood from their \nconversation they would continue their pattern of covering up. She \ntestified she knew that if she filed a truthful affidavit the Jones \nlawyers would certainly have deposed her in that case.\n  The testimony of Mr. Vernon Jordan confirms the President knew Ms. \nLewinsky planned to file a false affidavit. He stated that, based on \nhis conversations with the President, that the President knew in \nadvance that Ms. Lewinsky planned to execute an affidavit denying their \nrelationship and that he later informed the President Ms. Lewinsky had \nsigned in fact that false affidavit.\n  For his part, the President denies asking Ms. Lewinsky to execute a \nfalse affidavit. Instead, as he asserted in his response to the House \nJudiciary Committee's request for admission, he seeks to have you now \nbelieve he sought simply to have Ms. Lewinsky execute an affidavit that \nwill ``get her out of having to testify.''\n  While being factually correct, this statement reflects a legal \nimpossibility. The President has admitted Ms. Lewinsky was the woman \nwith whom he indeed had an improper intimate relationship while \nPresident. And he has admitted he was very concerned over the great \npersonal embarrassment and humiliation he feared would have occurred if \nthat relationship had been revealed in the Jones case. Yet, he would \nhave you believe he cannot remember a call he made to that woman about \nthat case which occurred at 2 o'clock in the morning. His statement is \nnot credible, and the reason it is not credible is because it is not \ntrue.\n  As Mr. Jordan's grand jury testimony corroborates, the President knew \nwhat Ms. Lewinsky planned to allege in her affidavit, yet the President \ntook no action to stop her from filing it. As you have heard in earlier \npresentations, the President's lawyer, Mr. Robert Bennett, stated in \ncourt directly to Judge Wright when he presented the false affidavit, \n``There is absolutely no sex of any kind in any manner, shape or \nform,'' and that the President was ``fully aware of Ms. Lewinsky's \naffidavit.'' The President took no action to correct his lawyer's \nmisstatement.\n  As you have also heard, the President, in his grand jury testimony, \ntried to disingenuously dissect the words of his attorney to remove his \nconduct from further examination, even though obviously, and by any \nreasonable interpretation or inference of the definition given the \nPresident, his conduct with Ms. Lewinsky was covered. And he disavowed \nknowledge of his lawyer's representations by claiming he was not paying \nattention. That canard has been most ably disposed of in prior \npresentations both through the words of the managers and the videotape \npresentations.\n  Later in the deposition, when Mr. Bennett read to the President the \nportion of the affidavit in which Ms. Lewinsky denies their \nrelationship and asked him ``is that a true and accurate statement as \nfar as you know it,'' the President answered, ``That is absolutely \ntrue.'' This statement is neither credible nor true. It is perjury.\n  The inescapable conclusion from this evidence is that the President \nhas lied, and continues to lie, about the affidavit. His continued \nfalse statements and denials about the affidavit bolster the conclusion \nof our managers that, in fact, he was part of the scheme to file the \nfalse affidavit. The evidence supports Ms. Lewinsky's account that such \na scheme did in fact exist between them. The evidence and all \nreasonable inferences drawn therefrom do not support the President's \ndenial--inferences, I respectfully add, that in your deliberations, as \nin the deliberations of any jury, are to be and should be based on \ncommon sense and deliberated in terms of the light of your experiences \nin judging human behavior.\n  Moreover, in engaging in this course of conduct, referring here to \nthe words of the obstruction statute found at section 1503 of the \nCriminal Code, the\n\n[[Page S275]]\n\nPresident's actions constituted an endeavor to influence or impede the \ndue administration of justice in that he was attempting to prevent the \nplaintiff in the Jones case from having a ``free and fair opportunity \nto learn what she may learn concerning the material facts surrounding \nher claim.'' These acts by the President also constituted an endeavor \nto ``corruptly persuade another person with the intent to influence the \ntestimony they might give in an official proceeding.'' Such are the \nelements of tampering with witnesses found at section 1512 of the \nFederal Criminal Code.\n  Ms. Lewinsky knew full well her only hope of not having to testify \nwas to file an affidavit that did not truthfully reflect her \nrelationship with the President. The President also knew that if she \nhad filed a true affidavit, without any doubt, it would have caused the \nJones lawyers to seek her further testimony--something both \ncoconspirators desperately sought to avoid.\n  In encouraging her to file an affidavit that would prevent her from \nhaving to testify, President Clinton was, of necessity, asking her to \ntestify falsely in an official proceeding. He was attempting to \nprevent, and in fact did prevent, the plaintiff in that case from \ndiscovering facts which may have had a bearing on her claim against the \nPresident. His motive was improper in the language of the law, that is, \ncorrupt. And his actions did influence the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky as \na witness in the pending official proceeding in U.S. district court.\n\n  Under both sections of the Federal Criminal Code, that is, 1503, \nobstruction, and 1512, obstruction in the form of witness tampering, \nthe President's conduct constituted a Federal crime and satisfies the \nelements of those statutes.\n  With regard to the issue of perjury before the grand jury concerning \nthe affidavit, we as managers would show that when asked before the \ngrand jury whether he had instructed Ms. Lewinsky to file a truthful \naffidavit, President Clinton testified, ``Did I hope she would be able \nto get out of testifying on an affidavit? Absolutely. Did I want her to \nexecute a false affidavit? No, I did not.''\n  The evidence, however, clearly establishes that the President's \nstatement constitutes perjury, in violation of section 1623 of the U.S. \nFederal Criminal Code for the simple reason the only realistic way Ms. \nLewinsky could get out of having to testify based on her affidavit \nwould be to execute a false affidavit. There was no other way it could \nhave happened. The President knew this. Ms. Lewinsky knew this. And the \nPresident's testimony on this point is perjury within the clear meaning \nof the Federal perjury statute. It was willful, it was knowing, it was \nmaterial, and it was false.\n  Let us reflect and see also, members of the jury, how the use of \ncover stories and the development thereof ties in the facts and the law \nthat constitute a basis on which you might properly find a conviction \non perjury and obstruction of justice.\n  We, as managers, believe that the evidence presented to you also \nestablishes that on December 17 the President encouraged a witness in a \nFederal civil rights action brought against him to give perjurious, \nfalse and misleading testimony when called to testify personally in \nthat proceeding. This was, in essence, the conspiracy--18 USC 371--to \ncommit both obstruction and perjury.\n  Throughout their relationship, the President and Ms. Lewinsky, \nunderstandably, wished to keep it secret, and they took steps to do \nthat, steps that ultimately turned out to be and constitute criminal \nacts. For some time, in fact until Ms. Lewinsky testified under oath \nand under a grant of immunity, their efforts were remarkably \nsuccessful, all things considered --all circumstances considered. \nAssociates and employees testified in support of the President's \nstories, and even several Secret Service officers testified to the \ngrand jury that they understood Ms. Lewinsky to be in the Oval Office \nto ``pick up papers.'' Yet, as Ms. Lewinsky testified, her White House \njob never required her to deliver papers or obtain the President's \nsignature on any documents. It was all a sham. It was all a cover \nstory. It was all a conspiracy to obstruct.\n  Ms. Lewinsky testified later, after she left the White House job to \nwork at the Pentagon, that phase 2 of the coverup went into effect. The \ntwo coconspirators began to use Ms. Currie as a source of clearance \ninto the White House. This was so even though the purpose of Ms. \nLewinsky's visits were almost always to simply see the President. As my \ncolleagues have told you, on December 17, during that 2 a.m., or \nperhaps it was 2:30, telephone conversation placed by the President to \nMs. Lewinsky, he told her her name appeared on the witness list in the \nJones case. She testified that at some point in the conversation the \nPresident told her, ``You know, you can always say you were coming to \nsee Betty or that you were bringing me letters.'' Ms. Lewinsky \ntestified that she understood this to be ``really a reminder of things \nthat they had discussed before.'' She said it was instantly familiar to \nher. He knew, or, ``I knew,'' she says--that is, Ms. Lewinsky knew--\n``exactly what he meant.'' And so, I respectfully submit, do all of us \nhere know exactly what the President meant.\n\n  When the President, then, was questioned before the Federal grand \njury if he ever had said something like that to Ms. Lewinsky, he \nadmitted that, well, ``I might. . .have said that. Because I certainly \ndidn't want this to come out, if I could help it. And I was concerned \nabout that.''\n  A cover story--which this was--between two teenagers trying to steal \na date without their parents' knowledge is one thing. Such would not \nconstitute a crime. It would be something we might even wink at, as \nlong as it didn't happen too often. However, we are not here dealing \nwith two love-struck teenagers trying to circumvent their parents' \nwatchful eyes. We are dealing here with the President of the United \nStates of America and a subservient employee concocting and \nimplementing a scheme that, while perhaps not illegal in its \ninception--simply trying to keep the relationship private--did in fact \ndeteriorate into illegality once it left the realm of private life and \nentered that of public obstruction.\n  However--and this is critical in terms of establishing the illegality \nor convictability of the President's actions--the situation at the time \nof that early morning phone call from the President to Ms. Lewinsky was \nvery different from that facing the President during any earlier \ndiscussions of a cover story.\n  Now, in early December 1997, Ms. Lewinsky had been officially named \nas a witness in a pending judicial proceeding. She was now under an \nobligation to give complete and truthful testimony and he, the \nPresident, was under a legal obligation at that time not to tamper with \nher or her possible testimony. This is precisely where private lies \nbecome public obstruction. This is, in fact, the bright line between \nchildlike pranks and deadly serious obstruction of our legal system. \nThe President and Ms. Lewinsky at that point entered the big leagues, \nand the President, a highly skilled lawyer, knew it, which is why he \nwent to such lengths to continue the coverup for so many months.\n  The President knew that if Ms. Lewinsky were to testify that she only \nbrought papers to the President or to see the President's secretary, \nher testimony would have been neither complete nor truthful. Yet, the \nPresident encouraged her to give that untruthful testimony and, in so \ndoing, he broke the law of obstruction of justice. And, in lying about \nit, he compounded the problem by breaking the law of perjury.\n  As Mr. Cannon made clear, with regard to section 1503, the general \nFederal obstruction statute of the criminal code, a person commits the \ncrime of obstruction of justice when he attempts to influence the due \nadministration of justice, which includes all aspects of any civil or \ncriminal case, including pretrial discovery.\n  Mr. Clinton's encouragement to Ms. Lewinsky to tell something other \nthan the truth certainly would have influenced the discovery process in \nthe Jones case. Courts have consistently held that civil discovery is \nevery bit a part of the due administration of justice, protected by the \nobstruction statutes, as any other aspect of any other civil or \ncriminal case. And, as Mr. Cannon also made clear with regard to \nsection 1512 of the Federal Criminal Code, a person commits witness \ntampering when he attempts to influence another\n\n[[Page S276]]\n\nperson to give false testimony in an official proceeding.\n  Mr. Clinton did encourage Ms. Lewinsky to give false testimony about \nher reasons for being in the White House with the President. By \nencouraging her to lie, the President committed the crime of \nobstruction of justice under section 1503 and the crime of witness \ntampering under section 1512 of the Federal Criminal Code.\n  You have also, Members of the Senate, heard about the President's \nstatements to Ms. Currie on January 18, and then again on the 20th or \n21st. The President spoke with her in what was clearly, demonstrably, \nunavoidably, another potential witness to be influenced in the civil \nrights case. The President did this in this case by relating to Ms. \nCurrie false and misleading accounts of events about that case as to \nwhich he was going to testify, had testified, and, again, with the \nintent that his recitation of the so-called facts would in fact \ncorruptly influence her testimony.\n  As the managers have previously described to you, the evidence in \nthis case shows that on that Saturday, January 17, only 2\\1/2\\ hours \nafter the President had been deposed in the Jones case, he called his \nsecretary at home and asked her to come to the White House the next \nday, a Sunday. She testified--Ms. Currie, that is--testified this was \nvery unusual. It was rare for the President to call and ask her to come \nin on a weekend, but of course she did--the next day, Sunday, January \n18, 1998, at about 5 p.m.\n  She testified to the grand jury that during her meeting with the \nPresident he said to her, ``There are several things you may want to \nknow.'' He then proceeded to ask her a number of questions in \nsuccession. You were presented evidence of these five statements by \nother managers. I will only emphasize that it was at that time and in \nthat way, in that manner, that the President led Ms. Currie through a \nseries of statements and determinate questions to establish a set of \nfacts describing his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky at the White House \nthat supported his false testimony.\n\n  As you have heard, Ms. Currie stated under oath she indicated her \nagreement with each of the President's statements, even though she knew \nthat the President and Ms. Lewinsky had, in fact, been alone in the \nOval Office and in the President's study. Prosecutors frequently see \nthis pattern. It is not unknown to prosecutors, Federal or State. You \nfrequently see this pattern of agreeing to things that the person knows \nare not true, where you have a dominant person suggesting testimony to \nanother person who is in a subordinate relationship. This, I submit, is \nyet another bright line between a private lie and public obstruction.\n  During the President's grand jury testimony he was asked about his \nstatements to Ms. Currie. He testified he was trying to determine \nwhether his recollection was accurate. As he put it, ``I was trying to \nget the facts down. I was trying to understand what the facts were.'' \nThis fits the same pattern of a classic obstruction of prosecution, in \nwhich a defendant suggests a story to someone in the hopes that they \nwill later testify consistent with that earlier suggestion. Indeed, \nwhen defendants in Federal courts defend against obstruction \nprosecutions in those type cases, they frequently rely on the very same \ndefense the President raises here--that he was merely and oh-so-\ninnocently encouraging the other person to tell the truth.\n  You may want to see, as an example of an unsuccessful effort at such \na defense, the case of United States v. O'Keefe, a Fifth Circuit case \nfrom 1983. In that case, Mr. O'Keefe did not ask someone to lie. He did \nnot even say, ``I suggest you lie.'' Rather, as is almost always the \ncase in white-collar obstruction prosecutions, his words, along with \ntheir setting and their context, suggested a certain story--in that \ncase as well as this, a false story. Just as Mr. O'Keefe did not \nexpressly ask someone to lie, Mr. Clinton never asked someone to lie. \nHe didn't have to. He was too smart for that, and he had witnesses who, \nat that time at least, were willing, ready, and able to do his bidding. \nThe President lied to the grand jury when he made these statements \nmischaracterizing his earlier statements to Mrs. Currie, just as he \ntampered with her as a likely witness 9 months earlier, in January.\n  The President's assertion--that he simply was trying to understand \nwhat the facts were--lacks even colorable credibility, when one \nconsiders that he had already testified. It was obviously too late to \ntry to recollect what the ``facts\" were. If in fact one accepts that, \nthen he is admitting he didn't testify to what the facts were under \noath at the deposition, because he didn't say, ``I don't know; I have \nto ask Mrs. Currie.'' He testified under oath as to what the facts \npurportedly were. Then he would have us believe that he had to, after \nthe fact of the deposition, go back and find out what the facts were \nfrom somebody else.\n  That is an argument that cannot be made with a straight face.\n  In any event, Ms. Currie could not have told him what the true facts \nwere, because he alone knew what they were.\n  The defenses and explanations the President's defenders raise to \njustify why the President would make factual assertions to Ms. Currie \nabout the circumstances of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, right \nafter his testimony, are many. For example, one administration witness \nwho appeared before the House Judiciary Committee actually suggested \nthat such ``coaching'' is proper as a method whereby an attorney \n``prepares'' a client or witness for testimony.\n  Of course, such a suggestion in this case would be ludicrous. \nPresident Clinton obviously did not and could not represent Ms. Currie \nas her attorney. Yet, it is this sort of explanation, straining \ncredulity, that illustrates the lengths to which the President's \ndefenders have gone to try to explain away the obvious--that there was \nno legitimate reason why the President made the statements to Ms. \nCurrie after his grand jury testimony, other than to ``suggest'' to her \nwhat her testimony should be. In Federal criminal trials, defendants go \nto jail for such obstruction. In the case before you, we submit this \nclearly forms a proper basis on which to convict this President of \nobstruction of justice for witness tampering and subsequent perjury.\n  Please keep in mind also, it is not required that the target of the \ndefendant's actions actually testify falsely. In fact, the witness \ntampering statute can be violated even when there is no proceeding \npending at the time the defendant acted in suggesting testimony. As the \ncases discussed by Manager Cannon demonstrate, for a conviction under \neither section 1503, obstruction, or 1512, obstruction by witness \ntampering, it is necessary only to show it was possible the target of \nthe defendant's actions might be called as a witness. That element has \nbeen more than met under the facts of this case.\n  It was not only likely Ms. Currie would be called; the President's \nown testimony, deliberate testimony to the grand jury, pretty much \nguaranteed that she would be called. He wanted her called so she could \nthen buttress his false testimony. His actions clearly, we believe, \nviolated both the general obstruction statute and the witness tampering \nstatute in these particulars in this regard.\n  With regard to the obstruction regarding the subpoena for the \nPresident's gifts to Ms. Lewinsky, let us look at the merger of the \nfacts and the law, as has been discussed. While the witness tampering \nstatute makes it a crime to attempt to influence the testimony of a \nperson, it also makes it a crime to influence a person to withhold an \nobject from an official proceeding; in other words, to tamper with \nevidence. The facts of this case, we as House managers believe, clearly \nshow the President corruptly engaged in, encouraged, or supported a \nscheme with Monica Lewinsky and possibly others to conceal evidence \nthat had been subpoenaed lawfully in the Jones case.\n  On December 19 of 1997, Ms. Lewinsky was served with a subpoena in \nthe Jones case requiring her to produce each and every gift given to \nher by the President. Then, on December 28, Ms. Lewinsky again met with \nthe President in the Oval Office, at which time they exchanged gifts. \nThey also discussed the fact that the lawyers in the Jones case had \nsubpoenaed all the President's gifts to Ms. Lewinsky and especially a \nhatpin. The hatpin apparently had sentimental significance to both of \nthem, in that it was the very first gift the President gave to Ms. \nLewinsky. During that conversation, Ms. Lewinsky\n\n[[Page S277]]\n\nasked the President whether she should put the gifts away outside her \nhouse or give them to someone, maybe Betty.\n\n  At that time, according to Ms. Lewinsky's sworn testimony, the \nPresident responded, ``Let me think about that.'' Apparently he did, \nbecause later that day, that very same day, only a few hours after Ms. \nLewinsky and the President had met to discuss what to do with the \ngifts, Ms. Currie called Ms. Lewinsky, setting in motion the great gift \nexchange.\n  According to Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Currie said, ``I understand that you \nhave something to give me,'' or ``[t]he President said you have \nsomething to give me.'' In her earlier proffer, or offer of evidence, \nto the independent counsel, prior to her testimony before the grand \njury, Ms. Lewinsky said Ms. Currie had said the President had told \nher--that is, Ms. Currie--that Ms. Lewinsky wanted her to hold on to \nsomething for her.\n  After their conversation at the Oval Office, Ms. Currie drove to Ms. \nLewinsky's apartment for only the second time in her life. There she \npicked up a box sealed with tape and on which was written ``Please, do \nnot throw away.'' Ms. Currie then took the box, drove to her home, and \nplaced the box under her bed.\n  In her grand jury testimony, Ms. Currie testified that she and Ms. \nLewinsky did not discuss the content of the box, nor did she open it \nwhen she got it to her home, but she knew--she ``understood'' what was \nin the box--that it contained the gifts from the President to Ms. \nLewinsky. In fact, Ms. Lewinsky testified Ms. Currie was not at all \nconfused, surprised, or even interested when she handed the box over to \nher.\n  The legal impact, the legal import, of this is that there is no \nquestion that if the gifts had actually been produced to the Jones \nlawyers, they would have established a significant relationship between \nthe President and Ms. Lewinsky. Knowledge of the gifts, at a minimum, \nwould have caused the Jones lawyers to inquire further as to the nature \nof the relationship between the President and Ms. Lewinsky.\n  Her failure to turn over the gifts as required by the lawful subpoena \nserved on her was, in the words of the witness tampering statute, the \nwithholding of an object from an official proceeding. We believe the \nevidence shows, clearly establishes, that the President corruptly \npersuaded Ms. Lewinsky to withhold these objects from the lawful \nproceedings in the Jones case.\n  In his grand jury testimony, the President asserted he encouraged Ms. \nLewinsky to turn over the gifts. Ms. Lewinsky's testimony directly \ncontradicts that. Importantly, all other evidence of subsequent acts \ncorroborates her testimony, not the President's. For one thing, the \ngifts were never turned over. In fact, Ms. Lewinsky testified she was \nnever under any impression, from anything the President said, that she \nshould turn over the gifts to the attorneys for Ms. Jones. Quite the \nopposite.\n  While the President asserts he never spoke about this matter with \nBetty Currie, he would have us believe that his personal and \nconfidential secretary would, on a Sunday, drive to the home of the \nwoman with whom he was having an inappropriate intimate relationship, \ntake possession of a sealed box which she believed to contain gifts \ngiven by the President, hide the box under the bed in her home, never \nquestion the person giving her the box, and never even mention to the \nPresident she had received the box of gifts.\n  The President's position, as he would have you believe, is not \ncredible. It defies the evidence. It defies any reasonable \ninterpretation or inference from the evidence. It defies common sense. \nAnd it stands in defiance of Federal law.\n  The only reasonable interpretation of the facts is that, following \nthe discussion between the President and Ms. Lewinsky earlier in the \nday on December 28, the President decided Ms. Lewinsky has actually \ncome up with a pretty good suggestion: The gifts should be put away \noutside of her home.\n  As jurors, you may reasonably presume, based on the evidence and all \nreasonable inferences therefrom, along with common sense, that it was \nthe President who directed Ms. Currie to call Ms. Lewinsky to tell her \nshe understood she ``had something for her.'' And that happened to be \nevidence under lawful subpoena in a civil proceeding in a U.S. district \ncourt.\n  Ms. Currie would have no independent reason to even consider such a \ncourse of action on her own. She had never, other than one time in her \nlife, ever driven to Ms. Lewinsky's home. She did so on this Sunday not \nbecause she developed a sudden hankering to do so or because she \nroutinely visited interns at their homes--she didn't--or because she \nhad a vision; she did it because the President would have asked her to \ndo it.\n  Now, the President further points out that Ms. Currie has testified \nthat Ms. Lewinsky called her to arrange to pick up the gifts, rather \nthan the other way around. In fact, although Ms. Currie has testified \ninconsistently as to whether Ms. Lewinsky called her or she called Ms. \nLewinsky, she actually deferred to Ms. Lewinsky's superior knowledge of \nthe facts.\n  However, even if one were to accept, for purposes of argument, that \nit was Ms. Lewinsky who initiated the call, the President's avowal that \nhe had no knowledge of or involvement with the hiding or the transfer \nof the gifts is still not plausible. It is totally unreasonable to \npresume that the private secretary to the President of the United \nStates would drop what she was doing, travel to the home of a former \nintern, pick up a box, and hide it in her home simply because the \nformer intern demanded that she do so. All of this had to have been \ndone--reasonably, plausibly, credibly was done--because of \ncommunication directed and an understanding between the President and \nhis personal secretary.\n  There is one more point on this. Ms. Lewinsky testified she met with \nthe President for 45 minutes on December 28, at which time they \ndiscussed the fact that she had been subpoenaed, along with the need to \nconceal the gifts. The President's testimony directly conflicts with \nhers on this point.\n  First, the evidence, however, establishes that his professed \ninability to remember whether she and the gifts had been subpoenaed is \nunbelievable and false.\n  Please keep in mind when evaluating the circumstantial evidence to \ndetermine whether a false statement was made intentionally, the most \nimportant evidence to consider is the existence of a motive to lie. It \nis the calculated falsehood, combined with a clear motive to lie, that \nleads, day in and day out in Federal court proceedings, to the \nconclusion that a false statement--false statements were intentional.\n  Also, we urge you to bear in mind that the law will not allow a \nperson to testify, ``I don't recall,'' or, ``I'm not sure,'' when such \nanswers are unreasonable under the circumstances.\n  Former U.S. Representative Patrick Swindall attempted this course of \naction when he appeared before a Federal grand jury in the Northern \nDistrict of Georgia in 1988. His evasive and false answers to the grand \njury provided the basis for his subsequent conviction.\n\n  Feigned forgetfulness or feigned assertions that grand jury questions \nare ambiguous and therefore cannot be answered cannot, and in fact in \nFederal proceedings do not, shield defendants from criminal liability \nfor perjury or impeding the conduct of a Federal grand jury; nor should \nsuch efforts be allowed to shield President Clinton from conviction on \nthese two articles of impeachment as to these facts.\n  The President, a man of considerable intelligence and gifted with an \nexceptional memory--as somebody described, ``a prodigious memory''--can \nand should be inferred to have clearly understood what he was doing, as \nwell as the logical and reasonable consequences of his actions, as well \nas the questions put to him by the independent counsel in the grand \njury questioning.\n  And he had a clear motive to falsely state to the grand jury that he \ncould not recall that he knew on December 28 that Ms. Lewinsky had been \nsubpoenaed and that the subpoena called for her to produce the gifts, \nfor to have acknowledged such would have helped establish a motive on \nhis part for orchestrating the concealment of the gifts.\n  And as we have also seen and understand, there is no doubt the \nPresident's statement of feigned forgetfulness was material not only to \nthe matters before\n\n[[Page S278]]\n\nthe Jones case but to matters subsequently before the grand jury.\n  Now, the President's counsel may very well argue the fact that the \nPresident gave Ms. Lewinsky additional gifts on that same day--that is, \nDecember 28--as proof of the President's assertions that he didn't know \nthere was anything wrong going on here. Their argument, if they make \nit, cannot be sustained in the face of so much evidence to the \ncontrary. The evidence in fact points to a much more plausible \nexplanation. The additional gifts given that day demonstrate the \nPresident's continued confidence that Ms. Lewinsky would keep to their \nearlier agreement to conceal their relationship.\n  It is also plausible that the additional gifts were intended as a \nfurther gesture of affection by the President to Ms. Lewinsky to help \nensure she would not testify against him. Such a fact pattern also \nfinds its way to those of us who have a prosecutorial background in \nFederal courts on a regular basis.\n  We have heard about the job search and its relationship to perjury \nand obstruction. Let me tie the facts related to job search and the law \napplicable thereto together. We believe, as managers, that the evidence \nshows that, beginning on or about December 7, 1997, and continuing \nthrough and including January 14 of last year, the President \nintensified and succeeded in an effort to secure job assistance for a \nwitness in a Federal civil rights case brought against him in order to \ncorruptly prevent the truthful testimony of that witness in that \nproceeding at a time when the truthful testimony of that witness would \nhave been harmful to him.\n  Monica Lewinsky is, if nothing else, a persistent witness. After she \nwas transferred out of the White House, and after being rebuffed \nrepeatedly by others to secure assistance from the President in gaining \na job that met her expectations and wishes, she decided to change tack. \nShe wrote directly to the President, asked for, and received a meeting \nin which she asked him to find her a job in New York.\n  The day before the President filed his answers to the interrogatories \nin the Jones case, as Manager Gekas discussed, the President asked Ms. \nCurrie to set up a meeting for Ms. Lewinsky with Mr. Vernon Jordan. Two \ndays after he filed his answers, in which he refused to answer whether \nhe had ever had any extramarital relationships in the context of his \npublic jobs, that meeting in fact occurred. But Mr. Jordan made no \nparticular effort to assist Ms. Lewinsky at that time. In fact, as he \nlater testified, he had no recollection of the meeting. There was, of \ncourse, at that early stage, no urgency.\n\n  The situation, however, changed dramatically in early December, 1997. \nOn December 6, the President became aware that Ms. Lewinsky had been \nnamed as a witness in the Jones case. Early that day, she had thrown a \ntantrum at the White House northwest gate when she was unable to meet \nwith the President when she wanted. Despite the President's initial \nanger over Ms. Lewinsky's behavior and over the acts of some of the \nSecret Service officers a mere 5 days later, Ms. Lewinsky, in fact, \nsecured a second meeting with Mr. Vernon Jordan. But this time, unlike \npreviously, this powerful Washington lawyer jumped for the former \nintern. He immediately placed calls to three major corporations on her \nbehalf.\n  On December 11, Judge Wright ordered the President to answer Paula \nJones' interrogatories. On December 17, the President suggested to Ms. \nLewinsky she file the affidavit and continue to use their cover stories \nin the event she was asked about her relationship with the President. \nThe next day she had two interviews in New York City arranged by Mr. \nJordan. On December 22nd, Ms. Lewinsky met with an attorney at a \nmeeting arranged by Mr. Jordan. The following day she had another job \ninterview arranged by Mr. Jordan.\n  On January 7, Ms. Lewinsky signed the false affidavit and proudly \nshowed the executed copy to Mr. Jordan. The next day, Ms. Lewinsky had \nan interview arranged by Mr. Jordan with MacAndrews & Forbes in New \nYork City, an interview that apparently went poorly. To remedy this, \nshe called Mr. Jordan and so informed him. Mr. Jordan then called the \nCEO of MacAndrews & Forbes, Mr. Ron Perelman to, in Mr. Jordan's words, \n``make things happen, if they could happen.'' After Mr. Jordan's call \nto Mr. Perelman, Ms. Lewinsky was called and told that she would be \ninterviewed again the very next morning. That following day she was \nreinterviewed and immediately offered a job. She then called Mr. Jordan \nto tell him and he passed the information on to Ms. Currie. ``Tell the \nPresident, mission accomplished.''\n  Now, what are you as jurors entitled to conclude from all of this as \na matter of law and of fact? Until it became clear that Ms. Lewinsky \nwould be a witness in the Jones case, little was done to help her with \nher job search. Once she was listed as a witness, things changed \ndramatically and rapidly. Just days after she is listed on the Jones \nwitness list, she gets a second meeting with one of the most \ninfluential men in Washington. But, unlike their first meeting, Mr. \nJordan now makes three calls on her behalf to get her a job interview. \nA week later the President proposed the affidavit. The next day, Ms. \nLewinsky has two job interviews in New York. A few days later, Mr. \nJordan arranges for an attorney to represent her. The next day she has \nanother job interview. Two weeks later she signed the affidavit. The \nnext day she has another interview.\n  ``Mission accomplished.'' Obstruction accomplished. Another \npotentially embarrassing witness in the bag.\n  Were Ms. Lewinsky to get a job and move to New York, this would help \nthe President substantially in two very important ways. First, it would \npresumably create a happy and probably compliant witness, one willing, \nif not eager, to support the President's false testimony. Second, it \nwould make Ms. Lewinsky much more difficult, if not impossible, to \nreach as a witness in the Jones case. In fact, this is precisely what \nthe President himself suggested to Ms. Lewinsky during their December \n28 meeting, according to her sworn testimony.\n\n  To put it plainly, but respectfully, if that is not obstruction by \nwitness tampering, one would be hard pressed to find a fact pattern \nthat was.\n  This aspect of the case against the President is extremely important. \nShe gets the job. And what did the President get? The key affidavit to \nthrow the Jones lawyers off the trail and possibly a witness outside \nthe practical reach of the attorneys, much like the absent witnesses we \nhave seen in large numbers in the campaign financing investigations.\n  The President's efforts were designed to and did obstruct justice and \ntamper with a witness. And his actions, we submit, were criminal under \nboth sections 1503 and 1512 of the Federal Criminal Code.\n  The President's false statements to his senior aides. Here, too, the \nfacts and the law come together and would form the basis, we \nrespectfully submit, for a conviction on articles of impeachment. All \nthat needs to be shown to prove a violation of the statute is that the \ndefendant engaged in misleading conduct with another person to \ninfluence that testimony. Misleading conduct is not a term of art for \nwhich there is no definition. It is specifically defined in the Federal \nCriminal Code as section 1515. When you, as jurors, properly apply \nthese definitions to the terms of section 1512, the tampering statute, \nand then turn your attention to the facts in this case wherein the \nPresident repeatedly and deliberately gave false explanations to aides \nhe knew or should reasonably have known would be witnesses in Federal \njudicial proceedings, the conclusion he violated this statute is, we \nrespectfully submit, unavoidable. I point to one case previously \nmentioned, the O'Keefe case as particularly, perhaps, applicable to \ndeliberations on this matter.\n  Finally, statements by the President and his lawyer concerning the \naffidavit during the Jones deposition. The obstruction statute may also \nbe violated, as you know, by a person who gives false testimony. In the \nJones case, the President allowed his attorney to make false and \nmisleading statements to a Federal judge. This part of the obstruction \nscheme was accomplished by characterizing as true the false affidavit \nfiled by Ms. Lewinsky in order to prevent questioning by the Jones \nlawyers, testimony which had already been deemed relevant by the judge \nin that case. The President's lawyer, as you have heard, objected to \nthe innuendo of\n\n[[Page S279]]\n\ncertain questions asked of the President, and at that point during the \ndeposition pointed out that Ms. Lewinsky had signed an affidavit \ndenying the relationship with the President. He then made the famous \nstatement about there being no relationship in any way, shape or form \nor kind.\n  Following this statement, Judge Wright warned Mr. Bennett about \nmaking an assertion of fact in front of the witness--that is, in front \nof the President--in which he replied,\n\n       I am not coaching the witness. In preparation of the \n     witness for this deposition, the witness is fully aware of \n     [the] affidavit, so I have not told him a single thing he \n     doesn't know.\n\n  The President's lawyer did not know what an understatement that was.\n  Later on September 30 of 1998, long after the deposition and after \nthe full evidence of Ms. Lewinsky's relationship with the President \nbecame public, Mr. Bennett wrote to Judge Wright to inform her that she \nshould not rely upon the statements he made during the President's \ndeposition because parts of the affidavit were ``misleading and not \ntrue.'' ``Misleading and not true.'' Sounds like perjury. Sounds like \nobstruction.\n  Which brings us full circle, full circle from a false affidavit \nconfirming earlier concocted cover stories, through a web of \nobstruction, to a letter from a distinguished lawyer forced to do what \nno lawyer wants to do, but every honorable lawyer must do when \nconfronted with clear evidence their client has misled a court, and \nthat is to correct a record of falsity even to the detriment of their \nclient.\n  What we have before us, Senators and Mr. Chief Justice, is really not \ncomplex. Critically important, yes, but not essentially complex. \nVirtually every Federal or State prosecutor--and there are many such \ndistinguished persons on this jury--has prosecuted such cases of \nobstruction before in their careers--perhaps repeatedly--involving \npatterns of obstruction, compounded by subsequent coverup perjury. The \nPresident's lawyers may very well try to weave a spell of complexity \nover the facts of this case. They may nitpick over the time of a call \nor parse a specific word or phrase of testimony, much as the President \nhas done. We urge you, the distinguished jurors in this case, not to be \nfooled.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I object to the use and the continued \nuse of the word ``jurors'' when referring to the Senate sitting as \ntriers in a trial of the impeachment of the President of the United \nStates.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, I base my objection on the following:\n  First, article I, section 3, of the Constitution says the Senate \nshall have the sole power to try all impeachments--not the courts, but \nthe Senate.\n  Article III of the Constitution says the trial of all crimes, except \nin the cases of impeachment, shall be by jury--a tremendous exculpatory \nclause when it comes to impeachments.\n  Next, Mr. Chief Justice, I base my objection on the writings in ``The \nFederalist Papers,'' especially No. 65 by Alexander Hamilton, in which \nhe is outlining the reasons why the framers of the Constitution gave \nthe Senate the sole power to try impeachments. I won't read it all, but \nI will read this pertinent sentence:\n\n       There will be no jury to stand between the judges who are \n     to pronounce the sentence of the law and the party who is to \n     receive or suffer it.\n\n  Next, Mr. Chief Justice, I base my objection on the 26 rules of the \nSenate, adopted by the Senate, governing impeachments. Nowhere in any \nof those 26 rules is the word ``juror'' or ``jury'' ever used.\n  Next, Mr. Chief Justice, I base my objection on the tremendous \ndifferences between regular jurors and Senators sitting as triers of an \nimpeachment. Regular jurors, of course, are chosen, to the maximum \nextent possible, with no knowledge of the case. Not so when we try \nimpeachments. Regular jurors are not supposed to know each other. Not \nso here. Regular jurors cannot overrule the judge. Not so here. Regular \njurors do not decide what evidence should be heard, the standards of \nevidence, nor do they decide what witnesses shall be called. Not so \nhere. Regular jurors do not decide when a trial is to be ended. Not so \nhere.\n  Now, Mr. Chief Justice, it may seem a small point, but I think a very \nimportant point. I think the framers of the Constitution meant us, the \nSenate, to be something other than a jury and not jurors. What we do \nhere today does not just decide the fate of one man. Since the Senate \nsits on impeachment so rarely, and even more rarely on the impeachment \nof a President of the United States, what we do here sets precedence. \nFuture generations will look back on this trial not just to find out \nwhat happened, but to try to decide what principles governed our \nactions. To leave the impression for future generations that we somehow \nare jurors and acting as a jury----\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. Chief Justice, I call for the regular order and I ask, \nas a parliamentary point, whether it is appropriate to argue what I \nunderstand is a statement as to the proper reference relative to \nMembers of the Senate. This is not a motion, and if it is a motion, it \nis nondebatable, as I understand it.\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Yes. I think you may state your objection, \ncertainly, but not argue. The Chair is of the view that you may state \nthe objection and some reason for it, but not argue it on ad infinitum.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I was stating the reason because of \nthe precedents that we set, and I do not believe it would be a valid \nprecedent to leave future generations that we would be looked upon \nmerely as jurors, but something other than being a juror. That is why I \nraise the objection.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair is of the view that the objection of the \nSenator from Iowa is well taken, that the Senate is not simply a jury; \nit is a court in this case. Therefore, counsel should refrain from \nreferring to the Senators as jurors.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. Manager BARR. I thank the Court for his ruling. We urge the \ndistinguished Senators who are sitting as triers of fact in this case \nnot to be fooled. We urge you to use your common sense, your reasoning, \nyour varied and successful career experiences, just as any trier of \nfact and law anywhere in America might do. Just as other triers of fact \nand law do, so, too, have each of you sworn to decide these momentous \nmatters impartially. Your oath to look to the law and to our \nConstitution demands this of you. As this great body has done on so \nmany occasions in the course of our Nation's history, I and all \nmanagers are confident you will neither shrink from nor cast aside that \nduty.\n  Rather, I urge and fully anticipate that you will look to the volume \nof facts and to the clear and fully applicable statutes and conclude \nthat William Jefferson Clinton, in fact and under the law, violated his \noath and violated the laws of this land and convict him on both \narticles of impeachment. Even though such a high burden--that is, proof \nof criminal violations--is not strictly required of you under the law \nof impeachment, in fact, such evidence is here. That higher burden is \nmet.\n  Perjury is here; obstruction is here in the facts and the law which \nforms the basis for the articles of impeachment in the House which we \nbelieve properly would form the basis for conviction in the Senate. \nPerjury and obstruction, we respectfully ask you to strike down these \ninsidious cancers that eat at the heart of our system of Government and \nlaws. Strike them down with the Constitution so they might not fester \nas a gaping wound poisoning future generations of children, poisoning \nour court system, and perhaps even future generations of political \nleaders.\n  Just as Members of both Houses of Congress have unfortunately over \nthe years been convicted and removed from office for perjury and \nobstruction, and just as Federal judges have been removed from life \ntenure for perjury and obstruction, so must a President; so sadly \nshould this President.\n  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and thank you, Members of the U.S. \nSenate sitting here as jurors of fact and law in the trial of President \nWilliam Jefferson Clinton.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/15/senate-section/article/S259-3", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
