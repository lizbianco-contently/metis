Madam President, there are a lot of reasons to like \nthe broad bipartisan Energy bill which is before us. You will like it \nif you are an American interested in producing more energy. You will \nlike it if you are interested in paying less for energy. You will like \nit if you are an American interested in saving energy. There are a lot \nof important reasons to support the Energy Policy Modernization Act.\n  Here's another one. You will like it if you are an American \ninterested in bolstering your country's long-term national security. \nThat is always important, and Americans are telling us it is especially \nimportant today. They see our commanders, for instance, attempting to \njuggle myriad threats from across the globe with diminishing force \nstructure. Well, if we are interested in improving our overall \nstrategic position, then there are ways this broad bipartisan Energy \nbill can help.\n  First, the Energy Policy Modernization Act is designed to boost \nAmerica's liquefied natural gas exports. That doesn't just hold \npotential for America's economy, it holds potential for America's \nglobal leadership, including the security of our allies. We know that \nRussia is the dominant supplier of natural gas to Western Europe, and \nwe know that building America's own export capacity can enhance \nEuropean energy security in the long run. So, in broad strokes, ``by \nincreasing our ability to export natural gas--in the form of liquefied \nnatural gas or LNG--to Europe, the U.S. can weaken Russia's strategic \nstronghold while boosting our domestic economy by increasing energy \nexports.'' That is how Congressman Calvert, a Republican, and \nCongressman Israel, a Democrat, put it in an op-ed they authored last \nyear after returning from a trip to Ukraine.\n  Here is what a former Obama energy adviser wrote in November: \n``Increased LNG trade can also enhance energy security for our \nallies,'' he said. ``[Russian state-owned energy giant] Gazprom's grip \non Europe is weakening, and U.S. LNG will accelerate that shift even as \nRussia seeks to counter it. . . .''\n  Enhancing America's own export capacity is also important when you \nconsider that Iran has just been freed from Western sanctions and is \nlooking to expand its own trade in energy resources, including its \nnatural gas potential. Robust LNG exports to Asia can also enhance \nAmerica's stature there, too, and give our allies in the region a \nstable source of energy.\n  Boosting America's natural gas exports is one reason to support the \nbill, but here is another. The Energy Policy Modernization Act is \ndesigned to reduce our foreign reliance on minerals and raw materials \nneeded for everything from military assets to smart phones.\n  We can strengthen American mineral security by developing our world-\nclass American mineral base. The necessary modern policies can move us \nahead, and this bill contains positive steps forward.\n  Here's what else this bill would do. The Energy Policy Modernization \nAct is designed to defend our national energy grid from terrorist cyber \nattacks. It would help prepare us by authorizing additional cyber \nsecurity research, it would help deter attacks by erecting stronger \ncyber security defenses, and it would help provide for faster and more \neffective responses when threats do arise.\n  At the end of the day, here is what you can say about the Energy \nPolicy Modernization Act. It aims to make America more secure in an era \nof insecurity. It aims to make America more prosperous in a time of \neconomic uncertainty. It is a bipartisan bill that deserves to pass. It \nis great to see so many Republicans and Democrats in this Chamber who \nactually agree with that. It is great to see both sides working with \nthe bill managers to process amendments and move this legislation \nalong.\n  I ask Members to continue working in the same spirit of cooperation.\n\n[[Page S454]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/02/senate-section/article/S454-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, in recent weeks the Nation has become \nconcerned, afraid, and even outraged to learn that nearly 100,000 \npeople who are residents of the city of Flint, MI, have been poisoned. \nAbout 9,000 of those poisoned are children under the age of 6 years.\n  Two years ago, in an effort to pinch pennies, an unelected emergency \nmanager appointed by Governor Rick Snyder switched the water supply \nfrom the city of Flint, MI, water source to the Flint River. Water from \nthe Flint River is contaminated with lead, bacteria that causes \nLegionnaires' disease, and lots of other bad things. As a result, the \nresidents of Flint, MI, were forced to drink the water.\n  There is no trick photography here. This is a person in Flint, MI. \nYou could go to any house you wanted to go to. This is the water that \nthey were drinking and bathing in. It is hard to comprehend that this \nwent on for such a long time.\n  Can you imagine taking a bath in this, brushing your teeth, or \ndrinking it? How about bathing a new baby? This is your little bathtub.\n  Through no fault of their own, the people of Flint, MI, are being \nforced to endure a public health crisis that could have been avoided. \nThis is a manmade crisis. We will never know the full extent of the \ndamage to the people who live in Flint, MI--especially to the children. \nThey have been harmed because they have been poisoned by the acts of \nthe leadership in the State of Michigan, especially the Governor of the \nState of Michigan. The reckless decision to switch to unsafe drinking \nwater was forced upon 100,000 people. These people in Flint, MI, are \nnow exposed to water with high levels of lead--frighteningly high \nlevels of lead--among other things. This is not just lead. There is \nbacteria, and they haven't determined the full extent of it. It is \nestablished.\n  I can remember when I first came to this body many, many years ago. I \nhad the good fortune to chair a number of hearings in the environment \ncommittee dealing with lead poisoning.\n  At the time that we studied it, lead poisoning was lead that children \ningested--children who lived in developments where there were large \namounts of lead-based paint. The children who ate this lead--not on \npurpose--were not what they could have been. It affected their brains.\n  This lead in water, lead anyplace, affects the brain. It affects \nadults, too, but especially children. Lead causes serious problems for \nadults, as I mentioned, but it is especially dangerous for children, \ncausing lifetime effects. You can't get well. They have a program where \nthey try to take the blood out and run it through a purifier. It takes \na long time, but there are no safe levels of lead for children.\n  After the city made this wrong decision to switch its water source, \nit was really very quickly that the citizens of Flint complained that \nthe water was discolored, and it also smelled. Everyone began to \ndevelop rashes.\n  The response of State government was appalling. Rick Snyder, the \nGovernor of Michigan, is one of those who berates government all the \ntime. Emails released from his office just last week referred to a \nresident who said she was told by a State nurse in January 2015, a \nlittle over a year ago--she was complaining about her son's elevated \nblood levels. The nurse told this woman: It is just a few IQ points. It \nis not the end of the world.\n  Can you imagine a health care worker telling someone: It is your \nbaby, but it is just a few IQ points. No big deal. It is not the end of \nthe world. This was a State nurse.\n  The water was so poisonous that General Motors, the manufacturer of \nautomobile parts there, stopped using the source for their Flint engine \noperations because the parts corroded during the manufacturing process. \nThey had to stop using this water. People were still drinking this \nwater and bathing in this water.\n  Despite overwhelming evidence that a city in his State had lead \npoisoning, Governor Snyder failed to act and protect the people of \nFlint. This went on for a long time.\n  As Flint struggles to recover from this terrible public health \nproblem, an investigation will determine who exactly is to blame for \nthis reckless decision. We know who caused the problem.\n  This was a manmade disaster, as I said earlier, but now we must act \nto protect the residents of Flint. This protection should start with \nrepairs to their water infrastructure. Like many cities--and there are \nquite a few in the Midwest--Flint has lead pipes, but the highly \ncorrosive nature of the Flint River damaged them. It ate away at the \ninsides of those pipes. Now these lead pipes are leaching into the \nclean water supply from Lake Huron. It will cost over $1 billion to \nreplace Flint's corroded water infrastructure.\n  The people in Flint, MI, are struggling. There has been money spent \nthere. Flint had been doing quite well until this came along. There was \na new vitality. But now people are afraid to eat in restaurants, and \nthe businesses have been terribly damaged because people don't believe \nthe water is pure. A lot of these restaurants, for example, put in \ntheir own water supply and water purification system, but people don't \nbelieve it. They are afraid.\n\n  We need this done now. The State and Federal Government must \ncooperate now to end this crisis, which requires that we make \ninvestments. I repeat: now.\n  President Obama has declared a state of emergency in Flint, MI, and \ngiven FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the authority to \nprovide resources for the people of Flint. The problem is that right \nnow they are just getting bottled water. The infrastructure is so bad.\n  Governor Snyder has finally--finally--declared a state of emergency \nand finally apologized for his administration's slow response. The \nGovernor's apology is too late. The residents of Flint have already \nbeen poisoned.\n  It is too bad the people on that side of the aisle disparage the \ngovernment all the time. It is too intrusive. It is too involved. It is \ndetrimental to our society.\n  The Governor of Michigan is one of the leading cheerleaders of that \ntheory. He denigrates government every single chance he gets. But to \nwhom does he turn when the State of Michigan is in trouble? To the \nFederal Government. When emergency strikes, the Federal Government \nsteps in. That is one of the responsibilities we have to protect \nAmerica.\n  So I hope Senate Republicans will support our efforts to protect the \npeople of Flint in this time of need. Senator Murkowski--the chair of \nthat important committee that has jurisdiction of the bill that is \nbefore this body today--is working with Senator Cantwell. They are \ncommitted to doing something to help in this. Let's make sure we \nsupport them.\n  Sadly, some of the same Republicans who have called for relief when \ntheir States faced natural disasters are disparaging government action \nin Flint. For example, last year, Texas was devastated with historic \nflooding. But who stepped in? It was the Federal Government that \nstepped in to provide disaster relief for the people of Texas.\n  That is why I was disappointed to see the senior Senator from Texas \nsay: ``While we all have sympathy for what's happened in Flint, this is \nprimarily a local and state responsibility.'' He didn't say that when \nthe flooding was taking place in Texas.\n  Last year, as Florida was hit with extreme flooding, the junior \nSenator from Florida called for Federal disaster assistance. But when \nit comes to the children and families of Flint, the Senator, who \nfinished third last night in the Iowa caucuses, cautions against any \naction. This is what he said about Flint: ``I believe the federal \ngovernment's role in some of these things (is) largely limited unless \nit involves a federal jurisdictional issue.''\n  Well, the issue was that the State of Michigan didn't do what it was \nsupposed to do.\n  The junior Senator from Florida is not alone. Republican Senators \nroutinely rush to the floor to demand Federal aid when trouble hits \ntheir backyard. That is the right thing to do. Americans help each \nother in times of crisis.\n  This week the Senate has a chance to help the families suffering \nthrough a\n\n[[Page S455]]\n\npublic health crisis. I hope Republicans who have had difficulties in \nthe past and have requested Federal aid for their States won't turn \ntheir backs on the people of Michigan.\n  If a Federal Government response is necessary for natural disasters, \nshouldn't the Federal Government help respond to these manmade \ndisasters? The examples I gave in Texas and Florida were not manmade \ndisasters; this is.\n  We remain committed to giving the people of Flint, MI, what they need \nduring this crisis--help from the Federal Government to restore clean, \nsafe water. But the Federal Government cannot do it all. The people of \nFlint, MI, should understand that the Governor of Michigan is costing \nthem a lot of money, and it is going to cost the taxpayers of Michigan \na lot more because the Federal Government cannot do it all.\n  Senator Stabenow and Senator Peters have proposed an amendment to the \nbill before us that provides emergency relief to address the Flint \nwater crisis. I support that. The people of Flint have been poisoned. \nWe owe our fellow citizens swift action to address this medical \nemergency.\n  I urge my colleagues, especially my Republican friends, to support \nthe Stabenow-Peters amendment to give the people of Flint the relief \nthey so desperately need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/02/senate-section/article/S455-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to emphasize the importance \nof the Judicial Redress Act. This is a bill that the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee favorably reported last week by an overwhelmingly bipartisan \nvote of \n19 to 1.\n  As I speak, the Senate majority and minority leaders are in the \nprocess of clearing this legislation by unanimous consent. I am \noptimistic the Senate will pass the Judicial Redress Act in the coming \ndays and that ultimately we will send this legislation to the \nPresident's desk.\n  I thank Senator Chris Murphy for introducing this important bill with \nme and for the broad support we have built among both Republicans and \nDemocrats.\n  I also wish to acknowledge the good work of Representatives Jim \nSensenbrenner and John Conyers for their efforts in the House. They \nhave been stalwarts in advancing this important legislation in the \nHouse of Representatives. It has been a true bipartisan, bicameral \nevent.\n  Simply stated, the Judicial Redress Act would extend certain data \nprotections and remedies available to U.S. citizens under the Privacy \nAct to European citizens by allowing them to correct flawed information \nin their records and, in rare instances, the option to pursue legal \nremedies if Federal agencies improperly disclose their data.\n  Our legislation fights an inequity--a reciprocal benefit that has \nbeen withheld from our European allies with little justification. \nCross-border data flows between the United States and Europe are the \nhighest in the world. Today most countries in the European Union \naffirmatively provide data protection rights to Americans on European \nsoil. Our European allies and their citizens should likewise have \naccess to the core benefits of the Privacy Act when in the United \nStates. It is the right and fair thing to do. Passing the Judicial \nRedress Act is critical to ratification of the Data Privacy and \nProtection Agreement, commonly called the ``umbrella agreement.'' This \nagreement allows for data transfers between European and American law \nenforcement officials for the purpose of fighting and investigating \ncrime, including terrorism.\n  European officials have said they will not ratify the umbrella \nagreement until Congress provides EU citizens with limited judicial \nredress. Our bill is key to providing reciprocity to our European \nallies and will serve as the catalyst to finalizing the long-awaited \ndata protection deal.\n  The U.S. Department of Justice, which supports this legislation, \nstates that failure to finalize the umbrella agreement ``would \ndramatically reduce cooperation and significantly hinder \ncounterterrorism efforts.'' Given the global state of affairs, we \nsimply cannot risk losing the critical benefits of the umbrella \nagreement.\n  As chairman of the Senate Republican High-Tech Task Force, I am \nalways seeking ways to keep our American technology industry at the \nforefront of the global economy. I am convinced that passing the \nJudicial Redress Act will build much needed good will with our European \nallies. We are currently negotiating a new safe harbor agreement--an \ninternational agreement that allows U.S. technology companies to move \ndigital information between the European Union and the United States.\n  For years, safe harbor rules have benefited U.S. technology companies \nthat provide cloud services to their European customers. Without a safe \nharbor agreement, however, U.S. cloud-based companies seeking to do \nbusiness in Europe would be forced to negotiate with 28 individual \ncountries in the European Union over how their citizens' data is \ncollected and stored. Such a requirement would disrupt and chill \ntransatlantic business operations, jeopardize countless American jobs, \nand stifle American domestic innovation.\n  Indeed, businesses of all sizes and in all sectors would face \nprofound consequences if we do not conclude a new safe harbor \nagreement.\n  The economic damage would be significant and relatively immediate, \nand the consequences could be catastrophic, especially for small \nenterprises. Failure to reach an agreement would impact the economies \nof both the United States and our friends in the European Union.\n  If we are unable to reach a final safe harbor agreement soon, \nCongress must be prepared to take appropriate action to ensure that \nthese negative consequences do not come to fruition.\n  In the meantime, it is critically important that Congress pass the \nJudicial Redress Act. I am pleased that the Senate is swiftly moving \ntoward this end, and I am optimistic that we will have a successful \nresolution in the coming days.\n  I thank my colleagues on both sides of the floor for their support in \nthis effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/02/senate-section/article/S455-5", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S455-S457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    FLINT, MICHIGAN, WATER CRISIS AND ALISO CANYON NATURAL GAS LEAK\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I am on the floor to talk about a \nsituation that is occurring in my home State with a leak--a natural gas \nleak that is\n\n[[Page S456]]\n\ncreating havoc in one of my communities. But before I do, I wish to \ncomment on the issue that my Democratic leader talked about, which is \nthe poisoning of children in Flint, MI, due to lead in the drinking \nwater.\n  Maybe I am old-fashioned, but I believe that when you hurt a child, \nthat is the lowest thing you can do. There is nothing lower in life \nthan hurting an innocent child. That means if you abuse a child, if you \ntaunt a child--but when you poison a child and their brain is damaged \nfor the rest of their life--that is the lowest thing an adult can do. \nAny adult who knew that these children were being poisoned and looked \nthe other way, in my view, is liable. You don't hurt a child. You don't \nhurt a child--let alone for life--and destroy their mind.\n  I know that Senators Stabenow and Peters are working hard with the \nRepublicans to come up with something to help the people there, and I \nhope that it will work out. I know that in my committee on the \nenvironment we have been working with them, along with Senator Inhofe, \nso we can do something. But it is after the fact. It is not as if you \ncan make this damage go away.\n  What shocked me was that on the heels of this tragedy and travesty in \nFlint, MI, we were marking up a bill, and the Republicans, to a person, \nsupported the ability of people spraying pesticides into drinking water \nnot to have to get a permit anymore and to take away the authority of \nthe EPA to require a permit if you are going to spray harmful \npesticides with toxins into a drinking water supply.\n  This is what my Republican friends did in the environment committee. \nI think they ought to change the name of that committee to the \npollution committee. What is that? In addition, the underlying bill \nsays you can never regulate the lead in fishing tackle under TSCA. \nLead. Hello? We now know what lead does when it gets into drinking \nwater. If there are ways to have less toxic fishing tackle, shouldn't \nwe try to make that happen if it is available?\n  So here we have a bill called the sportsmen's bill. Lots of things in \nthere are wonderful and I support wholeheartedly, but now we are going \nto say you can never regulate the lead in fishing tackle under TSCA? \nThen you are going to say you don't need a permit to spray pesticides \ninto a water supply? You have to be kidding.\n  We talk a lot about defending the American people. We have to do it \nabroad and at home because dead is dead. It is a serious issue when you \nexpose people to toxins. They get cancer. They have brain damage.\n  I am hopeful we can do something for the people of Flint and stand \nwith them, but I will tell you it is not going to let people off the \nhook. Anybody who knew this was happening and turned away or said: Who \ncares? It is a poor community, they will be punished at some point, \neven if in their own heart. We cannot disconnect from that incident to \nwhat we are doing today in saying you no longer need a permit to dump \npesticides into drinking water. What are people thinking? Are we so \nbeholden to special moneyed interests that we can't tell them they have \nto have responsibility? Defending our people means having a smart \npolicy to defend them from terror, which I support, but it also means \nprotecting and defending them with reasonable rules and regulations so \nwe don't poison them here at home or hurt the brains of their kids.\n  I want to show something that is happening in my State as we speak. \nThis is quite a picture. It shows what a gas leak looks like: plumes of \nmethane gas above a community. This is an infrared camera. This is what \nis happening from a natural gas leak. It didn't happen yesterday and it \ndidn't happen a month ago. It happened on October 23, and it is still \nout of control. I have submitted an amendment on behalf of myself and \nSenator Feinstein today to get some of the brightest minds from the \nDepartment of Energy--and there are very bright minds over there--to \ntake a look at what the heck is happening and why it is that this is \nrunning amuck. It is now burning longer than the BP oilspill. I \nremember so well because I worked so hard on the committee with all of \nmy colleagues, with Senator Landrieu and others, to get to the bottom \nof why it was happening, and we sent Stephen Chu, who was then \nSecretary of Energy. Guess what. In the BP spill, he figured out a \nbetter way to track the spill and therefore contain it by using gamma \nrays, as I remember.\n  As of last week, almost 3,700 households have been relocated to \nhotels and other temporary housing because the residents who live right \nhere are experiencing headaches, nausea, dizziness, nose bleeds, and \nother side effects stemming from the rotten egg smell, the chemicals \nthat give the natural gas its artificial odor.\n  This is Aliso Canyon. Schools have temporarily closed because the \nkids and teachers can't stand the smell all day. People's homes, their \nfurniture, everything they have left behind are becoming infused with \nthis horrid smell and the chemicals. It is a disaster for these \nresidents and for many local businesses struggling to stay afloat. We \nsee here, this is the Aliso Canyon leaking well site, but the plume is \nall over this community.\n  I want to share a couple of other photos because we know a picture is \nworth a thousand words. These are children, sick of being sick at \nschool. This is a mom who is having serious headaches. That is why this \namendment is so important because this is what is happening and, by the \nway, could happen probably anywhere where there are these natural gas \nstorage sites. There are 400 in America--400, in America. This is the \nfirst, and we had better deal with it and figure out how to deal with \nit because right now it is running amuck.\n  One of my constituents said: My husband and I moved there over 3 \nyears ago. We poured a lot of money into this home, our dream home, \nthinking it was a perfect area to move. I am expecting. We had \ndifficulties trying to conceive. The joy has been robbed from us \nbecause we have had to relocate twice. I am fearful to bring my newborn \nbaby back to Porter Ranch.\n  That is the community here, Porter Ranch. She said: I am fearful to \nbring my newborn baby back to Porter Ranch when the time comes and they \nsay the coast is clear.\n  Another one. This particular individual, Scott McClure, was quoted in \nthe L.A. Times:\n\n       I can't go outside and play baseball with my sons. I can't \n     go on walks with my family. My youngest son has been moved to \n     another school. My property value has dropped dramatically. I \n     get headaches, stomach \n     aches. . . .\n\n  The California Air Resources Board estimates that more than 86.5 \nmillion kilograms of methane--a powerful greenhouse gas--have been \nemitted into the atmosphere. So we move from a disaster for our \nfamilies--reflected in this woman's face--to a disaster for the \nenvironment because it is, so far, 2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide. \nThat is the equivalent of the methane that has poured into the \natmosphere. That is more greenhouse gas than 468,000 cars emit in 1 \nyear. Just think, in over 3 months this one leak has emitted as much as \nhalf a million cars do in an entire year. We have worked so hard across \nparty lines here to make sure our cars have good fuel economy and don't \nemit so much of this greenhouse gas, and now we have seen as much as \nhalf a million cars in an entire year. That is what has come into the \natmosphere.\n  This leaking well is 8,600 feet deep. The leak is thought to be \naround 500 feet below the surface. The gas company has unsuccessfully \nattempted to kill the well seven times by plugging it with brine and \ngravel. They are now attempting to drill a relief well down to the \nreservoir and cut the resisting well at its base, but this may not be \ncompleted in another month. If it isn't successful, they will have to \nstart over again.\n  So--October 23. We are now starting February, and these people have \nlived with this extraordinary disaster over them. I pray that this \nnightmare will be over and people can move back to their homes and that \nthey have the peace of mind that their homes are clean and their air is \nclean and the community will return to normal. In the meantime, we have \nto figure out what caused this leak and how to prevent it from \nhappening again at Aliso Canyon and everywhere around the country where \nthere are 400 similar sites.\n  On January 6, 2016, the Governor of the State of California declared \nan\n\n[[Page S457]]\n\nemergency for Los Angeles County due to the Aliso Canyon natural gas \nleak. State regulators have been working with the gas company and with \nFederal PHMSA and EPA. PHMSA is hazardous pipeline. They check to make \nsure those hazardous pipelines--the pipelines that carry this hazardous \nmaterial--are safe. They have been working as they have been providing \nconsultation.\n  I want to say that the working group on climate change called in the \nFederal people who were working in PHMSA and the EPA. They are doing \nconference calls and they are working, but it is not enough. It is not \nenough. We need the best minds--the best minds--and that is why Senator \nFeinstein and I have offered this amendment today. It is at the desk.\n  Under the amendment, the Department of Energy Secretary would lead a \nbroad review of this leak, including the cause, the response, and the \nimpacts on communities and the environment. They will issue a finding \nto all of us, all of our committees, as we listen, and to the \nPresident, within 6 months, but if they find something in the course of \ntheir investigation that can solve this leak or prevent another leak--\nin the Presiding Officer's State or anybody's State--they would have to \ncome forward and make it clear and report that finding.\n  The task force includes representatives of PHMSA--the Pipeline and \nHazardous Materials Safety Administration--Department of Health and \nHuman Services, Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, and the Department of Commerce. We have a small \ntask force here. Is it now seven? Seven. The reason is, we don't want \nsome big bureaucracy. We want a small task force to meet, headed by \nSecretary Moniz, who is an outstanding scientist, and we want them to \nhelp solve this crisis and provide relief for the thousands of affected \nresidents when they come in with their analysis. We want to make sure--\nwe want to make sure--this doesn't happen again in anybody's State, \nbecause when you have a constituent like this in your State who comes \nout and says: My God, I don't know what to do, that is what is on this \nface. I don't know what to do. I am scared. My kids are breathing this. \nI am breathing this. Where do I go? So we need our brightest minds, \nabsolutely, dealing with this, and that is what our amendment does.\n  Again, we have more than 400 underground natural gas storage \nfacilities. We have nine in California. This is a public health and \npublic safety issue that is critical for people not only in my State \nbut across the Nation.\n  Again, we know our most sacred responsibility is to keep our people \nsafe. Whenever we say that, people right away think about what is \nhappening abroad and homeland security and taking on ISIL and doing \neverything we have to do to keep our people safe. We have the Super \nBowl coming up in my beautiful State. Believe me, we are focused on \nthat. This is a great nation. We know how to take care of our people. \nTherefore, when we see a woman or children like this saying they are \nsick and we see this--and this is what the people of California are \nseeing in their living rooms, the picture of this out-of-control plume \ngoing on since October 23--we think: Wait a minute. This is the \ngreatest country in the world, with the greatest minds in the world, \nthe greatest science in the world. We have so many wonderful things, \nand we can't stop this leak? My God. It is ridiculous.\n  I was frustrated after I had that meeting because we are very much \nalike in many ways. We want to solve a problem, and we don't want \nbureaucracy to get in the way. We want to get the best people. Who \ncares who gets the credit? Sit around and get it done. When I had this \nmeeting with those Federal officials who were on these conference \ncalls, I got a clear sense, after all my years of experience--and I \nhave had a lot. When I started out, I didn't have all this gray hair.\n  The bottom line is, I know from experience that it doesn't feel like \nsomebody is truly in charge. That is why Senator Feinstein and I are \ngiving this amendment all of our heart and soul. We hope that our \nfriends on the other side will sign off on it because I know the \nDemocratic side has. I believe they will. We are working with them \nright now on a couple of issues.\n\n  If this passes and becomes the law of the land, we will finally have \nsomeone in charge here at the Federal level, someone so bright, so \nsmart--Secretary Moniz. I have a lot of faith in him. I think a lot of \nus do. He is in it for the right reasons. I think if he goes in there \nand they start to take a look at this, they may well find something \nright away that has been overlooked that could stop this horrific leak.\n  I want to close with this: Californians are leaders in so many \nareas--technology, entertainment, and trade. We would be the seventh or \neighth largest economy in the world.\n  I don't want to be a leader showing the way to the future with this \nkind of a travesty. I want to solve the problem. I want to tell my \nfriends here in the Senate that we have the technology to solve it; we \nhave leak-detection systems to find these problems before they happen. \nThis particular yard started in the fifties. If you built a house in \nthe fifties, you have to keep making improvements. I don't know the \nhistory of all of this, and I am not getting into that now. We are \nwhere we are. But I would suggest that if this natural gas yard was set \nup in the fifties, I don't think there were a lot of homes around at \nthat time. Let's be clear. We have to think about these things, where \nwe place these facilities. If I were in another State right now--and I \nam going to do this in California: I am going to look at the eight \nother facilities in my State. God forbid, if they have a leak, what is \ngoing to happen and how can we prevent it? Maybe there is an easy way \nto maintain these pipes in a way that makes sense. If we can find that \nout, we can stop this. We can say: This was horrible. We stopped it, \nand we are going to be able to prevent other explosions like this from \nhappening. And if they do happen, we will know how to deal with it.\n  We are not going to subject kids to this where they have to go out \nwith signs--and, by the way, masks around their necks--that say \n``relocate our school'' and ``sick of being sick at school'' and \ndislocate these kids, and they have been dislocated. They have been \ndislocated from their school. You know how it is for a kid. You have \nyour world. Your world is your home. Your world is your school. Your \nworld is your family. That is it. When you disrupt that, it is very \ndifficult on our children.\n  I hope and pray that we will get this done today and that we will get \nthe Department of Energy ready to go on this. Even if we pass it here \nand we don't get it quickly to the House and they don't do it quickly, \nI think we will send a signal to the Department of Energy that they can \nlook at this now and help in a way where they would have the confidence \nthat we would all be behind that here in the Senate.\n  I am looking forward to a vote on this. I hope we have a voice vote. \nWe don't need a recorded vote on something like this. I am going to \ncontinue to work with the Republican leaders on this. I hope we can \nmove forward.\n  I thank you so much for your patience and your time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/02/senate-section/article/S457-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S457-S459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ENERGY POLICY MODERNIZATION BILL\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, one of the things the Republicans were \ndetermined to do when we took the majority in the Senate last January \nwas to get the Senate working again for American families.\n  Under Democratic control, the Senate had basically ground to a halt. \nThe Democratic leadership spent its time pushing partisan show votes \ninstead of putting in any real work on the challenges that are facing \nour Nation. Republicans were committed to changing that. Since we took \nthe majority last January, we have worked hard to once again make the \nSenate a place for serious debate and serious legislation. We have \nsucceeded.\n  Last year we passed a number of significant bipartisan bills, \nincluding a\n\n[[Page S458]]\n\nmajor reform of No Child Left Behind and a multiyear transportation \nbill that will strengthen our infrastructure and put Americans to work.\n  This week we are beginning consideration of a bipartisan energy bill \nto modernize our Nation's energy policies for the 21st century. This \nbill is the product of months of work by Republican and Democratic \nSenators and staffers on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. \nSenators held four full committee hearings and spent countless hours \nhammering out the legislation that is before us today. This bill is a \ngreat example of the kind of substantive, bipartisan legislation we can \nproduce when the Senate is working the way it is supposed to work.\n  Among many other things, this bill will streamline the application \nprocess to make it easier for American companies to export liquefied \nnatural gas. The natural gas industry in the United States has grown by \nleaps and bounds in recent years, and our economy will benefit \ntremendously when U.S. companies start exporting American liquefied \nnatural gas this year. Liquefied natural gas exports from the United \nStates will also strengthen our allies in Europe by allowing them to \nrely on the United States for their import needs instead of relying on \naggressive nations like Russia.\n  I have also submitted several amendments to this bill, including an \namendment to streamline the permitting process for wind development. \nAmerican wind developers cite permitting delays as one of the chief \nobstacles to development of this clean energy source. My amendment will \nremove this roadblock and allow wind generation and the jobs that it \ncreates to move forward more quickly.\n  I have also submitted an amendment that would examine whether \nhydroelectric dams in places like the Missouri River in my home State \nof South Dakota could be paired with future hydrokinetic generation to \nbetter harness the great energy potential of our rivers.\n  I have submitted an amendment to prevent the Environmental Protection \nAgency from moving ahead with a lower ground-level ozone standard until \n85 percent of the U.S. counties that are not yet able to meet the old \nsmog standard are able to meet the old requirements. We should \nprioritize the worst cases of smog in America before imposing \nsignificant economic burdens or limiting energy generation in other \nareas.\n  One thing Republicans always say when we talk about energy is that we \nneed an ``all of the above'' energy policy. What do we mean by that? We \nmean that we need to focus on developing all of our Nation's energy \nresources, from renewable fuels, such as wind and solar, to traditional \nsources of energy, such as oil and natural gas. That is the only way to \nmake sure Americans have access to a stable, reliable energy supply and \nto keep our energy sector thriving.\n  The bill we are considering today is an ``all of the above'' energy \nbill. It invests in a wide range of clean energies, from nuclear, to \nhydroelectric, to geothermal. It supports traditional sources of \nenergy. It modernizes our Nation's electrical grid. It promotes energy \nefficiency. It encourages conservation. That is the kind of energy \npolicy we need to take our energy sector into the 21st century.\n  Unfortunately, the President has repeatedly blocked domestic energy \ndevelopment and the jobs it would create. He rejected the Keystone XL \nPipeline--a project that his own State Department found would have \nvirtually no impact on the environment and that would have supported \n42,000 jobs during construction. He has blocked attempts to tap our \nvast domestic oil reserves in Alaska. His EPA has imposed a steady \nstream of burdensome regulations that are making it more expensive to \nproduce American energy. The President's national energy tax will drive \nup energy bills for poor and middle-class families and reduce our \nNation's energy security, while doing very little to help our \nenvironment. Similarly, the President's waters of the United States \nrule will place heavy regulatory burdens on farmers, ranches, \nhomeowners, and small businesses across the country.\n  President Obama might like to think that the United States can rely \non a few boutique renewable energies, but the truth is that our Nation \nis simply not there yet. Efforts to impede other, more traditional and \nreliable types of energy production simply punish American families who \nthen face soaring energy prices and fewer jobs in the energy sector.\n  Robust domestic energy production coupled with commonsense energy \nefficiency measures will create jobs, enhance the reliability of our \nenergy supply, spur economic development, and help keep energy costs \nlow. Those are the kinds of energy policies that this bill supports.\n  Last Friday we learned that the economy grew at a rate of seven-\ntenths of 1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015. Needless to say, \nthat is not where we need to be in terms of economic growth. The \nrecession may have technically ended 6\\1/2\\ years ago, but our economy \nhas never fully rebounded. Economic growth has been persistently weak \nduring the Obama recovery, and there are no signs of substantial \nimprovement in the near future. In historical terms, the Obama recovery \nis the weakest economic recovery since the Eisenhower administration. \nIf you rank the 66 years since 1950 in terms of economic growth, the \nObama years rank 45th, 46th, 47th, 48th, 54th, 55th, and 66th. Let me \nrepeat that. If you rank the 66 years since 1950 in terms of economic \ngrowth, the Obama years rank 45th, 46th, 47th, 48th, 54th, 55th, and \n66th--or dead last. It is no wonder the American people are tired of \nliving in the Obama economy.\n  Given this weak economic growth, removing impediments to energy \ndevelopment is more important than ever. A thriving energy sector can \nhelp us overcome the weakness of the Obama recovery and usher in a new \nera of stronger economic growth.\n  According to former CBO Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the difference \nbetween a 2.5-percent growth rate and a 3.5-percent growth rate would \nhave a major impact on the quality of life for low- and middle-income \nfamilies. If our economy grew at just 1 percentage point faster per \nyear, we would have 2\\1/2\\ million more jobs and average incomes would \nbe nearly $9,000 higher--$9,000 higher. That is the difference between \nowning your own home and renting one. It is the difference between \nbeing able to send your kids to college and forcing them to go deeply \ninto debt to pay for their education. It is the difference between a \nsecure retirement and being forced to work well into old age. \nAdditionally, an additional percentage point in economic growth will \nreduce our annual deficits by $300 billion. That in turn would further \nimprove the health of our economy.\n  The American people have suffered long enough in the Obama economy. \nThey are ready for a new era of strong economic growth; an era built \nupon free enterprise, not big government programs; an era that focuses \non growth, opportunity, and income mobility, not redistribution of \nshrinking economic resources; an era that rewards innovators and \nentrepreneurs rather than punishes them.\n  Over the next year, Americans who are ready for a change from Obama's \nfailed policies will hear from congressional Republicans who are \nincreasingly focused on getting our economy working again. Reforming \nour Tax Code and reining in regulations, repealing and replacing \nObamaCare, strengthening our international security by rebuilding our \nmilitary, and reforming outdated poverty programs will be the \nfoundation of our agenda for a more prosperous future.\n  Americans will also continue to hear from a Republican-led Senate \nthat it is focused on moving bipartisan bills to improve economic \nsecurity for American families. The bill before us today is one of \nthose bills. It will help consumers use less energy and free up energy \nproducers to develop resources and create jobs.\n  I am glad the Senate is focused on an ``all of the above'' energy \napproach that supports energy growth and development in this country. I \nthank Senator Murkowski for her leadership and work on this bill. I \nlook forward to working on more bills here in the Senate that will \nstrengthen economic security for American families. That is what we \nshould be about--better, more robust growth in the American economy \nthat creates better paying jobs for American workers and families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n[[Page S459]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing none, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/02/senate-section/article/S459-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S459-S460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PRESCRIPTION DRUG ADDICTION\n\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I am here to talk about a public health \nepidemic that kills more people in the United States every year than \ngun violence or motor vehicle accidents. Last year, drug overdoses \nkilled nearly 50,000 Americans. Almost 60 percent of those overdoses \nwere caused by prescription opioids or heroin. Drug overdoses are \nincreasing the death rate of young adults in the United States to \nlevels not experienced since the AIDS epidemic, more than 20 years ago. \nThese skyrocketing death rates make them the first generation since the \ntime of the Vietnam war to experience higher death rates in early \nadulthood than the generation that preceded them.\n  So we ask ourselves: What specifically is causing this tidal wave of \naddiction and overdoses? Well, the answer is clear. Over the last 10 \nyears, the Drug Enforcement Agency has increased the amount of \noxycodone it has approved for manufacturing by 150 percent.\n  For 2016, the DEA has told Big Pharma it is OK to make nearly 1.4 \nmillion grams of oxy. That is enough for almost 15 billion 10-milligram \npills. Let me say that again: That is enough for almost 15 billion 10-\nmilligram pills to be sold in America this year. That is a full bottle \nof potent painkillers for every man, woman, and child in the United \nStates of America for 2016. This tsunami of opioid addiction is \nswallowing families as quickly as Big Pharma wants Americans to swallow \nits pills. Yet, despite this raging epidemic, you would think the Food \nand Drug Administration, the agency responsible for the safety of all \nprescription drugs in the United States, would welcome every bit of \nexpert advice it can get from doctors and other public health \nprofessionals. In fact, the FDA's own rules call for it to establish an \nindependent advisory committee of experts to assist the agency when it \nconsiders a question that is controversial or of great public interest, \nsuch as whether to allow a new addictive prescription painkiller to be \nmarketed in the United States. Instead, the FDA has put up a sign in \nits window: ``No Help Wanted.'' The FDA began turning its back on \nadvisory committees in 2013 when an expert panel established to review \nthe powerful new opioid painkiller Zohydro voted 11 to 2 against \nrecommending its approval, but the FDA approved the drug anyway, \noverruling the concerns voiced by experienced physicians on the panel. \nThose experts criticized the agency for ignoring this incredible \ngrowing epidemic. The advisory panel warned that this Oxycontin \nepidemic--this heavily abused prescription painkiller that the FDA \nfirst approved back in 1995--needed a new test for safety. They warned \nabout the growing dangers of addiction, abuse, and dependence \nassociated with the entire class of opioid painkillers. Justifiably, \nthe FDA was lambasted for its decision to approve Zohydro by public \nhealth experts, doctors, Governors, and Members of Congress. But \ndespite the warning of real-world dangers of abuse and dependence on \nthese new supercharged opioid painkillers, the FDA willfully blinded \nitself to warning signs.\n  In 2014, in the wake of the Zohydro decision, the FDA twice skipped \nthe advisory committee process altogether when it approved the new \nprescription opioids Targiniq and Hysingla. Then, in August 2015, the \nFDA did it again. This time it bypassed an advisory committee on the \nquestion of a new use for Oxycontin for children aged 11 to 16. This \ntime the FDA even ignored its own rules that specifically called for an \nadvisory committee when a question of pediatric dosing is involved. In \nother words, there is a special category when children are involved \nthat calls for advisory committees, and the FDA ignored that.\n  At this point it became clear that the FDA was intentionally choosing \nto forgo an advisory committee in order to avoid another overwhelming \nvote recommending against approval of a prescription opioid. Why? \nBecause the FDA would then have had to ignore yet another group of \nexperts in order to continue its relentless march to put more drugs \ninto the marketplace.\n\n  With the Oxycontin-for-kids decision, the FDA's reckless attitude \ntoward expert advice on drug safety went too far. Children whose brains \nare not yet fully developed are especially vulnerable to drug \ndependency and abuse. Yet the agency focused its so-called safety \nanalysis only on concerns about proper dosing, saying that it needed \nonly to tell doctors the proper doses for children who needed the drug.\n  Well, that is just plain wrong. We use experts to determine if child \ncar seats are safe, if toothpaste is safe, and if vaccines are safe. We \nshould use experts to determine if the opioid painkillers are safe for \nour families. We need to immediately reform the Food and Drug \nAdministration opioid approval process if we want to stop this epidemic \nof prescription drug and heroin addiction.\n  Last week I placed a hold on the nomination of Dr. Robert Califf to \nhead the FDA. Before I can support this nomination, the FDA must make \nthree needed changes to its opioid approval process. First, the FDA \nneeds to make sure that every opioid approval question is reviewed by \nan external panel of experts. Second, the FDA needs to consider \naddiction, abuse, and dependence as part of its determination of \nwhether an opioid is safe. The FDA cannot continue to operate as if \nsafety just means dosage, when it should include all of the dangers, as \nwell, of these painkillers. And third, the FDA should rescind its \ndecision on Oxycontin for kids and then convene an advisory panel, as \nit should have done in the first place. Then the FDA can consider the \nOxycontin-for-kids decision with the benefit of that panel's \nindependent advice and with the proper meaning of safety in mind.\n  The FDA must commit to shift the way it approaches and evaluates \naddiction before I can consider supporting Dr. Califf's nomination.\n  The prescription drug and heroin epidemic knows no geographic \nboundaries, and our response should know no political boundary. That is \nwhy Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and I worked together to identify \nsolutions to this crisis. Last spring, Senator McConnell and I joined \ntogether in calling for a Surgeon General's report on the opioid \ncrisis.\n  Last fall, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy announced that he will be \nissuing a new report on the substance abuse crisis this year. Fifty \nyears ago, there was a historic report on smoking that changed the way \nour country viewed that. This is the same kind of report that we need \nfrom our Surgeon General for our country to see, but that is just the \nfirst step in a larger comprehensive national strategy that I am \nfighting for this year.\n  We need to stop the overprescription of pain medication that is \nleading to heroin addiction and fueling this crisis. That starts with \nthe prescribers. We need to ensure that all prescribers of opioid \npainkillers are educated about the dangers of addiction and appropriate \nand responsible prescribing practices.\n  I have a bill that requires every prescriber of opioid pain \nmedication in this country, as a condition of receiving their DEA \nprescribing license, to be trained in the best practices of using pain \nmedications and methods to identify and manage an opioid-use disorder. \nStopping overprescription also includes narrowing the pipeline at the \nfront end.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to continue for 2 \nadditional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, this means that the DEA needs to reduce \nthe quotas of oxycodone and hydrocodone that it approves for \nmanufacture each year. The DEA is allowing Big Pharma to manufacture \ntoo many of these pain pills. Although the United States is less than 5 \npercent of the world's population, Americans consume 80 percent of the \nglobal supply of opioid painkillers and 99 percent of the world's \nsupply of hydrocodone, the active ingredient in Vicodin. Tragically,\n\n[[Page S460]]\n\nwe have become the ``United States of oxy.''\n  With the opioid epidemic reaching epic proportions, our Federal \nbudget should reflect the magnitude and importance of investing in \ntreatment and recovery services.\n  In Massachusetts, approximately 65,000 people are currently dependent \non opioids. Some 50,000 need treatment but are not receiving it. \nTreatment for prescription drug and heroin addiction is absolutely at \nthe top of the list of the things this Congress should deal with, and \nthat is why we need to work together. We need to make sure that the \ntreatment is there for each of these patients, and that includes \nensuring that patients receive from a physician the help they may need \nfrom Suboxone. Right now, that is denied to many different patients.\n  I have been in Congress for 39 years. I have never actually seen an \nissue like this that has grown so quickly and affects so many families \nin our country. Not a day goes by in the State of Massachusetts where \nsomeone doesn't come up to me and talk to me about a family member who \nhas been affected by this epidemic. It is time for us to join together \nin a bipartisan fashion to produce the kind of legislation to give hope \nto families and let them know that relief is on the way, and that \nprevention and treatment will be there to help their families deal with \nthis crisis.\n  I hope we can accomplish that goal this year, and I believe we can do \nit on a bipartisan basis.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time with thanks to the Senator from \nAlaska for her indulgence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/02/senate-section/article/S460-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                             Drug Addiction\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, before I begin my remarks this morning \nabout the Energy Policy Modernization Act, I wish to acknowledge my \ncolleague from Massachusetts. I come from a very large, remote State. \nAbout 80 percent of the communities in Alaska are not connected by a \nroad, so one would think that our isolation would insulate us from some \nof the scourges that we see when it comes to drugs and drug addiction. \nUnfortunately, that is not the case. In my State we are seeing the same \nlevel of addiction. While the numbers might not be as eye-popping as \nMassachusetts or New Hampshire and other parts of the country, that is \nbecause we have fewer people. But on a per capita basis, the numbers \nare staggering and very worrying.\n  As my colleague from Massachusetts notes, this is not something that \nshould be a Republican or a Democratic problem or have a Republican or \nDemocratic solution. This should have all of us working together \nbecause what is happening and what we are seeing is simply \nunacceptable. It is destroying families and communities, and we must \nwork together. I appreciate his comments here before the body this \nmorning.\n  Mr. President, I hope the Senate is prepared for another good, busy \nday of debate on our broad bipartisan energy bill.\n  Late yesterday, while we were not taking votes, we were in session \nfor a few hours--but what we were able to do during that time period \nwas approve eight more amendments by voice vote. We are now up to 19 \namendments accepted so far. The latest batch from yesterday featured a \nproposal from Senators Gardner, Coons, Portman, and Shaheen to boost \nenergy savings projects that will limit the cost of government and save \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  We also approved an amendment from Senators Flake, McCaskill, and \nBooker to evaluate the number of duplicative green buildings programs \nwithin the Federal Government. I think we all appreciate the need to be \nmore efficient, but do we need to have dozens and dozens of duplicative \nprograms to build this out? That is what that amendment addressed.\n  We also approved an amendment from Senators Inhofe, Markey, and \nBooker to renew a brownfields restoration program run by the EPA.\n  So we did OK yesterday, approving eight amendments by voice votes, \nwhich is not bad for a Monday around here when we were not scheduled to \nhave votes, but I think we can do better than that. I think we can pick \nup the pace, and we are ready to do that.\n  We will have two rollcall votes that are scheduled for 2:30 this \nafternoon. The first one is an amendment by the Senator from Utah, Mr. \nLee, amendment No. 3023, and it would limit Presidential authority to \npermanently withdraw Federal lands as national monuments. This is an \nissue that I have joined the Senator from Utah on, as well as many \nSenators from around the West, who have concerns that we would see vast \nareas of our particular States permanently withdrawn--something that \nagain resonates very strongly in my State, where 61 percent of our \nState is held in Federal land. I am pleased that my colleague from Utah \nhas offered this amendment, and I am hopeful the Senate will adopt it.\n  The second amendment we will have this afternoon is the Franken \namendment No. 3115. This would impose a nationwide efficiency mandate. \nThis is a matter that we had before the energy committee when we were \nin markup in July, and many Members are already familiar with it.\n  I am aware that some Members are still filing amendments, but I think \nmy advice to them is to know they are chasing the train down the tracks \nat this point in time. We had a total of 230 amendments filed as of \nthis morning, so we have a lot to sort through as we are trying to deal \nwith the debate and just kind of keep things moving.\n  A number of Members are also hoping to secure a vote on their \npriorities, so we have a line now. Those who are just thinking about \nfiling should know where you are in this process. Senator Cantwell and \nI intend to continue to process amendments as quickly as we can and we \nask for the cooperation of Members to help that effort move along.\n  I do want to thank the ranking member on the energy committee. \nSenator Cantwell and her staff have been working very hard and very \nwell with me and my staff as we are working to process this bill. The \nlevel of back-and-forth has been very constructive, very helpful, and I \nappreciate it, and I want to give special recognition to the yeoman's \nwork that the staff are doing right now.\n  We will be setting up additional rollcall votes today. We will \nhopefully be able to reach agreement on amendments that we can clear on \nboth sides as well.\n  As we have moved through the debate process on this important Energy \nbill, we have seen some good, strong amendments. I mentioned some \nalready. We have had amendments from both parties. We have had them \noffered by Members from all areas of the country. We have seen some \nparticularly good ones that focus on hydropower. I wish to take a few \nmoments this morning to speak about hydropower and the amazing supply \nsource that hydropower provides for our Nation.\n  Hydropower harnesses the forces of flowing water to generate \nelectricity, and it has many virtues as an energy resource. It is not \nonly emissions free and renewable, it is also capable of producing \nstable, reliable, and affordable base power. How about that: stable, \naffordable, and reliable base power. It is emissions free. It is \nrenewable. It is not defined yet as renewable, and we address that in \nthis bill. Right now, hydropower produces about 6 percent of our \nNation's electricity and nearly half of our renewable energy. That is \nmore\n\n[[Page S461]]\n\nthan wind and solar combined and enough electricity to power some 30 \nmillion American homes.\n  Up in Alaska, hydropower provides--the number is right about 24 \npercent of our electricity. It provides energy for communities \nthroughout the State, most notably in the southeastern part of the \nState where I was born and raised. It is very significant there. It is \nalso in what we call the railbelt area. It is an amazing contributor to \nour State's energy base. We continue, though, to have vast potential \nwith hundreds of sites in Alaska alone just waiting to be developed. We \nare a leader on hydropower, but we are hardly alone in having untapped \npotential.\n  According to an official from the Department of Energy who testified \nbefore the energy committee back in 2011, our country could realize \n``an additional 300 gigawatts of hydropower through efficiency and \ncapacity upgrades at existing facilities, powering nonpowered dams, new \nsmall hydro development, and pump storage hydropower.''\n  So let me repeat what that really means: An additional 300 gigawatts \nof hydropower, not through some big megadam but through efficiency, \nthrough capacity upgrades at existing facilities, powering up our \nnonpowered dams, new small hydro development--we see a lot of that in \nAlaska--and pump storage hydropower. With that, 300 gigawatts of \nadditional power.\n  Putting it into context, 1 gigawatt can power hundreds of thousands \nof homes. We have an estimated 300 gigawatts of potential hydropower--a \nhuge benefit to our country in terms of what we could get from our \nhydro resources, and it will not take much to start taking advantage of \nit. That is the beauty of it.\n  It may surprise some to know that right now only 3 percent of our \nNation's existing 80,000 dams around the country currently produce \nelectricity. Just 3 percent of 80,000 dams that are already out there \nare producing electricity. Think about what we could do if we electrify \njust the top 100--just the top 100 out of 80,000. We could generate \nenough electricity for nearly 3 million more homes and create thousands \nof jobs. Meanwhile, simply upgrading the turbines at existing \nhydropower dams could yield a similar amount of additional electric \ngenerating capacity.\n  We talk a lot about efficiency around here. Well, let us apply the \nefficiency with what we have with our existing facilities. What most of \nus agree on is that hydropower is a great American resource. It is \nrenewable, it is affordable, it is always on, and nearly every State \nhas potential in some way. Yet, despite all of this--despite the \ntremendous benefits that it provides and despite our tremendous \nuntapped potential--America's hydropower development has stalled. Why? \nIt has stalled, quite honestly, because of redtape and environmental \nopposition.\n  This was the subject of a recent op-ed piece that I cowrote with Jay \nFaison, who is the founder of the ClearPath Foundation. It is called \n``Stop Wasting America's Hydropower Potential.'' It ran in the New York \nTimes last month, and we have gotten some pretty good, positive \ncomments. I ask unanimous consent that this op-ed be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 14, 2016]\n\n              Stop Wasting America's Hydropower Potential\n\n                   (By Lisa Murkowski and Jay Faison)\n\n       President Obama has described climate change as one of the \n     biggest challenges facing our country and has said he is open \n     to new ideas to address it. He can start by supporting \n     legislation to increase the nation's hydropower capacity, one \n     of our vital renewable energy resources.\n       Hydropower harnesses the force of flowing water to generate \n     electricity. It already produces about 6 percent of the \n     nation's electricity and nearly half of its renewable energy, \n     more than wind and solar combined. This is enough electricity \n     to power 30 million homes and, according to the Department of \n     Energy, avoids some 200 million metric tons of carbon dioxide \n     emissions each year. That amounts to taking about 40 million \n     cars off the road for one year.\n       But we could be doing much more to harness the huge \n     potential of hydropower, even without building new dams.\n       For instance, only 3 percent of the nation's 80,000 dams \n     now produce electricity. Electrifying just the 100 top \n     impoundments--primarily locks and dams on the Ohio, \n     Mississippi, Alabama and Arkansas Rivers that are operated by \n     the Army Corps of Engineers--would generate enough \n     electricity for nearly three million more homes and create \n     thousands of jobs.\n       And upgrading and modernizing the turbines at existing \n     hydropower dams could yield a similar amount of additional \n     electricity-generating capacity.\n       Despite the benefits of this technology, American \n     hydropower development has stalled because of government red \n     tape and environmental opposition. Less capacity has been \n     added each decade since the 1970s, even as our infrastructure \n     ages. Half of our plants use turbines or other major \n     equipment designed and installed more than 50 years ago.\n       At the heart of the problem is a broken federal permitting \n     process that has created an unnavigable gantlet for \n     hydropower projects. While mandatory environmental reviews \n     must be stringent to protect waterways and wildlife, federal \n     bureaucrats insist on duplicative, sequential processes that \n     exacerbate regulatory uncertainty, delay approvals and drive \n     up consumer costs.\n       Compounding the roadblocks are environmental groups that \n     claim to adhere to sound science but hold remarkably outdated \n     views of hydropower and its benefits. Rather than acknowledge \n     technological advances and the environmental safeguards in \n     our laws, these groups have filed lawsuits to dismantle dams \n     or stop their construction.\n       Add it all up, and it can now take well over a decade to \n     relicense an existing hydropower dam. For the California \n     customers of Pacific Gas and Electric, relicensing costs have \n     run as high as $50 million a dam--all for the privilege of \n     continuing to operate an existing renewable energy project.\n       One-third of the nation's hydropower dams will require \n     license renewals by 2030. We need to make this process more \n     efficient by reducing bureaucratic and administrative delays \n     that end up increasing electricity rates and slowing \n     hydropower's expansion.\n       Fortunately, Congress has stepped in to get hydropower \n     development back on track. Legislation in both chambers, \n     including a measure in the Senate that was approved by a \n     bipartisan vote in committee, would direct agencies to \n     expedite the permitting of new projects and the relicensing \n     of existing ones, and would advance the use of hydropower \n     nationwide.\n       But while Congress has chosen to lead on this important \n     issue, President Obama has threatened to veto the House bill, \n     claiming it would undermine environmental safeguards. The \n     challenge is finding a way to bring state and federal \n     agencies to the table with the applicants at the beginning of \n     the process so they can identify potential problems and \n     coordinate environmental reviews. The legislation would not \n     change the authority of federal agencies to impose \n     environmental conditions.\n       There is much more that we can do. Upgrading existing dams \n     is just one of the approaches that holds big promise. \n     Coordinating hydropower projects on a regionwide basis might \n     allow for permitting on a more timely basis and provide \n     better opportunities for environmental mitigation. There is \n     also tremendous potential for electricity generation using \n     new marine hydrokinetic technologies that convert the energy \n     of waves, tides and river and ocean currents into \n     electricity. And it is important to recognize the huge, \n     untapped potential for hydropower in Alaska.\n       With hydropower, Congress has given the president an \n     opportunity to address climate change and ``bridge the \n     divide'' between parties. If he is serious about expanding \n     the use of clean, renewable energy, he should at last give \n     hydropower the attention it deserves in his final year.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Register-Guard, Jan. 20, 2016]\n\n                         Preserve Hydro Assets\n\n       On Sept. 29, 1963, a crowd of 1,800 people gathered near \n     the headwaters of the McKenzie River for the dedication of \n     the Eugene Water & Electric Board's Carmen Smith project. A \n     band played, box lunches were served, Gov. Mark Hatfield \n     spoke and power flowed from a hydroelectric complex for which \n     Eugene voters had approved a $23.5 million bond issue three \n     years earlier.\n       Carmen Smith has been generating electricity ever since, \n     and now its license to operate on a public waterway needs to \n     be renewed. EWEB submitted its relicensing application to the \n     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 10 years ago. The \n     relicensing process--along with improvements to the project, \n     most of them related to fish passage--will cost an estimated \n     $226 million.\n       It is costing 10 times as much and taking more than three \n     times as long to relicense the project as it did to build it \n     in the first place.\n       To be sure, a million dollars isn't worth what it used to \n     be, more is known about the environmental effects of \n     hydroelectric projects than was the case half a century ago, \n     and appreciation of the importance of the McKenzie River's \n     fish habitat has grown. Still, the high cost of relicensing \n     has tipped the value of the Carmen Smith project into \n     negative territory. Low power prices are to blame--but \n     another factor is a relicensing process that is predicated on \n     the notion that hydroelectric projects are valuable enough to \n     carry a heavy load of added costs.\n       The $226 million price tag for relicensing stems in part \n     from an agreement that EWEB negotiated in 2008 with \n     government agencies, environmental groups and Native American \n     tribes. The other parties to the agreement\n\n[[Page S462]]\n\n     pledged to support a new license of Carmen Smith, and EWEB \n     agreed to retrofit its components to improve fish passage and \n     make other improvements. With electricity selling at $100 per \n     megawatt hour or more, power generated by the Carmen Smith \n     complex would easily cover the costs.\n       In today's markets, however, electricity is selling for \n     one-third that amount on a good day--and sometimes, buyers \n     can't be found at any price. Without a reduction in \n     relicensing costs, Carmen Smith will become a money loser. \n     Parties to the 2008 agreement are close to accepting a \n     revision that would lower the costs by $55 million to $60 \n     million. EWEB would close a relatively small generating \n     turbine at the complex's Trail Bridge Dam, eliminating the \n     need for a costly fish screen. Even with that change, \n     prospects of a positive cash flow from Carmen Smith are \n     dicey.\n       EWEB is not the only utility whose hydroelectric plants are \n     being weighed down by relicensing costs. One-third of the \n     nation's dams will need new licenses by 2030. These are \n     mostly dams whose construction bonds have long been paid off, \n     an advantage that until recently allowed the relicensing \n     process to become a vehicle for the addition of \n     environmental, recreational and other improvements. In some \n     cases, such improvements are no longer affordable. In other \n     cases, the costs of licensing acts as a barrier to the \n     electrification of dams or other impoundments, blocking the \n     development of a reliable, carbon-free power source.\n       Many hydro projects need environmental upgrades, and should \n     not be relicensed without them. But the process should not \n     drag on for a decade, and it ought to recognize the \n     environmental benefits of hydropower--benefits in danger of \n     being buried under a mountain of relicensing costs.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. At the heart of the problem is a broken Federal \npermitting process that has created an unnavigable gauntlet for our \nhydropower projects. It can now take well over a decade to relicense an \nexisting dam. I will say it again. We are not talking about licensing a \nnew dam; we are talking about relicensing an existing dam--a process \nthat can take over a decade. For the California consumers of Pacific \nGas and Electric, relicensing costs have run as high as $50 million per \ndam simply to continue an existing project. We are not building \nanything new. We want to relicense it. It is costing $50 million and \ntaking over 10 years.\n  There was a recent editorial in a Eugene, OR, newspaper, the \nRegister-Guard, which called for the preservation of hydropower assets, \nand it noted that the existing Carmon Smith project has been mired in \nthe relicensing process for over 10 years, with a pricetag estimated at \n$226 million. It amounts to 10 times as much and 3 times as long as it \ntook to build the project when it was constructed in 1963. What is \nwrong with this picture? Taking 10 times as much--requiring 10 times as \nmuch money--$226 million--and taking 3 times as long to build as when \nthey built that project back in 1963. We are going in the wrong \ndirection. This is not progress. We are headed exactly in the wrong \ndirection.\n  We can change that. Let us put it in the context of what we have \nexisting in this country right now. I said that right now hydro is \nproviding about 6 percent of our energy and about half of our \nrenewables. One-third of our Nation's existing hydropower projects will \nrequire license renewals by 2030. One-third of the existing facilities \nare going to have to go through this decade-long relicensing process, \nwhich will cost millions of dollars. What we need to do is make the \nrelicensing process more efficient by reducing bureaucratic and \nadministrative delays that end up increasing electricity rates, slowing \nhydropower's expansion, and actually delaying the adoption of \nenvironmental mitigation measures. If you are concerned about the \nenvironment, you ought to be interested in making sure we have a better \nprocess because if we fail to improve the relicensing process, we are \ngoing to start losing hydropower projects, and we will backslide as \nother forms of generation replace them, just as we are seeing with \nnuclear power in some parts of our country. We are going to go \nbackward.\n  Whether your issue is climate change or whether it is electric \nreliability or just good, affordable energy, we should be able to agree \nthat this is a situation we want to avoid. We do not want to be going \nbackward on this.\n  Coming from Washington State, Senator Cantwell understands and \nclearly appreciates the value of our hydropower resources. I have been \nvery pleased to be able to work with her on many of these initiatives, \nas well as with many other members of our committee, on some of the \nbipartisan reforms we have contained within the Energy Policy \nModernization Act. What we realize is that our current policies are \nholding this resource back and that we need to update, we need to \nmodernize them, if we ever want to harness the amazing potential of \ndomestic hydropower. Our joint hydropower language attempts to bring \nState and Federal agencies to the table with the applicants at the \nbeginning of the process so they can identify where the potential \nproblems may be and coordinate environmental reviews.\n  Because hydropower licenses are issued by the FERC, our bill \nauthorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to be the lead \nagency so they set a schedule and they coordinate all the needed \nFederal authorizations. The schedule is to be established on a case-by-\ncase basis, in consultation with other agencies, and if a resource \nagency then cannot meet a deadline, the White House Council on \nEnvironmental Quality is then tasked with resolving these interagency \ndisputes.\n  In terms of a step that is long overdue, we formally designate \nhydropower as a renewable resource for the purpose of all Federal \nprograms.\n  When I first came to the Senate some years ago and focused on energy \nissues, I just really had a hard time with the fact that hydropower was \nnot considered a renewable resource.\n  I was born in Ketchikan, AK. It is in the middle of a rainforest. I \nwas raised in southeastern Alaska, where the annual precipitation is \nsomething that would take most people's breath away. If I were to tell \nthe people of Juneau or Wrangell or Ketchikan that what is coming out \nof the sky today is not a renewable resource, I would be laughed out of \nthe room. Hopefully we take care of this and formally designate \nhydropower as a renewable resource for the purposes of all Federal \nprograms.\n  We have very good, commonsense ideas carefully crafted within our \nbill. Our language does not alter the authority of Federal agencies to \nimpose mandatory environmental conditions or weaken the stringent \nenvironmental review process. For those who are afraid that somehow or \nanother we are going to run roughshod over the environmental \nregulators, that is not the case. What we are doing is, through \nefficiency, streamlining, and some coordination, we are going to be \nable to make a difference in our Nation's ability to develop \nhydropower, and that is why the members of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee overwhelmingly supported the hydropower provisions \nin the bill we have before us today.\n  There is always more good news we can add. We have looked at the \namendments other Members have offered. We have already accepted an \namendment from Senator Daines to extend the deadline for the \nrelicensing of a hydropower project in Montana. We also have a number \nof other amendments from other Members from both sides of the aisle, \nand I am hoping we will be able to add them to the bill. For example, \nSenator Gillibrand has filed an amendment to extend the deadline for a \nhydroproject in her home State of New York. Senator Burr has filed an \namendment to extend the deadline of a hydroproject in his home State of \nNorth Carolina. Senator Kaine has filed an amendment to extend the \ndeadline for hydroprojects in his State of Virginia. All of these \nprojects would add power to nonpowered dams. These projects already \nhave licenses, but what they need is more time to deal with the \ntechnical and regulatory issues that often arise before construction \ncan begin.\n  We have a fair number of our western Members who are understandably \nprioritizing hydropower. Senator Barrasso is filing an amendment to \nauthorize the use of active capacity of the Fontenelle Reservoir in \nsouthwest Wyoming. Senators Flake and Feinstein have come together with \na pretty good amendment to improve the way the Army Corps of Engineers \noperates dams to increase their efficiency. Is this not just good \ncommon sense?\n  It probably comes as no surprise that I have a couple of amendments \nthat will benefit Alaska, including one that will expand the existing \nproject at Terror Lake and allow the local community there--Kodiak--to \nremain powered almost entirely by renewable energy. Right now they are \n99.7 percent powered by renewable energy between wind\n\n[[Page S463]]\n\nand their hydrocapacity. We want them to get to that full 100 percent.\n  Finally, I want to recognize the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nMarkey, who has a proposal to encourage the development of pumped \nstorage hydropower assets--one of the best ways to store baseload power \nand a technology that could help to smooth out the intermittency of \nother renewable resources. We are working on that one--checking it \nout--but it looks good.\n  These are good proposals. As we continue our voting and clearing \nprocess here today, I am confident we will be able to accept many more \nof them.\n  Again, I want to acknowledge the work and partnership I have with \nSenator Cantwell on many of these hydro issues. Her State certainly \nenjoys the benefit of lower cost energy because of the investments made \nin hydro.\n  We have more work ahead of us. I know Members are anxious to talk on \ntheir amendments that they may have an interest in moving toward this \nafternoon, but this Senator is glad to be back on the bill, and \nhopefully we will have an exciting and energetic day.\n  With that, I yield the floor to my ranking member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from Alaska \nfor her focus on the hydropower bills we may be considering here, and I \nam thankful for the focus from all my colleagues on hydropower and ways \nwe can continue to improve the efficiency of our resources and make \nsure we are continuing to diversify.\n  I think we have outlined a good plan for today. Obviously we need the \ncooperation of our colleagues to keep moving forward on this \nlegislation. We are going to have a couple of votes.\n  I am so pleased my colleague from Minnesota is here to talk about one \nof our first votes, a federal energy efficiency resource standard. He \nhas been a leader on this issue.\n  Yesterday I outlined some of the great States in this Nation that \nhave already adopted what are called energy efficiency resource \nstandards, which have shown great success in helping to save energy and \ndriving down demand, thereby saving money for both businesses and \nhomeowners. I think it is something that will also receive a lot of \nenthusiasm as we move forward.\n  I know that we have many ideas; that is what I like about this Energy \nbill--it was bipartisan coming out of the committee, and so far it has \nbeen bipartisan on the Senate floor in working out these issues. I hope \nmy colleagues will understand that there will be a point where we do \nhave to move off of this bill. Hopefully, with the cooperation of \nMembers, we can make a great deal of progress today on additional votes \nbesides the two that are pending, set more votes for later this \nevening, and also continue the process of getting some of these other \nissues resolved in the meantime.\n  Again, I thank our colleagues for turning their focus to this. I \nthank my colleague for outlining where we have already been on the bill \nas it relates to the amendments we adopted last night and the continued \nprogress. I think it comes down to the fact that as our economy \nchanges, energy production needs to have the attention of our \ncommittee. We need to continue to be able to help empower this \ntransformation that our economy is seeing on energy, and working \ntogether in a bipartisan fashion helps us to get there. It is good for \nour homeowners, it is good for businesses, and it is good for our \neconomy.\n  With that, I yield the floor and encourage our colleagues to support \nmy colleague Senator Franken on his EERS amendment we will be voting on \nshortly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise today to talk about the importance of updating our Nation's \nenergy policy. I thank Chairwoman Murkowski, Ranking Member Cantwell, \nand their staffs for their hard work in crafting a bipartisan energy \nbill.\n  Congress hasn't passed a comprehensive energy bill since 2007, and a \nlot has changed in the energy sector since then. We have seen a \ntransformation in renewable energy. Electricity generation from wind \npower has grown by more than 400 percent. Wind energy now supplies \nelectricity for 20 million Americans. The growth of solar energy is \nequally impressive. In its early days, solar power was known for \npowering satellites and space stations. Now we are seeing residential \nand utility-scale solar power becoming important components of the \ngrid. Since the passage of the last Energy bill in 2007, our solar \ngeneration capacity has increased more than 2,000 percent. During that \ntime, the cost of solar energy has dropped more than 60 percent. We \nhave to build on these trends and reorient our energy sector toward a \nclean energy future. Comprehensive energy legislation needs to promote \ninnovation, deploy clean energy technology, and create good-paying \njobs.\n  The bipartisan Energy bill we are currently debating is an important \nstep forward. It improves our Nation's energy efficiency through \ncommonsense measures, such as updating building codes. It invests in \nenergy storage, which will turn intermittent renewable energy into \nbaseload power. It also helps States and tribes to access funds to \ndeploy more clean energy technologies. These are good measures, and \nthat is why I voted to support this bill out of the energy committee.\n  However, the current bill does not go far enough to fight the \nchallenge of climate change. Climate change presents a Sputnik moment--\nan opportunity to rise to the challenge and defeat the threat of \nclimate change. In response to Sputnik, we mobilized American ingenuity \nand innovation. We ended up not just winning the space race and sending \na man to the Moon, we did all sorts of great things for the American \neconomy and for our society.\n  By rising to the challenge of climate change, we can bet again on \nAmerican ingenuity. We have the opportunity not just to clean up our \nair but also to drive innovation and create jobs. That is why I am \noffering my American Energy Efficiency Act as an amendment to this \nbill. This amendment, which is cosponsored by Senators Heinrich, \nWarren, and Sanders, establishes a national energy efficiency standard \nthat requires electric and natural gas utilities to help their \ncustomers use their electricity more efficiently. This is something \nthat 25 States are already doing, and what those programs have shown us \nis that energy efficiency standards work.\n  Our amendment will send market signals that we are serious about \nenergy efficiency. It will unleash the manufacturing and deployment of \nall kinds of energy-efficient products throughout our economy. It will \nhelp households and businesses save money on their electricity bills. \nAccording to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy--the \nexperts in energy efficiency who rated the energy savings in the \nPortman-Shaheen bill--our amendment will generate more than three times \nthe energy savings of the entire Portman-Shaheen energy efficiency \ntitle in the base bill. By the year 2030, our amendment will generate \n20 percent energy savings across the country and result in about $145 \nbillion in net savings to consumers.\n  Our amendment is modeled on the experience of States that have \nadopted energy efficiency standards. In fact, the first State to adopt \nefficiency standards was Texas. Similar programs have been adopted by \nboth red and blue States. What we have seen with these programs is that \nthey work. They are saving energy, and they are saving consumers money, \nboth in businesses and homes.\n  My State of Minnesota passed its energy efficiency standards under a \nRepublican Governor--Governor Tim Pawlenty--in 2007. We have a goal of \n1.5 percent annual energy savings, and we don't just meet that goal, we \nexceed it. These energy efficiency standards also send a market signal \nto companies to innovate and deploy energy savings technologies.\n  The State of Arkansas set its energy savings targets in 2011, and \naccording to the Arkansas Advanced Energy Foundation, the program has \ngenerated $1 billion in sales by energy efficiency companies. The \nstandard has also helped create 9,000 well-paying jobs in the State. \nThe program has been so successful that the State public service \ncommission recently extended the energy efficiency goals through 2019.\n\n[[Page S464]]\n\n  Arizona implemented its energy efficiency savings targets in 2011. \nJust 3 years after its implementation, Arizona went from being 29th to \nthe 15th most energy-efficient State in the country. Through the \nprogram, utilities have saved electricity equivalent to powering \n133,000 homes for 1 year. Businesses and residents have already saved \n$540 million from reduced energy and water usage. These savings put \nmore in people's pockets. That means more money to buy groceries, a new \ncar, or to pay for college.\n  The States have shown that energy efficiency standards work. We \nshould learn from Pennsylvania, Illinois, Colorado, and 22 other States \nand bring this successful experiment to the whole country.\n  I again applaud the efforts of Senator Murkowski and Senator Cantwell \nin bringing this bipartisan Energy bill to the floor.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment when it comes to a vote \nthis afternoon. My amendment will make this good piece of legislation \nstronger. It will reduce emissions. It will save Americans money. It \nwill unleash clean energy innovation and jobs throughout the Nation. I \nurge all of my colleagues to vote yes on this amendment and to bet on \nour future.\n  This is a Sputnik moment. When we responded to Sputnik, we did \namazing things. This is a piece of it. I urge my colleagues to support \nmy amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I speak on amendment No. 3192, which is \nrevolutionary. At some point I will yield to my colleague the Senator \nfrom Louisiana to further discuss this amendment.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I filed today is a byproduct of the work \nand bipartisan agreement of members representing the gulf, the \nAtlantic, and the Arctic regions of our country. I specifically thank \nSenators Murkowski, Warner, Scott, Vitter, Kaine, and Tillis for their \ncontributions in our efforts to bring greater equity revenue sharing \nfrom funds derived from offshore energy production.\n  For years, energy activities in coastal gulf States and adjacent \noffshore waters have produced billions of barrels of oil and trillions \nof cubic feet of natural gas for American energy consumers. The States \nalong the gulf coast and the Arctic, et cetera, have supported offshore \nenergy development for the rest of the country, providing the support \nfor and paying for the infrastructure needed to bring this energy to \nmarket. With all of this development, as you might guess, there have \nbeen increased costs associated with supporting this increased traffic, \nadditional use of local and State resources, as well as transportation \ncorridors--such as pipelines, vessels, and trucks--to get this energy \ndelivered to those consumers driving vehicles all across the United \nStates.\n  Maybe most importantly, in addition to the critical areas that \nsupport this energy supply, in my State in particular we are \nexperiencing unparalleled land loss due to Federal decisions as to how \nthe lower Mississippi River will be channeled for the benefit of the \ninland country as well as those efforts associated with this oil and \ngas development. We can see the effects of this unparalleled land loss. \nWhen Hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit our coast, there was no longer the \nwetlands that buffered the impact of tidal action. Those wetlands \neroded, so those hurricanes hit with greater force, causing greater \ndamage to our State. After Hurricane Katrina, you only have to remember \nthose news reports from New Orleans to understand how devastating that \ncould be--all related to decisions made by the Federal Government.\n  Addressing these historic costs of hosting a capital-intensive \nindustry, while ensuring resilient domestic energy supply, can be \nobtained only through equitable revenue sharing. What Louisiana does \nunder our State constitution with any revenue that is shared from the \nFederal Government related to drilling off the coast of the Gulf of \nMexico--100 percent is dedicated to coastal restoration; 100 percent is \ndedicated to restoring the wetlands that would prevent another \nHurricane Katrina from devastating New Orleans or any other coastal \ncommunity in our State.\n  There are other benefits for the rest of the country. This amendment \nthat we have filed would increase funding for the Land and Water \nConservation Fund by over $600 million, so the rest of the country \nbenefits as well.\n  This amendment brings greater equity in revenue sharing with the gulf \nStates by lifting the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, or the GOMESA \nrevenue sharing cap, while allowing mid-Atlantic States and Alaska to \nshare in future revenue from offshore energy production. All energy-\nproducing States deserve to share the revenue derived from energy \ndeveloped both onshore and offshore. Responsible revenue sharing allows \nStates hosting energy production to mitigate for the historic and \nprospective infrastructure demands of energy production and allows \nStates to make strategic investments ensuring future generations of \nresiliency for this vital infrastructure and natural resources.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my colleague from Louisiana, Senator \nVitter, for his thoughts on this issue.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Cassidy.\n  Mr. President, I also rise in strong support of this amendment, the \nCassidy amendment, which would increase revenue sharing for States for \noffshore and oil and gas development.\n  Revenue sharing is a critical issue that I have advocated with others \nfor many years, certainly including Senator Cassidy, his predecessor, \nand Committee Chair Murkowski. I am pleased that our coalition in \nsupport of this strong, positive concept has grown in recent years and \nit now includes colleagues from the mid-Atlantic States. I am \nparticularly pleased that that is evidenced by this amendment being \nsupported and coauthored by the two Senators from Virginia and Senator \nScott.\n  Revenue sharing with oil and gas producing States is, No. 1, fair to \nthose States that incur real environmental and other costs due to \nproduction activity that benefits the Nation; and, No. 2, it is good, \npositive pro-American energy policy.\n  It is fair because, again, energy-producing States incur costs and \nimpacts from that production, including environmental costs. Those \nStates need to be properly compensated to deal with those real costs \nand impacts.\n  Secondly, and just as importantly, this is positive, productive \npolicy that furthers pro-American energy agenda. It encourages the \nproduction of American energy. It incents domestic drilling and \nactivity and domestic energy production over the long term. That energy \nproduction is essential to job creation and an overall healthy economy. \nIf it weren't for the oil and gas jobs that accompanied the energy \nsector boom earlier this decade, we would still be in a technical \nrecession.\n  One point I wish to emphasize is that many of those jobs have been \ncreated by small firms in the oil and gas services industry and support \nsectors. These small business jobs are something I have highlighted in \nmy role as chair of the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship.\n  This amendment before the Senate, the Cassidy amendment, would \nincrease revenue sharing for gulf States, and it would establish \nrevenue sharing for new production from Alaska, Virginia, North \nCarolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. This is a clear gain for those \nStates and those regions. But, more importantly, it is a clear gain for \nthe country because in the medium and long term, we will get more \nAmerican energy production and be more self-sufficient.\n  Let me be clear what revenue sharing means for States such as my home \nof Louisiana. In Louisiana we spend 100 percent of those revenues on \nvalid environmental works, specifically coastal restoration.\n  We lose a football field of land in Louisiana's coastal area--just in \ncoastal Louisiana--every 38 minutes. Think about that. Close your eyes, \nand picture a football field losing that amount of Louisiana coastal \nland every 38 minutes, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 52\n\n[[Page S465]]\n\nweeks a year, with no time off for holidays or weekends. This is our \nmost significant environmental issue by far in Louisiana, so our State \nhas committed itself to spending all of the money we receive from \nrevenue sharing to restoring, rebuilding, and stabilizing our coast.\n  This is vitally important for us. It is also vitally important for \nthe rest of the country because Louisiana supplies so much energy to \nthe rest of the country--so many fisheries, fish, and seafood to the \nrest of the country. Our ports in the midst of that coastal area are \nvital to trade and commerce for the rest of the country.\n  What this amendment does is expand revenue sharing to Alaska and the \nmid-Atlantic States. Between 2027 and 2031, those States would receive \n37.5 percent of revenue sharing from oil and gas production off of \ntheir coasts, which is what Louisiana and the Gulf States receive now.\n  The amendment would also lift the cap on revenue sharing that the \ngulf States are burdened with under the GOMESA act of 2006. Under that \nlaw, revenue sharing with gulf States is capped arbitrarily at $500 \nmillion a year, but in those operative years of this amendment, that \nwould be increased to $1 billion a year.\n  Revenue sharing is vital when it comes to adequately compensating the \nStates that incur costs and impacts, so it is vital for fairness. But, \nagain, it is vital to encourage more American energy production and \nmore self-sufficiency. For our Nation--not just the States impacted--\nthat means growth, and that means energy independence. That is a win, \nin fact, for our foreign policy--less dependence on unstable and \nsometimes very unfriendly nations in the Middle East.\n  We want to continue to play a critical role in meeting America's \nenergy needs. We want to do that in Louisiana; other States want to do \nthat. This amendment and this concept will very much encourage us to do \nthat and continue to forge a path of American energy independence, \nwhich is great for economic growth.\n  I wish to briefly take a moment to compliment my colleague from \nLouisiana, Senator Cassidy. He has worked very hard on this issue, this \namendment, and other critical energy issues as a member of the energy \ncommittee and also before that as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives. I am very grateful for this opportunity to work with \nhim on this amendment and this concept that we have been working on and \nfurthering for some time.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this commonsense, pro-American \nenergy, pro-American jobs amendment. This will move us in the right \ndirection for energy independence, for economic growth, and for a sound \nforeign policy that decreases our reliance and dependence of any sort \non nations in the Middle East.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I will be speaking later, as we are \nexpecting Senator Shaheen from New Hampshire.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I am delighted to be on the floor \ntoday, again, with my good friend from Ohio, Senator Portman, to \ndiscuss our energy efficiency bill, the Energy Savings and Industrial \nCompetitiveness Act, which is almost entirely now a part of the broad \nEnergy Policy Modernization Act that is on the floor today.\n  The Energy Policy Modernization Act is a broad bipartisan approach to \nimprove our Nation's energy policies on efficiency, infrastructure, \nsupply, and accountability. I wish to thank the chair of the energy \ncommittee, Senator Murkowski, and Ranking Member Cantwell for the good \nwork they have done to put together this bipartisan piece of \nlegislation that is going to address a number of our energy challenges \nand also permanently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund. \nNow, as I said, a fundamental component of this bill started out as \nShaheen-Portman. Now we call it Portman-Shaheen. But as my colleagues \nknow, Senator Portman and I have been working on this energy efficiency \nlegislation since we first introduced it in 2011.\n  I am a proponent of energy efficiency because it is the easiest, \ncheapest way to reduce energy costs, to combat climate change, and to \ncreate private sector jobs. In addition to being affordable, energy \nefficiency benefits aren't confined to a certain fuel source or to a \nparticular region of the country. You can like efficiency if you are a \nsupporter of fossil fuels or if you are a supporter of new alternative \nenergies.\n  Our piece of this comprehensive bill represents nearly 5 years of \nmeetings, negotiations, compromise, and broad stakeholder outreach. The \nend result is an affordable, bipartisan approach to boost the use of \nenergy efficiency technologies in manufacturing, in buildings, and \nacross the Federal Government.\n  According to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, \nwhen fully implemented, our efficiency bill will create nearly 200,000 \njobs, reduce carbon emissions by the equivalent of taking 22 million \ncars off the road, and save consumers $16 billion a year. And it does \nthis with absolutely no mandates.\n  Critical to the negotiation of this legislation has been the joint \neffort between Senator Portman and myself, and between our staffs, to \nwork out with stakeholder groups the concerns they had in the energy \nefficiency legislation and to come up with compromises that we all \nthought not only helped build support for the legislation but that \nactually make it a better bill.\n  So on buildings, which use about 40 percent of our energy in this \ncountry, the proposals in our legislation would improve energy savings \nby strengthening outdated model building codes to make new homes and \ncommercial buildings more energy efficient. Again, I point out that it \ndoes that without any mandates. It is a carefully crafted agreement \nthat has been negotiated with everyone, from the home builders to the \nrealtors to a number of our friends in labor. So I think this is a \ncompromise, and the language in the bill is a compromise for which \nthere is broad support.\n  The bill also encourages energy efficiency in the industrial sector, \nwhich consumes more energy than any other sector of our economy. Again, \nthe provisions in the legislation would encourage the private sector to \ndevelop innovative energy efficient technologies for industrial \napplications and to invest in a workforce that is trained to deploy \nenergy efficiency practices to manufacturers, and they would encourage \nthe Department of Energy to work more closely with stakeholders on \ncommercialization of new technologies.\n  Finally, the energy efficiency piece of this legislation would \nencourage the Federal Government, the Nation's largest energy consumer, \nto adopt more efficient building standards and technologies, such as \nsmart meters. With stronger efficiency standards for Federal \nfacilities, we can save taxpayers millions of dollars.\n  Senator Portman and I have introduced our bill three times. Each \ntime, this legislation has received broad bipartisan support from our \nSenate colleagues, broad bipartisan support in the energy committee, \nand it has received strong support from a diverse group of \nstakeholders--everyone from trade associations and the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce to the National Association of Manufacturers, labor \norganizations, and the environmental community--all, I think, because \nefficiency is something that we can all agree on.\n  At long last, I am excited to see that the full Senate is again \ntaking up this legislation as part of a bigger, more comprehensive \nbill.\n  Before I turn it over to Senator Portman, who is here, I would also \npoint out that two other provisions I have been working on are included \nin this comprehensive bill. One is smart manufacturing legislation, \nwhich uses technology to integrate all aspects of\n\n[[Page S466]]\n\nmanufacturing so that businesses can manufacture more while using less \nenergy. The other provision deals with grid integration, because, as we \nknow, this is one of the issues that the committee took up as part of \nthis bill: How do we address our aging transmission and distribution \ninfrastructure? The grid integration bill will ensure the broader \ndeployment of clean and efficient technologies, such as solar, combined \nheat and power, and energy storage. I think that is important to \nstrengthen this Nation's energy security.\n  Finally, I will close by saying that the Senate is working this week \non a comprehensive energy bill for the first time since 2007, if it \nbecomes law. Since then, we have seen a dramatic change in our economy, \nand we have seen a dramatic change in the world economy with respect to \nenergy. The United States has greatly reduced our energy imports. We \nare now the world's top producer of oil and natural gas. In many places \naround the world, electricity generated by renewable sources, such as \nwind and solar, is cheap enough to compete effectively with electricity \ngenerated by fossil fuels. Just at the end of the year, we saw more \nthan 180 countries come together to form a global plan to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. So \nwe are truly experiencing a revolution in energy production and energy \ntechnology. It is way past time for our energy policies in America to \ncatch up with that revolution.\n  I, again, thank the chair and ranking member and the entire energy \ncommittee, and, again, my colleague Senator Portman for the great work \nhe has done and that we have done together to bring this portion of the \nbill to the floor.\n  I yield to Senator Portman.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from New \nHampshire, and I tell her that the third time is the charm. Right? We \nhave had the bill before us twice now. We really think this is the \nopportunity for us to do something good for our constituents and for \nour country. This is an opportunity for us to pass energy efficiency \nlegislation. It will help create more jobs, make the environment \ncleaner, make our businesses more competitive, make us less dependent \non foreign sources of oil, and help with the trade deficit because of \nthat. So this is a win-win for everybody, and, because of that, I thank \nSenator Shaheen for her work on this. We have been working on this for \n4 years together. The last vote we had in the energy committee on this \nlegislation was a 20-to-2 vote. As we have worked on this over time, we \nhave received more and more support as people understood what we were \ndoing and why it was so important for their States and for our country.\n  The economic growth in this last quarter was 0.7 percent, meaning \nless than 1 percent growth. That is discouraging. We have to look \naround and say: What can we do to help to get this economy moving \nagain? One area is energy. There is no question about it. We believe \nour legislation will help. It is going to create jobs. We have the \nnumber out there, as Senator Shaheen talked about, and just under \n200,000 jobs could be created by our legislation. We have an analysis \nthat shows this. But this broader energy bill would also help. That is \none reason we need to move forward on this.\n  We are grateful that our legislation is part of this broader bill \ncalled the Energy Policy Modernization Act. This legislation is one \nthat Senator Murkowski and Senator Cantwell have been talking about on \nthe floor. I support that broader legislation, also, as does Senator \nShaheen, and we like it because it is a broader bill that looks at the \nenergy issue as an ``all the above.'' In other words, we should be \nusing various sources of energy and producing more energy, but we \nshould also be using what we have more efficiently.\n  We are delighted that our legislation--the Portman-Shaheen \nlegislation--is title I of this broader bill. This is an opportunity \nfor us to do something really good for the economy--this broader bill, \nas well as our specific bill. We think our specific bill is really \nimportant with regard to jobs.\n  One thing I hear back home from our manufacturing companies is that \nthey would like to become more competitive so that they can create more \njobs in Ohio and in America. We are starting to bring some jobs back \nbecause energy prices are relatively low, natural gas and oil in \nparticular. But one of the issues they are facing overseas is that \nother countries are more energy efficient and their manufacturing \ncompanies are more efficient. So they are competing with companies that \nhave a lower cost to produce the same product. So one reason they are \nexcited about this legislation--and why the National Association of \nManufacturers is for this legislation and has worked with us from the \nstart--is that this provides them access to new technologies on energy \nefficiency that will let them compete globally with other companies and \ncreate more jobs. This is going to result in more jobs coming to Ohio, \nmore jobs coming to New Hampshire, and more jobs coming to America. We \nlike that about the legislation. It also has more jobs because these \nenergy efficiency retrofits are going to create more jobs and activity \nhere in this country. So as buildings become more efficient, we will \nneed workers to work on that. We have some training programs in our \nlegislation, for instance, to provide for that workforce. So we are \ngoing to create more jobs.\n  As to energy independence, the underlying bill lets us actually \nproduce more energy here but use it more efficiently. I like producing \nmore and using less. It is a nice combination, and it lets us say to \nother countries in the world that we are going to be energy independent \nand not subject to the dangerous and volatile parts of the world where \nour energy comes from. We are going to be a net exporter over time. \nEnergy efficiency helps us to be able to do that.\n  Our trade deficit is driven by a couple things. I am a former U.S. \nTrade Representative, and, yes, countries like China and other \ncountries aren't playing by the rules. That is a problem, and we need \nto address that. But another one is energy. We still do need to bring \nin more energy than we are exporting. That is an opportunity for us to \nhelp our economy overall with efficiency and to help improve our trade \ndeficit, which improves our environment.\n  Senator Shaheen talked about improving the environment, but the \nanalysis she was using is that 21 million cars being taken off the road \nis the equivalent savings that is in this legislation for emissions. \nThat is because of the energy efficiency. This is an opportunity for us \nto be much more energy efficient in terms of our economy and be more \ncompetitive but also to clean the environment. This is a good example.\n  By the way, it is not a big regulatory approach, as some other \napproaches are. It doesn't have any mandates in it, so it is not going \nto kill jobs. It is actually going to create jobs and yet help the \nenvironment. That is a good combination for us. It is one we are \nexcited about because it is a way for us to both help the economy and \nhelp the environment. That is important too.\n  We are excited about getting this across the finish line because we \nknow it is the right legislation. It is the right time. We think there \nis an opportunity for us to actually do something that is bipartisan, \nsomething we can get through the House and get to the President's desk \nfor his signature.\n  One reason we are excited about the prospects of getting something \ndone is that we have so much support around the country. There are over \n260 trade association groups that have now supported this legislation. \nBy the way, they range from the National Association of Manufacturers--\nas I talked about earlier--to the Sierra Club, to the Alliance to Save \nEnergy, to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. That is not a group that \nnormally gets together on legislation. So this is an opportunity for us \nto get a lot of groups involved and focused because it does make good \neconomic sense, good energy sense, and good environmental sense. While \nhelping others in the private sector, the bill does not have mandates. \nI think that is very important. This is legislation that provides \nincentives but not mandates.\n  The final piece I want to talk about is one that everybody should be \nfor. It is going to actually help reduce the costs of the Federal \nGovernment and therefore help us all as taxpayers; that is, to take on \nthe Federal Government's efficiency challenge. We believe\n\n[[Page S467]]\n\nthe U.S. Federal Government is the largest energy user in the United \nStates and may well be the largest energy user in the world. This is \nlet's practice what we preach.\n  The Federal Government is talking about green technologies, energy \nefficiency, and so on, but in our own Federal Government we see huge \ngaps and huge opportunities. This legislation goes after that and \nspecifically puts in place requirements for the Federal Government to \nbe much more efficient with how it uses energy. That will make a big \ndifference in terms of everything we talked about with regard to the \nenvironment and the benefits of efficiency, but it also helps the \ntaxpayer because at the end of the day, we will be spending less on \nenergy for the Federal Government as taxpayers.\n  It is another part of the legislation that I think is important and \none where I would hope everybody would be supportive. Overall, we \nbelieve this legislation will save consumers $13.7 billion annually in \nreduced energy costs. This is a big deal. This is something that if we \ncan get it through the Senate this week and get it through the House \nand get it to the President for his signature, it will make a real \ndifference for the families I represent and whom all of us in this \nChamber have the honor to represent.\n  I thank Senator Shaheen for her patience over what has been 4, 5 \nyears working on this together with me and the good work she has done \nand others have done to give us this opportunity to be able to help \nthose folks whom we represent with an ``all of the above'' energy \nstrategy that is good for jobs, good for the environment, and good for \nthe taxpayer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, as the Presiding Officer knows, we are \nbusy working to complete action on the Energy Policy Modernization Act. \nI want to start by saying some good words about the leadership of \nSenator Murkowski, the chairman of the energy committee, and her \nranking member, Senator Cantwell, who have gotten us to this point. \nUnless we drop the ball in the next couple of days, we ought to be able \nto wrap up our debate and deliberation on this very important bill that \nwill help our country move forward with energy policies that reflect \nthe times we are living in.\n  I also think we ought to reflect on what those times are because it \nwas just a few short years ago when all of the pundits and experts were \npredicting peak oil. In other words, all the oil that could be \ndiscovered, they said, had been discovered and we would then be in a \nperiod of decline from that point forward. In the United States we also \nfound ourselves in the main dependent upon imported oil from the Middle \nEast. As you know, both of those have turned around. In other words, \nbecause of the innovation and good old all-American know-how, we are \nnow exporting more energy.\n\n  To Senator Murkowski's credit, she led the effort to lift the ban on \nexporting crude oil, so now American-produced energy can be made \navailable on world markets. Just as significantly, we can make sure our \nfriends and allies around the world aren't captive to people like \nVladimir Putin, who uses energy as a weapon and threatens to cut off \nthe energy supply, particularly of those countries in its orbit in the \nBaltics unless they are willing to go along with his heavy-handed \ntactics.\n  This is a very good story. This legislation will update our energy \npolicies with that reality in mind and enable our country to continue \nto grow its role as a leading global energy power. I pause here to say \nthat this is not just from people who come from an energy State as I \ndo, such as from Texas or Alaska or North Dakota. The energy story is \nthe story of world history in so many ways.\n  One of my favorite books is written by Daniel Yergin, a Pulitzer \nPrize-winning author. One of the books he has written is called ``The \nPrize,'' which tracks the history of the globe and in an incredible \nsort of way, but he makes the point that so much of our history has \nbeen determined by the need for and attempt to gain access to reliable \nenergy supplies and how important that is not only to our military to \nbe able to fight and win our Nation's wars but to our economy, to the \nbusinesses that need access to reasonably priced energy and to \nconsumers, obviously.\n  We are seeing the benefit now, those of us who filled our gas tank \nrecently, of inexpensive gasoline prices because the price of oil has \ncome down because of increased world supply. There comes a point where \nit is challenging to the industry, but they have been through ups and \ndowns in the past, and I am sure they will make the appropriate \nadjustments.\n  In this legislation, in addition to addressing and modernizing our \nenergy policies, we are doing things such as modernizing the electric \ngrid. That is what keeps the lights on at night and keeps our \nthermostats working when it is cold and we have snowstorms like we had \nin Washington recently.\n  This bill will make our electricity supply more reliable and more \neconomical in the long run. Just like we did with crude oil, this bill \nwill help expedite the approval process for liquefied natural gas \nexports. It is amazing to me to think that a few short years ago we \nwere building import terminals that would actually receive natural gas \nbeing exported from other countries to being brought to the United \nStates to help us with our energy needs. Now those have been \nretrofitted and reversed so these export terminals are now exporting \nAmerican energy to markets around the world.\n  I want to spend a couple of minutes talking about some amendments \nthat I have offered to the underlying bill. Again, I must compliment \nthe bill managers for working with various Senators to try to work in, \neither through a voice vote or by some acceptance of amendments, \nprovisions which are designed to improve this legislation. My \namendments that I want to mention now are designed to address Texas's \nneeds and the American people's needs from preventing overreach by the \nadministration, particularly when it comes to your energy production \nand supply.\n  One amendment I have offered specifically targets an upcoming rule \noffered by the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, known as \nBSEE. BSEE is an organization that most people are completely unaware \nof, but it is set to hand down a rule referred to as the so-called well \ncontrol rule that deals with highly technical and complex safety \nproducers for offshore wells.\n  Certainly, since the BP blowout in the Gulf of Mexico, we have become \nall too aware of the dangers of uncontrolled blowout of offshore \ndrilling, but there has been a lot of very important study, work, and \neducation that has been acquired since that time. The industry has done \na lot to make itself safer.\n  You can imagine, if you are a publicly traded company or if you are \nnot a publicly traded company, you sure don't want to be in the middle \nof another crisis like we saw with the BP blowout in the Gulf of Mexico \nfor all sorts of reasons: People lost their lives, cost hundreds of \nmillions of dollars, and of course the environmental impact along the \ngulf coast, including States like Texas. In typical bureaucratic \nfashion, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, BSEE, has \nrefused to engage in discussions that might help clear up some \nconfusion among stakeholders. They have been unwilling to take the time \nto fully vet the negative impact on their proposed rules and to talk to \nthe people who know the most about it, and that would be the people who \nwould be most affected by the rule.\n  My amendment would require BSEE to resubmit the rule but first by \ntaking additional comments from stakeholders, and it would require the \nrulemaking organization to have additional workshops with industry \nexperts so everybody can understand what they are trying to accomplish \nand to do it more efficiently and better.\n  So often the very people who have the most expertise are in the \nindustry the government tries to regulate. I know there is a natural \nreluctance to try to consult with and learn from the regulated \nindustry, but the fact is, often--and it is true in this case--it is \nthat industry that understands the process and both the risks and what \nprotective measures need to be taken in order to accomplish the \nobjective. So rather than just issuing a rule that is complex and \nhighly technical without consulting the stakeholders who are sitting \ndown and having a reasonable conversation trying to figure out\n\n[[Page S468]]\n\nwhat you are trying to accomplish, have you thought of this, have you \nthought of doing it differently or a better way, that doesn't happen. \nUnfortunately, that is where we are with BSEE.\n  In addition, I have submitted an amendment that protects property \nowners along a 116-mile stretch of the Red River, which borders the \nStates of Texas and Oklahoma. This has to do with another bureaucracy \ncalled the Bureau of Land Management. A few years ago, the Bureau of \nLand Management claimed to actually own tens of thousands of acres \nalong the Red River. As you can imagine, that came as quite a shock to \nthe people who thought they owned that property, and now many of them \nare stuck today fighting the U.S. Government--their government--in \ncourt to reclaim the property that is rightfully theirs.\n  My amendment would help protect these landowners from this massive \nland grab. It would require a legitimate survey of the land in question \nto be conducted and approved by the authorities. It seems so \ncommonsensical, but unfortunately common sense isn't all that common \nwhen you see the bureaucracy at work. With this amendment, these \nlandowners would finally get a reasonably efficient means of resolution \nto this frustrating abuse of Federal Government power.\n  Another amendment I have submitted would address how States, \ncounties, and other affected parties enter into a conversation about \nthe Endangered Species Act. Too often States and local communities, not \nto mention private property owners, are left in the dark while interest \ngroups they don't know much about conduct closed-door discussions with \nFederal authorities about potential listing of endangered species.\n  My amendment will give all of the stakeholders the opportunity to \nhave a seat at the table and to have a conversation--it doesn't seem \nlike a lot to ask--so both the regulators and the regulated can talk \nabout the real impact those regulations will have on their daily lives \nand better inform the regulatory process.\n  These amendments get to different specific problems, but the common \ntheme uniting them is a desire to try to lessen the interference by the \ngovernment in our everyday lives. By pushing back against overbearing, \ncostly regulations that don't actually accomplish the goal that even \nthe regulators say they want to accomplish and ensuring that State and \nlocal communities and stakeholders play a role in this conversation \nwhich should be part of the regulatory process, the American people \nwould be better served by this legislation.\n  As we continue these discussions on this bill, I hope my colleagues \nwill consider these amendments and others like them to help get the \ngovernment out of the way or to help correct the bureaucracy when it is \nmisguided and misinformed about how to actually accomplish consensus \ngoals.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3023 to Amendment No. 2953\n\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 3023.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Lee] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3023 to amendment No. 2953.\n\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To modify the authority of the President of the United States \n                     to declare national monuments)\n\n       At the end of subtitle E of title IV, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 44___. MODIFICATION OF AUTHORITY TO DECLARE NATIONAL \n                   MONUMENTS.\n\n       Section 320301 of title 54, United States Code, is amended \n     by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(e) Effective Date.--A proclamation or reservation issued \n     after the date of enactment of this subsection under \n     subsection (a) or (b) shall expire 3 years after proclaimed \n     or reserved unless specifically approved by--\n       ``(1) a Federal law enacted after the date of the \n     proclamation or reservation; and\n       ``(2) a State law, for each State where the land covered by \n     the proclamation or reservation is located, enacted after the \n     date of the proclamation or reservation.''.\n\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \nan additional 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, if there is one thing we know about \nAmerican politics--if there is one thing we have learned from the 2016 \nPresidential race thus far--it is that there is a deep and growing \nmistrust between the American people and the Federal Government. This \ninstitution, Congress, is held in shamefully low regard by the people \nwe were elected to represent, but so, too, are the scores of \nbureaucratic agencies that are based in Washington, DC, but extend \ntheir reach into the most remote corners of American life.\n  In my home State of Utah, the public's distrust of Washington is \nrooted not in ideology, but experience. In particular, the experience \nof living in a State where a whopping two-thirds of the land is owned \nby the Federal Government and managed by distant, unaccountable \nagencies that are either indifferent or downright hostile to the \ninterests of the local communities that they are supposed to serve. I \nhave lost track of the number of stories I have heard from the people \nof Utah about their run-ins with Federal land management agencies, but \nthere is one story that every Utahan knows: President Bill Clinton's \ninfamous use of the Antiquities Act in 1996 to designate as a national \nmonument more than 1.5 million acres of land in southern Utah--what \nwould become known as the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument.\n  What Utahans remember about this episode is not just what President \nClinton did, but how he did it. Signed into law in 1906, the \nAntiquities Act gives the President power to unilaterally designate \ntracts of Federal land as ``historic landmarks, historic and \nprehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific \ninterest.'' The purpose of the law is to enable the Executive to act \nquickly to protect archaeological sites on Federal lands from looting, \ndestruction, or vandalism.\n  But the Antiquities Act is not supposed to be carte blanche for the \nPresident. In fact, it is quite the opposite. The language of the law \nis clear. It instructs the President to restrict the designation of \nnational monuments under the Antiquities Act to the ``smallest area \ncompatible with proper care and management of the objects to be \nprotected.'' So you can imagine the surprise, and, in fact, the \nindignation across the State of Utah following President Clinton's \ndecision to annex a stretch of land roughly 1\\1/2\\ times the size of \nthe State of Delaware and then to give control over that land to a \nFederal bureaucracy that routinely maintains a maintenance backlog that \nis several billion dollars higher than its multibillion-dollar annual \nbudget.\n  Even worse than the enormous size of the designation was the Clinton \nadministration's hostility toward the people of Utah and the \ncommunities that would be most directly and severely affected by his \ndecision. Not only did President Clinton announce the monument \ndesignation in Arizona--over 100 miles from the Utah State border--but \nhe refused to consult or even notify Utah's congressional delegation \nuntil the day before his announcement. Consulting with the people who \nlive and work in the communities around a potential national monument \narea isn't just a matter of following political etiquette, it is a \nmatter of ensuring that Federal land policy does not rob citizens of \ntheir livelihood, which is exactly what happened as a result of the \nGrand Staircase designation.\n  Utah's economy is built on the farm and agriculture industry, and \nlivestock is the State's single largest sector of farm income. But of \nthe 45 million acres of rangeland in Utah, nearly three-quarters is \nowned and managed by the Federal Government.\n  Since the 1940s, Federal agencies have slashed livestock grazing \nacross the Utah landscape by more than 50 percent--a policy of economic \ndeprivation that accelerated after 1996 on rangeland within the Grand \nStaircase case. Even today the Bureau of Land Management shows no sign \nof relenting.\n\n[[Page S469]]\n\n  For most people, the Grand Staircase episode is a case study of \ngovernment-sponsored injustice and a form of bureaucratic tyranny. For \nme, it brings to mind the line from America's Declaration of \nIndependence in which the colonists charge that the King of Great \nBritain ``has erected a multitude of New Offices and sent hither swarms \nof officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.''\n  But for President Obama and the radical environmental groups that \nhave co-opted Federal land agencies, it is the textbook model for the \napplication of the Antiquities Act. In fact, it appears that President \nObama is considering using his final year in the White House to target \nanother vast tract of land in southern Utah for designation as a \nnational monument. Covering 1.9 million acres of Federal land in San \nJuan County, this area, known as Bears Ears, is roughly the same size \nas the Grand Staircase. Both are situated near the southern edge of the \nState, and both possess an abundance of national beauty unrivaled by \nany place in the world.\n  The similarities don't end there. Each area is home to a group of \nUtahans deeply connected to the Federal land targeted by environmental \nactivists for a national monument designation. In the case of the Grand \nStaircase, it is the ranchers, and in the case of Bears Ears, it is the \nKaayelii Navajo. The Kaayelii believe that a national \nmonument designation in Bears Ears, their ancestral home, would \nthreaten their livelihood and destroy their very way of life.\n\n  Their concerns are well founded. In the 1920s and 1930s, hundreds of \nNavajo families settled on homesteads located in national monuments \nonly to find themselves steadily pushed out by imperious Federal \nagencies all too eager to eradicate the private use of public lands. So \nit should come as no surprise to us today that the Kaayelii are \nprotesting the unilateral Federal takeover of Bears Ears and calling on \nthe Obama administration to forgo the high-handed approach to land \nconservation that was employed by President Clinton in 1996.\n  The Kaayelii, of course, are not opposed to the protection or the \nconservation of public lands. They care about the preservation of Bears \nEars just as much as anyone else. To them, the land is not just \nbeautiful, it is also sacred. They depend on it for their economic and \nspiritual survival, which is why all they are asking for is a seat at \nthe table so that their ancestral land isn't given over, sight unseen, \nto the arbitrary and arrogant control of Federal land management \nagencies.\n  I agree with the Kaayelii. The President of the United States has no \nbusiness seizing vast stretches of public land to be micromanaged and \nmismanaged by Federal agencies, especially if the people who live, \nwork, and depend on the land stand in opposition to such a takeover. \nThere is no denying that the people of San Juan County reject the \npresumption that they should have no say in the management of the land \nin their community. The truth is that most of those who have mobilized \nto support a monument designation at Bears Ears, including several \nNative American groups, live outside of Utah in States such as \nColorado, New Mexico, and Arizona.\n  By contrast, the people of San Juan County, UT--the people whose \nlives and livelihoods are intricately tied to Bears Ears--stand united \nin their opposition to a monument designation. That is why I have \noffered amendment No. 3023, which would update the Antiquities Act in \norder to protect the right of the Kaayelii and their fellow citizens of \nSan Juan County to participate in the government's efforts to protect \nand preserve public land.\n  Here is how my amendment works: It preserves the President's \nauthority to designate tracts of Federal land as national monuments, \nbut it also reserves a seat at the table for people who would be \ndirectly affected by Executive action. It does so by opening the \npolicymaking process to the people's elected representatives at the \nState and Federal levels so they can weigh in on monument designations.\n  Under my amendment, Congress and the legislature of the State in \nwhich a monument has been designated would have 3 years to pass \nresolutions ratifying the designation. If they fail to do so, the \nnational monument designation will expire. Some critics might claim \nthat this amendment would take unprecedented steps to curtail the \nPresident's monument designation authority under the Antiquities Act. \nThis is not true. This, in fact, is nonsense. The truth is that \nCongress has twice passed legislation amending the Antiquities Act. In \n1950, Congress wholly prohibited Presidential designation of national \nmonuments under the Antiquities Act in the State of Wyoming. Some 30 \nyears later, Congress passed another law requiring congressional \napproval of national monuments in Alaska larger than 5,000 acres.\n  If you have ever visited Wyoming or Alaska, you know that these \nprovisions have not led to the parade of horribles conjured up by \nradical environmental activists who seem intent on achieving nothing \nshort of ironfisted Federal control of all Federal lands.\n  In reality, the States of Wyoming and Alaska have proven that \nnational monument designations are not necessary to protect and \nconserve America's most beautiful, treasured public lands. So why \nshould the people of Wyoming and Alaska enjoy these reasonable, \ncommonsense protections under the law while the people of Utah--and \nindeed, the people of every other State in the Union--do not enjoy the \nsame protections? There is no good answer to this question except, of \ncourse, the adoption of my amendment.\n  To anyone who might suggest that the people of these communities in \nand around national monuments are not prepared to participate in the \nmonument process and policy process that leads to the creation of a \nmonument, I invite you to visit San Juan County in southeastern Utah. \nYou will see a community that is not only well informed about the \nissues and actively engaged in the political process, but also \ngenuinely dedicated to finding a solution that works for everyone.\n  The people of San Juan County--from the Kaayelii to the county \ncommissioners--have the determination that is necessary to forge a \nlegislative solution to the challenges facing public lands in their \ncommunity, and that is exactly what you would expect. San Juan is a \nhardscrabble community. It is one of the most disadvantaged in the \nentire State of Utah, but you wouldn't know it from the people there. \nThe citizens of San Juan County are hardworking, honest, decent, and \nhappy people. Yet for far too long, Federal land management agencies \nhave given the people of San Juan County and the people all across \nAmerica little reason to trust the Federal Government.\n  My amendment gives us an opportunity to change that. If Congress \nwants to regain the trust of the American people, we are going to have \nto earn it, and one of the ways we can earn it is by returning power to \nthe people, and that is what this amendment would do. Passing this \namendment giving all Americans a voice in the land management decisions \nof their community would be a meaningful and important step toward \nearning back that trust. I urge my colleagues to lend their support to \nthis amendment and the vital public trust that it will help us to \nrebuild.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I am hopeful that before we go to the \ncaucus lunches, we will be able to move forward on a few more \namendments and the scheduling of votes. Hopefully we will be able to do \nthat in a few minutes.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, we are making some good progress here \nin the intervening hours since we came to the floor this morning and \nbegan business.\n  Working with the ranking member on the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, we have come to an agreement to announce a series of \namendments that will be voted on. I want to acknowledge the effort that \nhas gone back and forth on both sides to make\n\n[[Page S470]]\n\nsure folks have an opportunity to weigh in and vote on amendments that \nare important to them. I think we have a good series here that we will \nannounce.\n  It is our hope that as we move to vote on these amendments, we will \nalso continue the good work we have done to try to advance some other \nmeasures that will be able to go by voice votes, and we will be working \non those throughout the day.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to call \nup the following amendments: No. 3182, Rounds, as modified; No. 3030, \nBarrasso; No. 2996, Sullivan; No. 3176, Schatz; No. 3095, Durbin; and \nNo. 3125, Whitehouse; that following the disposition of the Franken \namendment No. 3115, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the above \namendments in the order listed with no second-degree amendments in \norder prior to the votes; that a 60-vote affirmative threshold be \nrequired for adoption; and that there be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to each vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I would note that there will now be a \nseries of eight votes when we commence at 2:30 this afternoon, and \nrecognizing that there are committees meeting and other Senate business \ngoing on, we would hope to be able to process these votes relatively \nefficiently, respecting that 10-minute vote parameter, so that we can \nmove through them in a manner that respects others' schedules.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/02/senate-section/article/S470-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 2:30 \np.m. will be equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3023\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Lee amendment \nNo. 3023, which places commonsense limitations on the ability of the \nexecutive branch to unilaterally lock up large swaths of public land. \nSpecifically, the amendment provides Congress and the applicable State \nlegislatures a 3-year window to approve Presidentially declared \nnational monuments, ensuring that land use decisions finally have the \ninput from the impacted States.\n  Arizona knows all too well the effects of restrictive Federal land \ndesignations. Like most Western States, a significant portion of \nArizona is under Federal ownership. Arizona leads the Nation with a \ntotal of 21 national parks and monuments. Like most, our Federal land \nis a mix of single-purpose lands set aside for recreation and multiple-\nuse lands providing opportunities for grazing, mining, and timber \nproduction. The ability to use these lands for multiple purposes is \ncritical; however, a national monument designation can take away that \nopportunity with one stroke of the President's pen.\n  It is also worth noting that a monument designation has the potential \nto change the character of the water rights associated with Federal \nlands--an outcome I am working to prevent with separate stand-alone \nlegislation.\n  There is a real concern that the President will take unilateral \naction to increase the Federal Government's ownership of Federal lands. \nIn fact, one recent proposal would lock up another 1.7 million acres \nright in Arizona to create yet another national monument. That is an \narea larger than the entire State of Delaware. The negative impact of \nsuch a land grab would likely extend to activities such as hunting, \nlivestock grazing, wildfire prevention, mining, and other recreation \nactivities. Last March Senator McCain and I sent a letter to the \nPresident urging him to not unilaterally pursue this monument \ndesignation. This sentiment is echoed by a large number of individuals \nthroughout Arizona, including State and local officials, several \nmunicipalities, and a wide range of sportsmen's groups.\n  The Lee amendment would give these stakeholders a voice in the \nmonument designation process, and I am happy to be a cosponsor and to \nsupport this amendment on the floor today.\n  I also look forward to considering several amendments I have \nsubmitted on this legislation as well regarding safeguarding hydropower \nproduction, reimbursing national parks after a government shutdown \noccurs, and creating a database to increase transparency for WAPA \ncustomers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, we are about to vote shortly on the Lee \namendment.\n  I rise to speak in opposition to that amendment and to remind my \ncolleagues that this is a vote that we took around the same time last \nyear.\n  The Antiquities Act is one of our Nation's most successful \nconservation laws. It was signed into law in 1906 and used by President \nTheodore Roosevelt to designate Devils Tower in Wyoming as its first \nnational monument.\n  In the 110 years since its enactment, the Antiquities Act has been \nused by 16 different Presidents--8 Republicans, 8 Democrats--to \ndesignate more than 140 national monuments, including the San Juan \nIslands and the Hanford Reach in the State of Washington. Nearly half \nof our national parks, including national icons, such as the Grand \nCanyon and Olympic National Park, were designated as national monuments \nunder the Antiquities Act. However, the amendment of the Senator from \nUtah would effectively end the President's ability to use the \nAntiquities Act to protect these threatened lands. His amendment \nrequires that the national monument designation will expire after 3 \nyears unless Congress enacts a law specifically approving the \ndesignation, and the State in which the monument would be located would \nalso have to approve the designation. So this amendment requires State \nand Federal approval over a Federal land designation, which is \nunprecedented, giving away Federal land management responsibilities to \nStates and a veto over these conservation efforts.\n  I hope that, as my colleagues look at this first vote, they will \noppose this amendment. As I said, I strongly do, and I hope our \ncolleagues will look at their past record on this as well, because I am \npretty sure we are all on record on our side in opposition to this \namendment in the past.\n  With that, I know we are probably ready to proceed to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of my amendment \nNo. 3023.\n  The purpose of this amendment is simple--to put in the hands of the \npeople the right to decide whether a monument close to them will be \ndesignated. My amendment would leave intact the President's authority \nto designate a monument such that we could protect land from imminent \ndestruction, but it puts a fuse on that. It puts a finite limit on that \nauthority so that within 3 years that monument designation would expire \nunless both the host State has acted to embrace it and Congress has \naffirmatively enacted the monument designation into law.\n  The American people demand and deserve nothing less than to have \ndecisions such as these put in the hands of their elected \nrepresentatives rather than simply handed over to one single official \nwho doesn't stand accountable to the American people.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3023.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask for order so my colleagues might \nhear my wise remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I call on my colleagues to support my \namendment No. 3115 that I offer with Senators Heinrich, Warren, and \nSanders. This amendment establishes a national energy efficiency \nstandard that requires electric and natural gas utilities to help their \ncustomers use energy more efficiently. Our amendment is modeled on the \nexperience of Minnesota and 24 other States that have already adopted \nenergy efficiency standards, including States such as Texas, Arizona, \nand Arkansas. The State programs are working great, helping reduce \nenergy usage, saving customers, consumers, and businesses money on \ntheir electricity bills, creating well-paying jobs, and reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions. According to the American Council for an \nEnergy-Efficient Economy, our amendment will generate more than three \ntimes the energy savings of the entire Portman-Shaheen energy \nefficiency title, which is a great title in and of itself, in the base \nbill. By the year 2030, our amendment will generate 20 percent energy \nsavings across the country and result in about $145 billion in net \nsavings to consumers.\n  We like to say that States are the laboratories of democracy, and \nhalf our States have shown that these policies work. So it is time to \nbuild on their successes and bring this successful experiment to the \nentire country. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nimportant amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I urge that Members oppose this \namendment that would impose a Federal mandate on retail electricity and \nnatural gas suppliers to reduce a certain percentage of electricity or \nnatural gas that their customers use annually. We have considered this \nbefore. We have seen it. It has been under consideration for about a \ndecade. Most recently, the energy committee rejected this same proposal \nas we were moving forward on this bipartisan Energy bill.\n  A national mandate like this depends on the behavior of end-use \ncustomers. The concern that you take a one-size-fits-all policy that \nrefuses to recognize very real regional differences that are in play \nout there with energy use is problematic. As the Senator from Minnesota \nsaid, 25 States already have this in place, but what we do by imposing \na new national mandate is we upend those existing State programs.\n  We have a good, bipartisan efficiency measure contained in this. That \nis why a Federal EERS has not worked before. Now is not the right time \nto move forward with it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the votes in this series \nbe 10 minutes in length so we can move through the amendments we have \nin front of us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is 2 minutes equally divided.\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, conservation easements are an important \ntool when we talk about rural America. They are used on a regular \nbasis, but whenever entering into a conservation easement with the \ngovernment, farmers, ranchers, and landowners should be made aware of \nall of the options made available to them, not just permanent \neasements. While there are many programs and options available, all too \noften landowners are not aware of these options and will unknowingly \nenter into a contract with the government because they don't realize \nthere are also shorter term options available to them.\n  This amendment will aggregate information for landowners and will \nallow landowners to choose from conservation options that are shorter \nterm and are not a permanent contract with the government.\n  I ask that my colleagues support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, this amendment would direct the \nDepartment of the Interior to create a new education program to educate \nlandowners about conservation programs. It also requires that if the \nInterior Department contacts landowners about selling property or \nparticipating in a Federal conservation program, that the landowner be \nprovided information about the Federal conservation programs available. \nI think this information is already publicly available, so I don't \noppose establishing it as a conservation education program, and I am \nhappy to move this amendment by a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we all want to reduce the flaring of \nnatural gas in oil wells, and to do that we need natural gas gathering \nlines. These are small pipelines that capture natural gas from oil \nwells where it would otherwise be flared off into the atmosphere.\n  This is a bipartisan amendment. I am delighted to be here with \nSenator Heitkamp, who is a cosponsor. This bipartisan amendment \nexpedites the permitting of the gathering lines on Federal land and, \nsubject to tribal consent, also on Indian lands. This is a commonsense \nsolution that helps taxpayers, Indian Country, and our environment.\n  I yield to my lead cosponsor, the junior Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I thank my great friend from the State \nof Wyoming.\n  Many of you have talked about the challenges you have in terms of \nseeing the flaring. If you want to stop waste, whether it is economic \nwaste because of a lack of royalties, both Federal and State, or if you \nwant to stop flaring and waste and do a great environmental thing, you \nwill vote yes on this amendment.\n  What this amendment fundamentally does is shorten the time period for \npipeline easements across Federal land--easements where today it takes \n2 or 3 weeks to get a private or State easement--which takes over a \nyear. During that period of time, we have seen flaring across North \nDakota and across the West.\n  Please vote yes for this amendment. It is a great environmental and \neconomic amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, speaking in opposition to this \namendment, it is basically like Keystone ``light.'' The proponents want \nto have no environmental review of natural gas gathering pipelines, and \nthat is why we should oppose it. With two exceptions, the amendment \nwould require the Secretary of the Interior or Agriculture to approve \nthe right to waive any gathering pipelines, unless they violate the \nEndangered Species Act or the National Historic Preservation Act. It \nwould require the Secretary of the Interior or Agriculture to approve \nthe right to waive with pipelines.\n  I consulted with the Department of the Interior, which had grave \nconcerns about waiving those laws here. This amendment would \nsignificantly limit the Department's ability to gather relevant, \nscientific, technical information, and the public views about how to \nmanage our public lands. So I encourage our colleagues to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. BARRASSO.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require each agency to repeal or amend 1 or more rules \n                   before issuing or amending a rule)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, we all know that our economy is \noverregulated, and this overregulation undermines our ability to grow \nour economy and create good jobs. I am sure all the Senators know that \njust this last quarter we grew at 0.7 percent GDP growth. We can't even \nbreak 1 percent GDP growth now.\n  Take a look at this chart. This is one of the big problems. Federal \nregulations only grow. They only grow year after year. They never go \naway. They are never sunsetted.\n  Even President Obama recognizes this is a problem. In his State of \nthe Union address, the President said: ``I think there are outdated \nregulations that need to be changed. There is red tape that . . . \n[must] be cut.''\n  My amendment is an opportunity to do just that. It is a simple, one-\nin, one-out requirement for agencies. When an agency issues a new reg, \nit has to sunset or get rid of an old reg. Now, it is up to the agency \nto choose which reg it is going to get rid of, but it has to abide by \nthe one-in, one-out rule.\n  This is not a partisan idea. In fact, this is becoming a consensus \nidea.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. The U.K. and Canada are doing this.\n  Many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are very \ninterested in this idea. I ask for their support of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the committee on \nhomeland security, I rise in opposition to this amendment.\n  Our friend who is offering this amendment today indicates that \nFederal agencies are always promulgating regulations, and we never \nstand any of them down; we never retire them. As it turns out, about 5 \nor 6 years ago, President Obama said to Cass Sunstein, who runs OIRA, \npart of OMB: I want you to begin a top-to-bottom review of regulations. \nFind the ones that don't serve a purpose, and let's get rid of them.\n  Over the next 5 years, that effort will bear fruit. It is not like \nsaving a couple of million dollars. Over the next 5 years, it is going \nto save $22 billion. So we actually do have a process, and this is one \nthat has really been provided by leadership from the administration.\n  The other avenue was provided by our Democratic leader from years ago \nwhen he authored something called the Congressional Review Act. It is \nnot always effective; it doesn't always work, but it is actually a way \nto stand down regulations that we don't want to see stood up.\n  So there are two ways to do this. We always have an opportunity \nwhenever regulations are proposed. We can speak to them. We can testify \nto them. We can urge that they be changed while they are in production.\n  I urge us to vote no on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Texas (Mr. Cruz), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. \nGraham), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio), and the Senator from \nAlabama (Mr. Shelby).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Alabama (Mr. Shelby) \nwould have voted ``yea.''\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3176 and ask that \nit be reported by number.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment by number.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S475]]\n\n\n  \n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Schatz] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3176 to amendment No. 2953.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of February 1, 2016, under \n``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, this amendment is based on a very simple \nidea: that there should be a level playing field for fossil fuels and \nfor clean energy. Right now we have subsidies on both the fossil fuel \nside and on the clean energy side through our Tax Code. Periodically, \nwe need to recalibrate our energy policy based on market conditions, \nfiscal circumstances, and what is happening in the world.\n  Again, here is the idea: We should make sure to reevaluate tax \npreferences for fossil fuels and clean energy at the same time. If we \nare serious about creating a level playing field, we should phase out \nincentives for fossil fuels as we phased them out for wind and solar \npower. Majorities of both Democrats and Republicans support the repeal \nof these tax preferences, and so I hope my colleagues will join me in a \nbig bipartisan vote for putting our clean sources of energy on equal \nfooting with their fossil fuel counterparts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we have seen an iteration of this \nbefore. It is Groundhog Day, but there is a difference with the \napproach that has been taken with regard to targeting oil and gas \nproduction with this basket of fossil fuel subsidies, where we are \ntalking about the repeal of five very important tax provisions that are \nvital to our domestic small and midsize operators.\n  The sponsor is correct. It does tie the expiration of these \nprovisions to the expiration of wind tax credits, which most of us \nwould agree should be phased out.\n  I am in favor of reforming our Tax Code to make it more \nstraightforward and fair. I would welcome that discussion for us to \nengage in broad-based tax reform on the Senate floor, but the Energy \nPolicy Modernization Act is not the place to do it. It is not the \nappropriate venue for a tax amendment. As my colleagues know, all \nrevenue-raising measures must originate within the House. The adoption \nof this tax-related amendment would therefore create an impermissible \nblue-slip problem.\n  I urge its rejection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this bipartisan amendment which I am \noffering with Senator Alexander would increase funding levels for the \nDepartment of Energy Office of Science to a rate of 5 percent annual \nreal growth for 5 years.\n  The Office of Science is an incredible organization--24 scientists, \n10 national labs, research in 300 colleges and universities in all 50 \nStates. It was their work which led to the development of the MRI, and \nthey are currently working on imaging systems to identify Alzheimer's \nin its early stages. It is an incredible operation. This commitment \nwill pay us back many times over.\n  I yield to my friend and colleague from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I urge a ``yes'' vote because I think \nan important part of a Republican pro-growth policy is support for \ngovernment-sponsored research. That is how we got 3-D mapping and \nhorizontal drilling that led to unconventional gas and oil. That is how \nwe are going to get the cost of carbon capture low enough to make it \ncommercial. That is how we are going to get solar panels cheap enough \nto make them useful.\n  We should reduce wasteful spending on subsidies for mature energy \ntechnology and double energy research, and this would do that on a \nconservative path. At 5 percent a year, it would take 10 years to \ndouble the $5 billion of energy spending we have today.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, this is the last vote in this tranche \nof votes, and I hope this can be a bipartisan vote. We all understand \nthat a shadow has fallen over this Chamber since Citizens United, and \nthat is the shadow of dark money. The American public is sick about the \nspecial interests that have so much sway. They are even more sick of \nspecial interests having secret sway because of secret spending. This \nsecret spending influences what we can and cannot do. It influences our \ndeliberations. It has even constrained the shape of the very bill on \nthe floor right now. As one Kentucky newspaper said, it has also \ncreated a tsunami of slime in our elections.\n  This vote gives us the chance to push back and to put a little \ndaylight on the secret money that is being spent in our elections. I \nvery much hope that, consistent with past Republican support for \nsunshine and disclosure, we can get a bipartisan vote in favor of \ndisclosure of the big-money donors who are now putting secret money \ninto our elections--in this case, particularly in the energy sector.\n  I ask for the votes of my colleague in favor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I do think that at some point in time \nit is fair to discuss disclosure when it comes to campaign finance and \ncampaign finance disclosure. However what this amendment does is \nrequire campaign finance disclosures from individuals receiving over $1 \nmillion from fossil fuel activities--no other activities.\n  What activities are we talking about? It defines fossil fuel \nactivities as those including ``the extraction, production, refining, \ntransportation, or combustion of oil, natural gas, or coal.'' That is \npretty broad. We are talking about explorers, producers, refiners, \nperhaps even the automotive industry, the rail industry, powerplants, \nand many others.\n  We can have a discussion about campaign finance disclosure and what \nmay or may not be appropriate. We defeated an amendment similar to this \nwhen we had the Keystone debate last January. We tabled another. The \ntime and the place to debate this issue is not in this Energy Policy \nModernization Act. Therefore, I will be opposing the amendment and \nencourage my colleagues to do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nmandatory quorum call under rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the \nSenate with respect to the cloture motions be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the crisis in Flint, MI, is a tragedy that \nwas entirely preventable. This week we have a chance to do something \nabout it. Senator Stabenow and Senator Peters from Michigan have \nsubmitted an amendment that I hope, when we go back on the bill, we \nwill consider. As we do so, it is important to remember that Flint is \nfar from the only town in this country where families face exposure to \ndangerous levels of lead.\n  In Sebring, in northeast Ohio, near Youngstown, we know there are \ntroubling amounts of lead in the water. Families are scared that their \ndrinking water isn't safe. They are afraid they are facing another \nFlint. No parent should have to worry that the water coming out of \ntheir faucets might in fact be poisoning their children. Pregnant women \nshouldn't have to fear their tap water.\n  In Sebring, just as in Flint, families were left in the dark about \nthe safety of their water. For months, local officials failed to notify \nresidents about the lead, and the State EPA failed to step in. I spoke \nwith the mayor. I spoke recently--just this week--to State \nRepresentative Boccieri and State Senator Schiavoni, who represent \nSebring and that part of the county, about what our response should be.\n  The amendment before us this week will help put a stop to the \nfailure--in Michigan, the failure of the Governor, and in Columbus, it \nappears to be the failure of the State EPA. It requires the Federal \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to notify the public directly if there \nis a danger from lead in the water system if a State fails to do so \nwithin 15 days. No more arguing about whose responsibility it is while \nfamilies continue drinking water that we know is not safe. No more \nfinger-pointing after the fact. This amendment says that when there is \na problem with the water, people have a right to know and that it is \nthe EPA's job to make sure they do. The sooner we know about lead \ncontamination, the sooner we can get to work to fix it. That is why \nnotification is critical. But notification is just the beginning. The \namendment before us this week will be just the beginning of our work to \nprotect Americans from unsafe levels of lead.\n  The Centers for Disease Control estimates that at least 4 million \nAmerican households--4 million American households with children--are \nexposed to high levels of lead. We know what that does to their brain \ndevelopment. We know the impact it has for the rest of their lives. \nFour million households in this country have children who are exposed \nto high levels of lead even though we know it isn't safe.\n  This problem stretches far beyond Flint, MI, and far beyond just our \nwater systems. Corroded lead pipes are a major health hazard, but they \nare far from the only source of lead poisoning. We know that too many \nof our children\n\n[[Page S478]]\n\nare exposed to lead through paint--mostly in older homes and mostly in \nlower income homes--and even the dirt in their backyards. Imagine that.\n  The devastating effects of lead poisoning fall disproportionately on \nlow-income children and on children of color. They are more likely to \nlive in older homes closer to the city center and in rental housing \nthat is poorly maintained. I have seen it firsthand in Ohio. The \nCleveland Plain Dealer conducted an investigation last fall. They found \nthat some 40,000 Cuyahoga County children have tested positive for lead \npoisoning in the last 10 years. Think about that--40,000 children in \nthat community alone have been tested for lead poisoning over the past \n10 years and have tested positive.\n  Paint chips shed from molding and windowsills in older homes turn \ninto dust that is easily ingested. Sometimes babies pick up lead chips \nand chew on them because they are colorful.\n  The danger hasn't subsided. More than 187,000 homes in Cuyahoga \nCounty are putting their occupants at risk of lead poisoning. That is \nwhy our efforts can't stop with Michigan and can't stop with lead in \nour water.\n  The good news is, we can combat this. I know we can because we have \ndone it before. In 2012 a number of my colleagues--Senators Franken \nfrom Minnesota, Casey from Pennsylvania, and Merkley from Oregon--wrote \nto the EPA about the danger posed by former lead smelter sites in urban \nresidential communities. I was in one of those neighborhoods and talked \nto people who had seen far too much lead in the dirt where their \nchildren play in front or behind their houses. Because of our efforts \nand some diligent reporting by reporters at USA TODAY, the EPA has \nacted to reexamine hundreds of former lead factory sites, helping \ncommunities address and deal with this problem. Think about this: You \nmove into a home. You didn't know that 40 years ago this neighborhood \nhad a lead smelting plant. Your children play in it. You have no idea \nthat soil is contaminated from that lead smelter that closed decades \nago.\n  We also worked to combat the threat of lead in our children's toys. \nIn 2007 Ashland University professor Jeff Weidenhamer found that more \nthan one in seven Halloween toys he purchased and tested through his \nclasses contained dangerous levels of lead, most of them made in China, \nmost of them painted by companies contracting with U.S. toy companies. \nWho is responsible for that? Surely the Chinese companies' \nsubcontractors that put the lead paint on the toys but certainly the \nU.S. toy companies that contracted with them and didn't care enough or \nknow enough to check the quality of these toys. Following that shocking \ndiscovery, we worked with Professor Weidenhamer and other experts to \npass the bipartisan Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act in 2008. \nWhen Professor Weidenhamer conducted the same test on toys in 2011, \nnone of them tested positive for dangerous levels of lead.\n  In spite of the fact that many people sitting in this body won their \nelections by saying that the government can never do anything good, \nthat the government can never have an impact on our lives, and that the \ngovernment is too big, that is what the government did--we passed a \nconsumer protection bill in 2008. Two years later we found that \ncomparable toys don't have lead paint in them. So we know we can make \nprogress when we work together and strengthen consumer protections to \nensure that agencies tasked with protecting children have the resources \nthey need.\n  We need to take the lead in our water, in our communities, and in our \nhomes just as seriously as lead in toys. It is not enough to just \nrespond to the crisis at hand. We should do that in Flint, we should do \nthat in Sebring, and we should do that in smaller communities in Ohio \nin older homes--all of those things. But it is not enough just to \nrespond. Once children have been exposed, the effects can't be erased. \nWe have to do more to help protect families from being exposed to lead \nin the first place.\n  We did the right thing in December when we funded critical programs \nat the CDC and at Housing and Urban Development that helped prevent \nlead poisoning and monitor lead levels in children, but we can't stop \nthere. We are seeing in Flint, we are seeing in Sebring, OH, and we are \nseeing in cities across our country that current efforts are not \nenough. Senator Stabenow and Senator Peters' amendment is a first good \nstep. I hope we will use this opportunity to examine what more we can \ndo to protect our children, especially those young enough that their \nbrain is developing. Lead poisoning arrests much of their brain \ndevelopment and affects the rest of their lives. We have to do whatever \nwe can to protect our children from the terrible effects of lead \npoisoning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Remembering State Senator Gil Kahele\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, what is aloha? It is not a catchphrase. As \nit is commonly understood, it is synonymous with kindness, with love, \nwith hospitality, with a Hawaiian perspective, but it is difficult for \nthose not from Hawaii to fully understand its meaning and for those of \nus from Hawaii to fully explain.\n  No one embodied the spirit of aloha more than State senator Gil \nKahele, who died suddenly last week. He was a living personification of \nthe idea that we are all in this together, that it really does mean \nsomething to live together in an island State in the most isolated \npopulated place on the planet and the most beautiful place in the \nworld.\n  Senator Kahele devoted his life to public service, but political \noffice for him was an afterthought. Gil was a veteran of the U.S. \nMarine Corps. He worked for the State's department of defense for 33 \nyears and eventually became director of public works at the Pohakuloa \nTraining Area.\n  Gil took office in 2011 and dedicated his efforts to the people of \nSenate District 1. He was the chair of the Tourism and International \nAffairs Committee. Gil was committed to supporting the needs of his \ndistrict and was instrumental in securing funding for the College of \nPharmacy at the University of Hawaii at Hilo.\n  The circumstances of my election in 2014 were unusual in the extreme, \nand they brought me to Gil. On election night, I was ahead by fewer \nthan 2,000 votes, but there were parts of Hawaii Island--two precincts \nin particular--that were unable to vote because of a category 4 \nhurricane that hit the southern part of the Big Island, the Puna \nDistrict. As a result, the day after the primary election day, we \nrealized we weren't quite done, and so we went to Puna. But more than \nthe election not being done, the people of Puna were without water and \npower. Their food was rotting, their roads weren't clear, and they had \nno working utilities. So we went to work--not gathering votes but \ngathering provisions; not walking door to door to campaign but \nliterally standing on the road handing out blocks of ice for the folks \nin Puna. We did this every day for a week, with Gil and the Kahele \nohana, until a sense of normalcy was eventually restored. For their \nfamily, this was just what you do if you are a person like Gil Kahele, \nborn in a grass shack in the fishing village of Miolii, a Native \nHawaiian who served his country, his State, his community, and his \nfamily the best way he knew how--with aloha.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Wildfire Prevention Funding\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, last year more acreage in our forests \nburned than ever before. I know the Presiding Officer understands what \nthis has been like in the West over the last few years. Senator Crapo \nand I have dedicated something like 5 years of our professional lives \nto coming up with practical approaches to deal with this mushrooming \nproblem. There are a whole host of issues that go into making a \nsensible forestry policy to make sure that we can protect our treasures\n\n[[Page S479]]\n\nin the West, have jobs in the woods that are sustainable, and keep our \nforests healthy.\n  In order to do that, one of the most important reforms that are \nnecessary is the one that Senator Crapo and I have been working on. I \nreally began on this before I was the chairman of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee. Senator Crapo and I literally have teamed \nup now for half a decade to end a particularly inefficient and harmful \neconomic and environmental policy that we call fire borrowing. Fire \nborrowing takes place when Congress fails to budget enough money to \nfight wildfires, forcing agencies to raid their other accounts, \nincluding accounts to prevent wildfires.\n  Obviously, there may be some listening in who don't represent western \ncommunities. But what Senator Crapo and I have tried to convey to our \ncolleagues is that fire borrowing doesn't just threaten fire prevention \nand suppression. It is quicksand that is dragging down all of the \nprograms at the Forest Service: timber sales, stream restoration, trail \nmaintenance, recreation, and many more.\n  So Senator Crapo and I said that this was too important to have yet \nanother issue that gets thrown around, batted around like another bit \nof cannon fodder for partisan kind of drills. We have put together \nlegislation with 21 cosponsors in the Senate and 145 in the House to \nend fire borrowing. Our legislation is supported by a coalition of more \nthan 250 groups of anglers, sportsmen, environmentalists, and timber \ncompanies. It is pretty hard to get more than a handful of people to \nagree on much of anything here in Washington, DC. What Senator Crapo \nand I have been talking about now has more than 250 organizations \nbehind it.\n  Despite the overwhelming support for this effort, the bill has been \nstuck. Tonight what Senator Crapo and I are going to talk about is how \nwe can work together with our colleagues to unstick this and to get it \ndone. We felt that all along we had been doing what it took to make \nthis happen. We talked to our colleagues of both parties. We \nnegotiated. We talked to House Members. We talked to Senate offices. We \ntalked to the administration. We talked to timber and environmental \npeople. All we said is that it makes sense, even though there are a \nwhole host of changes that you can pursue for a sensible fire policy to \nend fire borrowing for good, to end the erosion of the Forest Service \nbudget, and to start focusing on prevention. Wouldn't it make more \nsense to concentrate on prevention, going in there and thinning out the \nforests and using sensible fire prevention strategies rather than not \nto do the prevention and have the forests get hot and dry? Then we have \nlightning strikes in our part of the world. All of a sudden you have an \ninferno on your hands, and they don't have enough money to put all \nthese fires out. So you borrow from the prevention fund and the problem \ngets worse.\n  What Senator Crapo and I said is that we will work with all of the \nbudget authorities. We were very much involved with Chairman Enzi in \nthis. We could come up with some budget process issues that would be \nacceptable here in the Senate and also to our colleagues in the House.\n  There was a colloquy last week among the chairs of the Energy, \nBudget, and Agriculture Committees that indicated that they very much \nwant a resolution of the issue. I am pleased that they are interested \nin hearings and working on legislation and moving in February and \nMarch. I felt that this was a promising start to the year because that \nis what Senator Crapo and I were after last July when we got a great \nmany Senators together and we said that we were going to try to get \nthis worked out so that it could have been done last fall. We all said \nthat we were going to get together and get this resolved.\n  Obviously, for a variety of reasons it didn't happen. But I think \nwhat we heard last week strikes me as a beginning to finally getting \nthis unstuck, and I have been so appreciative of working with the \nSenator on this now for something like 5 years. I would be interested \nin the Senator's reaction with respect to this situation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I strongly agree with my friend and \ncolleague Senator Wyden from Oregon. He is absolutely right that we \nhave been working on this for probably 5 years as we have worked to \nidentify the solution and then build the coalition of support to \nimplement the solution that is necessary for this critical problem.\n  I am also very appreciative, as Senator Wyden has said, that we had \nthe chairman of the Energy Committee, the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, and the chairman of the Agriculture Committee engaged in a \ncolloquy last week discussing the urgency of resolving this issue. I \nbelieve we are now getting to a point at which the understanding of how \ncritical it is to resolve this issue has penetrated deeply into the \npolitical fiber of both the Senate and the House. Now we need to take \nthat momentum and continue to move forward.\n  As we take stock of last year's fire season, the statistics are \nsobering. Senator Wyden referenced a little bit of it. Let me just add \nto that a little bit.\n  Nationally, last year, we had 68,151 fires that burned 10.1 million \nacres and cost over $1.7 billion in suppression operations. These fires \naccounted for the loss of roughly 4,600 structures, and, most \ntragically, the lives of 13 wild land firefighters.\n  This set of statistics is a set of statistics that is growing every \nyear. We are seeing more fires and more catastrophic fires every year \nbecause we are not managing our forests properly, and we are not \ndealing with the crisis that is creating in forest fires.\n  There is a very important statistic that I think everyone in America \nshould understand about this critical issue. I just said that there \nwere 68,151 fires in America last year. One percent of those fires cost \n30 percent of the firefighting budget. Those are the fires that became \ncatastrophes. They became catastrophic. The solution we have come \ntogether on to help address this issue is simply to make a very obvious \nconclusion and to put it into the law; that is, when we get a fire that \nis 1 percent of the fires that cost 30 percent of the firefighting and \ndo so much of the damage, we declare that they are natural disasters--\njust like the earthquakes, the hurricanes, the tornadoes, the floods \nand the other disasters that we acknowledge here in Congress and deal \nwith as disasters when we finance the efforts to fight them and to \nrespond to them.\n  With these numbers in mind, I want to again thank the committee \nchairmen who came to the floor last week and engaged in a colloquy to \nexpress how serious this issue is. It is getting to a crisis point. As \nthose Senators last week noted, when it comes to how we fight \nwildfires, we are in a crisis.\n  For more than a decade, as fires have raged across the West, we have \nseriously underbudgeted for the necessary suppression costs with these \ndisasters. To make matters worse, the lack of resources to fight the \nworst of our annual fires has forced land management agencies into what \nSenator Wyden has so ably described--fire borrowing that results in \nless money for the very activities that can prevent the large \ndevastating fires from happening in the first place. What happens is \nour management agencies, the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, \nand those who deal with the wild lands and grasses that burn, have had \nto borrow from all of their other funds so that they can't adequately \nmanage the land. As a result, we end up with more bad fires, and every \nyear the catastrophic fires grow.\n\n  When the Forest Service is forced to borrow to fight fires, they are \nactually borrowing against jobs, recreational opportunities, and proper \nforest management. The best way to think of fire borrowing is less \ntimber, less jobs, and less access to these beautiful lands because \nwhile it is fire borrowing, in many cases it delays the repayment in \nways that actually cancel projects, undercut the ability to implement \nproper forest management, lose jobs, and reduce access to our public \nlands. Perhaps the most destructive is the fact that less work in the \nwoods means that the harmful cycle just gets worse.\n  As Senator Wyden has noted, to address this problem, we have \nconsistently introduced legislation for years now that would treat the \ndevastating fires as the disasters that they are.\n  I need to back up for a second. We talk about the fact that there is \na cost that is not being provided for by Congress and that this fire \nborrowing has\n\n[[Page S480]]\n\nto happen, but I think it is critical to note that our solution has \nbeen scored by both the Congressional Budget Office and by the OMB at \nthe White House as having zero budget impact. It will not increase the \ndeficit because we do end up paying to fight these fires, it is just \nthe way that we end up paying to fight them is the way we deal with so \nmuch of our catastrophic health care--at the emergency room with the \nmost expensive solutions, the worst outcomes, and we don't deal with \nthe underlying crisis.\n  While there is broad agreement from lawmakers on both sides of the \naisle and in both Houses of Congress that a fix to fire borrowing is \nneeded, there have been different approaches to the solution. Senator \nWyden and I have been very willing to work with those who have \ndifferent ideas about how we need to solve this problem and can \nactually make adjustments in our legislation as we move forward to deal \nwith issues and concerns that others have raised.\n  We are now at the crisis point, and now we need to move forward and \nput a final resolution in place. Senator Wyden and I have worked with \nthese lawmakers and will continue to work with them. We are simply here \ntonight to say that we are very pleased to see that the leadership of \nthe critical committees in the Senate and others who are so concerned \nabout this issue are in agreement that we need to put this on the front \nburner and engage with developing a solution and putting it into law.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Wyden, the chairman of our \nEnergy, Budget, and Agriculture Committees, and all the interested \nstakeholders whom Senator Wyden mentioned--250 groups from across the \npolitical spectrum. This is one of those issues in which those groups \nthat so often have different perspectives on how to manage our public \nlands are in agreement, and we need to take this support--the political \nagreement that is taking place and the political awareness of the \ncrisis that is happening--and move forward to the implementation of a \nsolution.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to come to the floor tonight and talk \nwith Senator Wyden one more time about this as we move to the final \nstages of implementing this important legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Idaho, and in \nwrapping this up I wish to convey what the bottom line really is here.\n  Senator Crapo and I do not want to be back on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate in the winter of 2017 once again talking about how something got \nstuck or somebody didn't agree with somebody on one small aspect of \nthis, and as a result fire borrowing is still in place. What Senator \nCrapo and I are saying is we want to work with all sides. It is going \nto have to be bipartisan and it is going to have to be bicameral. Those \nare probably the most important words in this whole discussion. It is \ngoing to have to be bipartisan and it is going to have to be bicameral.\n  We have lots of committees involved. We have the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee that I am on and the Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry Committee, and the Budget Committee that both of us have been \non. We have lots of committees in the Senate, and we have partners in \nthe House who have also played a meaningful role.\n  I would like to think that Senator Crapo and I were able to move that \nbipartisan, bicameral process a fair way down the road at the end of \nlast year, but what we are saying is: Let's now vow, as a body and \nworking with our colleagues, to make sure we are not back here in the \nwinter of 2017 after yet another horrendous fire season and once again \nsaying: You know, this Forest Service practice is a textbook case of \ninefficiency, and we are explaining what fire borrowing is and how it \ndoes so much damage in the forest and to forest health.\n  This is about the betterment of rural resource-dependent communities, \nespecially in the West and around the country. Senator Crapo and I have \nworked together on other past efforts, such as the secure rural schools \nlegislation and the Healthy Forests Restoration Act. We were both \ninvolved in those efforts and they were, in fact, bipartisan and \nbicameral.\n  Tonight our hope is, as a result of this discussion and what we heard \non the floor of the Senate last week, that in fact after more than 5 \nyears of effort on this issue, that this time the Congress, on both \nsides of the Capitol, will come together and will work with the \nadministration. They indicated support for what we were doing last year \nand will indicate support early on for efforts that are bipartisan and \nbicameral. The sooner we can get on with that, the better. That is why \nit is good news that the committees will be starting hearings and \nlegislative consideration shortly, and we look forward to working with \nour colleagues.\n  I yield at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                  Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, on Thursday, 12 countries will sign a \nmassive trade agreement to change the rules for 40 percent of the \nworld's economy, but the Trans-Pacific Partnership will not go into \neffect unless Congress approves it. I urge my colleagues to reject the \nTPP and stop an agreement that will tilt the playing field even more in \nfavor of big multinational corporations and against working families.\n  Much of the debate over this trade agreement has been described as a \nfight over America's role in setting the rules of international trade, \nbut this is a deliberate diversion. In fact, the United States has \nfree-trade agreements with half of the TPP countries. Most of the TPP's \n30 chapters don't even deal with traditional trade issues. No. Most of \nTPP is about letting multinational corporations rig the rules on \neverything from patent protection to food safety standards all to \nbenefit themselves.\n  The first clue about whom the TPP helps is who wrote it. Twenty-eight \ntrained advisory committees were formed to whisper in the ear of our \ntrade negotiators to urge them to move this way or that way during \nnegotiations. Who are the special privileged whisperers? Well, 85 \npercent are corporate executives or industry lobbyists. Many of the \ncommittees--including those on chemicals and pharmaceuticals, aerospace \nequipment, textiles and clothing, and financial services--are 100 \npercent industry representatives. In 15 advisory committees, no one--no \none--was in the room who represented American workers or American \nconsumers. There was no one in the room who worried about the \nenforcement of environmental issues or protection against human rights \nabuses. Nope. Day after day, meeting after meeting, our official \nnegotiators listened to the whispers of the giant industries and heard \nlittle from anyone else.\n  The second clue about what is going on is that it all happened behind \nclosed doors. The U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Froman, says that \nthe United States has been working to negotiate this trade deal for \nover 5\\1/2\\ years, but the text of the agreement was hidden from public \nview until just 3 months ago, and when I say hidden, I mean hidden. The \ndrafts were kept under lock and key so that even Members of the Senate \nhad to go to a secure location to see them, and then we weren't allowed \nto say anything to anyone about what we had actually seen. A rigged \nprocess produces a rigged outcome. When the people whispering in the \nears of our negotiators are mostly top executives and lobbyists for big \ncorporation--and when the public is shut out of the negotiating \nprocess--the final deal tilts in favor of corporate interests.\n  Evidence of this tilt can be seen in a key TPP provision, investor-\nstate dispute settlement, ISDS. With ISDS, big companies get the right \nto challenge laws they don't like, not in courts but in front of \nindustry-friendly arbitration panels that sit outside any court system. \nThose panels can force taxpayers to write huge checks to big \ncorporations with no appeals. Workers, environmentalists, and human \nrights advocates don't get the special right, only corporations do.\n  Most Americans don't think of keeping dangerous pesticides out of our \nfood or keeping our drinking water clean as trade issues, but all over \nthe globe companies have used ISDS to demand compensation for laws they \ndon't like. Just last year a mining company\n\n[[Page S481]]\n\nwon an ISDS case when Canada denied the company permits to blast off \nthe coast of Nova Scotia. Today, Canadian taxpayers are on the hook for \nup to $300 million all because their government tried to protect its \nenvironment and tried to protect the livelihood of local fishermen.\n  ISDS hasn't been a problem just for other countries. We have seen the \ndangers of ISDS right here at home. Last year, the U.S. State \nDepartment concluded, and President Obama agreed, that the Keystone XL \nPipeline would not serve the national interests of the United States. \nIt was a long fight, but the administration, applying American law, \ndecided that the pipeline was a threat to our air, to our water, and to \nour climate and denied the permit, but the oil company that wants to \nbuild this pipeline doesn't think the buck stops with our President. \nNow this foreign oil company is using the ISDS provision in NAFTA to \ndemand more than $15 billion in damages from the United States just \nbecause we turned down the Keystone Pipeline.\n  The Nation's top experts in law and economics have warned us about \nthe dangers of ISDS. Nobel Prize-winning economist Joe Stiglitz, \nHarvard law professor Laurence Tribe, and others recently noted that if \nISDS panels force countries to pay high enough fines, the countries \nwill voluntarily drop the health, safety, labor, and environmental laws \nthat big corporations don't like. That is exactly what Germany did in \n2011 when they cut back on environmental regulations after an ISDS \nlawsuit.\n  Everyone understands the risks associated with ISDS. In fact, the \nissue got so hot over tobacco companies using ISDS to roll back health \nstandards around, the world that the TPP negotiators decided to limit \nthe use of ISDS to challenge tobacco laws. That is a pretty bold \nadmission that ISDS can be used to weaken public health laws.\n  I am glad tobacco laws are protected from ISDS, but what about food \nsafety laws or drug safety laws or any other regulation that is \ndesigned to protect our citizens? Under TPP every other company, \nregardless of the health or safety impact, will be able to use ISDS.\n  Congress will have to vote straight up or down on TPP. We will not \nhave a chance to strip out any of the worst provisions like ISDS. That \nis why I oppose the TPP, and I hope Congress will use its \nconstitutional authority to stop this deal before it makes things even \nworse and more dangerous for America's hardest working families.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to applaud \nthe great work that Chairman Murkowski and Ranking Member Cantwell are \ndoing this week on the Energy bill to get this bill to the floor--the \nEnergy Policy Modernization Act of 2016. They have been leaders and \nhave shown their commitment to developing and advancing what is truly a \nbipartisan bill.\n  This legislation is a result of nearly a year's work on the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee, with four legislative hearings leading \nup to a July markup. There have been many hours put into the base text, \nand we had a strong bipartisan vote to report the bill out of committee \n18 to 4. It is also nice to see Members over the past several days, and \nlast week as well, having the opportunity to amend the bill on the \nfloor--to make it even stronger through an open amendment process \nthroughout this past week.\n  The Energy Policy Modernization Act will mean more energy efficiency, \nmore energy generation, and more jobs in the energy sector. Promoting \nenergy efficiency and clean alternative power sources is something that \nhas been a focus of my service, and I am pleased that I have had a \nchance in my role on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to \ncontinue shaping Federal energy policy in the U.S. Senate.\n  We have before us this week an opportunity to really advance our \nnational energy policy and to think about what our national energy \npolicy means for this country--energy being a cornerstone of our \neconomy and our security. It means more jobs, it means more growth, and \nperhaps even one of the most potent foreign policy tools this Nation \nhas to offer our allies.\n  I wish to take a little bit of time to highlight several provisions \nof the bill that I helped champion and sponsor to get included in the \nbase of the text.\n  Section 1006 would encourage the use of something called energy \nsavings performance contracts and utility energy savings contracts in \nFederal buildings. It is a long name for something that probably \ndoesn't fit very well on a bumper sticker. But what energy savings \nperformance contracts and utility energy savings contracts do is \nsomething very simple. They are tools that will allow innovative public \nand private partnerships to occur, that allow private companies to use \nprivate dollars to make energy efficient upgrades to Federal buildings. \nThe private companies are then reimbursed for upgrades once the Federal \nbuildings' energy costs are lower. So, in essence, we are taking \nprivate sector ingenuity and know-how and private sector investments \nand putting them into Federal buildings to lower utility costs, to make \nsure we are doing a better job of heating or cooling or turning the \nlights on in our buildings, all through private sector know-how, with \nno cost to the taxpayer, resulting in taxpayer savings and, of course, \nthousands of private sector jobs.\n  Last night we had an amendment that passed by voice vote which \nrequires Federal agencies to implement energy savings projects at \nFederal facilities. For the past several years, we have been carrying \nout mandatory Federal energy audits that outline energy savings \nprojects for Federal facilities that are aimed at reducing energy \nconsumption and saving tax dollars, but Federal agencies were not \nrequired to implement these changes. So we were actually spending \nFederal dollars to find out how we can save Federal dollars. Yet we \nwould put that report on a shelf where it could gather dust, and we \nactually didn't implement the taxpayer savings that the reports \nsuggested. We are not talking about just a little bit of savings; we \nare talking about billions upon billions of dollars of savings that we \ncould put upon the Federal Government simply by making the billions of \nsquare feet of office space that the Federal Government has more energy \nefficient--all, again, by using private sector know-how and private \nsector ingenuity, with zero taxpayer dollars involved. This amendment \nthat we added last night would make sure those requirements--those \nfindings of energy savings--are actually put into place. Instead of \njust gathering dust on the shelf, we are going to make them a reality.\n  Section 3002 of the bill would reauthorize a Department of Energy \nprogram for 10 additional years to provide funding to retrofit existing \ndams and river conduits with electricity-generating technology. It is \nestimated by the Department of Energy that there is up to 12 gigawatts \nof untapped hydropower development within the Nation's existing dam \ninfrastructure--12 gigawatts already there, untapped. Right now we \nestimate that only about 3 percent of the Nation's 80,000 existing dams \nare used to generate clean hydroelectric power. If people are concerned \nabout zero emissions and carbon emissions, hydropower is one of the \ngreatest opportunities we have--hydroelectric generation--to produce \nclean energy, a renewable resource and emission free.\n  We have heard from the Colorado Small Hydro Association that there \nare new Colorado hydroelectric projects benefiting from this program \nthat were originally authorized in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. These \nprojects include new small hydro projects near Ouray, Creede, Grand \nLake, and Ridgeway, CO.\n  Another measure I have been working on over the past several years is \nsection 2201, which expedites the approval of liquefied natural gas \nexport applications. I carried this measure in the House where we \npassed it with bipartisan support, and now we are going to be able to \npass it with bipartisan support in the U.S. Senate.\n  When we think about the foreign policy potential that expediting \nliquefied natural gas has for this country and the world, it is truly \nsignificant. We\n\n[[Page S482]]\n\nnow can send to our allies in Eastern Europe and around the globe--\nnations that are currently dependent on energy from tyrannical \ngovernments or governments that would use their energy contracts and \npricing to try to gouge their neighbors or to manipulate markets for \ntheir own gain of an unscrupulous leader--it is a foreign policy tool \nthat the United States can now provide to our allies abundant, \naffordable energy. This bill will allow that liquefied natural gas \npermitting process to be expedited. Nations can't wait to get their \nhands on U.S. energy. The Department of Energy has said that they can \ncomply with the terms of this bill. It is a no-brainer.\n  I also sponsored language in section 4101 of the bill to commission a \nstudy of the feasibility and the potential benefits that could be \nbrought about by an energy-water Center Of Excellence within the \nDepartment of Energy's national laboratories. In Colorado we are home \nto the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. We are also home to some \nof the most incredible waterways our Nation has to offer. We are also \nhome, of course, to the high plains areas of the Western Slope and the \nEastern Plains that need more attention when it comes to how we are \ngoing to develop our energy sources while also making sure we are \nprotecting our water and making sure we are being good conservationists \nwhen it comes to our water. An energy-water Center Of Excellence would \naid in efforts to establish a comprehensive approach for managing \nenergy and water resources in the future.\n  In section 3017, I worked to clarify that oilseed crops are eligible \nto qualify for the same research provisions as biomass. Meeting future \ndemand for energy and fuel will require a variety of sources, and \nscience and research indicate that oilseed crops have the potential to \nplay a significant role. The Central Great Plains Research Station in \nAkron, CO, is researching right now oilseed productivity under varying \nwater availability. Meeting our energy needs in an increasingly \ndrought-ridden area will only become harder and harder. Without the \nnecessary research, we may not have an appropriate response, but with \ncontinued innovation, we will have a great one.\n  Oilseeds can hold the key to providing safe, clean energy that is \nwater efficient--a key for the increasingly drought-ridden West.\n  One of the things we know we have to consider in agriculture, as \nfarmers sometimes face challenging and sometimes historic lows in \ncommodity prices, is to make sure we are finding new ways and new value \nto the crops they can raise. The development of oilseeds, development \nof dryland oilseed technologies is an incredible way for us to bring \nvalue-added opportunities to rural America.\n  These are only a few of the provisions that I have worked to advance \nin this bill, and I wish to thank, again, Chairman Murkowski and so \nmany of our colleagues for including these provisions so important to \nStates like Colorado and the Presiding Officer's State of Montana, and \nfor what we have been able to do in this Energy bill.\n  We are spending this time on energy because it is so important to \nthis country. Why is it important? Because it means jobs. It means an \neconomic foundation. Abundant and affordable energy means the \nopportunity for a small business to open up. It means the ability of \nour neighbors to be able to afford to cool or heat their homes, to be \nable to turn on the light switch when they wake up in the morning and \ngo home at night.\n  Over the past year we have looked back at the work the Senate has \ndone, and really the past year has been a very productive one in the \nSenate for the American people. We have focused on four things in the \nSenate--four corners--something that I call my four corners plan: \nWorking on education, passing a bipartisan education bill; areas such \nas our economy, and providing tax relief to small businesses and people \naround the country; passing a bipartisan transportation bill to make \nsure we are getting goods to and from the market. We have worked on the \nenvironment by passing the Land and Water Conservation Fund. In fact, \nthis bill will address the great program of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, which has benefited all 50 States across the country \nwith projects in every single one. This bill, the Energy Modernization \nPolicy Act that we are working on today, will address the fourth corner \nof my four corner plan, and that is energy. We will hopefully produce \nhundreds of thousands of jobs around Colorado and the country, directly \nor indirectly related to energy development and energy production, \nwhether that is clean energy, renewable energy, energy efficiency, \ntraditional energy, transmission of that energy to and from consumers; \nwhether it is produced in the sparsely populated southeastern areas of \nColorado or the densely populated areas of Colorado's front range and \nbeyond. I hope our colleagues will agree to support and pass this \nlegislation so that it actually continues American leadership when it \ncomes to energy policy.\n  So I thank the Presiding Officer for his leadership. I know in \nMontana this Energy bill is an important step forward because it \nrepresents an all-of-the-above energy policy. I want to thank the \nPresiding Officer for his leadership in Montana, and I also want to \nthank the chairman of the committee, Senator Murkowski, for her \nleadership as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we have been working hard this \nafternoon. I think we had a very productive day. We processed eight \namendments, which was very good for the process we are in. I have \nappreciated Members' cooperation with that.\n  We have been working through the back-and-forth to come up with a \npackage of amendments that we can process by voice vote. It has been \ngood. It has been a little lengthier than we had anticipated, but I \nthink we are in a good place now and I am pleased with that.

Mr. President, I want to take a moment today to recognize \nthe Montagnard community in my State of North Carolina and in other \nplaces across the Nation. I am proud to say that North Carolina is home \nto the largest population of Montagnards in the Unites States and home \nto the largest population of Montagnards outside of Vietnam.\n  Many Americans may not know about the history behind the United \nStates's special relationship with the Montagnards, which is a history \nthat goes back to the days of the Vietnam war. The Montagnards are an \nindigenous tribespeople of the central highlands of Vietnam, and during \nthe Vietnam war, it was the Montagnards who were trained by the CIA and \nSpecial Operations Forces to fight alongside our troops against the \nNorth Vietnamese and Viet Cong.\n  At their own great risk, the Montagnards provided critical \nintelligence support to our troops on the ground, no doubt saving \ncountless American lives. After the war, the United States took in \nhundreds of Montagnards into our country as refugees because of the \nsevere persecution they faced from the Vietnamese Government for that \nvery reason. While this indeed is a long overdue recognition, I will be \nsubmitting later this week a Senate resolution recognizing their \nservice and sacrifice.\n  However, I believe our recognition of the Montagnards should not stop \nat what took place decades ago because even today, in 2016, the \ngovernment of Vietnam continues to discriminate against them for the \nloyalty and assistance they provided to the United States some 40 years \nago. The government of Vietnam continues to persist in its oppression \nof the Montagnards' basic human rights: the freedom to practice their \nChristian faith freely without fear of persecution and the right to \neducation, land ownership, and a decent standard of living. This kind \nof persecution is well documented in the latest human rights and \nreligious freedom reports published by the State Department and the \nU.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom.\n  The United States of America has an obligation to stand up for the \nthousands of suffering Montagnards in Vietnam--some of whom were once \nour comrades-in-arms. I have heard from many Vietnam war veterans in my \nState who can tell you how much their military assistance and \nfriendship had meant to them. We should not look the other way; we must \ncontinue pressing the Vietnamese Government to respect their \nfundamental human rights. With this Senate resolution, we send a loud \nand clear message to the Montagnard people: you are not forgotten.\n  The United States can do better--we must do better--to support this \nmarginalized tribespeople in Vietnam with whom we share a unique and \nhistoric bond.\n  I would ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.\n  Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/02/senate-section/article/S485-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   REMEMBERING DONALD ``BUDDY'' WRAY\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the life \nand legacy of Arkansas businessman and former Tyson Foods executive \nDonald ``Buddy'' Wray.\n  Buddy spent his life building Tyson Foods into one of the world's \nleading food companies. He was equally committed to serving northwest \nArkansas and leaves behind a legacy as a respected community leader.\n  Buddy started his career as a service technician in 1961, working as \nthe liaison for the many family-contracted farms ensuring the health of \nthe flocks. He rose through the ranks of the company.\n  As a regular fixture at Tyson, his dedication led him to become the \nchief operation officer in 1992 and, a year later, the president of the \ncompany, a position he held until his retirement in 2000.\n  His commitment and love for the company led him to serve as part-time \nconsultant, but he returned to full-time service in 2008. Chairman John \nTyson says Buddy was ``instrumental in everything the company did for \nover 50 years.''\n  Buddy was a strong voice for the Arkansas poultry industry, always \nkeeping the needs of the farmer close to his heart. He was named the \nDistinguished Alumni of the Year in 2000 by the University of Arkansas. \nIn 2004, the university established the Donald ``Buddy'' Wray Chair in \nFood Safety within the Dale Bumpers College of Agriculture. His \nexemplary dedication to agriculture was noted in 2012 when he was \ninducted into the Arkansas Agriculture Hall of Fame. In 2015, he was \ninducted into the Arkansas Business Hall of Fame.\n  Buddy truly transformed agriculture and was an advocate for Arkansas. \nMy thoughts and prayers are with his wife of 50 years, Linda; children \nCindy, Scott, Jana; their eight grandchildren; and the rest of the Wray \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/02/senate-section/article/S485-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECOGNIZING MARSH DOG\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, small businesses have the unique \nability to tackle issues in their communities head on through \nthoughtful, innovative solutions. This week I am proud to recognize \nMarsh Dog of Baton Rouge, LA, as being small business of the week for \ntheir commitment to preserving and protecting Louisiana's vulnerable \ncoastlines.\n  In 1998, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries placed a \nbounty on the nutria rat in an effort to curb the reproduction of the \ninvasive species, which has wreaked environment havoc on Louisiana's \nvulnerable coastal habitats. In response to the bounty, businesses \nacross the State began inventing creative ways to recycle byproducts of \nthe rodent.\n  During this time, Hansel Harlan, the future founder of Marsh Dog, \nbecame increasingly concerned with the ingredients he found in mass \nmarket dog food products. After reading about the many recalls and the \nharmful ingredients circulating within the dog food industry, Harlan \nbegan toying with the idea of creating custom treats for his canine \ncompanion. After a few trial runs and on the suggestion of his sister \nVeni, Hansel included nutria rat meat into his recipe, creating an all-\nnatural, eco-conscious snack his dog immediately enjoyed. Harlan and \nVeni, with the blessing of their K-9 taste tester, began developing and \nmarketing the innovative product.\n  Today Marsh Dog enjoys great success and praise from their customers \nand environmental groups across the State. In addition to receiving a \ngrant from the Barataria-Terrebonne National Estuary Program in 2011, \nwhich proved to be the endorsement that catapulted their success, Marsh \nDog was also named Conservation Business of the Year by Louisiana \nWildlife Federation.\n  Hansel and Veni embody what it means to be innovative entrepreneurs. \nThey created a solution for two impactful problems in their community, \nwhile also growing a successful small business, is a remarkable feat \nthat deserves celebration.\n  Congratulations again to Marsh Dog of Baton Rouge, LA, this week's \nsmall business of the week, and I look forward to having my rescue dog \nRanger try your treats.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/02/senate-section/article/S485-4", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S485-S486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING PATTON'S WESTERN WEAR\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, oftentimes small businesses grow \nfrom the humblest of beginnings, providing livelihoods for hard-working \nentrepreneurs and their families. In rare cases, these small businesses \ndefy all odds, building successful establishments that integrate into \ntheir adopted communities, all while supporting local economies and \ntraditions. This week I am proud to recognize Patton's Western Wear of \nRuston, LA, as small business of the week for their perseverance in \nbuilding a solid and successful family-owned and operated retail group \nthat has left its mark across the State of Louisiana.\n  In 2007, Robert, Patrick, and Thomas Patton used their farming \nbackground and extensive experience in retail to open their own western \nstore in Ruston, LA. Catering to the western and oilfield communities \nof north central Louisiana and southern Arkansas, the Patton brothers \nbegan building a reputation for providing a diverse selection of \nproducts and quality customer service. One year later, the\n\n[[Page S486]]\n\nbrothers experienced such success that they expanded their small \nbusiness and opened a second western-style store in Lake Charles, LA. \nIn choosing Ruston and Lake Charles, which lie on opposite sides of \nLouisiana, the Patton brothers have since acquired a loyal clientele \nthat includes everyone from cowboys to college students.\n  Today the Patton brothers manage their small business by remaining \ntrue to their western roots. They are active in the rodeo community, \nsupporting over 100 individual rodeos each year, and have also \nsponsored a bull rider in the National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas, NV, \nfor 4 years in a row. Recognized as a Best of the Delta business, the \ngroup now operates four locations throughout Louisiana, having most \nrecently opened the doors to their newest location in Shreveport in \nJune 2015.\n  The Patton brothers continue to show entrepreneurs across the country \nthat it is possible to turn a passion into a business--even from the \nhumblest of means. Through dedicated service to their community, \nexceptional commitment to customer service, and an excellent retail \nstrategy, the Patton brothers have made their mark across Louisiana and \ninto Arkansas and Texas.\n  Congratulations again to Patton's Western Wear for being selected as \nsmall business of the week, and I look forward to your continued growth \nand success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/02/senate-section/article/S486-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/02/senate-section/article/S486-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA'S FISCAL YEAR (FY) 2016 BUDGET AND FINANCIAL \n                              PLAN--PM 39\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to my constitutional authority and as contemplated by \nsection 446 of the District of Columbia Self-Government and \nGovernmental Reorganization Act as amended in 1989, I am transmitting \nthe District of Columbia's fiscal year (FY) 2016 Budget and Financial \nPlan.
