Mr. President, we begin this week by remembering a \nfailed idea from the past--ObamaCare--and we will end by passing \nbalanced budget legislation about the future.\n  Five years ago today, a partisan ObamaCare bill was signed into law \nover the objections of the American people. It was rushed through in \ndefiance of the experts who warned it would result in higher costs, \nfewer choices, and broken promises for the middle class. And, \ntragically, that is just what we have seen.\n  Millions of Americans lost health plans they were promised they could \nkeep, premiums spiked, deductibles skyrocketed, tax time became even \nmore of a burden, and often a costlier one as well, and for too many, \nfamily doctors and trusted hospitals fell out of network.\n  All we have to do is listen to letters such as Karen's from \nLouisville to know that Americans deserve better than what ObamaCare \nhas given them.\n  Karen was paying $325 a month for her health insurance. But now, she \nsays her premium has spiked to almost $550 a month with a deductible \nwell in excess of $6,000. ``I cannot afford this,'' Karen wrote, ``but \nI do not have a choice. It scares me to think what will happen if I do \nget sick.''\n  That is Karen's story, and it is hardly unique.\n  Every Member in this body should be striving for something better--\nsomething better--than the pain of ObamaCare. And we can. By passing a \nbalanced budget that is about the future, we can leave ObamaCare's \nhigher costs and broken promises where they belong--in the past--and \nstart fresh with real health reform. That is just one of the many \nreasons for Senators who support the balanced budget now before us. It \nis a budget that recognizes serious fiscal and economic challenges that \nare facing our country and works to address them in a commonsense way.\n  Americans know that Washington can't tax away the challenges \nconfronting us, and Americans know Washington can't ignore away the \nproblems confronting us, either. Americans also know that every dollar \nspent on interest for the growing national debt is essentially wasted. \nEvery dollar spent on interest is one less dollar for Social Security \nor for helping those who truly need it or for tax relief.\n  That is why the balanced budget before us is premised on a simple \ntruth--that Washington has a spending problem, not a revenue problem. I \nknow this can be hard for some to acknowledge, but politicians have a \nduty to the American people to simply admit it. They owe it to the \nAmerican people to explain why the kind of budget blueprints we have \nseen from the White House are just so totally unserious. President \nObama's budgets skip the tough choices, keep spending more money we \ndon't have, contain massive tax increases, and never balance--ever. \nThey never balance--ever.\n  Contrast that to the budget before the Senate today. It balances, it \ndoes so without raising taxes, and it is the result of open and \ntransparent committee work led by Chairman Mike Enzi.\n  This budget is another example of the new Senate getting back to work \nfor the American people. It is another example of the new Senate moving \npast failed ideas from the past, such as ObamaCare, and positioning \nAmerica for the future instead.\n  This balanced budget is all about growing an economy that can work \nbetter for the middle class of today and leaving a more prosperous \nfuture to the middle class of tomorrow. It will also provide the \nprocedural tools, via the budget reconciliation process, to bring an \nend to the nightmare of ObamaCare. That is something all of us should \nwant.\n  So since our friends across the aisle have decided not to offer a \nbudget of their own, I would invite them to join us--to join us in \nsupporting the growth-oriented and balanced budget that is before us \nnow.\n\n[[Page S1676]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/23/senate-section/article/S1676-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2016--MOTION TO \n                                PROCEED\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time used \nfor my opening statement not count against the budget resolution time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Affordable Care Act\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as the Republican leader mentioned, it is \nhard to believe that 5 years have gone by since we passed the \nAffordable Care Act--but it is true. It has been 5 years. We recall \nback to that cold winter day when we were able finally to get it done.\n  But to me it doesn't seem that long ago. The memories of what took \nplace to get where we did to pass that are very fresh in my mind. It \nwasn't an easy feat. Presidents going back to Truman and Eisenhower had \ntried to pass legislation dealing with health care, and they were all \nunable to do it. So it was really a great accomplishment that Congress \ncould pass this legislation.\n  It wouldn't be a stretch to say that President Obama risked his \nPresidency by pushing for health care reform. It was really a defining \nmoment for many people.\n  Republican opposition at the time was overwhelming. No matter what we \nas Democrats did or tried to do, there was nothing we could do to get \nRepublicans to join us in giving health care to the American people, \neven though the original health care bill we passed was patterned after \nRepublican proposals. So we worked hard, and we got it done. We pled \nfor help, and we got none. Republicans simply were not interested in \nworking with us to fix our Nation's health care system.\n  Outside the Capitol, a sophisticated and dishonest public relations \ncampaign costing huge amounts of money was being waged against \nObamaCare by political operatives, lobbyists, insurance companies, and \nmany others. We pressed on, and we did the very best we could, and it \nwas pretty good. Was it perfect? Of course not. No legislation is. But \nwhat we eventually passed was and still is good for America.\n  I was very surprised to hear my friend, the senior Senator from \nKentucky, talk about a woman from Kentucky. That is very unusual, since \n400,000 people in Kentucky today have insurance because of ObamaCare \nthat they didn't have before.\n  Five years later, I am very proud of the work we did. I am just as \nproud today as I was when President Obama signed the Affordable Care \nAct into law. ObamaCare is reducing costs, expanding access, and \nprotecting individuals with preexisting disabilities.\n  Look at just a few of the things it has done.\n  Some 16.4 million Americans now have quality health care coverage--\n16.4 million.\n  The United States has seen the largest decline in the uninsured \nrate--probably ever, but we will use just for purposes of \nillustration--in decades.\n  In the last 18 months, the uninsured rate for nonelderly adults has \nfallen by 35 percent. That is stunning.\n  Health care costs have grown at their slowest level in some 50 years.\n  Now listen to this. Patient safety initiatives are keeping Americans \nsafe. Since we passed this legislation, the number of preventable \ndeaths at hospitals and care centers has dropped by 50,000 people. That \nis 50,000 people who are alive today who wouldn't have been had it not \nbeen for ObamaCare. That is just one aspect of the people who are alive \ntoday because of ObamaCare who would not have been otherwise.\n  But for all of the incredible national statistics that are available, \nthe best evidence that the Affordable Care Act is working can be found \nin our homes, our neighborhoods, and our communities.\n  This year in Nevada, ObamaCare is making a real difference in the \nlives of about 73,000 people who signed up for coverage through the \nhealth care insurance marketplace. Frankly, Nevada got off to a really \nslow start because they had a contract in the State with Xerox and they \ndid such an awful job. The Republican Governor of the State of Nevada--\nI have applauded him in the past and I will do it again--was very \ncourageous. He stepped forward and has made a huge difference in \nNevada. Not only are Nevadans getting covered, but they are getting tax \nbreaks, also. Some 65,000 Nevadans who selected a plan on the \nmarketplace qualified for an average tax credit of $242 per month. No \nmatter what standard we use, that is real money in the pockets of \nNevadans who are still recovering from the economic downturn because of \nwhat happened on Wall Street. There are stories just like this all \nacross America.\n  After 5 years, it is as clear as ever that the Affordable Care Act is \nworking. Americans are benefiting from increased health coverage, lower \ncosts, and improved efficiency.\n  Again, 16.4 million Americans have quality health coverage. Since \n2013, the United States has seen the largest decline in the uninsured \nrate in decades. In the last 18 months, the uninsured rate for \nnonelderly adults has fallen by 35 percent. Health care costs have \ngrown at their slowest rate in 50 years. Patient safety initiatives are \nkeeping Americans safe. Since 2011, the number of preventable deaths at \nhospitals and care centers has dropped by 50,000.\n  The ranking member of the Budget Committee is on the floor today. One \nof the great things we do not talk much about in the Affordable Care \nAct is community health centers. The good man from Vermont, the junior \nSenator from Vermont, came to me and talked to me about community \nhealth centers. As a result of his advocacy, we put lots of money--\nabout $11 billion--in the Affordable Care Act for community health \ncenters. It has changed the health care delivery system in America \nsignificantly. We must continue that program.\n  The Affordable Care Act, for all the reasons we have mentioned, is \nsomething that is really important. It is important that everyone \nunderstand how absolutely fantastic it was for the people of this \ncountry. After 5 years, it is clear it is working. Americans are \nbenefitting from increased coverage, lower costs, and improved \nefficiency.\n  I invite my Republican colleagues to accept that ObamaCare is the law \nof the land. Put aside the unrealistic notions of repealing a law of \nwhich 16.4 million people now have health care. Are we going to just \ndrop them, because the Republican plans would just basically drop them \nall?\n  Instead, Republicans should join with us to help even more Americans \nget the help they need. Perhaps, then, 5 years from now Democrats and \nRepublicans can look back with pride, knowing that together we helped \nmake a good law even better for all Americans.\n\n\n                       Reservation Of Leader Time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the leadership time \nis reserved.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I will begin by propounding some unanimous \nconsent requests. I think these have been agreed to on both sides.\n  First, I ask unanimous consent that, for the duration of the Senate's \nconsideration of S. Con. Res. 11, the majority and Democratic managers \nof the concurrent resolution, while seated or standing at the managers' \ndesks, be permitted to deliver floor remarks, retrieve, review, and \nedit documents, and send email and other data communications from text \ndisplayed on wireless\n\n[[Page S1677]]\n\npersonal digital assistant devices and tablet devices. I further ask \nunanimous consent that the use of calculators be permitted on the floor \nduring consideration of the budget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. For the information of Senators, this UC does not alter the \nexisting traditions that prohibit the use of such devices in the \nChamber by Senators in general, officers, and staff. It also does not \nallow the use of videos or pictures, the transmitting of sound, even \nthrough earpieces, for any purposes, the use of telephones or other \ndevices for voice communications, any laptop computers, any detachable \nkeyboards, the use of desktop computers, or any other larger devices.\n  Further, I ask unanimous consent that the initial debate time on the \nbudget resolution be allocated as follows: time until 1 p.m. equally \ndivided between the managers or their designees; 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. under \nthe control of the majority; 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. under the control of the \nminority; 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. under the control of the majority; 4 p.m. to \n5 p.m. under the control of the minority; 5 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time spent \nin quorum calls requested during the budget resolution be equally \ndivided and come off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, last week, the Senate Budget Committee took \nan important first step in helping to change the way we do business \nhere in Washington--by reporting out a balanced budget.\n  This week, we take the next step as the Senate begins debating how \nbest to make the government live within its means and set spending \nlimits for our Nation. But we are running out of time, and unless we do \nsomething soon, our Nation will be overspending nearly $1 trillion a \nyear. Now, that is actually $1,000 billion a year. A trillion dollars \nmakes it sound rather trivial. It is $1,000 billion a year of \noverspending.\n  Hard-working taxpayers are paying attention. In fact, 24 States have \nalready passed a constitutional balanced budget amendment, and there \nare 10 more that are working on it. If all of these States pass similar \nmeasures, we will have 34 States needed for a constitutional convention \non a balanced budget and we will be forced to act as they desire. ``If \nit isn't all of you,'' they are saying, ``it will be all of us.''\n  Well, we are elected to represent our constituents. In the face of \nsuch demands, we should act or someday it will be out of our hands.\n  One of the best ways to balance our budget is to make our government \nmore efficient, effective, and accountable. If Congress does its job, \nwe can have some flexibility and eliminate what is not working, \nstarting with the worst first. Then we can eliminate waste and \nstreamline what is left.\n  But to do this, first Congress must do something it has not done in \nthe past 8 years; that is, scrutinize every dollar for which they have \nresponsibility. Actually, with the billions of dollars we spend every \nsingle year, they will be lucky to scrutinize every million dollars.\n  If government programs are not delivering results, they should be \nimproved; and if they are not needed, they should be eliminated. It is \ntime to prioritize and demand results from our government programs.\n  Through the process of getting the budget together, I discovered that \nwe had 260 programs that have not been authorized. What is an \nauthorization? Well, the committees are the people who are kind of \nexperts or at least have a very concentrated concern over that \nparticular area. They pass the new programs--the details of the new \nprograms: the amount that can be spent on those programs, the way we \ncan measure whether they are getting things done.\n  I discovered that 260 of those programs that we are still funding \nhave expired. Their authorization ran out. One thing that is in those \nauthorizations is some kind of a sunset date; and we have passed the \nsunset date on 260 programs. So what? We are only overspending, \naccording to the authorization, $293 billion a year on expired \nprograms.\n  Yes, some of those programs are absolutely essential. What we need to \ndo, though, is have those committees that have the expertise go back \nand review them and reauthorize them and set the new limits and the new \nmatrix for what they are supposed to be doing so we can tell if they \nare doing their job. Mr. President, 260 programs--one of them expired \nin 1983; a whole bunch of them expired before this century. So we know \nthis will be a challenge for every single Member of Congress. But I \nbelieve we are up to the task because the American people are counting \non us.\n  This week hard-working taxpayers will also get to see something they \nhave been waiting to see; and that is an open and transparent \nlegislative process that will see Members from both sides of the aisle \noffering, debating, and ultimately voting on amendments to this \nresolution.\n  Senate Republicans will offer amendments that will enhance fiscal \ndiscipline, build a strong national defense, boost our economic growth, \ntackle ObamaCare, protect education, and help make our government more \nefficient, effective, and accountable to hard-working taxpayers.\n  What this budget does do. We will also hear people say what this \nbudget does and what it does not do. But here is what this budget does \ndo: It balances the budget in 10 years with no tax hikes. It protects \nour most vulnerable citizens. It strengthens the national defense. It \nimproves economic growth and opportunity for hard-working families. It \nslows the rate of spending growth.\n  It preserves Social Security by reducing spending in other areas to \nfully offset Social Security's rising deficits and encourages our \nNation's leaders to begin a bipartisan, bicameral discussion on how to \nprotect and save Social Security and avoid the across-the-board Social \nSecurity benefit cuts that could occur under current law. It protects \nour seniors by safeguarding Medicare from insolvency and extending the \nlife of the Medicare trust fund by 5 years. It ensures Medicare savings \nin the President's health care law are dedicated to Medicare, instead \nof seeing those changes go to other programs and more overspending.\n  It continues funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program, \nCHIP, and creates a new program based on CHIP to serve low-income, \nworking-age, able-bodied adults and children who are eligible for \nMedicaid. It increases State flexibility in designing benefits and \nadministering Medicaid programs to ensure efficiency and reduce \nwasteful spending and provides stable and predictable funding so long-\nterm services and supports are sustainable both for the Federal \nGovernment and the States.\n  So as we begin this debate this week, it is worth noting that the \nstrong economic growth a balanced budget can provide will serve as the \nfoundation for helping all Americans grow and prosper. A balanced \nbudget allows Americans to spend more time working hard to grow their \nbusinesses or advance their jobs, instead of worrying about taxes and \ninefficient and ineffective regulations. Most importantly, it means \nevery American who wants to find a good-paying job and a fulfilling \ncareer has the opportunity to do just that.\n  There are problems, however, with the family budget. Family income is \nnot growing as it should, and this has dire consequences for our \nfuture. If family income does not grow, it becomes very difficult for \nparents to pay for their children's education and for their own \ntraining needs. Likewise, slow family income growth means less money \nset aside for retirement, health care, a downpayment on a house, and \nmoney to get the next generation started.\n  Because job growth has been so slow since the beginning of the \nrecovery, it is not surprising that income growth has been slow too. A \nlot of people fail to note that when jobs and incomes slow down \ntogether, the real victims are your hopes, your dreams, and your \naspirations. Moreover, these trends of slow growth in jobs and incomes \nare relatively related and recent.\n  Hardly anyone listening to me today would be confused by the term \n``family income.'' It clearly means the cash that families receive from \ntheir jobs\n\n[[Page S1678]]\n\nand their investments. It is the stuff that goes into a savings \naccount, into a retirement plan, into education for the kids, into the \nhousehold rainy day fund. You can count it, and it is tangible.\n  One of the other things I discovered as I was going through this \nprocess is we have some things we call trust funds. I have discovered \nthat you better not trust them. There is no cash in the trust funds. \nNormally that would be investments that can be withdrawn and the bills \npaid. I think if we really were doing a financial statement for the \nFederal Government, we would have to move those trust funds over to \naccounts payable because what is backing them is the full faith and \ncredit of the Federal Government. I hope we can make it so that is full \nfaith and credit. That is why we need to change some of the things we \nare doing right now.\n  Last year, we spent $231 billion on interest. That is on an $18 \ntrillion debt. In the President's budget, that is proposed to go to \n$780 billion. That is more than we are spending on defense, more than \nwe are spending on education, more than we are spending on almost any \nother function the Federal Government does. If $230 billion is 1 \npercent, what happens if we go to the normal rate of 5 percent? Oh, \ngoodness, we only get to make choices here on $1,100 billion. So \nvirtually all the money we have would go to interest--no national \ndefense, no education, no other function that the Federal Government is \ninvolved in.\n  Our overspending is killing us. Yes, there are two ways you can \nreduce overspending. One is to cut spending; the other one is to raise \ntaxes. We are already collecting more money than we ever have in the \nhistory of the United States. So how are we going to solve this problem \nof the interest itself from bankrupting us? This budget is designed to \nput us on a path to do that. It will not solve everything. We have only \nhad about 8 weeks to do what has not been done in the budget for 6 \nyears. So I hope you will bear with us during the course of this \nprocess.\n  I am an accountant. I am also chair of the Senate Budget Committee, \nand we have started the monumental task of confronting America's \nchronic overspending, tackling our Nation's surging debt, and balancing \nour Nation's budget.\n  Incidentally, under the President's budget, the overspending this \nyear is $468 billion. Remember when we used to make decisions on $1,100 \nbillion? If the Constitutional Convention that I talked about that the \nStates are putting together were in place--there are 24 already; \nanother 10 makes it mandatory--we would have to cut 50 percent. We are \nnot able to do that. It was tough enough to balance the budget over a \n10-year period. That is a tremendous task we have ahead of us if we are \ngoing to take care of balancing our Nation's debt and bringing it down \nto where it is a manageable level, where we can afford the interest on \nit.\n  Before coming to Congress, I ran a small business in Wyoming for many \nyears. I served as a mayor in my hometown and then served in the \nlegislature. One of the most important roles I had was to ensure that \nmy budgets were balanced every year. In time, we were even able to \nbuild some rainy-day accounts in Wyoming. So far, there has never been \na crisis so bad that it has rained. It is time to begin this \nresponsible accounting in Washington because while we can lie about the \nnumbers, the numbers never lie.\n  The worst kept secret in America is that this administration is \nspending more than ever and taxing more than ever. The President's \nbudget increases taxes dramatically and still doesn't get us to a \nbalanced budget. In fact, that $468 billion in overspending this year--\nin the 10th year, he projects $1 trillion, which is $1,000 billion \noverspent. It never goes down. It keeps going up. We have to reverse \nthat trend.\n  The Federal Government should spend your tax dollars wisely and \nresponsibly and give you the freedom and control to pursue your future \nin the way you choose. Hard-working taxpayers deserve a government that \nis more efficient, more effective, and more accountable. That should be \nsomething on which both parties can agree because I never heard anybody \nsay they wanted a more inefficient, ineffective, and unaccountable \ngovernment.\n  Runaway spending habits over the past 6 years have created a \ndangerously growing debt because the habit of spending now and paying \nlater is deeply ingrained. Actually, under the President's budget, it \nisn't even paying later that is included. Federal deficits have hit \nrecord highs. We have overspent nearly $1 trillion a year--that is \n$1,000 billion. The more Washington spends, the more debt we owe and \nthe more is added to what future generations would have to pay.\n  Today, America's debt totals $18 trillion. In fact, every man, woman, \nand child now owes more than $56,000 on that debt. The number is \nexpected to grow to more than $75,000 over the next decade unless we \nmake important changes. Yes, that is every man, woman, and child. That \nmeans somebody born this morning owes $56,000 on that debt.\n  Every dollar spent on interest on our debt is another dollar we won't \nbe able to use for government services, for individuals in need, or \nanother dollar that won't be available to taxpayers for their own \nneeds.\n  It is time to stop talking and start acting. Washington has to live \nwithin its means, just as hard-working families do every day. We have \nto deliver a more effective and accountable government to the American \npeople that supports them when it must and gets out of the way when it \nshould. We didn't get here overnight, and we won't be able to fix it \novernight, but we can begin to solve this crisis if we act now.\n  The Republicans put forward a responsible plan that balances the \nbudget in 10 years with no tax hikes. It protects our most vulnerable \ncitizens, strengthens our national defense, and improves economic \ngrowth and opportunity for hard-working families. A balanced budget \nmeans real accountability in Washington and ensures that programs \nactually accomplish what they set out to deliver--which goes back to my \nstatement about 260 programs that have expired that we are still \nfunding to the tune of $293 billion. A balanced budget supports \neconomic growth for hard-working families and creates real opportunity \nfor all Americans to grow and prosper. A balanced budget allows \nAmericans to spend more time working hard to grow their businesses or \nto advance their jobs instead of worrying about taxes and inefficient, \nineffective regulations that drive down their opportunities. It also \nmeans our job creators can find new opportunities to expand our \neconomy. Most importantly, it means every American who wants to have a \ngood-paying job and a fulfilling career has the opportunity to do that. \nThat is what a balanced budget means for our Nation, and it is what the \nAmerican people deserve.\n  Congress is under new management, and by working together to find \nshared ground with commonsense solutions, we can deliver real results \nand have real progress.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Thank you, Madam President. Let me begin by commenting \non a few of the thoughts raised by my good friend Senator Enzi.\n  Senator Enzi says the economy today is not where it should be, and he \nis right. I don't think anybody thinks the economy is where it should \nbe in terms of low unemployment and high wages--no debate about that. \nBut I ask the American people to think back 6\\1/2\\ years ago, at the \nend of President Bush's term, to what the economy was like. At that \npoint, we were not gaining the 200,000 jobs a month we are gaining now; \nwe were losing 800,000 jobs a month. At that point, the deficit was not \nat $480 billion, where it is today; it was at $1.4 trillion. At that \npoint, the stock market was not soaring, as it is today; the American \nand world financial system was on the verge of collapse. So let's begin \nby putting issues into perspective.\n  No, nobody I know thinks we are where we should be economically in \nAmerica today, but anybody who does not understand that despite \nenormous Republican obstructionism, we have made significant gains over \nthe last 6\\1/2\\ years would, I believe, be very mistaken.\n  As we all know, the Federal budget we are working on now is not an \nappropriations bill. It does not provide explicit funding for this or \nthat agency. What it does do is lay the foundation\n\n[[Page S1679]]\n\nfor that process, the total amount of money the appropriations \ncommittees have to spend. In other words, this budget is more than just \na very long list of numbers. The Federal budget is about our national \npriorities and our values. It is about who we are as a nation and what \nwe stand for. It is about how we analyze and assess the problems we \nface and how we go forward in resolving those problems. That is the \ntask the Senate is now about to undertake, and it is a very serious \nresponsibility.\n  Let's be very clear. No family, no business, no local or State \ngovernment can responsibly write a budget without first understanding \nthe problems and the challenges it faces. That is even more true when \nwe deal with a Federal budget of some $4 trillion.\n  As I examine the budgets brought forth by the Republicans in the \nHouse and here in the Senate, this is how I see their analysis of the \nproblems facing our country. At a time of massive wealth and income \ninequality, perhaps the most important issue facing this country--a \nhuge transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top one-tenth of 1 \npercent. My Republican colleagues apparently believe the richest people \nin America need to be made even richer.\n  It is apparently not good enough for my Republican colleagues that 99 \npercent of all new income today is going to the top 1 percent--not good \nenough.\n  It is apparently not good enough that the top one-tenth of 1 percent \ntoday own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. Clearly, in \nthe eyes of my Republican colleagues, the wealthy and the powerful and \nthe big campaign contributors need even more help. Not only should they \nnot be asked to pay more in taxes, not only should we not eliminate \nhuge loopholes that benefit the wealthy and large corporations, some of \nmy Republican friends believe we should protect these loopholes, not \nchange them at all or maybe even make them wider.\n  It is apparently not good enough that corporate America is enjoying \nrecord-breaking profits and that the CEOs of large corporations earn \nsome 290 times what their average employees make--290 times more.\n  It is apparently not good enough that since 1985, the top one-tenth \nof 1 percent has seen a more than $8 trillion increase in its wealth \nthan it would have if wealth and equality had remained the same as it \nwas in 1985--an $8 trillion dollar increase in wealth going to the top \none-tenth of 1 percent. But apparently my Republican colleagues not \nonly do not talk about this issue, they will do nothing to address the \nmassive wealth inequality this country faces.\n  It is apparently not good enough for my Republican colleagues that \nthe wealthiest 14 people in this country--14 people--have seen their \nwealth go up by more than $157 billion over the past 2 years alone. \nFourteen people saw an increase in their wealth of $157 billion, and \nthe Republican budget talks about cutting food stamps and education and \nnutrition, because we are presumably a poor nation. Well, we are not a \npoor nation. We just have massive wealth and income inequality, so that \nthe vast majority of people are becoming poorer but the people on top \nare predominantly wealthy. That is the reality we must address.\n  As manifested in the House and Senate budgets, my Republican \ncolleagues are ignoring a very significant reality, and that is that \nmillions of middle-class and working families are people who are often \nworking longer hours for lower wages and have seen significant declines \nin their standard of living over the past 40 years. My Republican \ncolleagues say those people who are struggling, those people who are \ntrying to feed their families, those people who are trying to send \ntheir kids to college--those are not the people we should be helping; \nrather, we have to worry about the top 1 percent.\n  At a time when over 45 million Americans are living in poverty, which \nis more than at almost any time in the modern history of our country--\nand many of these people are working people, people who are working 40 \nor 50 hours a week at substandard wages--my Republican colleagues think \nwe should increase poverty by ending the Affordable Care Act, by \nslashing Medicaid, and by cutting food stamps and the earned-income tax \ncredit.\n  At a time when almost 20 percent of our kids live in poverty--the \nhighest rate of childhood poverty in the industrialized world--my \nRepublican colleagues think that maybe we should even raise that \npoverty rate a little bit among our children by cutting childcare, by \ncutting Head Start, by cutting the refundable child tax credit, and \nmaybe let's even go after nutrition programs for hungry children.\n  To summarize, the rich get much richer and the Republicans think they \nneed more help. The middle-class and working families of this country \nbecome poorer and the Republicans think we need to cut programs they \ndesperately need. Frankly, those may be the priorities of some of my \nRepublican colleagues, but I do not believe those are the priorities of \nthe American people.\n  Today, the United States safely remains the only major country on \nEarth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a \nright. Today, despite the modest gains in the Affordable Care Act, we \nstill have about 40 million Americans who lack health insurance and \nmillions more who are underinsured.\n\n  What is the Republican response to the health care crisis? They want \nto abolish--do away with completely--the Affordable Care Act and take \naway the health insurance that 16 million Americans have gained through \nthat program.\n  Here we have 40 million people who have no health insurance and the \nRepublican response is: Well, let's make it 56 million people. And if \nyou add the massive cuts they proposed to Medicaid and the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, even millions more would lose their health \ninsurance.\n  Does anybody, for 1 second, think this vaguely makes any sense in the \nreal world? People are struggling to try to find health insurance and \nthe response is: Oh, let's cut 16 million people off of the Affordable \nCare Act and millions more off of Medicaid.\n  While the Senate budget resolution does not end Medicare as we know \nit, unlike the House budget last year, it does make significant cuts. \nFurther, when you make massive cuts to Medicaid, it is not only low-\nincome people who suffer, you are also cutting the nursing home care \nfor seniors. These are elderly people--80, 90 years of age--in a \nnursing home, and one might argue these people are the most vulnerable \npeople in this country, the most helpless people, fragile people, and \nwe are going to cut programs for them.\n  I have talked a little bit about the devastating impact the House and \nSenate Republican budgets would have on the American people, but I \nthink it is equally important, when we look at a budget, to talk about \nnot only what a budget does but talk about what a budget does not do, \nthe serious problems it does not address.\n  Poll after poll tells us the American people, when asked what their \nmajor concerns are, almost always respond: It is jobs, wages, and the \neconomy. That is, generally speaking, what Democrats, Republicans, and \nIndependents respond. It is the economy, jobs, and wages.\n  Despite a significant improvement in the economy over the last 6 \nyears, real employment today is not 5.5 percent, it is 11 percent, \ncounting those people who have given up looking for work and those \npeople who are working part time. Youth employment, an issue we almost \nnever discuss, is at 17 percent, and African-American youth employment \nis much higher than that.\n  What the American people want--and what the Republican budget \ncompletely ignores--is the need to create millions of decent-paying \njobs. I think if you go to Maine, to Vermont, to Wyoming, to California \nand ask people what they want, they would say: We need more jobs, and \nthose jobs should be paying us a living wage.\n  In my view--and in the view of many economists--if we are serious \nabout creating jobs in this country, the fastest way to do it is to \nrebuild our crumbling infrastructure, our roads, bridges, water \nsystems, wastewater plants, airports, rail, dams, levees, broadband in \nrural areas.\n  According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, we need to \ninvest over $3 trillion by the year 2020 just to get our Nation's \ninfrastructure in good repair. When we make a significant investment in \nan infrastructure, we create millions of decent-paying jobs,\n\n[[Page S1680]]\n\nwhich is exactly what we should be doing and what our side of the aisle \nwill fight for, but it is an issue virtually ignored by the Republican \nmajority. Crumbling infrastructure, need to create jobs--they don't \ntalk about it.\n  At a time when millions of Americans are working for starvation wages \nand when the Federal minimum wage is at an abysmal $7.25 an hour, we \nneed a budget that substantially increases wages for low-income and \nmiddle-income workers. In the year 2015, no one who works in this \ncountry for 40 hours a week should be living in poverty. I would hope \nthat is a tenet all of us can agree on. No one should be making the \ntotally inadequate Federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour.\n  Raising the minimum wage to at least $10.10 an hour--I personally \nwould go higher than that--would not only be good for low-wage workers, \nit would reduce spending on Medicaid, public housing, food stamps, and \nother Federal programs by some $7 billion a year.\n  Sadly, when I offered an amendment in committee that called for a \nsubstantial increase in the minimum wage, not one of my Republican \ncolleagues voted for it.\n  Well, we are going to give them an opportunity to rethink the error \nof their ways. We are going to bring an amendment onto the floor to do \nexactly what the American people want; that is, significantly increase \nthe minimum wage in this country, so no one who works 40 hours a week \nlives in poverty.\n  We also need pay equity in this country so women do not make 78 cents \non the dollar compared to what a man makes for doing the same work. \nFurther, we need to address the overtime scandal in this country in \nwhich many of our people are working 50 or 60 hours a week but fail to \nget time and a half for their efforts.\n  I haven't heard--I sat through all of the committee meetings, Budget \nCommittee meetings, I was at the markup on Thursday--I didn't hear one \nRepublican word about the need for pay equity for women workers, about \nthe need to address the overtime scandal, and about the need to address \nthe minimum wage. These are the issues the American people want \naddressed, but look high and low in that long Republican budget, you \nwill not find one word addressing these issues.\n  I can stay in Vermont and I suspect every State in this country, \nyoung people and their families are enormously frustrated by the high \ncost of college education and the horrendously oppressive student debt \nthat many of them leave school with. In fact, student debt today at \n$1.2 trillion is the second-largest category of debt in this country, \nmore than credit card debt and auto loan debt.\n  Does the Republican budget do anything to lower interest rates on \nstudent debt? No. In fact, their budget would make a bad situation even \nworse by eliminating subsidized student loans and increasing the cost \nof a college education by about $3,000 for some of the lowest income \nstudents in America.\n  Does the Republican budget support or comment on President Obama's \ninitiative to make 2 years of community college free or do they provide \nany other initiative to make college affordable? Sadly, they don't. But \nwhat they do is cut $90 billion in Pell grants over a 10-year period, \nwhich would make college even more expensive for about 8 million low-\nincome college students.\n  My Republican colleagues say they are concerned about the deficit--\nwhich, by the way, has been reduced by more than two-thirds since \nPresident Obama has been in office, and we should be clear this side of \nthe aisle is concerned about the deficit.\n  My Republican colleagues are concerned about an $18 trillion national \ndebt, which has skyrocketed in recent years. One of the reasons it has \nskyrocketed is that we went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the \nexperts tell us that by the time we take care of the last veteran, \nthose wars may cost over $5 trillion, and my deficit hawk friends on \nthe Republican side, how did they pay for those wars? What taxes did \nthey raise? What programs did they cut? They didn't. They put it on the \ncredit card. That is how they paid for it.\n  What concerns me very much is that, unfortunately, two wars unpaid \nfor is not enough for my Republican colleagues. In the committee markup \nthey put another $38 billion into defense spending on the credit card--\noff-budget.\n  So I think we should ask ourselves how does it happen that the move \ntoward their balanced budget approach--they want to cut nutrition, \neducation, health care, virtually every program that working families \nneed--but when it comes to defense spending, another $38 billion. That \nis not chump change, even in Washington. That is off-budget--no \nproblem, just add it to the deficit.\n  When we talk about sensible ways of addressing our deficit or \nsensible ways of addressing our national debt, we cannot ignore the \nreality that major corporation after major corporation, in a given \nyear, pays what in taxes--20 percent, 5 percent, 10 percent, zero \npercent. Profitable corporations such as General Electric, Verizon, \nBoeing, and many others have not only paid nothing in Federal income \ntaxes in some recent years, they actually get rebates from the IRS.\n  Can we talk about that issue or is the only way toward a balanced \nbudget to cut programs for the elderly, the children, and the sick and \nthe poor?\n  A report from the Congressional Research Service: Each and every year \nprofitable corporations are avoiding about $100 billion in taxes by \nstashing their profits in the Cayman islands.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENZI. If the Senator needs a few more minutes----\n  Mr. SANDERS. I would be pleased to split the time.\n  I thank my colleague. I will take a few more minutes, and if he has \nmore, he could take the rest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. The point I was making is if we are serious about \nreducing the deficit, it is inconceivable that one does not look at the \nfact that corporation after corporation is paying zero in Federal \nincome taxes. It is inconceivable that we do not recognize that in 1952 \ncorporations contributed about 32 percent of all Federal tax revenue. \nToday, they contribute about 11 percent. It is inconceivable that we do \nnot understand that according to the CRS, each and every year \nprofitable corporations are avoiding $100 billion in taxes.\n  How can we not look at that issue? How could your only approach be to \nmake it harder for kids to go to college or for little children to be \nin the Head Start Program?\n  I look forward to the debate we will be having over the next several \ndays. I suspect there will be a lot of amendments being offered. I \nthink it is fair to say, on this side of the aisle, what the amendments \nwill be saying is that we need to create millions of jobs. We need to \nraise wages in America. We need a tax system that is fair and does not \ncontain loopholes that allow the wealthy and large corporations to \navoid paying their fair share of taxes.\n  We need a budget that says women workers should earn the same as male \nworkers. We need a budget that says we have to rebuild our crumbling \ninfrastructure.\n  I think there will be a lot of very serious debates. I think the \ndifferences between the two sides will become very apparent, and I hope \nthe American people pay strong attention to this discussion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the ranking member for his comments.\n  Madam President, I appreciate the civility with which we went through \nthe committee process and look forward to having that same civility on \nthe floor.\n  Yes, there are some very important things for us to talk about. I \nhave to agree, we need to do some things. The areas that were mentioned \nwere taxes, wages, health insurance, infrastructure, and student debt. \nWe just have a little bit different direction on how to achieve those \nthings, but I am hoping we can find the common ground on those.\n  The budget itself didn't get into specificity on how to do these \nthings because our Budget Committee--while we have people who represent \na lot of\n\n[[Page S1681]]\n\nthose different committees--don't have the range of expertise that the \ncommittees themselves do. So what we tried to do in the budget was set \nthe parameters for them to work in and to find the solutions that would \nwork best within those parameters.\n  We are trying to get this budget done by April 15. That is actually a \nstatutory deadline--it is seldom ever met--and I intend to meet that \ndeadline. That is so the appropriators, the people doing the spending \nbills, can actually get started, so that for once maybe we can have all \n12 spending bills debated on the floor, unlimited amendments, so we can \nget as many of the 100 opinions that we have--it is 300 or 400 opinions \nactually--involved in the decisions on how to best to spend the money \nthe United States spends.\n  The Finance Committee that I am also on is actually dedicated to \ngetting some tax reform done. I think they will do it in a bipartisan \nway. That should eliminate some of the loopholes that have been talked \nabout and also clear up some of the misconceptions there are about some \nof the things.\n  I will conclude by talking a little about deficit, because I keep \nhearing the other side say they have reduced the deficit in half. Yes, \nbut the word ``deficit'' is so misleading. It is not the debt, it is \nthe deficit. That is the amount of overspending in any given year. So \nthey have reduced the amount of overspending by one-half, but it is \nstill overspent by one-half. Every time it is overspent, that adds to \nthe debt. That is how the $18 trillion gets to $25 trillion in the next \n10 years. We have to stop doing that. So I would appreciate it if they \nwould use a different word. Somebody said it is the fiscal gap. Well, \nmaybe ``fiscal gap'' is a better word, but it is overspending.\n  Now overspending can be changed in two different ways: We can either \nincrease taxes or we can reduce our spending on things or we can do a \ncombination of those things. Until we start talking to each other, we \nwon't be doing any combinations of anything, probably.\n  So I am hoping we can have the civility we had in the committee here \non the floor and come up with solutions for America and Americans and \nthe hard-working taxpayers of this country, who are really interested \nin all of these topics and feel we ought to do something about it and \nthat we shouldn't just be taking a lot of latitude and putting in \ndetails that maybe aren't there in the other's provisions. So I look \nforward to the debate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, 5 years ago today, President Obama \nsigned his health care bill into law. Since then Americans have watched \ntheir paychecks shrink because of the law. Hard-working American \ntaxpayers have paid billions of dollars in higher taxes because of the \nlaw. They have had less health care choice because of the law.\n  So what does the President say about all of this? What does the \nPresident say to the millions of Americans who have had to suffer--\nsuffer--through a long list of costly and appalling side effects of the \nPresident's health care law? Well, last week he gave a speech in \nCleveland and he said, ``It's working even better than I expected.'' He \nrepeated the same thing this weekend, saying, ``It's working even \nbetter than I expected.''\n  Has the President not seen what has happened to workers' paychecks \nover the last 5 years? Maybe the President missed an article by the \nAssociated Press last Wednesday. The headline was: ``Health care law \npaperwork costs small businesses thousands.'' The article said, \n``Complying with the health care law is costing small businesses \nthousands of dollars that they didn't have to spend before the new \nregulations went into effect.''\n  The article gives the example of Mike Patton, who has a flooring \ncompany in the San Francisco Bay area. All of the extra ObamaCare \npaperwork is costing him about $25,000 a year. To pay for it, the \narticle said, Mike had to ``cut back on workers' bonuses and raises.'' \nHe told the Associated Press, ``They understand it didn't emanate from \nus . . . They're just disappointed that $25,000 could have gone into a \nbonus pool.''\n  Mike Patton's employees will get less money in their paychecks \nbecause of all the complex and costly redtape of ObamaCare. Is that \neven better than the President expected?\n  People are getting smaller paychecks and they are also paying higher \ntaxes because of this health care law. According to the latest estimate \nby the Congressional Budget Office, ObamaCare will increase \nWashington's spending on health care by $1.7 trillion over the next \ndecade. About half of that is for subsidies in the ObamaCare exchanges \nand about half is to pay for all of the people who have been dumped \nonto a broken Medicaid system. The $1.7 trillion has to come from \nsomewhere, and a lot of it is coming from hard-working American \ntaxpayers.\n  ObamaCare included more than 20 tax increases on things such as \nmedical devices, prescription drugs, and even on the very insurance \npolicies that Washington Democrats said everyone has to buy. Why so \nmany taxes? Why is ObamaCare so expensive? Well, an outrageous amount \nof the money has been wasted over the last 5 years.\n  Just the other day there was another example that came out of \nMassachusetts. There was a Boston Herald article last Wednesday, March \n18. The headline was: ``Health Connector officials spent $170G on \nperks.'' The article talks about Federal taxpayer money--Federal \ntaxpayer money--that was given to Massachusetts to set up the State's \nObamaCare exchange. The article says:\n\n       Massachusetts Health Connector officials behind the state's \n     failed health care website--\n\n  Now, remember, the health care Web site in Massachusetts completely \nfailed.\n\n       Massachusetts Health Connector officials behind the state's \n     failed health care website have racked up more than $170,000 \n     in taxpayer-funded expenses, including a Boston Harbor \n     summertime boat cruise, luxury hotel stays, ``appreciation'' \n     meals for staffers and contractors--and a $285 Obamacare cake \n     commemorating the launch of the Affordable Care Act. . . .\n\n  According to the article, ``the Connector's staff and board members \nscored numerous perks even as they spent hundreds of millions [of \ndollars] to fix the state portal during its botched Obamacare \nrollout.''\n  What does the State have to say about this--about the kind of waste \nand misuse of taxpayer money? Well, the article actually quotes a \nspokesman for the exchange saying ``we were happy to do it.'' Does \nPresident Obama think that kind of waste is even better than he \nexpected?\n  It seems as though the American people see headlines like this every \nday and every day they see more ways the President's health care law \nhas failed us over the last 5 years.\n  Let me cite one more example, and this one concerns one of the ways \nObamaCare has meant less choice for Americans when it comes to their \nown health care. President Obama promised you could keep your doctor. \nMillions of Americans over the past 5 years have lost access to their \ndoctor because insurance plans have had to limit the network of doctors \nthose patients can see. That can generate and create real problems for \npeople trying to use their coverage to actually get medical care.\n  This is about a woman by the name of Pam Durocher from Roseville, CA. \nAn article by Kaiser Health News on February 18 told her story. The \nheadline was: ``Even Insured Consumers Get Hit With Unexpectedly Large \nMedical Bills.'' And she is insured. The article continued: ``After Pam \nDurocher was diagnosed with breast cancer, she searched her insurer's \nwebsite for a participating surgeon to do the reconstructive surgery.'' \nThe article said she did her homework, so ``she was stunned to get a \n$10,000 bill from the surgeon. `I panicked when I got the bill' ''--no \nsurprise that she panicked when she got the bill--``said the 60-year-\nold retired civil servant. . . . ''\n  It turns out the surgeon had two offices and only one of those was in \nthe very narrow network of the insurance plan. The office Pam went to \nwasn't in\n\n[[Page S1682]]\n\nthe network so she got a bill for $10,000. According to this article: \n``Consumer advocates say that the sheer scope of such problems \nundermine promises''--undermine promises--``made by proponents of the \nAffordable Care Act that the law would protect against medical \nbankruptcy.'' It says that, ``Advocates believe a growing number of \nconsumers are vulnerable.''\n  Let me repeat that: Advocates of the health care law, people who \nvoted for it, believe a growing number--now with the fifth anniversary \nof the health care law--are vulnerable. And President Obama said that \nwas exactly the type of situation his law was supposed to prevent. \nInstead, it is exactly the kind of situation his devastating health \ncare law has created.\n  The Obama administration is bragging--bragging--about the number of \npeople covered by ObamaCare. Is this what those people have to look \nforward to? Does President Obama really think that making people such \nas Pam panic means his law is working even better than he expected? It \nmay be better than he expected, but it is a lot worse than what the \nAmerican people expected. It is also a lot worse than what they were \npromised.\n  As a doctor who has practiced medicine for 25 years, I know Americans \nhave always wanted affordable care instead of expensive Washington-\nmandated coverage. The American people expected health care reform to \ngive them the care they need, from a doctor they choose, at lower cost. \nFive years ago too many Americans were paying higher premiums. Here we \nare 5 years later and Americans are paying even higher premiums and \nfinding it harder to see their doctor. This isn't what President Obama \npromised and it is not what the American people deserve.\n  In the coming months the Supreme Court will rule on whether the \nPresident violated his own law with an unauthorized spending and taxing \nscheme. This will be a major blow to a law that has failed Americans \nfor more than 5 years and will be an opportunity to finally focus on \naffordable health care. Republicans are committed to helping the \nmillions of Americans who have been hurt by this law. We are working on \na plan that will deliver freedom, flexibility, and choice to Americans.\n\n  Five years later, the law has been bad for patients, it has been bad \nfor providers, and it has been terrible for the American taxpayers. \nThis anniversary today is not a cause for celebration. It is a call for \naction.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the following articles from the Boston Herald, the Associated \nPress, and Kaiser Health News.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Boston Herald, March 18, 2015]\n\n            Health Connector Officials Spent $170G on Perks\n\n             (By Chris Cassidy, Erin Smith and Matt Stout)\n\n       Massachusetts Health Connector officials behind the state's \n     failed health care website have racked up more than $170,000 \n     in taxpayer-funded expenses, including a Boston Harbor \n     summertime boat cruise, luxury hotel stays, ``appreciation'' \n     meals for staffers and contractors--and a $285 Obamacare cake \n     commemorating the launch of the Affordable Care Act, a Herald \n     review has found.\n       Under the Patrick administration, the Connector's staff and \n     board members scored numerous perks even as they spent \n     hundreds of millions to fix the state portal during its \n     botched Obamacare rollout. Among them:\n       $553 for a harbor cruise for an employee celebration in \n     September 2013, part of a $1,495 total expense item that also \n     covered costs for Sam LaGrassa's sandwiches and Lizzy's Ice \n     Cream.\n       A $236 one-night stay at the Palms Hotel in Miami, which \n     bills itself as a beachside oasis with ``spa-inspired'' \n     bathrooms, an on-site spa and ``impressive views of the \n     ocean,'' plus $944 in stays at Nine Zero and Millennium \n     Bostonian, and $352 at the Omni Parker House.\n       A $285 Obamacare cake in October 2013, and thousands for \n     employee ``appreciation'' desserts and catered meals for \n     staffers and contractors, including a $236 ``cookie tray'' \n     from Metro Catering, $298 for Lizzy's Homemade Ice Cream, \n     $134 for pastries from Fratelli's Pastry Shop and an \n     unspecified amount from Dandy Donuts for call-center \n     employees in Illinois.\n       About $20,400 in parking costs that officials say the \n     state's taxpayer-funded Medicaid program will ultimately \n     cover.\n       All told, Connector officials ran up $171,030 in expenses \n     in the 19 months from July 2013 through January 2015, the \n     review found.\n       Connector spokesman Jason Lefferts defended the expenses, \n     noting they also include trips to Maryland and Washington, \n     D.C., to meet with Obama administration officials at an \n     important time in the relaunch of the website.\n       ``We found the right path and we got a website that \n     worked,'' said Lefferts. ``In terms of the food and the \n     appreciation, obviously not just for staff here, but for the \n     vendors that worked for us and the navigators that were \n     helpful to us. If we bought them a bagel or a sandwich in \n     appreciation, we were happy to do it.''\n       From the start, the Connector's Obamacare portal was \n     plagued by embarrassing glitches that, among other things, \n     blocked people with hyphenated last names from signing up for \n     plans, and forced others to falsely claim to be prison \n     inmates or mental patients before they could finish their \n     applications. Others complained about frequent computer \n     crashes and long waits on the phone.\n       Travel costs for board members to attend meetings also ran \n     high, the review found. Former board member Ian Duncan--a \n     University of California at Santa Barbara professor--was \n     reimbursed $16,584 for travel.\n       Board member Lou Malzone, who lives on Cape Cod, expensed \n     $11,196 for travel and hotels. Malzone chalked up the costs \n     to times he stays overnight ahead of a board meeting, instead \n     of making the 75-mile, one-way trip to and from the Cape.\n       ``You tell me if you can find (a hotel) for under $200 or \n     $300 a night in Boston,'' Malzone said.\n       Other larger expense reports, he said--including at least \n     four that topped $1,000--are from times he was out of town on \n     business or vacation and flew back for a board meeting.\n       ``I have a pretty good attendance record,'' he said, \n     estimating he's missed just four meetings over nine years. \n     ``If you're out of town and there's a business meeting, I go \n     back, rather than do conference calls.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Associated Press, March 18, 2015]\n\n       Health Care Law Paperwork Costs Small Businesses Thousands\n\n                        (By Joyce M. Rosenberg)\n\n       New York.--Complying with the health care law is costing \n     small businesses thousands of dollars that they didn't have \n     to spend before the new regulations went into effect.\n       Brad Mete estimates his staffing company, Affinity \n     Resources, will spend $100,000 this year on record-keeping \n     and filing documents with the government. He's hired two \n     extra staffers and is spending more on services from its \n     human resources provider.\n       The Affordable Care Act, which as of next Jan. 1 applies to \n     all companies with 50 or more workers, requires owners to \n     track staffers' hours, absences and how much they spend on \n     health insurance. Many small businesses don't have the human \n     resources departments or computer systems that large \n     companies have, making it harder to handle the paperwork. On \n     average, complying with the law costs small businesses more \n     than $15,000 a year, according to a survey released a year \n     ago by the National Small Business Association.\n       ``It's a horrible hassle,'' says Mete, managing partner of \n     the Miami-based company.\n       But there are some winners. Some companies are hiring \n     people to take on the extra work and human resources \n     providers and some software developers are experiencing a \n     bump in business.\n       Companies must track workers' hours according to rules \n     created by the IRS to determine whether a business is \n     required to offer health insurance to workers averaging 30 \n     hours a week, and their dependents. Companies may be \n     penalized if they're subject to the law and don't offer \n     insurance.\n       Businesses must also track the months an employee is \n     covered by insurance, and the cost of premiums so the \n     government can decide if the coverage is affordable under the \n     law.\n       Many companies have separate software for payroll, \n     attendance and benefits management and no easy way to combine \n     data from all of them, says John Haslinger, a vice president \n     at ADP Benefits Outsourcing Consulting. And early next year, \n     employers must complete IRS forms using information from \n     these different sources. The process is more complex for \n     businesses with operations in different states.\n       Mike Patton's health insurance broker is handling the extra \n     administrative chores for his San Francisco Bay-area flooring \n     company DSB Plus, but he's paying for it through higher \n     premiums--about $25,000 a year.\n       To pay for the extra services the business is getting from \n     his broker, Patton cut back on workers' bonuses and raises.\n       ``They understand it didn't emanate from us,'' Patton says. \n     ``They're just disappointed that $25,000 could have gone into \n     a bonus pool.''\n       That kind of spending has led to a surge in business for \n     payroll providers, human resources consultants and health \n     insurance brokers that track hours and keep records for small \n     businesses, and even file documents with the government.\n       Sales have more than doubled in the last year at human \n     resources provider Engage PEO. Many of its clients are small \n     companies.\n       ``They want to comply with the law and don't want to be \n     subject to an unintended\n\n[[Page S1683]]\n\n     penalty,'' says Dorothy Miraglia King, executive vice \n     president of the St. Petersburg, Florida-based company.\n       Businessolver, a company whose primary business is creating \n     software to help companies administer benefits, also reports \n     an uptick in demand. In 2013, when clients started becoming \n     aware of the law's paperwork requirements, they asked for \n     software that could take care of all their needs, says Rae \n     Shanahan, a human resources executive at the West Des Moines, \n     Iowa, company.\n       ``The traditional systems that people have can't handle \n     it,'' she says.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From Kaiser Health News, Feb. 18, 2015]\n\n  Even Insured Consumers Get Hit With Unexpectedly Large Medical Bills\n\n                           (By Julie Appleby)\n\n       After Pam Durocher was diagnosed with breast cancer, she \n     searched her insurer's website for a participating surgeon to \n     do the reconstructive surgery.\n       Having done her homework, she was stunned to get a $10,000 \n     bill from the surgeon.\n       ``I panicked when I got that bill,'' said the 60-year-old \n     retired civil servant who lives near Roseville, Calif.\n       Like Durocher, many consumers who take pains to research \n     which doctors and hospitals participate in their plans can \n     still end up with huge bills.\n       Sometimes, that's because they got incorrect or incomplete \n     information from their insurer or health-care provider. \n     Sometimes, it's because a physician has multiple offices, and \n     not all are in network, as in Durocher's case. Sometimes, \n     it's because a participating hospital relies on out-of-\n     network doctors, including emergency room physicians, \n     anesthesiologists and radiologists.\n       Consumer advocates say the sheer scope of such problems \n     undermine promises made by proponents of the Affordable Care \n     Act that the law would protect against medical bankruptcy.\n       ``It's not fair and probably not legal that consumers be \n     left holding the bag when an out-of-network doctor treats \n     them,'' said Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and \n     Lee University. Jost said it's a different matter if a \n     consumer knowingly chooses an out-of-network doctor.\n       Durocher learned only after getting her surgeon's bill that \n     just one of his two offices participated in her plan and she \n     had chosen the wrong one. She said the doctor's staff later \n     insisted that they had raised the issue during her initial \n     consultation, but she doesn't recall that, possibly because \n     she was distracted by her cancer diagnosis.\n       Adding insult to injury, insurers are not required to count \n     out-of-network charges toward the federal health law's annual \n     limit on how much of their medical costs patients can be \n     asked to pay out of their own pockets.\n       Efforts by doctors, hospitals and other health providers to \n     charge patients for bills not covered by their insurers are \n     called ``balance billing.'' The problem pre-dates the federal \n     health law and has long been among the top complaints filed \n     with state insurance regulators.\n       Because the issue is complex and pits powerful rivals \n     against one another--among them, hospitals, doctors and \n     insurers--relatively few states have addressed it. What laws \n     do exist are generally limited to specific situations, such \n     as emergency room care, or certain types of insurance plans, \n     such as HMOs.\n       The federal health law largely sidesteps the issue as well. \n     It says insurers must include coverage for emergency care and \n     not charge policyholders higher copayments for ER services at \n     non-network hospitals, because patients can't always choose \n     where they go. While the insurer will pay a portion of the \n     bill, in such cases, doctors or hospitals may still bill \n     patients for the difference between that payment and their \n     own charges.\n       That means that in spite of having insurance, a consumer \n     involved in a car wreck and taken to a non-network hospital \n     might receive additional bills, not just from the hospital, \n     but from the radiologist who read his X-rays, the surgeon who \n     repaired his broken leg and the laboratory that processed his \n     blood tests.\n\n\n                         Networks Get Narrower\n\n       Advocates believe a growing number of consumers are \n     vulnerable to balance billing as insurance networks grow \n     smaller in the bid to hold down costs.\n       For example, there were no in-network emergency room \n     physicians or anesthesiologists in some of the hospitals \n     participating in plans offered by three large insurers in \n     Texas in 2013 and 2014, according to a survey of state data \n     by the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a Texas advocacy \n     group.\n       Smaller networks are also becoming more common in employer-\n     based insurance: About 23 percent of job-based plans had so-\n     called ``narrow networks'' in 2012, up from 15 percent in \n     2007, according to a May report from the Urban Institute and \n     Georgetown University Center on Health Insurance Reforms.\n       To protect consumers, advocacy groups, including Consumers \n     Union and the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, \n     want regulators to strictly limit balance billing when an \n     insured person gets care in a medical facility that is part \n     of an insurer's network.\n       ``Without protection from balance billing, the cost of out-\n     of-network care can be overwhelming,'' wrote Consumers Union \n     in a recent letter to the National Association of Insurance \n     Commissioners (NAIC), which is updating a model law that \n     states could adopt to regulate insurance networks.\n       NAIC'S current draft does not directly address the issue of \n     balance billing and consumer efforts have drawn sharp \n     opposition from insurers, hospitals and doctors.\n       Some states have taken other steps to protect consumers:\n       Earlier this month, California set out new rules requiring \n     some insurers to provide accurate lists of medical providers \n     in their networks.\n       New Jersey specifies that insurers guarantee that certain \n     providers be available ``within 20 miles or 30 minutes \n     average driving time.''\n       Colorado insurers must pay non-network medical providers \n     their full charges, not discounted network rates, for care at \n     in-network hospitals.\n       In Maryland, insurers must pay for ``covered services,'' \n     which includes emergency care, but the state sets \n     standardized payment rates.\n       Starting in April, New Yorkers won't face extra bills for \n     out-of-network emergency care, when an in-network provider is \n     unavailable or when they aren't told ahead of time that they \n     may be treated by a non-participating provider. Instead, the \n     bills must be settled in arbitration between the providers \n     and the insurance companies.\n\n\n                            Cost Trade-Offs\n\n       Insurers defend the move to smaller networks of doctors and \n     hospitals as a way to provide the low-cost plans that \n     consumers say they want. Since insurers can no longer reject \n     enrollees with health problems or charge them more, the plans \n     are using the tools left to them to reduce costs.\n       If regulators required them to fully cover charges by out-\n     of-network doctors, that could reduce ``incentives for \n     providers to participate in networks'' and make it harder to \n     have adequate networks, America's Health Insurance Plans, the \n     insurers' trade group, and the Blue Cross Blue Shield \n     Association wrote in a joint letter to the NAIC.\n       It would also raise premiums.\n       Instead, AHIP says, states could require out-of-network \n     doctors to accept a benchmark payment from insurers, perhaps \n     what Medicare pays, rather than balance billing patients.\n       Physicians, meanwhile, blame insurers for inadequate \n     networks.\n       ``It is the limited coverage, not the physician bill, which \n     is the cause of the unfairness,'' the Texas Medical \n     Association wrote to the NAIC.\n       At the very least, doctors and hospitals say insurers need \n     to do a better job of educating policyholders that their \n     plans may not cover care provided by some doctors and \n     hospitals.\n       ``There's no `free' anywhere,'' said Lee Spangler, vice \n     president of medical economics with the Texas Medical \n     Association. ``You either pay for the coverage through \n     premiums, or you pay for service when you receive it.''\n       Doctors choose whether to balance bill, he added--and some \n     don't.\n       But he noted that patients ``have received professional \n     services in the expectation that they will get alleviation of \n     what ailed them, and the physicians provided it in the \n     expectation they would be paid. There's no in between,'' \n     Spangler said.\n       For patients like Durocher, who got billed even after doing \n     everything she was told, the only recourse is to negotiate \n     with the physician or hospital to ask them to lower or drop \n     the charges.\n       ``Fortunately for me,'' Durocher said, ``this doctor was \n     very nice and wrote off almost $7,000 of the bill.''\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, today marks the fifth anniversary of the \nsigning of the so-called Affordable Care Act. Of course, few people are \nactually celebrating.\n  Five years--that is a long time, more than long enough for us to \nevaluate the impact of the law to determine if it is working. On that \nquestion, I think the answer is clear: The President's health care law \nis not working--not even close.\n  Most Americans recognize this. They have seen how the law has failed \nto deliver on the many promises that were made at the time it was \npassed, and they want a change. I will have more to say on the change \nin just a few minutes. For now, I would like to take some time to talk \nabout the lessons we have learned over the last 5 years.\n  If we think back to 2009 and early 2010, when ObamaCare was being \ndebated in Congress, we will remember a number of promises that the law \nwould actually reduce the cost of health care in this country. Those \nwere big promises. After all, costs represent the biggest barrier to \nhealth care in the\n\n[[Page S1684]]\n\nUnited States and are, by almost all accounts, the top concern for \nhealth care consumers. We simply cannot adequately reform health care \nwithout reducing costs, and on that count alone ObamaCare is a \nmiserable failure.\n  For example, under the law, we have seen premium hikes. Studies have \nshown the health care law increased costs in the individual insurance \nmarket by as much as 50 percent in 2014 alone. This year, we have \nalready seen a 4-percent increase for benchmark plans in the health \ninsurance exchanges. Moreover, a recent report by Avalere Health found \npremiums in the most popular exchange plans increased by an average of \n10 percent in 2015.\n  In addition to these spikes, which some might try to write off as \nisolated, premiums have increased faster overall under ObamaCare. \nAccording to a recent report by the National Bureau of Economic \nResearch, 2014 premiums in the nongroup health insurance market grew by \n24.4 percent, on average, compared to what they would have been had the \nlaw never been passed.\n  Looking to the future, costs are projected to continue going up. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, premiums will increase by \nabout 6 percent per year over the next 10 years. This increase can be \nattributed to a number of factors, including high demand for expensive \nmedical care, higher provider rates as enrollment increases, \nuncertainty created by haphazard regulatory changes under ObamaCare, \nand the failure of the plans to attract enough young and healthy \nconsumers.\n  Of course, none of these increased costs are surprising. Despite the \npromises made by the President and his allies in Congress that \nObamaCare would actually reduce costs, numerous studies and projections \nindicated that costs would be on the rise after the law was \nimplemented. Indeed, those of us who opposed the law have been noting \nthis almost nonstop for the last 5 years.\n  As we can see, the President's health care law is a failure on its \nown terms. The law is named the ``Affordable Care Act.'' The promise to \nreduce the cost of health care is right there in the name, and, by any \nmeasure, the law has failed to live up to this promise.\n  Of course, the failure to bring down costs isn't the only problem we \nhave seen with regard to ObamaCare. Another major problem is the lack \nof security and failed oversight of the online marketplace, which has \nput consumers' personal information at risk of fraud or theft.\n  It started with a lack of preparation. Two government watchdogs--the \nGAO and HHS Office of Inspector General--found that healthcare.gov was \ngiven a green light to launch, even though it was not adequately \nsecure. It continued with weak security.\n  Shortly after the launch of the exchanges, GAO found security \nproblems in State computer systems that link to the Federal network and \nwarned ``increased and unnecessary risks remain of unauthorized access, \ndisclosure, or modification of information collected and maintained by \nHealthCare.gov.''\n  CMS did take action to lower those risks, but even with those changes \nin place, the HHS OIG--Office of Inspector General--remained concerned \nabout security issues, including the use of encryption technology that \ndid not meet government standards.\n  I was one of the first Members of Congress to note these security \nproblems, and I introduced legislation to address some of them. Sadly, \nwith the Democrats in charge of the Senate, the legislation did not go \nanywhere, and the results were predictable.\n  In late 2013 and early 2014, cyber security experts warned the \nhealthcare.gov Web site was vulnerable to hacking, and, sure enough, in \nJuly of last year, the site was hacked, resulting in the upload of \nmalicious code.\n  These security problems are a prime example of how careless and \nhaphazard the Obama administration has been as it has tried to \nimplement the Affordable Care Act. Sadly, there are even more examples, \nmany of which directly impact the lives and livelihoods of the American \npeople.\n  As this tax session has commenced, we have seen how the health care \nlaw--and the administration's poor management of it--has resulted in \nfrustration and delay for hard-working taxpayers. Let's talk about that \nfrustration.\n  According to H Block, in the first 6 weeks of this tax-filing \nseason, 52 percent of customers who enrolled in insurance through the \nState or Federal exchanges had to repay a portion of the advanced \npremium tax credit they received under ObamaCare. That same report \nfound that individuals, on average, are having to repay about $530, \nwhich is decreasing their tax refunds by an average of roughly 17 \npercent.\n  Now let's talk about delay.\n  On February 20, 2015, the Obama administration announced that due to \nan error in the health care law, they sent out about 800,000 incorrect \ntax statements relating to form 1095-A, meaning that hundreds of \nthousands of Americans may be seeing delays in their tax refunds this \nyear.\n  These are just some of the problems hard-working taxpayers are facing \nas they try to deal with ObamaCare during this tax season.\n  While the ramifications to taxpayers are significant, the overall \nimpact on America's budget is even greater. The total overall cost of \nObamaCare so far has numbered in the tens of billions of dollars, and \nwe are barely through the first phases of implementation.\n  In numerous areas, taxpayers have been left on the hook for funds \nthat were doled out for ObamaCare to States, corporations, and \ncontractors with little or no accountability. Unfortunately, a \nsignificant portion of that money resulted in no benefit whatsoever to \nthe taxpayers.\n  Last week, the Finance Committee held a hearing on the anniversary of \nObamaCare, where I noted five specific misuses of taxpayer funds that \nhave resulted from ObamaCare. In just these five areas, roughly $5.7 \nbillion went to projects that added absolutely no value. Those examples \nof wasteful spending bear repeating.\n  No. 1, failed State exchanges. According to CRS--the bipartisan \nCongressional Research Service--$1.3 billion in taxpayer funds have \nbeen spent on State exchanges that failed and were never operational.\n  No. 2, consumer-oriented and operated plans or co-ops. CMS has loaned \n$2.4 billion to 24 co-ops, one of which failed before it enrolled \nanyone. When all is said and done, nearly half of this money will be \nlost due to defaults or artificially low interest rates, and CMS has no \nplans to recoup any of these funds, meaning a total cost to taxpayers \nof around $1 billion.\n  No. 3, healthcare.gov Web site. The failures of the Federal insurance \nmarketplace are well documented. Despite fixes that eventually came to \nthe Web site, the total cost of the failed enrollment system surpassed \n$2 billion.\n  No. 4, Serco. This contractor was awarded $1.2 billion to manage \npaper applications during the first enrollment period of the health \ncare law. Of course, very few of the applications received were on \npaper, and Serco employees had little to do. One former employee felt \nashamed after leaving the company and reached out to the St. Louis \nPost-Dispatch, saying:\n\n       I feel guilty for working there as long as I did. It was \n     like I was stealing money from people.\n\n  No. 5, marketplace navigators. The administration has spent over $120 \nmillion on the Navigator Program for the 2014 and 2015 open enrollment \nperiods. With enrollment in the exchanges surpassing 11 million \nindividuals, the efficacy of the Navigator Program has yet to be \ndetermined. The overall value of the Navigator Program is, at best, \ninconclusive, and, at worst, it represents more wasted taxpayer \ndollars.\n  These are just five examples of the misguided, poorly defined, and \nimproperly managed aspects of the health care law. There are, of \ncourse, many others.\n  Finally, there are the unilateral changes the administration has made \nto delay, extend or modify elements of the Affordable Care Act without \naction or even input from Congress. I have been on the floor a number \nof times to talk about the overreach on the part of the administration \nwhen it comes to implementing ObamaCare, so I will not go into \nexcruciating detail today.\n  We all know those abuses have taken place. It is no secret. Without \nstatutory authority, the administration twice delayed the employer \nmandate. They created a transition period out of thin air so the \nPresident could pretend that his promise that ``if you like your health \ncare plan, you can keep it'' was not a lie. There have been numerous\n\n[[Page S1685]]\n\nother exemptions and special enrollment periods created to help the \nadministration avoid negative fallout from patients and the business \ncommunity--and it wasn't true that ``if you like your health care plan, \nyou can keep it.''\n  All told, the Obama administration has made literally dozens of \nunilateral changes to the health care law, apparently recognizing that, \nas drafted, the law is as problematic as its critics have said.\n  I could go on, but I think I have sufficiently made some of the \npoints that need to be made. The so-called Affordable Care Act is, by \nany objective measure, a dismal failure. While its proponents continue \nto cherry-pick favorable data points in order to fool the American \npeople into thinking the law works, the majority of us know the truth: \nIt is time for a change.\n  It is no secret that I support a complete repeal of the President's \nhealth care law, but a simple repeal isn't good enough. We need to \nreplace ObamaCare with health care reforms that will actually work.\n  That is why I have joined my colleagues Senator Burr and Chairman \nUpton of the House Energy and Commerce Committee in unveiling the \nPatient CARE Act, a legislative proposal that will actually reduce the \ncosts of health care in this country, while giving people more rights \nto choose what kind of health care for which they want to pay money.\n  Our proposal is a serious, workable solution to the problems caused \nby the Affordable Care Act. It is out there for everyone to see. I, \nonce again, encourage all of my colleagues to look it over and provide \nus with your thoughts and input on our ideas. We would be interested in \nhearing from you. If those ideas can be improved, we are certainly \ninterested in improving them.\n  Once again, the 5-year anniversary of the Affordable Care Act is \nhardly cause for celebration, but it should be a time for all of us--\nparticularly those who supported the law at the outset--to reflect on \nthe last 5 years and decide how we want to move forward when it comes \nto the Nation's health care system. I hope our colleagues will think \nabout that. This bill was passed through both bodies on a totally \npartisan vote, with 100 percent of the Democrats voting in each body.\n  I think I have made a pretty compelling case for why the current law \nisn't working and why we need to go in a different direction. I hope \neventually my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will reach this \nsame conclusion so we can work together to come up with a health care \nsystem and health care set of laws that will work, do good for the \nAmerican people, and give us some element of respectability in the \nCongress that I think the Congress needs at this particular time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COTTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                         Negotiations With Iran\n\n  Mr. COTTON. Madam President, this week we will debate the budget. The \nkey part is the military budget, one part of our government where the \nstrategy and threats must drive the budget, not vice versa. The \ngreatest threat to our national security is a nuclear-armed Iran, and \nthis man, Ayatollah Khomeini, the Supreme Leader of Iran.\n  Last week marked Nowruz, the beginning of the Persian New Year. On \nthe occasion we were treated to speeches by President Obama and Iran's \nSupreme Leader, Ayatollah Khomeini. I have to say, President Obama's \nspeech was ill-advised. He spoke to the Iranian people directly, asking \nthem to press their leaders and speak up in support of a nuclear \nagreement.\n  Let's be clear about one thing: Iranians who speak up tend to \ndisappear into secret prisons or wind up hanging from cranes by the \nneck. Worse, by acting as if public opinion matters to the Ayatollahs, \nPresident Obama is treating Iran as if it were a legitimate democracy, \nnot a brutal theocratic dictatorship. No President should legitimize \nsuch a regime, which emboldens the dictator and undermines the Iranian \npeople struggling under his yoke.\n  But today I want to focus on the speech of this man, Ayatollah \nKhomeini, the Supreme Leader of Iran. The Ayatollah gave his speech on \nSaturday, just 2 days ago. It may have escaped your attention, but it \nwas not exactly a New Year's message filled with blessings of hope and \npeace.\n  Ayatollah Khomeini has never been a great admirer of America, of \ncourse. He sometimes likes to refer to us as the ``Great Satan.'' \nDuring his Nowruz speech, he whipped the crowd into frenzied chants of \n``death to America.'' What was his response to that chant? He said, \n``Yes, certainly, death to America.'' Death to America. That was just 2 \ndays ago.\n  Remember, this is the leader with whom the United States is \nnegotiating today, a theocratic tyrant who, in the middle of nuclear \nnegotiations, chants ``death to America.'' I suggest that we rethink \nthe wisdom of granting nuclear concessions to such a man.\n  Unfortunately, Ayatollah Khomeini may know his negotiating partners \nsomewhat better than they know themselves, for the Ayatollah also \nobserved, ``Iran's enemies, particularly America, are moving forward \nwith prudence and diplomacy. I understand them. They know what they are \ndoing. They need these negotiations. America needs the nuclear \nnegotiations.''\n  Regrettably, he is right when he says he understands his enemies, \nsince the West, especially the President, acts as if we need these \nnegotiations more than Iran does. After all, we had Iran on its knees \nin 2013 when President Obama gave Iran billions of dollars in sanctions \nrelief for merely starting negotiations. The West has extended \nnegotiations twice in exchange for nothing. The President has also made \na series of one-sided concessions from Iran's uranium enrichment \ncapabilities to the length of a nuclear agreement. So, yes, \nunfortunately, Ayatollah Khomeini is correct when he says he \nunderstands his enemies.\n  Let's consider what he said about the negotiations in this light. \nThis past weekend, the Ayatollah emphasized, ``We are absolutely not \nnegotiating or holding discussions with the Americans over regional or \ndomestic issues and neither over weapons capabilities.'' Again, he is \nabsolutely right. Iran has a ballistic missile program, which it only \nneeds if it wants to strike the United States or our European allies, \nbecause it already has missiles capable of striking Israel or anywhere \nelse in the Middle East. Yet we have removed its missile program from \nthe negotiating table, just as we have removed the possible military \ndimensions of its nuclear program from the table, even though that is \ncritical to understanding how far they have progressed toward a bomb.\n  It is not just their weapons capabilities. Note that the Ayatollah \nalso said Iran is not negotiating over regional issues. He made this \npoint repeatedly, saying also, ``We are not negotiating with the \nAmericans over regional issues. U.S. goals in the region are in \ncomplete contrast with our goals,'' and, ``Negotiations with the U.S. \nare only over the nuclear issue, and nothing else. Everyone should be \naware of this.''\n  By ``regional issues'' and ``our goals,'' to be clear, Ayatollah \nKhomeini means Iran's drive for regional hegemony. The outlaw Assad \nregime in Syria is more beholden to Iran than ever. Iranian-aligned \nmilitants have seized the capital of Yemen, causing the American \nEmbassy to close and our troops to evacuate. Iranian-backed and \nIranian-led Shiite militias are slowly taking over Iraq, and Lebanon \nremains subject to Hezbollah, Iran's terrorist proxy.\n  Despite this multifront aggression, President Obama is \ncompartmentalizing the nuclear negotiations as if Iran's drive for \nhegemony and its pursuit of nuclear weapons are distinguishable and \nunrelated rather than springing from the regime's revolutionary nature. \nIn fact, President Obama reportedly wrote a private letter to Ayatollah \nKhomeini--his fourth private letter to the Ayatollah--in part \nreassuring him that the United States would not undermine Assad's \nregime in Syria. Is it any wonder then that the Ayatollah boasts the \nnegotiations are so limited? Is it any wonder what Ayatollah Khomeini \nsaid this weekend\n\n[[Page S1686]]\n\nabout sanctions relief? President Obama and Secretary Kerry keep \ninsisting that sanctions can only be lifted gradually as Iran \ndemonstrates compliance with any deal. The Ayatollah is having none of \nthat. He said this past weekend: ``The lifting of the sanctions is part \nof the issues being negotiated and not the outcome of the \nnegotiations.'' In other words, in exchange for the Ayatollah's \nephemeral and easily reversed promises, ``sanctions must be lifted \nimmediately following an agreement.'' That is not a splittable \ndifference. And let's just say our side's history of one-sided \nconcessions in these negotiations does not inspire confidence that we \nwill preserve a sanctions regime that we took decades to assemble \nfully.\n  Finally, Ayatollah Khomeini wants the world to know that Iran will \nnot be bound in perpetuity by any deal, no matter its terms. He said: \n``The Americans keep saying that there should be irreversibility in the \nterms Iran accepts and the decisions it makes. We do not accept that.'' \nThe Ayatollah is happy to pocket concessions now for billions of \ndollars in sanctions relief and international legitimacy while \npreserving the option of going nuclear in the future, much as North \nKorea did after the 1994 Agreed Framework. I understand why Ayatollah \nKhomeini would want that deal, but why would we?\n  This is the man with whom we are negotiating. Evil men rarely cloak \ntheir wicked intent, and I urge my fellow Senators and all Americans to \npay careful attention to Ayatollah Khomeini's words both this past \nweekend and more generally. When someone chants, ``Yes, certainly, \ndeath to America,'' we should take him at his word and we should not \nput him on a path to a nuclear bomb. Those words are appalling enough. \nLet's not give him the ability to act on them.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          Affordable Care Act\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I was in the House of Representatives for \n16 years, and I have been in the Senate now for 8 years. During all of \nthat time, this country faced and still faces a major health care \ncrisis.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, the United States is the only major \ncountry on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all of our \npeople. Today, despite the modest gains of the Affordable Care Act, \nwhich I will discuss in a moment, we still have about 40 million \nAmericans without any health insurance. By the way, despite so many \nuninsured and so many underinsured, we end up paying, by far, per \ncapita the highest costs of any country.\n  How does it happen? Millions of people are uninsured, millions more \nare underinsured, and we end up paying per capita almost double what \nany other Nation faces.\n  Now, I was in the Congress during the years of the Bush \nadministration, and I waited eagerly to hear what my Republican \ncolleagues had to say about tens of millions of people without any \nhealth insurance and about the cost of health care being so expensive. \nI waited and I waited, and my Republican colleagues had nothing to say. \nApparently, the private insurance companies were doing just great under \nthat system. Drug companies were charging our people the highest prices \nin the world under that system. What is there to complain about? What \nis there to worry about? So 40 million, 50 million people have no \nhealth insurance and people can't afford health care, but it is no \nproblem for my Republican colleagues.\n  Five years ago, the Congress, with no Republican support, passed the \nAffordable Care Act. Let me be very clear. I voted for the Affordable \nCare Act. I will be the first to say that the Affordable Care Act has \nmany problems and, in fact, in many ways, it did not go anywhere near \nas far as it should have gone. By far, it is not a perfect piece of \nlegislation. Yet I still wait to hear what my Republican colleagues \nhave to say about how we address the health care crisis, other than \ndoing what they are doing in this budget, which is to repeal the \nAffordable Care Act completely.\n  Let's take a look at what the Affordable Care Act--ObamaCare--has \naccomplished, which they want to end completely. After 5 years of the \nAffordable Care Act, more than 16 million Americans have gained health \ncoverage. Many of those people never had health insurance in their \nentire lives. Many of those people were getting their health care \nthrough the emergency room at outrageously high costs. Since 2013, we \nhave seen the largest decline in the uninsured rate in decades, and the \nNation's uninsured rate is now at the lowest level ever recorded.\n  Just since October 2013, the uninsured rate for nonelderly adults has \nfallen by 35 percent, and 16 million more Americans have health \ninsurance.\n  Republican response: Get rid of the ACA; throw 16 million Americans \noff of health insurance.\n  Since the Affordable Care Act was enacted, health care prices have \nrisen at the slowest rate in nearly 50 years. All of us can remember 7, \n8, 10 years ago health care insurance rates with increases of 20, 30 \npercent. Since the Affordable Care Act was enacted, health prices have \nrisen at the slowest rate in nearly 50 years. Are they going up? Yes, \nthey are, but at the slowest rate in nearly 50 years.\n  Thanks to exceptionally slow growth in per-person costs throughout \nour health care system, national health care expenditures grew at the \nslowest rate on record--on record--from 2010 through 2013. Are we \nmaking progress in controlling the growth in health care costs? Yes, we \nare.\n  Republican response: Throw it out.\n  Ten million low-income Americans are now able to get health insurance \nthrough Medicaid. And if one is a low-income American struggling to \nmake ends meet and not able to afford health care, in many instances, \nthis is health insurance that saves one's life. It saves one's life \nbecause they now have the opportunity--maybe for the first time in \nyears--to be able to go into a doctor's office because they have \nMedicaid.\n  Republican response: Throw it out; 10 million low-income Americans no \nlonger have health insurance.\n  All of us remember not so many years ago, before the ACA. You have \nhealth insurance for your family, and when your child reaches the age \nof 21, that child is now off of your health insurance plan. So we have \nhuge uninsured numbers for young people in this country who are no \nlonger able to be on their parents' health insurance plan.\n  Under the Affordable Care Act, some 5.7 million young adults have \nbeen able to stay on their parents' policies. The uninsured rate for \nyoung adults has dropped by 40 percent. I would like to see it drop \neven more than that, but 40 percent is nothing to sneeze at.\n  The Republican response: Let's make sure all of these young people \nfrom 21 to 26 rejoin the ranks of the uninsured.\n  One of the great scandals that existed in this country before we had \nthe Affordable Care Act--when we think back on it, people find it hard \nto believe--somebody was diagnosed with diabetes, with cancer, with \nheart disease, with AIDS, or whatever it may be, and that person walked \ninto an insurance company and said: I need some insurance. They filled \nout forms. The insurance company said: Oh, you had breast cancer 3 \nyears ago; we are not going to insure you. You had diabetes; you are \nnot going to get insurance. So the people who needed insurance the most \nwere the people least likely to be able to get insurance. Can we \nimagine that--for people who had a history of heart disease, a history \nof cancer, scared to death it may reoccur, in absolute need of \ninsurance, insurance companies said: No. We can discriminate against \nyou. You are sick, you may get sick again, and we will have to pay out \nmoney. We don't want your business. Well, the ACA did something about \nthat. It should have never been allowed to happen in the first place. \nIt provides protections for people with preexisting conditions.\n  Republicans want to end the ACA. That is in this budget. They want to \nget rid of it. So for those people who have serious illnesses, \nunderstand that if the Republicans succeed, people may not be able to \nget health insurance, because we will go back to a time when\n\n[[Page S1687]]\n\ncompanies could discriminate against people with serious illnesses.\n  Before the ACA, many individuals couldn't gain access to health \ninsurance for a variety of ``illnesses,'' including pregnancy. I guess \npregnancy is an illness for which a person doesn't deserve insurance. \nIt doesn't make a lot of sense to most Americans, but that is what will \nreoccur if the Republicans are successful.\n  Millions of seniors in this country are struggling in terms of how to \npay for their medicines. The cost of medicine in America is very high--\nthe highest of any country on Earth. The Affordable Care Act moves to \nclose the doughnut hole, which means money that has to come out of \nseniors' own pockets. If the Republican budget gets passed and if that \ngets implemented into law, seniors will now be paying significantly \nmore for their prescription drugs. The Affordable Care Act includes \nimportant health care for seniors in the doughnut hole, including 45-\npercent discounts on the cost of their drugs, but allowing the full \nprice of the drug to be counted toward the amount they need to spend to \nget out of the hole.\n  The Affordable Care Act gives people access to free preventive care \nthat keeps them healthy and out of the hospital.\n  The Affordable Care Act ends discrimination against women by health \ninsurance companies so that they don't have to pay more for health \ninsurance simply because they are a woman. Are we going to go back to \nthe days when because a patient was a woman, she had to pay more for \nhealth insurance than a man? I certainly hope not. But that is what \nhappens if we end the Affordable Care Act.\n  The Affordable Care Act protects against a practice by insurance \ncompanies of including lifetime limits in their policies. Prior to the \nACA, many insurance plans included lifetime limits--a limit on the \namount of coverage that plan would provide an individual or a family in \ntheir lifetime. So, in other words, if somebody was racking up large \nclaims because they were seriously ill, the insurance company said: \nSorry, that is it. We are not going to pay any more. Are those the days \nwe want to go back to?\n  I think we can all agree the Affordable Care Act is far from perfect. \nIn my own view, we should provide health care to every person in this \ncountry as a right, and I would do it through a Medicare-for-all \nprogram. Other people have different ideas. But it is hard for me to \nimagine anyone thinking that the solution to America's health care \nproblems today is simply to eliminate the Affordable Care Act.\n  Let me change topics and take a broader look at the Republican budget \ngoing beyond the Affordable Care Act, which they want to abolish.\n  The question we have to ask ourselves is whether we are such a poor \ncountry that we should move toward a Republican budget which forces \nmore and more people to have no health insurance; which makes it harder \nfor working families to send their kids to college; which makes it \nharder for low-income families to send their kids to Head Start; which \ncuts back on nutrition programs, whether it is the Food Stamp Program, \nthe Meals on Wheels program, the WIC Program; which helps people who \nare struggling, literally, to try to come up with the income to \nadequately feed themselves. We have many people in this country who are \nactually hungry, and the Republican budget cuts those programs. Are we \nsuch a poor country that those are the choices that stand before us? I \nthink not. I think the facts are quite the opposite. I think the facts \ntell us that the United States of America is, in fact, the wealthiest \ncountry on this planet. In fact, we have never been a more wealthy \ncountry. We are not a poor country. We are an extremely wealthy \ncountry.\n  The problem we face is that we have a grotesque level of income and \nwealth inequality such that tens of millions of families are struggling \neconomically and many are hungry, while at the other side, people on \ntop are doing phenomenally well. But when you add it all together, it \nturns out that we are a very wealthy country. And the idea that people \nwould come forward and say: We are going to make it harder for low-\nincome families to feed their kids, we are going to make it harder for \nworking-class families to send their kids to college, and we are going \nto make it harder for working families to get their kids into childcare \nis a totally absurd argument. We are not a poor country.\n  Let me demonstrate how we are not a poor country. When some of us \ntalk about the rich getting richer, that is a general statement. Let me \nbe more specific. From the year 2013 to the year 2015, the wealthiest \n14 Americans--14 people--increased their net wealth by more than $157 \nbillion over the last 2 years. The wealthiest 14 billionaires in \nAmerica saw their net wealth increase by more than $157 billion from \n2013 to 2015.\n  Let me be even more specific, and tell me whether this is a poor \nnation that cuts kids off of health insurance, a poor nation that \ndenies nutrition to families who need it, a poor nation that cuts back \non Meals on Wheels for elderly, low-income seniors. Here is what is \ngoing on in this ``poor nation.'' From March of 2013 to March of 2015, \nBill Gates, the wealthiest person in America, saw his wealth increase \nby $12.2 billion, going from $67 billion to $79 billion in 2015. During \nthat period, Warren Buffett saw his wealth increase by $19 billion--one \nguy in 2 years. Larry Ellison saw his wealth increase by $11 billion. \nThe Koch brothers saw their wealth increase by almost $18 billion in a \n2-year period. The Waltons saw huge increases in their wealth--they are \nthe wealthiest family in America--Christy Walton by $13.5 billion, Jim \nWalton by $13.9 billion, and S. Robson Walton by $13 billion. Michael \nBloomberg saw his wealth increase by $8.5 billion. Jeff Bezos's wealth \nwent up by $9.6 billion. Mark Zuckerberg's wealth went up by $20 \nbillion, Sheldon Adelson's by $9.5 billion, Larry Page's by $7.6 \nbillion, and Sergey Brin's by $6.4 billion. These are just the top 14. \nAdded together, their wealth increased by $157 billion.\n  This is a reality my Republican friends don't want to deal with. They \ndo not want to ask the wealthiest people in this country--many of whom \nare paying an effective tax rate lower than that paid by truckdrivers \nand nurses--to start paying their fair share of taxes. Their solution \nto the deficit problem is to cut programs for working families, the \nelderly, the children, the sick, and the poor.\n  Despite the fact that the billionaires of this country are doing \nphenomenally well, their view is, oh no, we can't go to those guys. \nThey may be potential campaign contributors. We are going to go after \nthe elderly--they don't contribute a whole lot. Elderly people on the \nMeals on Wheels program, elderly people making $14,000 a year--they \nhave no political power here in Washington. They have no lobbyists out \nthere. We will just go after the working families, the poor, the \nelderly, the children, the sick. They are easy. They are not actively \ninvolved. Many of them don't even vote. We can go after them, but we \nhave to protect the interests of the wealthy and the powerful.\n  At a time when the richest 400 Americans paid a tax rate of just 16.7 \npercent in 2012--the second lowest on record--the Republican budget \ndoes nothing to ask the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share of \ntaxes to create jobs or reduce the deficit. They are immune. The rich \nget richer, but leave them alone. No problem. Working families pay a \nhigher effective tax rate than billionaires--not a problem because we \nare going to cut the deficit by going after the most vulnerable people \nin this country, the people who don't have a lot of political power.\n  While the effective tax rate of large, profitable corporations was \njust 12.6 percent in 2010 and corporate profits are at an alltime high, \nthe Republican budget does nothing to end the outrageous loopholes that \nallow major corporations to avoid $100 billion a year in taxes by \nshifting their profits to the Cayman Islands and other offshore tax \nhavens.\n  Now, why would you ask large, profitable corporations that in some \ncases pay zero in Federal income taxes to start paying their fair share \nof taxes? These are powerful people. These are people who have \nlobbyists all over Capitol Hill. These are people who make campaign \ncontributions. Why would we ask them to start paying their fair share \nof taxes?\n  At a time when billionaire hedge fund managers on Wall Street pay a\n\n[[Page S1688]]\n\nlower effective tax rate than a truckdriver or a nurse, the Republican \nbudget does not eliminate the carried interest loophole that will cost \nthe Federal Government $16 billion in lost revenue over the next 10 \nyears. The Republican budget protects over $40 billion in unnecessary \nand expensive tax breaks and subsidies for oil and gas companies even \nas the five largest oil companies alone made more than $1 trillion in \nprofits over the last decade. Ask large, profitable oil companies to \npay more in taxes? Don't be ridiculous--not when you can cut programs \nfor hungry kids or cut Head Start or cut Pell grants for working-class \nyoung people.\n  Let me tell you what this budget does do. At a time when millions of \nAmericans are working longer hours for lower wages, the Republican \nbudget paves the way for a tax hike averaging over $900 per person for \n13 million families--$900 apiece for more than 13 million families with \n25 million children--by allowing the expansions of the earned-income \ntax credit and the child tax credit to expire.\n  So we can't ask billionaires who are doing phenomenally well to pay \nmore in taxes. That we don't do. We can't ask corporations that stash \ntheir money in tax havens in the Cayman Islands to start paying their \nfair share of taxes. We can't do that. But what we can do is impact the \nlives of millions of working families by allowing the earned-income tax \ncredit and the child tax credit to expire. In other words, we raise \ntaxes for low-income Americans and working-class Americans and the \nmiddle class, but we do not ask the wealthy and large corporations to \npay a nickel more in taxes.\n  Further, the Republican budget paves the way for a tax hike of about \n$1,100 for 12 million families and students paying for college by \nallowing the American opportunity tax credit to expire. So if you are a \nfamily trying to send your kid to college, you are going to have to pay \nmore because our Republican colleagues are allowing the American \nopportunity tax credit to expire.\n  The Republican Senate budget would balance the budget on the backs of \nthe elderly, the children, the sick, and the most vulnerable people in \nour society. It would slash investments in education, health care, \nnutrition, and affordable housing, while paving the way for another \nunpaid war by significantly increasing defense spending. It also would \nnot ask millionaires, billionaires, and profitable corporations to \ncontribute one penny for deficit reduction. No, it is only working \nfamilies, the middle class, and low-income people who have to help us \nwith deficit reduction, not billionaires or large corporations.\n  As we all know, the budget we are debating today is not an \nappropriations bill; it is a budget bill, which, by the way, is filled \nwith magic asterisks--those little asterisks which tell us nothing \nabout how Republicans are going to be moving toward a balanced budget. \nBut by making over $5 trillion in budget cuts over the next decade--$5 \ntrillion--reasonable estimates have been made about the harm those cuts \nwould do to the American people.\n  At a time when the cost of college education is becoming out of reach \nfor millions of Americans, the Republican budget would eliminate \nmandatory Pell grants, cutting this program by nearly $90 billion over \n10 years, which would increase the cost of a college education to more \nthan 8 million Americans.\n  Take a deep breath and think about this. Young people all over this \ncountry--and I know this because at a lot of Vermont high schools, when \nyou talk to kids, they are wondering how they are going to be able to \nafford to go to college. They are worried about the high cost of \ncollege. The Republican solution is to cut--eliminate mandatory Pell \ngrants, cutting this program by over $90 billion during a 10-year \nperiod. So what they are doing is making a very difficult situation \neven more difficult in terms of enabling the middle-class and working \nfamilies in this country to be able to send their kids to college.\n  I think everybody who has children or grandchildren understands that \nwe have a major preschool and childcare crisis in this country, and in \nVermont and all over this Nation, it is very difficult for middle-\nincome Americans to find decent, quality, affordable childcare or \npreschool education for their kids. Within that context of a crisis in \nchildcare, the Republican solution is to give us a budget that would \nmean that 110,000 fewer young people, young children, would be able to \nenroll in Head Start over the next 10 years.\n  So we have a crisis in terms of higher education, and what they do is \ncut back on Pell grants, making it harder for families to send their \nkids to college. We have a crisis in childcare, and what the \nRepublicans do is cut back on Head Start, meaning that 110,000 fewer \nyoung children would be able to get into the Head Start Program. Under \nthe Republican budget, 1.9 million fewer students would receive the \nacademic help they need to succeed in school because of some $12 \nbillion in cuts to the title I education program. The Individuals With \nDisabilities Education Act would be cut by $10 billion over the next \ndecade, which would shift the cost to States and local school districts \nand could lead to increased property taxes for millions of Americans.\n  At a time when there are more than 20 million hungry Americans, \npeople who in the course of the week are not quite sure how they are \ngoing to get the food they need to survive, when many working families \nare running to emergency food shelters in order to get the help they \nneed to feed their families, the Republican budget would take some 1.2 \nmillion women, infants, and young people from the WIC Program, or the \nSpecial Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and \nChildren, which goes to pregnant women and new mothers. They would cut \nthat by $10 billion over a 10-year period, impacting some 1.2 million \nwomen, infants, and young children.\n  Once again, we do not ask billionaires to start paying their fair \nshare of taxes, but we tell the pregnant mother or the mother of a \nyoung child that the nutrition programs she has been receiving to make \nsure her kids are eating well are going to be cut by $10 billion over a \n10-year period.\n  I come from a cold-weather State, and we have had a very rough \nFebruary. Only yesterday, the weather in my hometown was about 10 \ndegrees.\n  Under the Republican budget, up to 900,000 families would be denied \nthe help they need to stay warm in the winter and cool in the summer by \ncuts to the LIHEAP program, or the Low Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram--a $5 billion cut over the next decade impacting some 900,000 \nfamilies. Many of the people on LIHEAP are seniors--a good percentage \nof them. These are elderly people without a lot of money in cold-\nweather States trying to keep warm in the wintertime. We are going to \nsee a $5 billion cut in that program over the next decade.\n  In Vermont, and I think in many parts of this country, we have a real \nhousing problem for low-income people. The cost of rent in many cases \nis much more than people can afford. People are spending 40, 50 percent \nof their limited incomes on rent.\n  To address that problem, the Republican budget would kick nearly half \na million families off the section 8 affordable housing program and out \nof their homes by cutting section 8 by $46 billion over a 10-year \nperiod.\n  So you have low-income people all over this country--and I see it \nevery day in Vermont--paying 40, 50, 60 percent of their income for \nrents, and what the Republican budget does is it cuts $46 billion over \n10 years from section 8 housing, again, making a bad situation worse.\n  At a time when real unemployment is 11 percent, the Republican budget \ncuts job training and employment services for more than 2 million \nAmericans.\n  So what we have is a budget which in many ways is a Robin Hood budget \nin reverse. At a time when the rich are getting richer and the middle \nclass is getting poorer, the Republicans take from the middle class and \nworking families to give more to the rich and large corporations.\n  The Republican budget has a set of priorities that are way, way, way \nout of touch with where the American people are.\n  During the next week, there are going to be a number of amendments \nbeing offered by Members on our side which will create jobs for the \nunemployed, raise wages for low-income workers, address the overtime \ncrisis facing millions of Americans who are not getting time and a half \nwhen they\n\n[[Page S1689]]\n\nshould, provide pay equity for women workers, address this issue of tax \nbreaks for the rich and large corporations, which are unconscionable \nand unsustainable. That is what we will be doing. I look forward to \nthat debate and those amendments.\n  I note that Senator Markey is on the floor and has asked for 10 \nminutes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I wish to follow on the comments that were \nbeing articulated by the Senator from Vermont. He has done an excellent \njob laying out these issues for the American people to deliberate upon \nthis week as we debate the budget of the United States of America.\n  Right now, millions of Americans are gripped by March Madness and the \nFinal Four showdown, but for our Nation's seniors and the middle class, \nthe real March madness is happening in Congress with the proposed \nRepublican budget.\n  Our country isn't like the big dance. Our country was not built on a \nzero-sum game, where one side wins and the other side loses. But that \nis exactly what this Republican budget does. It picks winners, and it \npicks losers.\n  Let's take a look at the GOP's budget brackets. The Republican final \nfour features their perennial favorites. In the first game, they have \nseniors versus special interests.\n  Well, in this Republican budget, it removes 11 million families from \nMedicaid, including 400,000 seniors in my State of Massachusetts alone. \nIt turns Medicare into a voucher program. It forces millions of \nseniors, including 80,000 in Massachusetts who receive Medicare, to pay \n$1,000 more for their prescription drugs next year. It does all of this \nwhile preserving tax breaks for special interests, such as the \ndeductions for corporate jets and for shipping jobs overseas.\n  The budget preserves billions for atomic bombs of the past--supported \nby the defense industry--which is why I introduced legislation today to \ncut $100 billion over 10 years from our bloated nuclear weapons \nprogram.\n  So there are no surprises yet in the GOP budget bracket. Special \ninterests advance and seniors lose. That is the first match. Seniors \nlose. It is not unexpected.\n  In the next game, it is a battle of generations. It is the old guard \nof Wall Street against the new blood of our Nation, our students. So \nwhat does the GOP budget do?\n  Well, it cuts 8 million Pell grants for college students by almost \none-third, making college less affordable for millions of young people \nand their families. It yanks 100,000 children from the Head Start \nProgram over the next 10 years. It does all that while not meeting the \nneeds of the Wall Street cops on the beat at the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission, and it puts Americans at risk from predatory \nlenders and credit card scams by continuing the GOP effort to kill the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. So in the battle between the Wall \nStreet boardrooms and America's classrooms, it is the big money over \nthe little guy yet again.\n  In the next David versus Goliath matchup, it is America's working \nfamilies against billionaires. Surely the spirit and character of \nAmerica's working families is deserving of a win. But there is no \nCinderella story with the Republican budget. That is because it kicks \nnearly 900,000 families off of low-income energy assistance. So \nfamilies will need to decide between heating and eating.\n  This budget includes $660 billion in cuts over the next decade to \nFederal programs that lift up our most vulnerable, such as food stamps, \nschool lunches, school nutrition programs--slashed, slashed, slashed. \nAccording to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 69 percent of \nnondefense cuts included in the House and Senate budget resolutions \ncome from these programs that serve the poor, the sick, and the needy \nin our society.\n  This budget sticks to the Republican policy of not increasing the \nminimum wage, keeping millions of Americans who want to get into the \nmiddle class out of the game. Are the billionaires asked to do more \nwith less? Do they have any tax breaks taken away? Do they pay a little \nmore to make sure the less fortunate are better off?\n  No, the Republican refs make sure that the Republican playing field \nremains tilted in their favor. It is another win for the rich.\n  Now, the matchup we have all been waiting for is the Big Oil \njuggernaut against clean energy and climate change. In a Republican \nSenate, Big Oil is undefeated, but can upstart American clean energy \ncompanies pull out a win? Well, the Republican budget protects billions \nof dollars in subsidies to the oil companies while killing the wind \nenergy tax credit. The Republican unwillingness to extend the tax \ncredit has already cost us 30,000 American jobs in the last few years.\n  Republicans continue to deny the existence of climate change by \nstopping funding to protect communities against sea level rise and \nstronger storms, even though 2014 was the warmest year on record and \nextreme weather impacted every part of the country. It does all of this \nwhile handing over more of our public land to Big Oil and to coal \ncompanies instead of preserving it for all Americans.\n  So, who is the winner? No surprise, Big Oil. They keep all of their \ntax breaks, even as we are taking money away from seniors, from \nstudents, from working families, and from a clean energy future in our \ncountry. It is no surprise, because when you have the Republican budget \nfinal four--special interests, Wall Street, billionaires, and Big Oil--\nthe fix was in from the start.\n  Unlike the March Madness games we love to watch each year, there are \nnever any upsets in the Republicans' bracket. There are no budget \nbuzzer beaters. In fact, the only ones upset here are grandma, grandpa, \nstudents, clean energy workers, and hardworking Americans.\n  Senate Republicans, once again, are trotting out their well-worn \nplaybook to pick the winners and losers in our society and in our \neconomy, because in this budget, there are clear winners and there are \nclear losers. Special interests score huge on big tax breaks. Wall \nStreet gets to block legislation. Billionaires take a bigger share of \nthe winnings, and Big Oil remains undefeated.\n  Meanwhile, American families and industries lose. Seniors pay more \nfor health care. Working families pay more for energy. Students pay \nmore for college. Clean energy companies cut more workers, stopping \nthis incredible clean energy revolution in our country.\n  This is the real March madness, the Republican budget that makes \nwinners out of Big Oil and billionaires, while the clock runs out on \nseniors and hardworking Americans, who are left to fend for themselves.\n  I implore my colleagues to reject this scheme and to create a plan \nthat does not bust the budgets of families across this Nation. I call \nupon my colleagues to reject this completely and totally distorted \nsense of priorities for our country.\n  I call for my colleagues to put together a budget for the future of \nour country that invests in students, invests in clean energy, invests \nin research, and invests in what the 21st century should be all about, \nwhile we pay the proper respect to the seniors in our country.\n  We cannot leave behind the poor, the sick, and the elderly. We have \nobligations in this country. We understand that this country has been \nmade the great country that it is--the greatest in the history of the \nworld--by remembering our obligations to all of those who built our \ncountry--not just those in the upper 1 percentile, who have been the \nprimary beneficiaries, but the other 99 percent who got up every single \nmorning and went to work as well, the other 99 percent who built this \ncountry and its values from the ground up. We have an obligation to \nthem as well. This Republican budget does not reflect that.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on the Republican budget. I again thank my \ncolleague from the State of Vermont for being an articulate, \npassionate, and moral voice that ensures that this debate is heard by \nevery single person in our country.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S1690]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I just want to reiterate what I think is \nthe key point in this entire debate, and that point is whether we \ndevelop a budget that works for the vast majority of our families--\nworking families, middle-class families who, in many instances, are \nworking longer hours for lower wages--whether it works for our children \nat a time when we are experiencing the highest rate of childhood \npoverty of any major country; whether it works for our elderly citizens \nwho often have to make the choice about whether to heat their homes, \nbuy the medicines they need or buy the food they need--and there are \nmillions of people in that position--or do we have a budget that works \nfor the top 1 percent of people who are doing phenomenally well or \nmaybe even the top one-tenth of 1 percent.\n  I want to get back to this chart, which I think is real interesting. \nI want everybody to take a deep breath and think about this. At a time \nwhen the top one-tenth of 1 percent owns almost as much wealth as the \nbottom 90 percent, when the people on top, the very wealthiest \nAmericans, are doing well almost beyond imagination, do we really want \nto cut food stamps and nutrition programs for hungry kids? Do we really \nwant to make college education less affordable for working families? Do \nwe really want to ask seniors to pay more for prescription drugs--those \npeople trying to live on $13,000, $14,000 a year.\n  So here is the chart. This comes from Forbes magazine, not notably a \nleftwing publication. They simply give us the facts, and here are the \nfacts. The top 14 wealthiest people in this country have seen their net \nworth increase by $157 billion over the last 2 years--14 people.\n  Do my Republican colleagues go to these people and say: You know \nwhat, you are Americans. We have a lot of problems here. Our middle \nclass is disappearing. We have an infrastructure which is crumbling. We \nhave millions of families who can't afford to send their kids to \ncollege. You, the top one-tenth of 1 percent, are doing phenomenally \nwell. Is it so hard for my Republican colleagues to say to these \npeople: Maybe you will have to pay a little more in taxes.\n  Let me list them. Bill Gates, in that 2-year period from 2013 to \n2015, saw his wealth increase by $12 billion; Warren Buffet, $19 \nbillion; Larry Ellison, $11 billion; Charles Koch, almost $9 billion; \nDavid Koch, almost $9 billion; Christy Walton, over $13 billion; Jim \nWalton, almost $14 billion; S. Robson Walton, $13 billion; Michael \nBloomberg, $8.5 billion; Jeff Bezos, $9.6 billion; Mark Zuckerberg, $20 \nbillion; Sheldon Adelson, $4.9 billion; Larry Page, $6.7 billion; and \nSergey Brin, over $6 billion.\n  That is just the increase in their net worth in a 2-year period. Who \ncan deny the very richest people in this country are doing phenomenally \nwell? How do you ignore that reality? How do you not say to those \npeople: You are going to have to help us with our infrastructure, with \neducation, with our deficit.\n  But my Republican colleagues have a different approach. Their \napproach is to say to working families: Well, we are going to make it \nharder for your kids to get into Head Start. We are going to make it \nharder for you to get the nutrition programs you need to keep your \nfamily from going hungry. We are going to make it harder for seniors to \nget the prescription drugs they need.\n  So I think, with this budget, the choices are pretty clear. It is \nlaid right out there. Republicans want to balance the budget on the \nbacks of the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor, and protect \nall of these guys--not ask them to pay one nickel more in taxes. I \nthink that is wrong from a moral perspective, from an economic \nperspective, and I think this is a budget that should be defeated.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          State Of The Economy\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, it is my understanding that reserved time \nis now available for the Joint Economic Committee, particularly in \nregard to presenting the report which is part of the budgetary process, \nso I will go forward with that.\n  It is an honor for me to serve as chairman of the Joint Economic \nCommittee. One of the main roles of that committee is to report to the \nSenate Budget Committee and to my colleagues in the Senate on the state \nof the economy, and that is why I am here today.\n  Just last week, Dr. Jason Furman, the chairman of the President's \nCouncil of Economic Advisers, appeared before the Joint Economic \nCommittee to discuss this topic as well as to discuss the findings of \nthe annual Economic Report of the President. Our committee is tasked \nwith evaluating and responding to that President's Economic Report. \nLast week our committee released our findings and recommendations, and \nI am here today to present some of those findings.\n  We found that despite improvements in economic conditions over the \npast year, our economy remains stuck in second gear. Let me discuss why \nwe have concluded that.\n  I often hear back home from Hoosiers--and I know my colleagues hear \nback home from people they represent--that we need to take action to \ngrow the economy. I think it is safe to say that of course all of us in \nthe Senate think the same way. But the age-old question in economics is \nthis: How does a nation best create an environment for economic growth \nand raise living standards for its citizens?\n  We are now nearly 6 years into this recovery. While there are many \nencouraging signs of economic improvement, particularly in the last \nseveral months, the recovery has been modest and there still are many \nAmericans in need of and still seeking meaningful job opportunities.\n  Since 1960, our Nation has experienced seven recessions and \nrecoveries. The recoveries of the past 50 years provide comparative \ndata to measure the progress of our current recovery. On the measures \nof GDP, jobs, and income growth, our current recovery ranks either dead \nlast or second to last in all of those seven recoveries. Let me restate \nthat.\n  In the last 50 years we have had 7 major recessions. Following those \nrecessions has been an economic recovery. As things get sorted out, the \neconomy kicks back in. If we take all those seven and we average them \nout in terms of what the results were following the recession, we get \ncertain numbers. What we have seen now in this last recession is \nperformance far under the average--in fact, dead last--of those seven. \nI will give a couple of metrics here.\n  Annual gross domestic product--the total of everything produced--has \na value and grew 4 percent in the average post-1960 recovery, while \nthis recovery has averaged just 2.3 percent of gross domestic product \ngrowth. So we are growing about half of the average of the previous \nrecessions.\n  Personal income rose an average of 15.3 percent in the past \nrecoveries. During this recovery, personal income has reached only 7.1 \npercent growth--less than half of what the average is for the previous \nseven recoveries.\n  At the same time, median household income has collapsed by $2,100 in \nreal terms per family during this current recovery.\n  And while the pace of job creation has picked up recently, there are \nstill 5.5 million fewer private sector jobs in this recovery than the \naverage of past recoveries.\n  In addition, the labor force participation rate--the percentage of \nworking-age Americans who have a job or are looking for a job--has \nfallen to 35-year lows. What this means is reduction in the \nunemployment rate over the past year is at least partially the result \nof many Americans giving up on looking for work. This, contrary to what \nour President said in his State of the Union Address, is not something \nto be proud of.\n\n  So we must ask ourselves: Why is this recovery so different? What \ndoes the future economic situation look like for the average American \nfamily?\n\n[[Page S1691]]\n\n  In our Republican Joint Economic Committee Response, we find that \nthese questions are addressed partly by the historic factors identified \nin the President's report.\n  For instance, there is mutual concern about the labor market scars \nthat remain in the aftermath of the recent recession, as well as the \nchallenges to restoring a more productive and participatory workforce. \nWhere we differ with the President is on how to best address these \nproblems and what policies we can offer that will return us to, at a \nminimum, the average of past recoveries. We are not asking for the Moon \nhere. Although we would like to see growth exceed the average of the \npast, we are simply saying: What policies do we need to enact just to \nget back to the average recovery? And we are half of that, as I said.\n  We differ with the President on how best to address these problems \nand what policies we can offer that will return us, at a minimum, to \nthe average of past recoveries. Unfortunately, we have found that many \nof the recommendations put forth in the President's report would not \ndeliver the benefits the administration projects. For instance, the \nadministration's proposal to increase the minimum wage would result in \nreduced job opportunities. That has been documented over and over in \ntestimony before our committee by analysts and economists who have \nlooked at this. It freezes out those seeking entry-level jobs--a start, \na foot in the door, the ability to show you can come to work and do a \ngood day's work, arrive on time and don't leave before your time ends. \nYou could be a productive person, and up the ladder they go. That entry \nlevel is killed when we raise the minimum wage beyond what the market \ncalls for. We end up losing a lot of small businesses that provide \nthose entry-level jobs, or end up hiring on a part-time basis to avoid \nthat result.\n  Additionally, the economic report of the President insufficiently \naddresses the challenges we face in terms of improving the American \neconomy, improving economic mobility, preparing students in the \nworkforce, enacting progrowth policies, and addressing our long-term \nfiscal challenges. Allow me, if I could, to discuss these items in \ngreater detail.\n  Let's look at economic mobility. For example, the Obama \nadministration continues to press income inequality as an issue, when \nit would be better to focus on policies that improve economic mobility. \nEconomic mobility is far more important for Americans as they move \nthrough different stages of life--from making less income after \ngraduation, to starting the process of building a career, building a \nresume, to building up earnings through a career experience, and \nestablishing families, to accumulate savings for retirement, and other \ngoals that all of us have gone through and many are going through and \nmany hope to go through as they look forward to meaningful work in the \nfuture.\n  Despite good intentions, President Obama continues to pursue policies \nthat impede job growth and real income growth. This restrains economic \nmobility.\n  Nearly 6 years now into the current recovery, Americans are only just \nbeginning to see signs of significant income growth--and income growth \nfeeds into upward economic mobility. My hope and our hope is this \ngrowth will continue to strengthen in the coming years. But we need a \nchange of policies from this administration if this is going to happen.\n  Let's look at education reform. We also differ with the President in \nthe area of education reform. It is becoming increasingly clear that \ntraditional solutions no longer work in today's labor market. The \nconnection between education and jobs is fractured, and repairing this \nconnection requires collaboration with employers who know what skills \ntheir workers need.\n  Education remains an area ripe for reform, yet the Obama \nadministration has preferred to promote the idea of making community \ncollege free rather than focus on the existing education deficits \nexperienced by so many students across the country. Many low-income \nAmericans are already able to receive a community college education for \nfree if they are eligible for Pell grants. But the real question here \nis: What kind of curriculum will they be taking as they enter the \neducation process? To simply go into a system that is not coordinating \nand cooperating with the private industry in terms of the skills needed \nfor them to grow and to join that particular means of production is \nsadly lacking in the President's proposals.\n  Today, many of the classes offered at community colleges are \nremedial. They are compensating for deficits in education at the high \nschool level. Many students find themselves unprepared for even the \nmost basic postsecondary courses at the community college and \nuniversity levels, let alone for skilled jobs that offer good pay. \nUntil we address this fundamental foundational underpinning in terms of \nhow to receive the right education, we have to address these questions \nrather than just simply say: Everybody go; don't worry, the taxpayer \nwill pay for your tuition; take whatever courses you want. That simply \nis not the model.\n  In Indiana, we have a consolidated model now, working with private \nindustry and our 2-year colleges, which is producing terrific results \nbecause we are matching the skills needed with the curriculum and \nteaching that provides those needs.\n  For these students, finding a good job remains a challenge, as does \nour ability to address those in this category who have given up looking \nfor a job. That takes us to the labor participation rate.\n  The labor force participation rate for those age 20 to 29 is more \nthan 4 percent lower now than in 2007. And the lower that goes, the \neasier it is to achieve an unemployment number that sounds good but \nreally is false because the factor of labor participation is skewing \nthe results.\n  Furthermore, for those who find a job in that 20-to-29 category, the \nFederal Reserve board survey of young workers reveals that only 42 \npercent of those surveyed reported having a job that is closely related \nto their field of study. Students' time and resources need to be better \ninvested so they can enter the workforce truly equipped, and without \nneedless delay and countless dollars spent on a degree that leaves them \nunemployed or jobless. This is a major challenge to our education \nsystem, and the President's education proposals fall far short of the \nreforms needed to address these challenges.\n  Let's look at growth and productivity--absolutely essential if we are \ngoing to have a growing economy and provide more jobs for more people. \nAs it stands, the United States remains one of the most productive \neconomies in the world. We can treasure that. We can celebrate that. \nHowever, much concern remains about whether America will be able to \nsustain that productivity of which it proved capable over the last half \ncentury, but there is a real question today as to whether that can be \nsustained.\n  Business creation, entrepreneurship, and technological innovations \nhave slowed over the past decade, alarmingly. If these trends prove to \nbe more than temporary, then they will have negative consequences for \nAmerica's standard of living.\n  Productivity and labor force participation growth alone cannot \naddress the Federal spending problems that have been years in the \nmaking. It appears the administration has not stopped to consider the \neffects of existing regulations and government policies.\n  ObamaCare's effects on labor force participation and hours worked \ncontinue to drive down productivity. Economist Casey Mulligan estimates \nthat, if fully implemented, by 2017 ObamaCare's long-term effect will \ntranslate to roughly 3 percent less in weekly employment--3 percent \nfewer total hours worked, and 2 percent less in labor income. That is \nnot how to boost productivity. That is a killer of increase in \nproductivity.\n  Nonetheless, the Obama administration prefers to add more spending \nprograms to the existing structure in an attempt to counterbalance the \ncurrent disincentives to work.\n  In contrast, we--Republicans on the committee--believe aggressive \naction on progrowth policies will improve the future economic situation \nof American families.\n  As we detail our report to Congress, there are three areas where \nimmediate opportunity to kick-start our economy and provide for the \nsustained growth needed to address the current fiscal and economic \ngrowth challenges we\n\n[[Page S1692]]\n\nface that need to be implemented--one, comprehensive tax reform; two, \nimplementation of foreign trade agreements; and three, regulatory \nrelief. Let's take those three in a little deeper discussion.\n  Tax reform. The need for comprehensive, pro-growth tax reform could \nnot be clearer. There is admission on both sides of the aisle in this \nChamber--the Republicans and the Democrats--that we have gone far too \nlong in terms of dealing with tax reform of our current taxation \nsystem. The Administration and Members of Congress in both parties \nagreed that it's broken. It is loaded with so many exemptions, \nexclusions, subsidies, credits, special interest provisions, rules and \nregulations, it is incomprehensible to fathom the complexity of this \ncurrent system. It is hurting our economy.\n  For example, the U.S. corporate tax rate is the highest in the \ndeveloped world. If American businesses are going to be able to compete \nin a global market, it has to be significantly lower. There is consent \non this. The President has acknowledged that this is needed and that \nthis is the case. Yet we see little if any policy coming forward--\ndirect policy--from the White House and from our Democratic friends as \nto whether we should go forward.\n  I am hopeful that the Ways and Means Committee in the House and the \nFinance Committee in the Senate, of which I am a Member, will take this \nseriously and will address this issue in a comprehensive way. \nUnfortunately, the President's framework may not lead to the desired \ngoals of productivity and other economic gains because with a tax code \nof 4 million words and compliance costs to American families and \nbusinesses equaling $168 billion a year, it is not surprising that 9 \nout of 10 Americans turn to a paid preparer or computer software to \ncalculate their tax burden. Six billion hours are spent every year by \nAmericans simply trying to figure out their tax return or get their tax \nreturn taken care of, and an extraordinary amount of money is spent on \nhaving someone else prepare that return because it is simply \nincomprehensible for most Americans to address.\n  Progrowth tax reform would simplify the Tax Code for individuals and \nfamilies, reduce the corporate rate, lower individual rates paid by \nsmall businesses, and make our individual tax system more competitive \nin the global market. By comparison, the Administration's suggested 28 \npercent corporate tax rate and hybrid territorial and worldwide tax \nsystem would still place the United States among the highest global tax \nrates and would still continue to put American businesses at a \ncompetitive disadvantage.\n  Let's look at trade. Another area of agreement between Congress and \nthe administration, so-called, is the pursuit of more trade \nopportunities. President Obama's National Export Initiative aimed to \nincrease the level of exports to $3.14 trillion before 2015 in order to \nsupport up to 2 million jobs, but it fell far short of that goal.\n  The opportunity to improve GDP growth is available now, pending the \nadministration's efforts to secure trade promotion authority to \nfinalize new trade agreements. During the State of the Union Address, \none of the few topics that brought Republicans to their feet, cheering \nin support, was the President's call for trade promotion authority. \nYet, it appears--and I remain concerned--that the President and the \nadministration are not really working hard enough and putting the \npressure on their own party Members to secure the necessary support of \nCongress to achieve this much needed result.\n  The President should fully engage with Congress to ensure passage of \ntrade promotion authority. This is a necessary policy if we are to get \nthe kind of economic growth we need. With these trade agreements, we \ncan expand market access for American goods and services and improve \nthe economic well-being of Americans and of citizens in our trade \npartner countries.\n  Regulatory burden. We have to stem the rising tide of regulatory \nredtape. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, the cost \nof complying with Federal regulations exceeds $1.75 trillion every year \nfor U.S. businesses, and it disproportionately affects small \nbusinesses. This amounts to more than $10,500 per American worker.\n  Furthermore, the administration has launched an aggressive assault on \nfossil fuels and the low-cost electricity they provide. In addition to \nthe EPA's harmful carbon regulations, the administration has unleashed \nmore than a dozen rules aimed at eliminating coal-fired plants in the \nUnited States.\n  We cannot neglect the costs and effects of new major regulations \nunder ObamaCare and Dodd-Frank that continue to subdue business \ninvestment and job growth.\n  Taken individually, each burdensome regulation increases costs to \nAmerican families and slows economic growth. Taken collectively, these \nregulations hang as a giant albatross around the necks of working \npeople and American businesses, both large and small. To reduce \nexcessive regulations, Federal agencies need to review and remove \noutdated and ineffective rules and should more fully evaluate the costs \nand benefits of any proposed rule.\n  I would like to turn now to the long-term effects and fiscal health \nthat is a challenge to all, each and every one of us. I have spoken at \nsome length about this recent recovery and our report's findings. In \naddition to working to improve the recovery in the short term, we must \nalso address the greatest threat to a successful economic America--our \nlong-term fiscal health.\n  Earlier this year, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office issued \nits updated budget and economic outlook for the next decade. The report \nwarned that under current law, if we just stay where we are and don't \nmake adjustments, ``large and growing federal debt would have serious \nnegative consequences, including increasing federal spending for \ninterest payments; restraining economic growth in the long term; giving \npolicymakers less flexibility to respond to unexpected challenges; and \neventually heightening the risk of a fiscal crisis.''\n  Federal Reserve Chairman Yellen said essentially the same thing when \nshe appeared last year before the Joint Economic Committee. Her answer \nhighlighted why the long-term deficits Washington currently is \nprojected to run must be addressed. I put that question to Chairman \nYellen, Chairman of the Fed, and this was her answer:\n\n       There is more work to do to put fiscal policy on a \n     sustainable course... Progress has been made over the last \n     several years in bringing down deficits in the short term, \n     but [through] a combination of demographics, the structure of \n     entitlement programs, and historic trends in health-care \n     costs, we can see that, over the long term, deficits will \n     rise to unsustainable levels relative to the economy.\n\n  With these comments, the Fed Chairwoman joined a long list of \nacademics, economists, and business leaders who have all stated the \nobvious: Unless the United States makes politically difficult but \nabsolutely necessary spending choices in the near term, eventually we \nare going to face a debt-induced crisis in the future. It is only a \nmatter of time. The clock is running down. We continue to postpone the \never-more-necessary policy changes that will help us avoid the coming \nfiscal crisis. It is there for everybody to see. That clock has been \nrunning now for tens of years. Republican Presidents and Democratic \nPresidents have watched this grow, the deficit spending and national \ndebt--plunge into national debt at a staggering rate. The consequences \nwill come home to roost, and they will affect not only our own \ngeneration but in particular our children's generation and our \ngrandchildren's generation and generations to come if we don't address \nthis.\n  In fact, if interest rates were not artificially held down by the Fed \nat historically low levels, we might already be facing our day of \nreckoning. According to the Congressional Budget Office, even a 1 \npercentage point increase in interest rates would add $1.7 trillion to \nthe deficits of the United States over a 10-year period of time. That \nis just a 1-percent increase in interest rates. If we go back to \naverage, we will be looking at a 3-percent or 4-percent or maybe even a \n5-percent interest rate level. Each one would cost us $1.7 trillion \nover a 10-year period of time. That new debt would occur without any \nchanges in spending or taxing; interest rates alone would simply drive \nour debt out of control. It is a ticking time bomb, a fiscal ticking \ntime bomb that must be addressed.\n  While the administration has taken credit for the current reduction \nin our\n\n[[Page S1693]]\n\nannual deficit, overall debt has increased dramatically under President \nObama--from $10.6 trillion to almost $18.2 trillion just during his \nterm of office. And they brag about making progress? Yes, the deficit \nis smaller than it was in the early years of the Obama administration, \nbut it is still a deficit of half a trillion dollars a year, and it is \ngoing to spike dramatically within 2 years, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office. What a bag of misery turned over to the \nnext President.\n  In addition, the reduction in our budget deficits is only temporary, \nas I just said, because the conclusion of the Congressional Budget \nOffice is that this will spike in 2017 and publicly held debt as a \npercent of GDP will continue to rise in the second half of the coming \ndecade. Yet, the CBO's projections of deficits and publicly held debt \nover the next decade does not tell the whole story. The debt will \ncontinue to climb to unsustainable levels over the next three decades--\n30 years of climbing into even more debt. By the end of that time, we \nwill owe our creditors more than our entire economy produces in 1 year. \nLet me say that again. At the end of that period--the next three \ndecades--we will owe our creditors more than our entire economy is \nworth. What a gift to our children. Thanks a lot.\n  Thanks for ignoring doing what you needed to do. You saw it coming. \nYou talked about it on the floor of the Senate. Everybody saw what was \nhappening, and no one had the will to stand up or too few had the will \nto stand up and do something about it.\n  It is reckless policy. It is dangerous. We have an obligation to the \nAmerican people. We have a moral obligation to our future children and \ngrandchildren to address this and to act responsibly.\n  There have been several bipartisan attempts, both in Congress and by \noutside groups, to address this ticking time bomb. Groups such as Fix \nthe Debt, the Business Roundtable, the Domenici-Rivlin effort at the \nBipartisan Policy Center--all tried to develop solutions and present \nthem. They did present them to us, and it is clear for everyone to see. \nOfficial government efforts were undertaken--Simpson-Bowles, the Gang \nof 6, the supercommittee that resulted from the Budget Control Act, and \nthe dinner club of Senators, which I participated in, that met directly \nwith the President and his senior advisers. Unfortunately, all of these \nefforts, all of the effort put into this, all of the alarms that were \nringing--all of this failed to reach agreement.\n  I am particularly disappointed with the failure of the final effort, \nwhich began with Senators and the White House seeking to go big and \nultimately got to the point where it was hardly worth putting anything \nin place. Even when we took the President's own recommendations and \nsent them to him for approval, they were rejected.\n  Despite the inability to reach agreements in the past, we must not \ngive up, my colleagues. We must not give up. We must continue to focus \non this greatest fiscal threat perhaps in the history of our country. \nIt is something we have a moral responsibility to tackle, a moral \nresponsibility to put our future careers in jeopardy by making the \nright choices. You know what, I think if we did that, the American \npeople are wise enough to know now that that would be rewarded rather \nthan condemned, that we would receive support for our future interest \nin elected office rather than rejection. The country understands maybe \nmore--or at least reacts to maybe more than we in this body do because \nyear after year after year we continue to fail to do what we all know \nwe need to do.\n\n  Despite the inability to reach agreements in the past, as I said, we \nshould not give up. The administration and the Congress must make tough \nfiscal choices now so future generations will have an opportunity to \nreach their potential and not be saddled with an even higher burden of \ndebt.\n  We must make reforms to our mandatory spending programs to tackle \nout-of-control Federal spending. Congress should also pass sensible \npolicies that will help create jobs and grow the economy. This is our \npriority and this is what need to do.\n  I will conclude by talking about the Republican budget plan that we \nhave begun to debate and will be debating this week and offering \namendments and ultimately voting by the end of the week.\n  We know that job creators and future entrepreneurs see today's large \ndebt levels as tomorrow's likely tax hikes, interest rate increases, \nand inflationary pressures. So we must lift the cloud of uncertainty \nthat is hanging over our economy. This is the first budget we have \ndebated on the Senate floor in 2 years. This is a budget plan that is \nso vital to the future of our economy and the future of America. We \nhave lacked such focused direction in the form of a budget over the \npast several years and that has hurt Americans. Americans need to know \nwhat is coming and what to expect. We need to move off of the word \n``certainty'' so that business owners, American families, and everyone \nengaged in this economy knows what the rules are, knows what is coming, \nand has a clear picture of where we stand even if there are some areas \nthat they are in disagreement with.\n  They need to know the Federal Government is carefully managing its \nspending and revenues. Every American family and business must have a \nbudget and live within their means, and it is about time Washington \ndoes the same.\n  I am pleased to be here talking about this Republican budget \nresolution that was led by the Senator from Wyoming, and many of us \nparticipated. I am not on that committee, but I commend them for the \nwork they have done in bringing forth a budget for us to talk about, \ndebate, amend, pass, and then live by. Certainly no budget is perfect. \nThis budget takes several important steps to putting our country back \non the right fiscal track.\n  Most importantly, this budget resolution balances the budget over 10 \nyears. We must stop spending more than we take in. We must move toward \na balanced budget. I have long been a proponent of a constitutional \namendment to require us to do this, as is done in many of our States. \nWe have to live up to the responsibilities of our oath to the \nConstitution and to not spend more than we take in. We do that in \nIndiana, and we have a successful economy and a successful legislature \nthat has made that the case, but it is severely and sorely lacking here \nin Washington.\n  In contrast to the Republican budget, the President's budget does not \ncome close to balancing the budget. In fact, for all of the \nadministration's praise of the short-term reductions in the annual \ndeficit, the President's budget predicts increases in deficits starting \nin 2018--yes, it is going to be dumped in somebody else's lap--and an \n$800 billion deficit in 2025.\n  Our Republican budget helps address the issue of underfunding the \nDepartment of Defense. It boosts defense spending by a necessary amount \nof money above the President's request because, along with the debt \nbomb, we have a terrorist bomb--potentially marrying terrorists with \nweapons of mass destruction--and a strong America and strong military \nare absolutely necessary to address the threats we see burgeoning all \nover the world today. Our budget addresses this specific question and \nstrengthens our national defense.\n  It helps preserve our safety net programs. It does not change Social \nSecurity, yet it will benefit Social Security by shoring up our broader \nfinances and achieving stronger economic growth and increased \nemployment.\n  In addition, the budget extends the solvency of the Medicare trust \nfund by calling for the same level of Medicare savings as called for by \nthe President. Let me be clear. Our budget does not call for the same \npolicies as the President. We would instead achieve these savings \nthrough policies based on free-market principles.\n  The budget also seeks to improve the Medicaid Program by increasing \nState flexibility, and it seeks to help economic growth by promoting \nseveral progrowth policies, including tax reform, reducing the impact \nof Federal regulations, promoting free trade, investing in \ninfrastructure, and enhancing U.S. energy security.\n  Finally, the Republican budget provides the means for addressing the \nflawed, confusing, distorted, tax-laden policy of ObamaCare. The repeal \nof ObamaCare provides flexibility to replace this disastrous law with \nhealth\n\n[[Page S1694]]\n\ncare solutions that bring down the cost of care and protect the \nvulnerable.\n  I will conclude by saying and reiterating what this Senate Republican \nbudget resolution accomplishes. It balances the budget in 10 years, \nensures flexibility for funding national defense, provides repeal and \nreplacement of ObamaCare, protects Americans from new tax hikes, \npreserves Social Security, extends Medicare trust fund solvency, \nimproves Medicaid, supports stronger economic growth, and enhances U.S. \nenergy security.\n  I am proud my Senate colleagues have drafted a plan to return our \nspending to a sustainable path toward a balanced budget, and I am \nhopeful this is the beginning of responsible action and look forward to \ndebating and passing the Republican budget this week.\n  Again, I commend the chairman and his committee for bringing forth a \nbudget that is sorely needed and will give Americans a clear picture of \na different path than this administration has proposed.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that on Monday, \nMarch 23, at 5:30 p.m., the Senate proceed to executive session to \nconsider the following nomination, Calendar No. 19; that the Senate \nthen vote without intervening action or debate on the nomination, the \nmotion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, that \nno further motions be in order, that any statements related to the \nnomination be printed in the Record, the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's actions, and the Senate then resume \nlegislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, writing and passing a budget is one of \nthe most fundamental responsibilities of any legislative body. \nUnfortunately, it is something we have not done in the U.S. Congress \nsince 2009. It is outrageous. It should be considered a scandal.\n  Today I will take a few minutes to discuss the budget we have before \nus today and how we intend to discharge our responsibilities to the \nAmerican people in the 114th Congress. Of course, one of the most \nimportant parts of a budget is that you have to determine what your \npriorities are--things you have to have, things you want but maybe need \nto defer, and things you want but maybe cannot afford.\n  When it comes to the budget Chairman Enzi and the Senate Budget \nCommittee have produced, our priority is clear. Our priority is to \nprotect the hard-working taxpayers of this country. Where do we start \nand how does the Senate Republican budget get America on the right \ntrack, boosting economic growth and job creation?\n  To start with, this budget actually balances and puts us on the path \nso we can begin to pay down our national debt, and it is important to \nsay that it does so without raising taxes. Those seem like pretty \nstraightforward goals for any budget, but unfortunately that has not \nbeen the case in recent years.\n  Throughout his 6 years in office and in the budgets he has sent to \nCongress, President Obama seems to be committed to the notion that the \nonly way Washington can revive strong economic growth is by steadily \ngrowing the government. Unfortunately, at the same time you end up \nadding to deficits and debt in the process.\n  Yes, it is true that we have had an experiment in the size and role \nof government over the last 6 years, and I must say we are no longer \ntalking about esoteric theories that were debated in the Federalist \nPapers or during the founding of our country. We now actually have hard \nevidence. We have things we can point to that show this has been a \nfailed experiment.\n  Under this administration, our national debt--and the bills, not that \nI will have to pay, but these young people and my children will have to \npay--has gone from $10.6 trillion to more than $18 trillion. I know \nthose numbers are almost meaningless to most of us because we simply \ncannot conceive of numbers that big.\n  The latest budget from the President adds another trillion in tax \nincreases and never balances--ever, while, in fact, the budget which \nwas voted out of the Budget Committee and is now before us on the floor \nof the Senate actually brings us a surplus, and the President's budget \nwould leave our country with a massive deficit of over $800 billion in \nits final year.\n  The last budget proposed by our friends across the aisle, Senate \nDemocrats in 2013, would have hit the economy with another $1 trillion \nin taxes and added more than $7 trillion to our national debt.\n  I believe, based on the failed experiment of the last few years, we \nshould conclude that just taxing and spending is not going to allow us \nto achieve the kind of prosperity and economic growth we all so badly \nwant. America's debt is a real danger, and one that apparently the \nPresident chooses to ignore, and our friends across the aisle, in their \nbudget proposals, seem to ignore it as well.\n  The reason our debt is so dangerous is because it makes us vulnerable \nto fiscal shocks and shocks to our national security and makes it much \nharder for us to respond to them, and our debt obviously costs money to \nservice. We need to pay interest to the people who buy our bonds, our \nnational debt, and when interest rates go back up from where they are \nnow, which is a historically low rate, more and more of the hard-earned \ntax dollars the American people will be paying to the Federal \nGovernment will be used not to pay down the debt but will be used to \npay interest on the debt to the people who own it, countries such as \nChina and other sovereign entities that purchase that debt. We will be \npaying interest on that debt in a way that makes us dangerously \nvulnerable not only to fiscal shock, but also crowds out our ability to \ndeal with other priorities, such as law enforcement, education, \nnational security, and the like.\n  Last year the Congressional Budget Office pointed out that in the \npast few years debt held by the public will be significantly greater \nrelative to the gross domestic product than at any time just after \nWorld War II. Our debt will be higher relative to our economy than at \nany time since World War II.\n  What does that mean to my fellow Texans? The CBO goes on to say that \nwith a debt so large, Federal spending on interest payments will \nincrease substantially as interest rates rise to more typical levels. \nThat is what I was just referring to. The other thing that happens is \nthat as the Federal Government's debt goes up, we basically reduce \nnational savings and capital stock at the same time and wages will be \nsmaller. In other words, our national massive debt is hurting economic \ngrowth today. It is hurting our economy, and it virtually assures that \nit will get worse in the days ahead.\n  The good news is it doesn't have to be that way, and this budget puts \nus on a path to balance and one that begins to pay down the debt, not \nadding to the debt with more taxing and spending along the way. And the \ngood news is we don't have to start from scratch and reinvent the \nwheel.\n  There are better options, many of which are reflected in the budget \nwe have proposed and will be voting on this week. There are policies \nand programs in the budget that we have borrowed which have proven to \nbe successful around the country in States such as Texas and others.\n  My State, in particular, has experienced an economic surge that has \nseen a boom in job creation and exports and it has been named the best \nState in the Nation in business 10 years running. Some people have \nactually called this the Texas miracle, but I take issue with that \ncharacterization. There is nothing miraculous about what has happened \nin Texas when we talk about the economy because you cannot explain a \nmiracle, but it is no secret why Texas has been one of the leading job \ncreation engines over the last several years. If we ask business \nleaders, they will tell us what makes Texas such an attractive place to \ndo business.\n\n  In Texas, we know we should not punish job creators with taxes that \ndiscourage investment and overregulation, which make it hard to make \nthe bottom line balance. We are not ashamed of our abundance of natural \nresources, nor are we apologetic about encouraging its development. The \nresults have been extraordinary.\n\n[[Page S1695]]\n\n  For example, Texas added nearly 460,000 jobs in 2014 alone--460,000 \njobs in 2014--more than any other State. Despite being home to about \n8.5 percent of the total U.S. population, Texas accounted for nearly \none-third of all new job gains during the last 10 years for the Nation. \nSimply put, what we have shown is what can be accomplished with sound \npublic policy that allows for job creation and economic prosperity, and \nthat is the good news. It is not a fluke. It is not a miracle. It is \nabout good policies actually working to benefit the people of my State \nand that could also be put to work for the American people.\n  We can take strategies that have worked in the States and lessons we \nhave learned in these laboratories of democracy and apply them here in \nWashington on a greater scale for the benefit of the entire Nation. \nSimply put, it boils down to lower taxes, sensible regulations, and a \nlower level of per capita government spending.\n  What happens under those conditions is that the private sector is \nwilling to invest, and when they invest, they create jobs and grow the \neconomy, and we all benefit, including the government, by increased tax \nrevenue. The government doesn't benefit, nor do the people benefit, \nwhen government policies discourage investment and job creation and \neconomic growth, which is what has been happening over the last few \nyears.\n  In the budget before us, which balances without tax hikes, we can \nprotect taxpayers and foster an economic environment that allows jobs \nand opportunity to blossom.\n  Gallup released a survey earlier this month that talked about the \nbiggest concerns facing the American people. The top concern was \ngovernment. They are concerned about their government. The second was \nthe economy, and the third was jobs. All three of those concerns \nactually tie neatly together because many Americans now feel they don't \nhave the same opportunities they once had. Maybe they have been laid \noff or had a tough time finding a new job that is as rewarding for them \npersonally and financially. Maybe they are actually working as hard as \nthey ever did, but they are actually making less money than they did 10 \nyears ago.\n  If people are deeply concerned, as I am, about the availability of \ngood jobs and the state of our economy, it only makes sense that people \nwould not be satisfied with the government as well. These concerns \ntranscend geographic, partisan, and demographic boundaries, and they \nare shared by Republicans, Democrats, and Independents alike.\n  Sadly, one of the statistics that hasn't gotten better over the last \nfew years, even though the unemployment rate has crept down, is the \npercentage of the American people--the workforce--who have actually \nleft the job market and given up looking for a job, and that remains at \na near historical high--about a 30-year high--the so-called labor \nparticipation rate. So when the unemployment rate goes down and we say, \nOh, that is a good thing, a lot of the reason it is going down is \nbecause fewer and fewer people are actually looking for work and they \nhave dropped out altogether. That is a bad thing.\n  Most people don't see themselves as future business owners; they \nsimply hope to find a good job doing something that provides them the \nability to put food on the table and to take care of their families, \nand that gives them a sense of satisfaction for a job well done. Yet, \nas we know, small businesses are the lifeblood of the economy, and it \nis the small businesses that actually help create the jobs that most \nhard-working taxpayers are occupied in. So if we are making it harder \nfor small businesses to create jobs, we are also making it harder on \nworkers to find jobs.\n  As I travel my State and talk to small business men and women, they \ntell me one of the biggest challenges they have had is something the \nPresident trumpets here in Washington as a grand success; that is, \nObamaCare because ObamaCare has been a job killer. This budget assumes \nfull repeal of ObamaCare, and it gives us the opportunity to make good \non our promises and finally remove one of the biggest roadblocks to job \ngrowth. Is that because we don't care about health care? Well, no; \nexactly the opposite. What we intend to do as a replacement is to \nreplace ObamaCare with affordable health care that provides people \naccess to the kind of quality care they want for themselves and their \nfamilies.\n  The irony of ObamaCare is that it spends and taxes so much, and yet \nstill 30 million people are uninsured. Many people find the health \ninsurance they purchased--even on the exchanges--has high premiums, \nwhich basically render them uninsured to the extent that they can't \neven afford it, and it has raised their premium costs by adding \nmandates for coverage they don't want and they don't need.\n  We can do much better.\n  Now, I have heard the President and some of his allies say, Well, we \nhave to have ObamaCare because we need to cover young adults up to the \nage of 26 who can be covered under their parents' policy or we need \nObamaCare because we need to cover people with preexisting conditions. \nThe fact is we can do both of those things. We will do both of those \nthings, and we don't need everything else that comes with it.\n  We also need to capitalize on an energy boom that is taking place \nacross the United States. This budget boosts development of American-\nmade energy. Unfortunately, the President decided to put his party and \nhis politics ahead of American job seekers recently when he vetoed a \nbipartisan bill to construct the Keystone XL Pipeline that the State \nDepartment said would create 42,000 jobs--construction jobs to start \nwith--and a number of other jobs thereafter. It would also provide an \nalternative means to transport oil from a friendly ally, Canada, and we \nwouldn't have to ship so much of it in railcars over the surface, which \nis admittedly a much more dangerous and volatile situation.\n  The President, when he vetoed the Keystone XL Pipeline, took \nbasically the opposite approach to what we have taken in my State and \nother States around the country, where we have seen our natural \nresources and the development of those natural resources as a way to \ngrow jobs and grow the economy.\n  In Texas, we have produced 94 percent more oil between September 2008 \nand September 2012. That has been primarily due to the innovation of \nthe oil and gas industry and the so-called shale oil and gas \nrevolution, which transformed States such as North Dakota and Texas, \nand in places such as Pennsylvania where the Marcellus shale exists. \nThe Eagle Ford, the Barnett, and the Haynesville shale plays in Texas \nhave been economic boons in my State and created thousands of jobs and \nadded hundreds of thousands of dollars to the tax rolls.\n  As my friends along the border of Texas and Mexico remind me, those \nnatural resources do not stop at the international border. Indeed, I \nwas recently in Mexico City with our colleague, Senator Kaine from \nVirginia, where we met with a number of oil and gas company \nrepresentatives at the American Chamber of Commerce in Mexico City, \ntalking about the change in the Mexican law which now will encourage \nprivate investment in developing their natural resources in Mexico. Of \ncourse, the better the Mexican economy does, the better our economy \ndoes, and the fewer people who feel as though they have to immigrate to \nthe United States in order to provide for their family.\n  This budget is a responsible budget. It balances in 10 years, it \ndoesn't raise taxes, and it begins a downpayment on our national debt. \nIt sends a very important message that the 114th Congress and the new \nmajority are very serious about discharging the most basic \nresponsibilities of governance--something that hasn't been done since \n2009, since the last time we had a budget, but we also learn from the \nStates when it comes to protecting taxpayers and removing barriers to \ngrowth and how that helps not only the small businesses but the people \nwho work at the jobs created by those small businesses.\n  In conclusion, there is one other thing this budget does. We know \nthat since the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the sequestration that \noccurred--the automatic caps on spending that occurred as a result of \nthe failure of the supercommittee to come up with a grand bargain--our \nNation has spent less and less on our national security. That has given \nrise not only to deep concerns by many of us, including the Presiding \nOfficer, about America's role\n\n[[Page S1696]]\n\nin the world and the message we are sending to our adversaries, but it \nalso raises the question of what is the primary purpose--what should be \nthe No. 1 priority of the Federal Government? I believe, and I think \nmany of us believe, that national security is the most important \npriority of the Federal Government. We have kind of lost sight of that \nin recent years with the budget caps and sequestration. We have tried \nto be responsible about spending. Unfortunately, with an unhelpful \npartner in the White House, sequestration seemed to be the only way we \ncould keep a cap on runaway discretionary spending, higher deficits, \nand greater debt. But I think now is the time for this Congress to step \nup and say that national security is our No. 1 priority. This budget \ndoes just that, and it provides additional resources necessary for the \nDepartment of Defense to make sure we not only maintain our status as \nthe preeminent military power in the world but also keep our commitment \nto our military families and those who have chosen to make the armed \nservices a career.\n  We also send a very important message to our adversaries that America \nwill not shrink or retreat from its leadership role on the world stage. \nUnfortunately, I think as a result of not only our budgetary decisions \nbut also a number of missteps and missed signals by the administration, \nsome of our adversaries have gotten the idea we are in retreat and that \nwe are somehow pulling back and going to be rendered a spectator rather \nthan a leader on the world stage. Perhaps the single most important \nthing this budget does is it says, America is back as the leader of the \nfree world and we will not shrink and we will not turn our back on our \nresponsibility not only to ourselves and our people but to our friends \nand allies across the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, in a moment I am going to yield for \nSenator Kaine, but before I do that, I just want to make a few points \nbased on the remarks from my friend, the Senator from Texas, Mr. \nCornyn.\n  When Senator Cornyn talked about military spending--and how much we \nshould spend on the military is a very important debate. We now spend \nmore money than the next nine countries combined. But as we talk about \nthe deficit and the debt, I would remind my colleagues and the American \npeople that one of the reasons our national debt is at $18 trillion and \none of the reasons our deficit is as high as it is is because under \nPresident Bush, we went to war in Iraq and we went to war in \nAfghanistan, and we put those wars on the credit card. We didn't pay \nfor them.\n  On Thursday, at the Senate Budget Committee meeting, an amendment was \npassed to add another $38 billion of defense spending to the deficit. \nSo I have a little bit of a problem understanding all of my Republican \nfriends coming down here and saying: We are really concerned about the \ndeficit and the debt. We are going to have to cut back on Head Start. \nWe are going to have to cut back on health care. We are going to have \nto cut back on the Meals On Wheels programs for seniors. We are going \nto have to cut back on Pell grants, making it harder for young people \nto go to college. We just can't afford those things anymore because the \ndeficit is so high. But, when it comes to military spending, we don't \nhave to worry about the deficit at all.\n  I have a real problem with that, and I suspect that within the next \ncouple of days there will be an amendment on the floor which makes it \nvery clear that if people want to go into another war--and I certainly \nhope we do not go into another war; I think two wars is quite enough--\nbut if people want to vote for another war, they are going to have to \npay for that war and not pass that debt on to our kids and our \ngrandchildren.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor for the Senator from \nVirginia, Mr. Kaine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Thank you, Madam President. I thank my colleague from \nVermont who has done an able job as the ranking member on the Budget \nCommittee.\n  I rise today to talk about the budget resolution that we are \nconsidering on the floor of the Senate this week.\n  I came to the Senate in 2013 with a background as a mayor and a \nGovernor. I believe in getting budgets done and getting them done on \ntime. Doing budgets under regular order is an important priority, and I \nhave enjoyed and look forward to more work with colleagues on budgeting \nmatters.\n  Quickly, we have been in a budget crisis of our own making in \nCongress. It is not someone else's fault. It is not the President's \nfault. The budget crisis we have been in has been of Congress's making. \nIn August of 2011, when one House pushed the country to the verge of \ndefaulting on our debt for the first time in our history, in order not \nto default we came up with the idea of the sequester. This was before I \nwas in the Senate, but the basic idea was this: Let's impose punishing \nacross-the-board cuts on all of these Federal spending levels to begin \nin March of 2013 to force us to try to come up with a better deal. I \ncall that ``let's try to do something good, and if we don't, then let's \ndo something really stupid.'' I don't know that this is a principle you \nshould ever apply.\n  When I came to the Senate on the verge of sequester going into \neffect, my first floor speech as a Senator and one of my first votes \nwas this: OK, we didn't find the budget deal that some wanted, but \nlet's not do something stupid. Let's not embrace the sequester and hurt \npriorities that matter to people every day. Sadly, we couldn't get the \n60 votes to cut off the sequester in the Senate. So since March of \n2013, we have been in sequester mode. I said in committee and I will \nsay again: The sequester violates every good principle of budgeting I \nhave learned as either a public sector budgeter as a mayor and a \nGovernor or as a private sector budgeter managing a multinational law \nfirm with lawyers on three continents. Nobody would do budgeting this \nway. The United States, because of Congress, is doing budgeting this \nway, and I think we need to come up with a better solution.\n  During the last Congress we did find a better solution. It wasn't a \nperfect solution, but the Murray-Ryan budget act did a 2-year budgetary \nframework that eliminated half of these punishing sequester cuts and \ngave a significant lift to the economy.\n  The economy has generally been pretty strong, cutting deficits but \nalso avoiding some of the mindless austerity that full sequester means.\n  A good budget for the country--and I am sad to say that the budget we \nwill be debating on the floor this week is not a good budget for the \ncountry--but a good budget for the country would do a couple of things. \nIt would put the promotion of growth and jobs first. The best \nantideficit strategy--if that is what you are interested in--is \npromoting a strong economy, and job growth would be the first priority. \nSecond, we would replace a mindless across-the-board sequester with a \nmore targeted approach. If we did that, we could credibly reduce \ndeficits rather than reducing deficits in a way that hurts the economy \nand punishes programs that matter to people.\n  The economy and jobs side, we will grow the economy and grow jobs if \nwe do things such as moving away from unnecessary austerity and \npromoting infrastructure. My colleague from Vermont has a strong \nproposal about infrastructure that we debated in committee and we will \nbe debating this week. If you did infrastructure and other investments \nin human capital, you could credibly reduce sequester and increase \njobs. We could also increase jobs if we had a tax code that didn't \npunish work, that didn't punish labor, wages, and salary the way this \none does.\n  The second way would be to restore key spending priorities and \nreplace sequester with a targeted approach. We should be focusing on a \nbudget that maintains a strong national defense; that keeps our \npromises to veterans; that invests in education, especially important \nprograms such as Head Start, pre-K, and college affordability.\n\n[[Page S1697]]\n\nWe can protect Federal employees, we can protect programs for people of \nlow and moderate incomes, such as SNAP or Pell grants, and we could \nensure the environment is protected if we followed targeted strategies. \nThat would be better.\n  Finally, growing the economy and pursuing targeted budget strategies \nwould enable us to credibly reduce the deficit. It is important to note \nthat the deficit has been coming down since the Murray-Ryan budget deal \nwas done, and that is important. But that is not the budget that will \nbe on the floor this week.\n  Last Thursday we voted a budget out of committee. It was a long day \nof debating and voting. I was able to support a number of amendments, \nand I had some of my own and others that were passed, and I appreciate \nthem. But I ultimately voted against the budget, and unless there will \nbe dramatic changes on the floor of the Senate, I will, in all \nlikelihood, be voting against the budget for the following reasons:\n  First, the budget before us proposes cuts to nondefense discretionary \nprograms--education, infrastructure, research--the nondefense, \nnoninterest, nonentitlement programs that are about 14 to 15 percent of \nthe Federal budget. It proposes not just cutting those to full \nsequester levels but cutting them by an additional $236 billion over 10 \nyears. Even the sequester levels are untenable, slashing these programs \neven further to make college more expensive, to spend less on \ninfrastructure, and to spend less on research. It is foolish for the \nNation.\n  The budget proposes $4 trillion in unspecified cuts to programs such \nas Medicare and Medicaid, but it only includes a budget reconciliation \ninstruction totaling $2 billion, which leaves a very unusual gap in the \nterms of how we are going to find magically the $4 trillion in cuts. \nThe budget depends on gimmicks and sort of magic tricks to achieve \nbalance, when we are not really achieving balance.\n  It uses outdated baseline proposals by the CBO. We just had CBO \nnumbers come in this March from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice, showing that the country, because of an improving economy, is \npoised to collect more revenue and poised to spend less on some key \nprograms. Instead of using that baseline data--the March data--the \nbudget we worked on in committee used worse January data to make the \nsituation seem more dire than it is. I don't know why we would do this. \nWe should use the most updated numbers.\n  Finally, I voted against the budget because it contained a critical \ndishonesty. It proposed to do two things simultaneously that violate \nthe basic laws of physics. The two measures are this: First we are \ngoing to entirely repeal the Affordable Care Act. However, all the \ntaxes we are collecting from companies and people to pay for the \nAffordable Care Act--we are going to keep all of those in the budget. \nSo we will repeal all of the benefits, all of the coverage, all of the \nprotection that tens of millions of Americans get under the Affordable \nCare Act, but we will keep taxing people and companies and keep all \nthat tax revenue in the budget. Clearly, both of those things are not \ngoing to happen. So the budget has this air of unreality about it.\n  But to me, the unreality of the numbers is even dwarfed in importance \nby just the flat statement that we are going to repeal the Affordable \nCare Act. There are many things I can say about the Affordable Care \nAct. Why don't I just pick one? That is that 16.4 million Americans are \nreceiving insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act. What does \nthis budget say will happen to those 16.4 million Americans? The budget \ndoesn't say. It has no plan for providing that they will be able to \nhave health insurance.\n  Taking away health insurance from 16.4 million Americans, many of \nwhom have it for the first time in their lives, is no small issue. That \nnumber is a big number. Sometimes big numbers just sound like big \nnumbers. Let me put it in context. How many Americans are 16.4 million \npeople? Well, 16.4 million people with health insurance is the entire \ncombined population of Wyoming, the District of Columbia, Vermont, \nNorth Dakota, Alaska, South Dakota, Delaware, Montana, Rhode Island, \nNew Hampshire, Maine, Hawaii, Idaho, Nebraska, and West Virginia. That \nis 14 States and the District of Columbia. The entire combined \npopulation from birth to death in those 15 jurisdictions is what 16.4 \nmillion American people are. What this budget proposes is to reach in \nand strip away health insurance from every last one of those 16.4 \nmillion people without a proposal, without a plan, without even any \nindication of how we would tackle this problem.\n  I refuse to be a part of that. I refuse to contemplate voting for \nthat. I have had too much experience with people who don't have health \ninsurance to push willingly people back into the shadows when they have \nhad health insurance for the first time in their life.\n  I know the Presiding Officer understands this. We all do. Health \ninsurance is about two things. It is about health, but it is also about \nassurance. So if you are sick, if you are in an accident, if your wife \nis in an accident, if your kids are sick, you have to have this so that \nyou can receive health care, so that you can receive treatment. But \nwhen you are not sick and when you haven't been in an accident, you \nstill go to bed worrying about what will happen to your children if \nthey get into an accident, what will happen to your wife if she gets \nill. Even when you are healthy, the absence of health insurance imposes \nan anxiety--especially on parents--that is very, very severe.\n  So I will not be part of a budget that tells 16.4 million people--the \ncombined population of 14 States and the District of Columbia--that \nwhile you may have had this health insurance for the first time in your \nlife, we are now going to take it away from you without a plan to help \nyou have the assurance and the peace of mind and the protection of your \nhealth that you have under existing law.\n  We should not step backward. We should always step forward. Can we \nfind improvements? Of course we can. But we shouldn't step backward. \nThat is why I voted against the budget in committee, and that is why I \nam likely, absent major change, to vote against it on the floor.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank Senator Kaine for his outstanding work on the \ncommittee and for his very cogent remarks.\n  In the Republican budget, we don't have to talk about protecting \nabsurd loopholes for large corporations and for the wealthiest people \nin this country. We don't have to talk about significant cuts in Head \nStart, making it harder for working families to send their kids to that \nvery important program. We don't have to talk about cuts in the Pell \ngrant program, some $90 billion in mandatory funding, making it harder \nfor working families to send their kids to college. We don't have to \ntalk about raising taxes on working families by allowing the earned-\nincome tax credit and the children's tax credit to expire. We don't \neven have to talk about that. All we have to do is to hear what Senator \nKaine just said.\n  Does anybody in America think it makes sense to tell 16 million men, \nwomen, and children--who today have health insurance, some for the \nfirst time in their lives--that they are going to lose that health \ninsurance, but, by the way, we will continue to collect the taxes from \nthe Affordable Care Act?\n  Does anyone take that proposal seriously--throwing 16 million people \noff of health insurance, the equivalent of, what was it, the 15 \nsmallest States in America--and having no plan with what to do with \nthese people?\n  On the surface, I think the Republican budget makes no sense at all \nand has a very warped sense of priorities in terms of protecting the \nwealthiest people in this country--the largest corporations--but \nsticking it to the middle-class and working families.\n  Senator Kaine mentioned that one of the areas that we, in fact, are \ngoing to focus on is the need to create jobs. I think all of us who are \nnot particularly partisan are aware of the fact that the economy today \nis a lot better than it was when President Bush left office and we were \nhemorrhaging 800,000 jobs a month. Is the economy where we would like \nit to be today? I don't think anyone believes that. But have we made \nsome significant progress in the last 6, 6\\1/2\\ years? Yes, I think we \nhave.\n\n[[Page S1698]]\n\n  But having said that, let's be clear. If you look at the unemployment \nrates, unemployment in this country is not 5\\1/2\\ percent. Real \nunemployment is close to 11 percent. Youth unemployment, which we never \ntalk about at all, is somewhere around 17 percent, and African-American \nyouth unemployment is off the charts.\n  In addition to that, we have another major problem. That is, our \ninfrastructure is crumbling. So what many of us think we should be \ndoing is that at a time when our roads, bridges, rail systems, water \nplants, wastewater plants, dams, levees, and airports need a huge \namount of work, and at a time when real unemployment is much higher \nthan it should be--well, what about a commonsense approach which says: \nLet's start rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure and let us put \nAmericans back to work?\n  Do you know what, that is what the American people want. On every \npoll I have seen, the top priority of the American people--Democrats, \nRepublicans, Independents--is the economy, create jobs, raise wages, \nand that is what we should be doing.\n  In about 1 hour or so I will officially offer an amendment which \nwill, in fact, rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and create many \nmillions of decent-paying jobs.\n  In terms of infrastructure, which is a fancy word for roads, bridges, \nwater systems, rail, and so forth, I don't think you have to be a Ph.D. \nin infrastructure to know our infrastructure is really in quite bad \nshape. Every day somebody gets into a car--whether it is in Vermont or \nWashington, DC--and you see that pothole that takes away half of your \naxle, that is what infrastructure is about.\n  When you are in a traffic jam because the road is inadequate to deal \nwith traffic, that is called infrastructure.\n  When your water pipes in your town are bursting and flooding \ndowntown, that is called infrastructure.\n  The truth is that for too many years Congress has dramatically \nunderfunded the maintenance and improvement of the physical \ninfrastructure our economy depends upon. That has to change, and that \nis why I will be introducing an amendment to invest $478 billion over 6 \nyears to modernize our infrastructure.\n  How will we pay for that? Will we pay for it by throwing children off \nof Head Start? Will we pay for it by throwing people off of the \nAffordable Care Act? No. We are going to pay for it in the right way, \nand that is to close tax loopholes that allow corporations and \nbillionaires to shift their profits to the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, and \nother tax havens. So instead of having these corporations putting their \nmoney in tax havens--paying zero in Federal income tax--and at a time \nwhen we are losing about $100 billion a year without reason, we are \ngoing to ask these corporations to start paying their fair share of \ntaxes, and then we are going to use that money to repair our crumbling \ninfrastructure and put millions of people back to work.\n  This amendment--by the way, I will tell you personally I have \nintroduced legislation that is more expansive than this, but because I \nwant all of the Members of the Senate to be supporting this, I have \ntailored it down a little bit, and we are talking about $478 billion \nover 6 years. This amendment will support more than 9 million good-\npaying jobs over 6 years, more than 1.5 million jobs a year. This is \nmoney that not only creates jobs and rebuilds our infrastructure, it \nmakes the country more productive, more efficient, and safer.\n  Right now, Larry Summers, the former Treasury Secretary, makes the \npoint that if we take into account the impact of depreciation, our net \ninvestment in infrastructure is actually closer to zero of GDP, zero \npercent. In other words, what we are spending our money on is not \nrebuilding new infrastructure but replacing and patching old \ninfrastructure.\n  The sad truth is that as a nation we are falling further and further \nbehind. Throughout China, multibillion-dollar projects are underway to \nbuild new bridges, airports, tunnels, an $80 billion water project, and \nhigh-speed rail lines--in China, not in the United States.\n  This past November, China approved nearly $115 billion for 21 \nadditional major infrastructure projects. While we are debating, while \nwe refuse to invest in our crumbling infrastructure, China is doing \njust that--in spades.\n  It is no surprise that the World Economic Forum's Global \nCompetitiveness Report now ranks our overall infrastructure at 12th in \nthe world--12th in the world. That is down from seventh place a decade \nago. There was once a time when the United States had an infrastructure \nthat was the envy of the world. Now we are in 12th place.\n  Let's take a look at some of the problems we face and why we need to \ninvest in infrastructure.\n  One out of every nine bridges in this country is structurally \ndeficient, and nearly one-quarter are functionally obsolete. We need to \nrebuild crumbling bridges.\n  Almost one-third of our roads are in poor or mediocre condition, and \nnearly 42 percent of all urban highways are congested. We need to \nrebuild crumbling roads.\n  Transit systems across the country are struggling to address deferred \nmaintenance, even as ridership steadily increases. People want to take \nadvantage of transit, to get to work on transit, and yet the transit \nauthorities are deferring maintenance because of limited funds.\n  Meanwhile, nearly 45 percent of American households lack any \nmeaningful access to transit, which is a huge problem in rural areas \nacross the country, including the State of Vermont. In Vermont, in most \ncases you have one way to get to work and only one way: That is in your \nautomobile.\n  The amendment I would be offering also creates a national \ninfrastructure bank. This idea, championed in the past by Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle, will leverage private capital to finance more \nthan $250 billion in transportation, energy, environmental, and \ntelecommunications projects.\n  My amendment will also greatly expand credit assistance to projects \nof national and regional significance through the TIFIA Program, long \nchampioned by my good friend from California, Senator Barbara Boxer.\n  It will boost funding for the highly competitive TIGER Program that \nfunds locally sponsored transportation projects across the country that \nincrease economic competitiveness and promote economic innovations.\n  But we all know our infrastructure problems are not just limited to \nroads, bridges, and transit. Much of our Nation's rail system is \nobsolete, even though our energy-efficient railroads move more freight \nthan ever and Amtrak's ridership has never been higher.\n  While we debate the merits of high-speed rail in Congress, countries \nacross Europe and Asia have gone ahead and built vast high-speed \nnetworks. Guess what. They work. High-speed rail trains relieve \ncongestion on roads, airports, and whisk people around quickly and \nefficiently.\n  China has already 12,000 miles of track with trains that run at least \n125 miles per hour and several thousand miles with trains that can \ntravel at 200 miles per hour. Meanwhile, the Acela, Amtrak's fastest \ntrain, travels at an average speed of just 65 miles per hour.\n  This amendment will invest $12 billion to make much-needed \ninvestments to upgrade our passenger and freight rail lines, and to \nmove people and goods more quickly and efficiently.\n  It is time for America to catch up with the rest of the world. There \nwas once a time when we were No. 1 in infrastructure. Today we are No. \n12.\n  I hear my friends on the other side talking about the debt we are \ngoing to be leaving our kids and our grandchildren, while we are going \nto be leaving them a crumbling infrastructure which at some point \nsomebody is going to have to pay for unless we get our act together \nnow.\n  America's airports are bursting at the seams as the number of \npassengers and cargo grows. The Airports Council International--North \nAmerica says America needs $76 billion over the next 5 years to \naccommodate growth in passengers and cargo activity and to rehabilitate \nexisting facilities.\n  Moreover, and rather incredibly, our airports still rely on \nantiquated 1960s radar technology because Congress chronically \nunderfunds deployment of a new satellite-based air traffic control \nsystem.\n  This amendment will invest $6 billion to improve airports across the \ncountry. It will invest another $6 billion to\n\n[[Page S1699]]\n\nbring our air traffic control system into the 21st century by \naccelerating deployment of NextGen technology that will make our skies \nsafer and our airports more efficient. Anyone, as many of us do, who \ntravels, who flies a lot, knows our airports need to be more efficient \nthan they are.\n  Bottlenecks at our marine seaports, which handle 95 percent of all \noverseas imports and exports, cause delays that prevent goods from \ngetting to their destinations on time. The same is true--perhaps even \nmore so--for our inland waterways, which carry the equivalent of 50 \nmillion truck trips of goods each year.\n  My amendment will invest an additional $1 billion a year to clear the \nbacklog of projects needed to improve inland waterways, coastal \nharbors, and shipping channels. Our businesses simply can't compete in \nthe global economy if they can't move their goods and supplies to, \nfrom, and within our country more efficiently.\n  Right now, more than 4,000 of the Nation's 84,000 dams are considered \ndeficient--not in need of a few repairs, but deficient--serious \nproblems.\n  Even worse, one of every 11 levees has been rated as likely to fail \nduring a major flood. I will talk a little more about this issue in a \nfew minutes as this is something that could concern everyone in the \nSenate.\n  My amendment will invest $5 billion a year to repair and improve the \nhigh hazard dams that provide flood control, drinking water, \nirrigation, hydropower, and recreation across the country, and the \nflood levees that protect our cities and our farms.\n  Much of our drinking water infrastructure is nearing the end of its \nuseful life. I like to tell the story of Rutland, VT. A few years ago \nthat city--one of the largest in Vermont--had water pipes that were \nbuilt before the Civil War--before the Civil War--and I think that is \nnot all that uncommon. Cities and towns all over this country, in many \ninstances, have pipes that go way, way, way back and are constantly \nbreaking and causing serious leaks.\n  Each year, there are nearly one-quarter million water main breaks \nwith the loss of 7 billion gallons of freshwater. Let me repeat that: \nEach year, there are nearly one-quarter million water main breaks with \nthe loss of 7 billion gallons of freshwater. But that is nothing \ncompared to the amount of water we lose through leaky pipes and faulty \nmeters. In all, the American Water Works Association estimates that we \nlose 2.1 trillion gallons of treated drinking water every year--2.1 \ntrillion gallons. Clearly, this is an issue that cannot continue to be \ndelayed. We have to address that.\n  Our wastewater treatment plants aren't in much better shape than our \nfreshwater pipes are. Almost 10 billion gallons of raw sewage is dumped \ninto our Nation's waterways every year when plants fail or pipes burst, \noften during heavy rains. My amendment would invest $2 billion a year \nso States can improve the drinking water systems that provide Americans \nwith clean, safe water.\n  The amendment would similarly invest $2 billion a year to improve the \nwastewater and storm water infrastructure that protects water quality \nin our Nation's rivers and lakes.\n  America's aging electrical grid consists of a patchwork system of \ninterconnected power generation transmission and distribution \nfacilities, some of which date back to the early 1900s. Not \nsurprisingly, the grid suffers from hundreds of major power failures \nevery year, many of which are avoidable. Our grid is simply not up to \nthe 21st century challenges it faces, including resiliency to cyber \nattacks. It is no wonder the World Economic Forum ranks our electric \ngrid at just 24th in the world, in terms of reliability, just behind \nBarbados.\n  My amendment will invest $3 billion a year for power transmission and \ndistribution modernization projects to improve the reliability and \nresiliency of our ever more complex electric power grid. This \ninvestment will also position our grid to accept new sources of locally \ngenerated renewable energy and will address critical vulnerabilities to \ncyber attacks, an issue of great concern to many of us.\n  Another area where we are falling behind is Internet access and \nspeed, and this is especially important to rural States such as \nVermont. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the \nOECD, ranks the United States 16th in the world in terms of broadband \naccess--16th in the world in terms of broadband success--not something \nwe should be terribly proud of. We are only marginally better in terms \nof average broadband speed--12th in the world, according to Akamai's \n2014 annual report.\n  How can it be that businesses, schools and families in Bucharest, \nRomania, have access to much faster Internet than most of the United \nStates of America?\n  My amendment will invest $2 billion a year to expand high-speed \nbroadband networks in underserved and unserved areas and to boost \nspeeds and capacity all across this country. Let us be clear: Internet \naccess is no longer a luxury, it is essential for 21st century \ncommerce, for education, for telemedicine, and for public safety. We \ncannot continue to lag behind many of our global competitors in terms \nof broadband quality and access.\n  That is a brief summary of what my amendment does. It addresses a \nchronic funding shortfall. It addresses the need to start the kinds of \ninvestments we need to bring our physical infrastructure into the 21st \ncentury. If $478 billion over 6 years sounds like a lot of money, \nplease consider this: The American Society of Civil Engineers--the \npeople who actually know the most about the state of America's \ninfrastructure--says we need to invest $3.6 trillion by 2020 just to \nget our Nation's infrastructure to a state of good repairs. So this \namendment is a good start, but that is all it is. It is a good start. \nMuch more has to be done.\n  Let me conclude by asking my fellow Americans to imagine an America \nwhere millions of people in our 50 States are hard at work earning good \nwages rebuilding our crumbling bridges, making our roads much better, \ndealing with wastewater plants, dealing with water systems, and dealing \nwith our rail system. Think about what America looks like when we \ncreate an infrastructure that is 21st century.\n  Our job right now is to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. As a \nformer mayor, I can absolutely assure you infrastructure does not get \nbetter all by itself. You can't turn around and ignore it and think it \ngets better. Quite the contrary, it gets worse. If you have a bridge \nright now which is in serious disrepair, it does not get better by \nignoring it. It only gets worse, and in fact it ends up costing more \nmoney to rebuild it as it deteriorates.\n  So we have an opportunity right now. We have an opportunity to make \nour country more efficient, more productive, and safer by creating a \n21st century infrastructure, and at the same time we have an \nopportunity to create millions of decent-paying jobs. In many respects, \nthis is a no-brainer. This amendment is paid for by ending outrageous \ncorporate loopholes that allow large profitable corporations from \npaying any Federal income tax. So I hope we will have wide bipartisan \nsupport for this amendment, which, as I understand it, will be voted on \ntomorrow, and I will officially bring it up in about half an hour.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I am going to talk about the fifth \nannual celebration of Congress Week, sponsored by the Association of \nCenters for the Study of Congress. It is a national commemoration which \ncoincides with the week in which Congress achieved its first quorums in \nthe year 1789.\n  Before I do so, let me make a couple of observations on other items \nof business in front of the Senate. First of all, we are about to \nembark on the annual process of adopting a budget. This Senator had the \nprivilege as a young Congressman in my first year in the House of being \nassigned to the House Budget Committee. That was not long after the \nwhole apparatus of the Budget Committees were set up requiring Congress \nto adopt an annual budget. The original reason for requiring it, and \nrequiring a process called reconciliation,\n\n[[Page S1700]]\n\nwas so a majority vote--instead of what used to be the Senate cutting \noff debate at two-thirds, now it is 60 votes to cut off debate--would \nbe required to pass a budget because of the tough decisions that needed \nto be made in lowering a deficit by cutting spending and raising tax \nrevenue.\n  But along come the administrations in the early part of the last \ndecade, and they reversed the process, using reconciliation not to \nrequire the hard votes for Senators and House Members in raising tax \nrevenue but to do exactly the opposite with a majority vote, instead of \nhaving to reach the 60-vote threshold to cut off debate in the Senate.\n  So as the decade started, after the administration in 2000 \ntransferred over to the new administration in 2001, with a healthy \nsurplus, lo and behold the budget, in the course of the next almost \ndecade, went completely out of whack. Instead of revenues being up and \nspending being here on a bar graph--the difference being the surplus of \nmore coming in each year--it went in exactly the opposite \ndirection. The tax revenues fell off so significantly because of the \ntax policies adopted through that budgetary reconciliation process in \nabout the year 2001. The tax revenues fell off, the spending increased, \nand we went to huge annual deficits.\n\n  I don't know what the majority is going to try to use reconciliation \nfor this time, but this Senator is looking for balance and common sense \nand taking care of the needs that government needs to provide--provide \nfor the national security; provide for those who are the least \nfortunate among us; provide for what a society with a big heart like in \nAmerica, reflected by the people who are elected in its representative \ngovernment--to reflect the American people with a big heart and to keep \nour fiscal house in order.\n  So as we start this process, I think we ought to be listening to \nSenator Sanders, the ranking member of the Budget Committee. We ought \nto be listening to the members of the Budget Committee. I have served \non that committee up through this last Congress for 14 years. It is an \nimportant process, and it can be effective if it is not misused. That \nprocess was misused when it took us from a position of huge surpluses \nin the 1990s, up through 2000, to exactly the opposite, huge annual \ndeficits.\n\n\n                            Airport Security\n\n  Madam President, I wish to mention another item I had occasion to be \ninvolved in over the weekend. If we go back to the latter part of last \nyear, there was a 6-month period--if you can believe this--that guns \nwere being smuggled onto commercial aircraft flying from Atlanta \nHartsfield to New York City, where they were then sold on the streets \nin Brooklyn.\n  We might say: Well, if this criminal ring is selling guns in a State \nthat does not allow the possession of guns--New York--why wouldn't they \njust run them up I-95 in a car or a truck? Because law enforcement was \non to that. So they devised this ingenious scheme where instead they \nwere bringing the guns into the passenger cabin of a commercial \nairliner--not once but over a 6-month period--and hundreds of guns were \ntransported right in the passenger cabin.\n  Here is how the scheme worked: One perpetrator would go through TSA \nsecurity with an empty knapsack, a backpack. Another perpetrator would \ngo through security--because there was not an actual check of whether \nthat airport employee at the Atlanta airport in fact had any \ncontraband, he could get into the area underneath the aircraft, go up \ninto the secure area for passengers, go into the men's room, and \ntransfer the guns to the fellow with the empty backpack who had already \ncome through security with TSA. They transferred--if you can believe \nit--an AK-47. At the time they finally picked up this fellow in \nDecember of last year, he had 16 handguns in his backpack.\n  Naturally, in our responsibility and as the ranking member of the \ncommerce committee, I wanted to get into this. What I found is that \nthey weren't doing those secure checks--like we do when we go through \nTSA as a passenger--in the perimeter of the airport for the thousands \nof employees who work at the airport. That is how they got the guns in \nand then did this scheme of transferring the guns. It is a good thing \nthe perpetrator was a criminal, not a terrorist, because we can imagine \nwhat it would be like had he been a terrorist.\n  So what are the airports going to do about it? I would suggest they \nought to take a look at the Orlando airport and also the Miami airport. \nThis Senator visited the Orlando airport over the weekend. They took \nhundreds of entry points at the airport for their employees and boiled \nthem down to a handful--specifically, 7 entry points for about 6,000 \nemployees at the Orlando airport. They put up the metal detection \ndevices, the conveyer belt that takes backpacks through the machine, \nthat looks at their backpacks to see if there is any contraband, et \ncetera. So it was not financially prohibitive when they boiled down the \nnumber of entry points for their employees to a manageable number. A \nsimilar thing was done at the Miami airport.\n  As a result, it has at first blush the appearance that this is a way \nof solving the problem. Now, sooner or later, if this kind of scheme \nhappens in another airport, it is going to be absolutely unacceptable \nand intolerable as to what happened in the Atlanta airport.\n  The question is, What about employees losing their badges and \nsomebody grabbing the badge and utilizing it? Well, at these screening \npoints, they swipe their badge, but the officers in that reduced number \nof entry points for airport employees are checking the badge, looking \nat the picture on the badge and the person with the badge, and then \nhaving the holder of the badge go over and enter a personal \nidentification number--a PIN number--as another safeguard before going \ninto the secure area of the airport.\n  We are going to have to do this. There is no excuse for what happened \nin Atlanta.\n\n\n                             Congress Week\n\n  Madam President, now I would like to speak about this great fifth \nannual celebration of Congress Week, and it goes back to when Congress \nfirst started in 1789, the very first quorums this Congress had. The \nbirth of the Congress was not on a single day or an event, but it was a \nprocess of deliberation in the Federal Government that met in the \nspring and summer of 1787. They hashed out the Constitution, which \nprovided for Congress to convene on March 4, 1789. On that date in New \nYork City, which was the temporary capital at the time, the first \nmeeting place of the Congress, cannons fired and church bells rang to \nannounce the birth of the new Congress, but only a few Members of \nCongress had arrived by that date. Weeks passed before the House \nachieved its first quorum on April 1, with the Senate not getting a \nquorum until 5 days later on April 6. The House and Senate met jointly \non April 6 in the Senate Chamber to count the ballots of the \nPresidential electors.\n  So Congress Week's theme, ``The People's Branch,'' reflects and \nemphasizes that Congress is the part of the government designed to be \nclosest to the people and the most likely to reflect the sentiment of \nthe people--because it is those of us in the Halls of the House and the \nSenate who go back home and are directly reflective and responsible to \nour constituencies.\n  We try to keep historical records of all of this. Our congressional \npapers are some of the richest sources for the study of national \naffairs, local history, regional issues, and, of course, for American \nhistory. They document the legislative branch, and they document the \nhistory and foreign affairs of the country. It is imperative that we \nmanage and preserve our own papers for future historical research and \nstudy of democracy.\n  The Association of Centers for the Study of Congress, founded in \n2003, is an independent, nonpartisan alliance of more than 40 \norganizations and institutions that preserve the papers of Members of \nCongress and promote a wide range of programs and research \nopportunities related to Congress. James Madison said that an informed \ncitizenry was the best guarantee that this Nation's great experiment in \nrepresentative democracy would work and survive for future generations.\n  So I want to call Congress Week to the attention of the Senate and to \nthe Nation's public--awareness of the rich and colorful history of \nrepresentative democracy through the institution of\n\n[[Page S1701]]\n\nthe United States Congress. I encourage our colleagues to preserve \ntheir records and the history of the individuals who make up this great \ninstitution.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan, Ms. Stabenow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, first I thank the distinguished \nSenator from Vermont for his advocacy, passion, and hard work in laying \nout what this is all about.\n  I also appreciate the work of the distinguished chair, even though we \nhave disagreements on the budget, because this is really an opportunity \nwe have to create a serious budget--a serious budget that gives every \nAmerican a fair shot to work hard and to get ahead and the opportunity \nto strengthen the middle class of our country. But that is not what is \nhappening here.\n  What America needs is a middle-class budget. Unfortunately, instead, \nwhat we have is a budget that continues to rig the system on behalf of \nthe wealthy and the well-connected. This budget does not close \ncorporate tax loopholes or end practices such as inversions that take \nour jobs overseas. It doesn't even address the folks who pack up and \nleave the country and let taxpayers and workers pay the tab for the \nmove.\n\n  This budget does not help us address our crumbling infrastructure, \nwhich is a burden on our workers and a drag on the economy. Frankly, if \nwe address that, as our ranking Member has urged, we will create a lot \nof good-paying jobs, millions of middle-class jobs.\n  This budget does not invest in a meaningful way in education and \nopportunity for the future, which is the key to equipping our workers \nto excel in the global economy we all face, nor does it help make \ncollege tuition more affordable or help the millions of Americans who \nare struggling to pay back college loans. Too many young people today, \ntoo many young professionals come out of college and get a job and have \nloans that are more than a mortgage would be. They can't afford to even \nbuy a house as a result of it. This budget needs to address that.\n  This budget does nothing to address what is happening in terms of \nwages for tens of millions of Americans who are working hard every day \ntrying to hold it together. It does not raise the minimum wage, nor \ndoes it help the millions of working women who are living in poverty. \nBy the way, half of the women living in poverty could be lifted out of \npoverty if we really had equal pay for equal work. That is stunning. We \ncould address that in this budget resolution.\n  This budget does not protect our seniors who have worked hard to earn \nthe security that comes from Medicare and Social Security. We are \ntalking about a situation where the House, in fact, outrageously is \nsuggesting doing away with the Affordable Care Act that has a group of \nexchanges through which insurance companies have to compete to lower \nprices--a whole process of the Affordable Care Act that they want to \neliminate. At the same time, they are proposing to put the same thing \nin place for Medicare--take away the universal structure of Medicare \nand create a situation that will be unstable and more costly for \nmillions of seniors.\n  Finally, this budget calls for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, \nbut it does some very interesting things. First of all, it would take \nhealth care coverage, medical care, away from 16.4 million families and \nraise taxes on millions of middle-class families right now. At the same \ntime they are taking away medical care, health coverage, they turn \naround and exclude the Affordable Care Act from the process of points \nof order that are in this bill that say if there is a point of order--\nthere can be a point of order against anything that increases the \ndeficit except for the Affordable Care Act. We are going to exclude \nthat. Why? Because the Affordable Care Act actually reduces the \ndeficit, and they admit it in the resolution because they exclude that \nfrom points of order.\n  So we have a very interesting situation where, on the one hand, this \nbudget takes away medical care, health care, extra help with closing \nwhat is called the doughnut hole for our seniors under medical, all the \nprovisions, all the protections for people who already have insurance \nwho now can't get dropped if they get sick and if they are sick can get \ninsurance even if they have a preexisting condition, all of the folks \nwho have their children on their insurance up to age 26, all of the \nother protections--gone under this budget. However, they admit that to \ndo that actually increases the deficit, so they exempt the Affordable \nCare Act from that provision.\n  On top of that, we are talking about millions of Americans who would \nhave increased costs. So people are going to get increased costs, \nincreased taxes, increased deficit, and less medical care.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask if I may have 1 more minute.\n  Mr. SANDERS. The Senator may have 2 more minutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank my colleague and leader of the Budget \nCommittee.\n  We are in this crazy situation where this bill would eliminate health \ncare for 16.4 million Americans right now, most of whom have not had \nthe ability to find affordable health care. It would raise their cost, \nraise their taxes, raise the deficit, and then at the same time this \nbill keeps the revenue and the cost savings from the Affordable Care \nAct. This is a pretty nifty trick, I have to tell you. So you lose your \nhealth care, but the revenue that is generated to pay for health \nservices stays in the baseline. They are counting the revenue, they are \ncounting the cost savings in this budget. They are counting the savings \nand taking away your health care. Not a good deal. I would suggest that \nis a very, very bad deal.\n  This is not honest budgeting. It certainly is not a budget that puts \nmiddle-class families first or those who are working very hard--one \njob, two jobs, three jobs--trying to lift themselves up to get into the \nmiddle class for themselves and their families.\n  It is not just irresponsible budgeting; it is irresponsible governing \nto create a document that hurts so many people in the priorities that \nare set--low-income people, middle-income people, those struggling hard \nand working hard to get into the middle class--but protects the \ninterests of privileged Americans. This is a budget rigged for the \nwealthy and well-connected of the country, and I would urge a ``no'' \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank Senator Stabenow not only for her remarks this \nevening but for the great work she has done on the Budget Committee, \nand I certainly concur with the thrust of what she is saying. Our \nmiddle class is struggling, and the wealthiest people are doing \nphenomenally well. Corporations are enjoying recordbreaking profits. \nCEOs make 270 times more than their average worker.\n  We don't need a budget that protects the top one-tenth of 1 percent \nand the CEOs of major corporations. We need a budget that protects \nworking families and the middle class. I know that is something Senator \nStabenow has been fighting for throughout this entire process, and I \nthank the Senator very much for that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 323\n\n (Purpose: To create millions of middle class jobs by investing in our \n  nation's infrastructure paid for by raising revenue through closing \n        loopholes in the corporate and international tax system)\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 323, which is at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Sanders], for himself and Mr. \n     Wyden, proposes an amendment numbered 323.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me just reiterate what I said a \nmoment ago. The wealthiest people in this country are doing \nphenomenally well. Ninety-nine percent of all new income created in \nAmerica today is going to the top 1 percent. Those people are\n\n[[Page S1702]]\n\ndoing great. They don't need the help of the Senate. They are doing \njust fine. The top one-tenth of 1 percent own almost as much wealth as \nthe bottom 90 percent. Those people are doing extraordinarily well. \nThey do not need the help of the Senate.\n  The people who do need the help are the working families and the \nmiddle class of this country, many of whom are working longer hours for \nlower wages. They, in fact, need our help. Seniors who are having to \nmake the difficult choice of whether they heat their homes in the \nwinter, buy the medicines they need, or buy the food they need, need \nour help. Young people in this country who would love to go to college \nbut don't know how they can afford to go to college need our help. \nPeople graduating college with $50,000, $60,000, $100,000 of debt and \ndon't know how to pay off that debt need our help.\n  We have to get our priorities right. We have to know whose side we \nare on.\n  The amendment I am offering, which I suspect will be voted on \ntomorrow, is very significant in that it addresses two major issues. At \na time when real unemployment in this country is not 5.5 percent--if we \ncount those who have given up looking for work--and I believe the \nPresiding Officer touched on that issue during her remarks--if we count \nthose who have given up looking for work or those who are working part \ntime when they want to work full time, real unemployment is 11 percent. \nWe need to create millions of jobs. Youth unemployment is at 17 \npercent. African-American youth unemployment is off the charts. Right \nnow, when we talk to people all over this country, they say: Help us. \nCreate decent-paying jobs.\n  That is what this amendment does. This amendment creates 9 million \ndecent-paying jobs over a 6-year period, and it does it in a very \nsensible way.\n  Mr. President, I think you know, I know, and every Member of this \nbody knows and virtually every American knows our infrastructure is \ncrumbling. Our roads, our bridges, our water systems, our wastewater \nplants, our levies, our dams, our airports, and our rail system are in \nneed of significant improvements. We cannot be a first-rate economy \nwhen we have a third-rate infrastructure. Everybody knows that.\n  Let me be very clear. If we don't invest in infrastructure today, it \nis not going to get better all by itself. It will only deteriorate. We \nkeep pushing it off, and we keep pushing it off, and the roads get \nworse, the bridges get worse, and the water systems get worse. Now is \nthe time to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, and when we do that, \nwe will create or maintain some 9 million good-paying jobs. I would \nhope that maybe once around here we can have bipartisan support for a \npiece of legislation that I believe in their hearts every Member of \nthis body knows makes sense.\n  How are we going to pay for this? We are not going to pay for it by \ncutting Medicare. We are not going the pay for it by cutting Pell \ngrants. We are not going to pay for it by cutting Head Start. We are \nnot going to pay for it by asking low-income seniors to pay more for \ntheir prescription drugs. We are going to pay for it by an eminently \nfair way; that is, by undoing huge tax loopholes that enable large, \nprofitable corporations in some cases to pay zero in Federal income \ntaxes. It is time to end those loopholes. It is time to invest in our \ncrumbling infrastructure. It is time to create millions of decent-\npaying jobs.\n  I would hope very much that we would have strong bipartisan support \nfor this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, we have now had our first amendment offered, \none to add more infrastructure. I doubt there is anybody in the \nChamber--even when we are all here--who would doubt that we need to do \nthings with infrastructure. My infrastructure time actually goes back \nto when I was elected mayor of Gillette, WY. It was a boom town. We \ndidn't know how big it was going to increase. We knew we were already \nshort of sewer, water, electricity, streets, sidewalks, not to mention \npolice, garbage, and all the other things that come with it. The \ninfrastructure was sorely lacking. In fact, one of the first calls I \ngot was from a person who said: What are you going to do when your \nsubstation blows up? I had to ask what a substation was, and then I \nwould have to ask why it would blow up. When it gets to 110 percent of \ncapacity--or the first warm day--it ought to blow up. If that happened, \nthe consequence of that was the people at Gillette would have been \nwithout electricity for about 6 weeks. I think in this day and age if a \ncompany went without electricity for 6 weeks, a person would be tarred \nand feathered. So I understand infrastructure and the need for it.\n\n  The Federal Government never once offered to do any infrastructure \nfor me, and we didn't need them to either. But there are things the \nFederal Government has taken the responsibility for and that we need to \nmake sure are funded and taken care of and repaired, and I am sure both \nsides of the aisle want to do that.\n  The title of this amendment sounds great, but when you get down into \nthe details, there are some problems. The budget resolution has a \ndeficit-neutral reserve fund for infrastructure and envisions that \nCongress will fully fund transportation priorities to strengthen our \ncrumbling infrastructure with a new highway bill in May.\n  I have been here long enough to know we always do that. It is not \nvery difficult to get the votes together to pass a highway bill. The \ndifficulty, of course, is coming up with the money, but there is a \ndeficit-neutral reserve fund established to allow the flexibility to \nget that to happen. It provides a mechanism so a bill can move. It \nallows authorizers to find new revenue or offsets to extend the life of \nthe highway trust fund.\n  The Senate budget resolution strives to maintain a well-functioning \nnational transportation system, a core element of the U.S. economy, \nwhich helps hard-working Americans while reducing lower priority items \nthat do not contribute to a national transportation network and should \nbe handled in a local way.\n  Our Nation's system of roads and bridges has deteriorated and is in \ndesperate need of repair. Everyone here is fired up about the issue \nbecause we have all experienced these infrastructure deficiencies. We \nhave seen bridges collapse. We have seen some of the deterioration of \nthe roads. We have all been frustrated with traffic, bottlenecks and \npotholes.\n  Today, there are more than 1 million miles of roads eligible for \nFederal aid and more than 60,000 bridges are structurally deficient. \nHowever, the highway trust fund is bankrupt. Each year trust fund \nspending outpaces the revenues from the gas tax by about $14 billion \nand that gap is growing. To compensate for funding shortfalls, the \ntrust fund has required large transfers totaling $65 billion since \n2008, $62 billion of which came from the general fund of the Treasury. \nWe didn't use to have to do that. Usually the gas tax provided a big \nenough fund that we were able to increase the number of dollars spent \non infrastructure.\n  When the Bowles-Simpson group met, their suggestion was that the gas \ntax--the user fee for cars using the highways--needed to be raised a \nnickel a gallon for each of three consecutive years. Unfortunately, \nthat was about 5 years ago, and they predicted the money would run out \nbefore now if we didn't make that kind of a raise. There have been \nseveral things that have been proposed, but we never had a vote on any \nof them.\n  A one-time cash infusion from a corporate tax increase does not do \nanything to take care of the discrepancy between spending and revenues \nthat results in the highway trust fund insolvency. We do need a long-\nterm highway trust fund solution rather than another short-term fix \nthat kicks the can down the road. A corporate tax increase is not a \nlong-term solution for the problems of the highway trust fund.\n  I have been interested in the international tax piece, and that is \nthe part the President hung his hat on for the infrastructure piece. \nThe way that works is to mandate a 14-percent tax on all of the money \nthat is overseas. I didn't really see any clause in there\n\n[[Page S1703]]\n\nthat allowed that to be paid over any kind of a period of time. We \ndidn't need all of that revenue right in the first year.\n  I did an international tax piece that had a much lower repatriation \nfee on it and it was not mandatory. The difficulty of making it not \nmandatory is it doesn't score so it does not show any money coming back \nbecause nobody has to bring it back. They have to declare everything \nupfront and agree to pay the tax over a period of 5 years if they were \ngoing to bring it back. There would be 5 years of revenue from this \nrepatriation of funds, even at a lower rate, which could fund what we \nare talking about here, or it could fund the other needs that have to \nbe done in tax reform.\n  The way the budget is written, that is left up to the individual \ncommittees to come up with the solutions they need. It is not up to us \nhere on the floor doing a budget where we have a mixture of people from \nall of the committees, but not the kind of structure we have in the \nspecific committees to come up with the final solution for it. There \nhas to be a solution, and I know it can be made, but it can't be done \nso that it bankrupts the companies. If we take the tax that is overseas \nand impose a 14-percent tax on it that has to be paid this year, we \nwill bankrupt almost every company that is out there, and the reason is \nthey don't just have that money sitting over there; it is being used \nover there. They have to be able to sell off or reclaim whatever money \nthey have in order to be able to pay any taxes on the money they have \noverseas. And that needs to be done, because if we can find a way for \ncompanies to bring their money back to the United States, they will \ninvest it in the United States and it will grow the economy and we will \nhave more jobs.\n  Incidentally, the best way to take care of most of these problems is \nto grow the economy, which is the opposite of what this administration \nis doing. It fascinated me that in the President's budget he said if we \ncould grow the economy by just 1 percent, it would result in $4 \ntrillion in taxes. But everything I saw in there were ways to change \nthat back so we didn't grow the economy the 1 percent to raise $4 \ntrillion.\n  I had the Congressional Budget Office look at it, and they said a 1-\npercent increase in the economy would raise $3 trillion, so we have a \nsmall deficit difference, but that is a lot of money any way you look \nat it, whether it is the CBO's estimate or the President's estimate.\n  Some of Senator Sanders' tax reform ideas have merit, but it should \nbe dealt with within the context of the comprehensive tax reform and \nthe highway bill. These tax policies have nothing to do with \ninfrastructure and will force transportation spending even further away \nfrom the user-pays principle we have always had until recently when we \nstarted tapping some of the other trust funds.\n  The U.S. tax code is overly complicated, inefficient, and archaic. I \nthink we all agree it needs to be fixed, and I believe Senator Hatch \nand Senator Wyden are on a path to do that. Both have taken a look at \nit very extensively and have been working on it for quite a while. \nSenator Hatch was working on it with Senator Baucus before Senator \nWyden became the chairman. I think the two of them are still working on \nit, and that is how it needs to be done. It is complicated, it is \ninefficient, it is archaic, it is too big, and it is not fair.\n  The current structure hurts economic growth, it frustrates working \nAmericans, and it pushes American businesses overseas. Any discussion \nof international or corporate tax reform should be dealt with in the \ncontext of a comprehensive tax reform to simplify the entire system. We \nshould not drag tax reform into the highway funding debate. One of the \ntendencies we have around here is to come up with some very simple \nsolutions that, as a solution, sound like a really good idea, but when \nwe get into the details, there are a whole bunch of complexities that \nresult in unintended consequences that can foul up the whole system, \nand that is one of the things that something as complex as our tax \nsystem can do if we try to write that as a budget resolution.\n  The budget resolution assumes the tax-writing committees will adopt a \ntax reform proposal that reduces marginal rates but broadens the tax \nbase to create a fairer, efficient, competitive, progrowth tax regime \nthat is revenue neutral, and I look forward to their work. I am on that \ncommittee so I will get to be a part of that work. One of the areas I \nam particularly interested in is, of course, small business.\n  I was in small business for a long time. My wife and I had shoe \nstores. If you have a small business corporation, you pay the taxes on \nthe money you make in that given year, even though you still need to \nkeep it invested in the business if you are going to keep the business \ngoing. Those are called the passthrough businesses, so we have to be \ncareful that when we fix the corporate tax structure, we don't ruin the \nsmall business tax structure at the same time. That is a major \ncomplication, but when you get into the details of that, it gets even \nmore complicated.\n  I am hoping we do both corporate and individual at the same time. I \nhave listened to Senator Sanders talk about and mention a number of \ncorporations that didn't pay taxes and even got some money back, and my \nfirst reaction to that is that is terrible; it should not happen in \nAmerica. But after I looked at it, I thought if they had really \nviolated the law, they would be in jail. They didn't violate the law. \nThey used the tax laws we have now, which shows why we need to have tax \nreform.\n  I am in favor of tax reform and eliminating loopholes. I had an \nopportunity to look at a number of the tax expenditures. I know some of \nthe businesses that were listed as tax expenditures actually wound up \ngetting a different name for the same thing they get to write off that \nevery other business gets to write off, and so we have to be careful \nthat when we eliminate those that we are not moving into another \ncategory because one of the tax breaks I looked at, if we eliminated \nit, it would allow them to write their expenses off much faster than \nhow they agreed to write them off. So it is more complicated than it \nseems on the surface.\n  I am hoping we can eliminate some of that complication and eliminate \nsome of those loopholes. I hope we can use some of the money for \ninfrastructure and the rest for the simplification and fairness of it. \nFairness is very important, and that is why we have the committee \nstructures the way we do too so we can have people looking at the \nissues from both sides to make sure there is fairness in the eyes of as \nmany people as possible. When we start tinkering with the tax code in \nvery small ways, that is how we wind up with these unfairness issues \nthat appear in there. Helping out one sector can sometimes be adverse \nto another sector, but we don't realize it until the actual action \ntakes place.\n  I am looking forward to the debate on infrastructure. It is my \nunderstanding we will vote on that sometime tomorrow around noon and \nthat gives us an opportunity to have more debate on it.\n  In the meantime, I think we can probably come up with some \ncommonsense solutions that could be worked through the committee, which \nwas what was always envisioned in our budget.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI.

Mr. President, I raise an issue before the body. I don't \nknow how accurate the press reports are, but apparently the Chief of \nStaff of President Obama, Mr. McDonough, today spoke in town to a group \ncalled J Street, which is an organization supportive of the United \nStates-Israel relationship, apparently. Here is what he allegedly said. \nHe basically said that an occupation that has lasted more than 50 years \nmust end.\n\n  So the Chief of Staff of the President of the United States, speaking \nin Washington today, called the Israeli presence in the West Bank an \noccupation. The Chief of Staff of the President of the United States is \nlooking at a world completely different than the one I am viewing.\n  I ask Mr. McDonough and President Obama: Don't you realize the last \ntime Israel withdrew in the Mideast--a Palestinian-controlled \nterritory--was the withdrawal from Gaza and that when Israel \nvoluntarily left Gaza, Hamas took over Gaza?\n  They are a terrorist organization and they fired up to 10,000 rockets \nfrom Gaza into Israel. Today, Israel has a presence in the West Bank. \nToday, Israel is surrounded by radical Islamists, unlike at any time I \ncan remember.\n  The language used by the Chief of Staff of the President of the \nUnited States is exactly what Hamas uses. So now our administration is \ntaking up the language of a terrorist organization to describe our \nfriends in Israel.\n  Here is a question to the American people: Would you withdraw from \nthe West Bank, given the situation that exists today on the ground \nbetween the Israelis and the rest of the region? Would you at this \nmoment in Israel's history completely withdraw from the West Bank, \ngiven the experience in Gaza?\n  Does anybody on the left think that is a good idea? Does anybody in \nIsraeli politics agree with the characterization of the Chief of Staff \nof President Obama? Does Mr. Herzog or anyone else in opposition to \nPrime Minister Netanyahu agree with this characterization? Is your \ncountry occupying the West Bank or are you there to make sure the West \nBank doesn't turn into Gaza?\n  I talked with the Prime Minister Saturday and I congratulated him on \na decisive victory and I look forward to working with him. He told me \nvery clearly that he believes a two-state solution is not possible as \nlong as the Palestinian Authority embraces Hamas, which controls the \nGaza strip and is a terrorist organization by any reasonable \ndefinition.\n  With whom do you make peace, Mr. President? What kind of deal can you \nmake when almost half the Palestinian people are in the hands of a \nterrorist organization who vow to destroy you every day? What kind of \ndeal is that?\n  So do I want a two-state solution? Yes, I would like a two-state \nsolution, where the Palestinians recognize the right of Israel to exist \nand they have the ability to chart their own destiny. They are not \nanywhere near there. The Palestinian community is broken into two \nparts. The Hamas terrorist organization controls the essential part of \nthe Palestinian community. They will not recognize Israel's right to \nexist. They are using the territory they hold as a launching pad for \nattacks against Israel routinely. These are the people who launch \nrockets from schoolyards and apartment buildings trying to blame Israel \nfor being the bad guy when they respond.\n  All I can say is when I thought it couldn't get worse, it has. When I \nthought we couldn't reach a new low in terms of this White House's view \nof the Mideast, we found a way to reach a new low. Today, the Chief of \nStaff of the President of the United States used language to describe \nIsrael that has been reserved for terrorist organizations up until now.\n  So, Mr. McDonough, President Obama, you are completely delusional \nabout the world as it is. You are negotiating with an Iranian regime, \nand in the President's New Year's greeting he called on the Iranian \npeople to speak out in support of a nuclear deal. Mr. President, don't \nyou understand that in Iran you can't speak out; that if you do speak \nout and petition your government you can get shot or put in jail? You \ndon't understand that? You are talking to people as if they have a \nvoice. You are talking about the regime as if they are some kind of \nrational actor.\n  In that same New Year's greeting, the President complimented the \nregime, headed up by the Ayatollahs, as\n\n[[Page S1705]]\n\nbeing cooperative in terms of their nuclear negotiations with the P5+1. \nWhat the President didn't mention is that this very regime that is \nspreading terror, unlike at any time in recent memory, is involved in \nthe toppling of four Arab capitals. They are wreaking havoc on the \nneighborhood. As we are negotiating on their nuclear deal, they are \nstill the largest state sponsor of terrorism. They called for death to \nAmerica 2 days ago.\n  So I say to the Obama administration: Wake up and change your \npolicies before you set the whole world on fire. Please watch your \nlanguage because our best ally in the region, the State of Israel, does \nnot deserve the label of ``occupier,'' given the facts on the ground, \nand they do not deserve to hear from the Chief of Staff of the \nPresident of the United States language that is usually reserved for a \nterrorist organization.\n  So when I thought it couldn't get any worse, it has. Let me put the \nObama administration on notice. You may not like the fact that Prime \nMinister Netanyahu won, but he did, and here is what you need to \nunderstand. If you are recalculating the administration's support for \nIsrael in terms of how you handle resolutions in the United Nations, \nyou need to understand that Congress will recalculate how we relate to \nthe United Nations if you stand on the sidelines and let the U.N. take \nover the peace process.\n  There will be a bipartisan, violent backlash in this body if the \nObama administration does not veto a U.N. resolution defining the peace \nprocess in the Security Council, avoiding direct negotiations between \nthe parties. I am here to say that one of the casualties of a haphazard \nforeign policy could be the relationship between the United Nations and \nthe Congress. I promise there is bipartisan support in this body for \ntwo things: to stand firmly with Israel and not to allow the U.N. \nSecurity Council to take over the peace process in defining the terms \nof a deal.\n  Secondly, if there is a deal with the Iranians over their nuclear \nprogram, if this administration takes that deal to the U.N. Security \nCouncil, bypassing Congress and not coming to us first, there will \nbecome a great backlash regarding that move.\n  So I say to the Obama administration: Israel is not the problem. The \nIsraeli people have not killed one American soldier. The Israeli people \nare in a dispute about their survival with the Palestinian people. The \nIsraeli people gave land to the Palestinians, and in return they got \n10,000 rockets, and you want them to do it again. Can't you understand \nwhy Israel may not want to withdraw from the West Bank given the \nhistory of Gaza? If you can't, you are completely blind to the world as \nit is, and your hatred and your disgust and your disdain for the Prime \nMinister has clouded your judgment.\n  So to our friends in Israel I say: There can only be one Commander in \nChief, and that is the way it should be. But there are 535 of us in the \nHouse and the Senate and we do have your back. We will not sit on the \nsidelines and watch this rhetoric enacted in a manner that would put \nyou at risk beyond what you already are in terms of risk.\n  This is a low point for me; that an administration, the Chief of \nStaff of an American President, would use this language, but it fits \ninto an overall pattern that I think is very destructive. So I say to \nPresident Obama and Mr. McDonough: Your foreign policy is not working. \nIf you don't get that, then God help us all because what you are doing \nin the Mideast is not working. You are making everything worse, and now \nyou have added fuel to the fire.\n  I hope there will be some self-correction at the White House; that we \nwill not take this rhetoric any further than we have today; that there \nwill be a reevaluation of whether it is appropriate to call the Israeli \npeople occupiers, given the facts on the ground. Only time will tell.\n  I do understand this, without any hesitation. There are many of us in \nthis body who will not put up with this. We will push back. Israel has \nnot killed one U.S. soldier. Israel hasn't toppled any of their \nneighbors. Israel doesn't chant ``Death to America.'' You may not like \nthe outcome of the Israeli election, but it was up to the Israeli \npeople to decide, and they have decided.\n  All of us got into this body the same way--people at home voted for \nus. Under our Constitution, we have an equal voice to that of the \nPresident in terms of checks and balances. Even though he is the leader \nof America's foreign policy and the Commander in Chief, we do have the \nright to speak on such matters. So here is my voice, and I think I \nspeak for many on both sides of the aisle when I say to the Israeli \npeople: Do what you have to do to defend the Jewish State. To the \nPresident of the United States and Mr. McDonough: The language you used \ntoday is very unhelpful and, quite frankly, disconnected from reality.\n  I will end with this. Would any Member of this body, if they were in \nIsraeli leadership, withdraw from the West Bank, given what is going on \nin the region? Would any Member of this body be as restrained in \nresponding to a rocket attack coming from a neighbor as Israel has been \nrestrained? What would we do if some terrorist organization next door \nto us launched a rocket trying to kill our children? Would we be as \nrestrained as our Israeli friends? I doubt it.\n  I am asking this body to walk a mile in the shoes of the Israeli \npeople and understand why this statement is so offensive and has \nusually been reserved by the leader of the free world to describe \nterrorist organizations.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Ernst pertaining to the introduction of S. 841 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mrs. ERNST.

Mr. President, Loretta Lynch, the nominee to be our next \nAttorney General, has now been awaiting a vote on the Senate floor for \n25 days. I have spoken many times about her historic nomination, her \ninspiring family, and her passion for the highest callings of public \nservice.\n  Last week, a distinguished group of bipartisan law enforcement \nofficials came together to call for the confirmation of Loretta Lynch. \nThese individuals have dedicated the better part of their careers to \nprotecting the American people, and they conveyed how important it is \nto have the Senate confirm the chief law enforcement officer in the \ncountry.\n  One of those individuals is my friend, Louis Freeh, former Director \nof the FBI and a Federal judge. Director Freeh wrote to the committee \nin support of Loretta Lynch that ``[i]n my twenty-five years of public \nservice--23 in the Department of Justice--I cannot think of a more \nqualified nominee to be America's chief law enforcement officer.'' He \nhas further stated that ``Ms. Lynch is an atypically non-political \nappointment for that office, a career professional without any \npolitical party ties or activity.''\n  Loretta Lynch is also supported by the current New York police \ncommissioner, who was appointed by a Democrat, and a former New York \npolice commissioner, who was appointed by a Republican. She has earned \nthe support of former U.S. attorneys from both Republican and \nDemocratic administrations. She has the support of the Major\n\n[[Page S1706]]\n\nCities Chiefs Association, the International Association of Chiefs of \nPolice, the Major County Sheriffs' Association, and many, many others.\n  There is a very obvious reason for the bipartisan support Ms. Lynch \nhas received--her qualifications are simply beyond reproach. She has \nbeen confirmed by the Senate twice before to serve as the top Federal \nprosecutor based in Brooklyn, NY. Those who have worked with her over \nthe course of her 30-year career described her as ``even-handed,'' \n``apolitical,'' and believe she ``will be a strong independent voice at \nthe helm of the Department of Justice.''\n  Under her leadership, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern \nDistrict of New York has brought terrorists to justice, obtained \nconvictions against both Republicans and Democrats in public corruption \ncases, and fought tirelessly against violent crime and financial fraud. \nHer record shows that as Attorney General, Ms. Lynch will effectively, \nfairly, and independently enforce the law.\n  Many Americans are starting to wonder why she is being held up so \nlong in light of her sterling record and in light of the very serious \nlaw enforcement challenges that we face in communities across the \ncountry. Unfortunately, the Republican Senate leadership is holding Ms. \nLynch's nomination hostage to their political agenda and that does not \nreflect well on the Senate or their leadership.\n  President Obama announced the nomination of Ms. Lynch more than 4 \nmonths ago. The Judiciary Committee reported her nomination with \nbipartisan support 25 days ago. As of today, her nomination has been \npending on the Senate floor longer than all of the past seven Attorneys \nGeneral combined: Richard Thornburgh, 1 day; Bob Barr, 5 days; Janet \nReno, 1 day; John Ashcroft, 2 days; Alberto Gonzales, 8 days; Michael \nMukasey, 2 days; and Eric Holder, 5 days. This delay is an \nembarrassment for the Senate.\n  The excuses for holding up her nomination continue to mount and each \nexcuse rings hollow given the importance of the position to which she \nis nominated.\n  First, the President and Senate Democrats were warned last November \nthat we should not move Ms. Lynch's nomination during the lameduck \nperiod last Congress. Senate Republicans claimed that she would be \ntreated fairly if we waited. In fact, the current majority leader \nissued a statement last November, proclaiming that ``Ms. Lynch will \nreceive fair consideration by the Senate. And her nomination should be \nconsidered in the new Congress through regular order.'' As a result, we \nacceded to their request. However, treatment of her nomination has not \nbeen fair when compared to her predecessors.\n  Despite Senate Republicans' request that we not move her nomination \nin the few weeks remaining in the lameduck session, they now assert in \nthe press that if this nomination was so important, then the President \nand Senate Democrats should have processed it during that very time of \ntransition. Sometimes you can only shake your head at what is said to \nexcuse their delay. This nomination is for the top law enforcement \nofficer in the Nation. It should not just be important to Democrats. It \nshould be important to Republicans as well. It is important to all \nAmericans.\n  I can remember when Judge Mukasey was nominated by President Bush to \nbe Attorney General. From the date of announcement to confirmation, it \ntook 53 days. Judge Mukasey received a floor vote just 2 days after he \nwas reported from committee. And these were some of the remarks made by \nSenate Republicans at that time: ``We should stop playing partisan \npolitical games with this nomination. The Justice Department is too \nimportant for this type of stuff.'' ``Forty days into the partisan \nwilderness is more than enough. We should confirm Judge Michael Mukasey \nwithout further delay.'' There were expressions of outrage against \nDemocrats after just 40 days. Contrast that to Ms. Lynch, who has now \nbeen waiting 135 days. Her nomination has been pending on the floor for \n25 days whereas Judge Mukasey received a vote in 2 days. Where is the \noutrage from my fellow Senators on the other side of the aisle now?\n  Second, the majority leader announced 2 weeks ago that he would \nfinally schedule a vote on Ms. Lynch's nomination last week. However, \ninstead of doing so, the majority leader changed his mind and acted as \nif the Senate could not consider legislation and executive nominees at \nthe same time. Now he has announced that she will not have a \nconfirmation vote until after the Senate has concluded its debate on \nthe human trafficking bill. The Senate often debates legislation and \nvotes on nominations at the same time. Over the last week and a half, \nwe voted on six other executive nominations while we were on the human \ntrafficking bill. None of those executive nominations is more important \nthan this one. The top law enforcement officer in the land is not a \nnegotiating chip that any party should use for leverage. That is not \nhow we respect the role that law enforcement officials play in our \nsystem of government.\n  What made the delay announced last Sunday more confounding is the \nfact that Loretta Lynch has a proven track record of prosecuting human \ntrafficking and child rape crimes. Over the course of the last decade, \nher office has indicted over 55 defendants in sex trafficking cases and \nrescued over 110 victims of sex trafficking.\n  Ms. Lynch and her office have used the tools that Congress has \nprovided them to bring traffickers to justice. In United States v. \nRivera, the prosecutors in her office utilized the Trafficking Victims \nProtection Act to help them obtain a conviction against an owner of \nseveral New York bars for his role in a sex trafficking and forced \nlabor ring. The evidence at trial established that the defendants \nrecruited and harbored scores of undocumented Latin American \nimmigrants, and forced them to work as waitresses at the owner's bars. \nThe owner and his accomplices used violence, including rapes and \nbeatings, as well as fraud and threats of deportation, to compel the \nvictims to work and prevent them from reporting the illegal activity to \npolice. Because of the leadership Ms. Lynch showed in making such cases \na priority, the bar owner was sentenced to 60 years in prison.\n  I am proud of the Senate's work to get the Trafficking Victims \nProtection Act reauthorized 2 years ago as part of the reauthorization \nof the Violence Against Women Act. We passed those laws with strong \nbipartisan support because we avoided unnecessary political fights, \nlistened to the survivors, and responded to what they said they needed. \nI wish the Republican leadership would do the same on Senator Cornyn's \ntrafficking bill. Unfortunately, it is many of the same Senators who \nvoted against the reauthorization of the Trafficking Victims Protection \nAct and the Violence Against Women Act who have injected a divisive \npartisan fight here--over the objection of the very survivors they wish \nto help. It is this unnecessary fight that has stopped an otherwise \nbipartisan bill. And now, many of those same Senators are using this \nunnecessary conflict--a conflict they created--as an excuse not to move \nLoretta Lynch's nomination. So instead of working together to confirm a \nnominee with a proven commitment to stopping human trafficking, and \ninstead of passing antitrafficking legislation that will help the \nsurvivors of this terrible crime, Senate Republicans have refused to do \neither one this month.\n  Loretta Lynch was recently named one of ``New York's New \nAbolitionists'' by the New York State Anti-Trafficking Coalition for \nher leadership in combating human trafficking. She has told members of \nthe Judiciary Committee that human trafficking would be one of her top \npriorities if confirmed as Attorney General. And now, in the name of \nsupporting human trafficking victims, Senate Republicans are blocking \nher nomination. That makes no sense. If we want to show our commitment \nto ending human trafficking, we should remove the unnecessary, partisan \nlanguage from the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act--language that \nis not in the House-passed bill--and confirm Loretta Lynch without \nfurther delay.\n  It is time to stop delaying and making excuses. It is time to stop \nplaying politics with our law enforcement and national security. There \nis only one holdup to Ms. Lynch's nomination to be Attorney General, \nand that is the party that the American public has entrusted to govern \nthe Senate. I ask\n\n[[Page S1707]]\n\nthat she receive a confirmation vote this week so that she can get to \nthe peoples' work as our next Attorney General of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/23/senate-section/article/S1707-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       CONGRATULATING JOHN DONATO\n\n Mr. KING.

Mr. Donato has a long \nhistory of excellence in sports, from playing at the Boston Garden in \nsemifinals games as a shooting guard in high school to bringing teams \nto wins as a coach at Houlton, Messalonskee, Mount View, Hall-Dale, and \nLawrence High Schools. After attending Ricker College, Mr. Donato spent \nan impressive 18 years coaching basketball and 25 years coaching \nbaseball at Houlton alone.\n  While he was coach, the Houlton girls' basketball team won nine \nEastern Maine Class B titles in 11 years and four State championships \nin 6 years. They had 261 wins overall. On top of that, his baseball \nteam won two Eastern Maine titles, with 324 wins overall, and the golf \nteam won two State championships. Mr. Donato then moved to central \nMaine, and after a year coaching at Hall-Dale High School, he began \ncoaching at Messalonskee High School. There his team went 17-1 during \nhis first season, a major turnaround from their 5-13 run the previous \nyear. He would spend 8 years at Messalonskee, followed by 4 years at \nMount View High School, and then began coaching girls' basketball at \nLawrence in 2010. The girls' State championship victory this year marks \nLawrence's first in 21 years.\n  I am not the first to recognize Mr. Donato's great achievements. He \nwas the McDonald's All-Star Coach of the Year 12 times, Eastern Maine \nClass B Coach of the Year 8 times, Kennebec Valley Athletic Conference \nCoach of the Year 4 times, and State of Maine Girls' Basketball Coach \nof the Year 5 times.\n  Mr. Donato is not only a coach, but also a teacher and former \nbusiness owner, now in his 14th year teaching science at Lawrence High \nSchool. In each respect, he has proven a strong commitment to his \ncommunity. Whether in the gym or the classroom, Mr. Donato brings \nknowledge of leadership and team building that is invaluable for our \nstudents. I am proud to represent people such as Coach Donato, an \noutstanding citizen of Maine, in the U.S. Senate. On the occasion of \nhis 500th win and fifth State championship title, I extend my \ncongratulations to him and the teams he has coached over the \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/23/senate-section/article/S1707-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 KENNEBUNK ROTARY CLUB 90TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. KING. Mr. President, I wish to honor the many years of \nservice provided by the Kennebunk Rotary Club, which is now entering \nits 90th year as an integral part of the Kennebunk community. The \nKennebunk Rotary Club is an organization founded on a steadfast \ndedication to ``Service Above Self'', a motto that I believe we should \nall strive to fulfill.\n  I have had the privilege of speaking with rotary members on multiple \noccasions and I value their insight as important members of their local \ncommunities. I have also attended a number of rotary club meetings in \nMaine and as the son of a rotarian I have seen firsthand the positive \nimpact that Rotary International has on communities in Maine and across \nthe country.\n  For generations, local students, families, seniors, and people around \nthe world have benefited from the Kennebunk Rotary Club and the many \ncharitable events that it hosts annually. Indeed, some of these events \nhave been a source of Kennebunk pride for years. These include cyber-\ncrime awareness trainings for seniors, a 5K every summer, and a \nChristmas party to provide gifts for children who otherwise wouldn't \nhave any under the tree.\n  In addition to these community events, the Kennebunk Rotary Club \nsponsors philanthropic programs such as the club's annual scholarship \nfund, which provides several local high school seniors with up to a \n$1,500 to cover some college expenses. Scholarship programs such as the \nKennebunk Rotary Club's open the door to success for Kennebunk \ngraduates. The first recipient of this scholarship, Thomas Putnam, \ndemonstrates the success of the program. Several years after he \nreceived his scholarship funds, he joined the Kennebunk Rotary Club and \nis today the director of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in \nMassachusetts.\n  Finally, the Kennebunk Rotary Club has been able to extend their love \nof community beyond the bounds of their scenic hometown, crossing \ninternational borders to help those in need. After a train carrying \ncrude oil exploded in the small town of Lac-Meegantic, Quebec, the \nKennebunk Rotary Club and the rest of Rotary International District \n7780 sprang into action. They helped raise over $25,000 in donations, \nwhich was used to provide 400 children with Christmas presents. It was \nmy pleasure to work with Rotary International and U.S. Customs to \nensure that those gifts arrived safely in Lac-Meegantic. Through \ncollaboration and a little hard work, the Kennebunk Rotary Club was \nable to make a huge impact on the lives of many.\n  I would like to again thank the Kennebunk Rotary Club, and \ncongratulate them on their 90 years of dedication to ``Service Above \nSelf.'' Their investment in Kennebunk, the great State of Maine, and \ncommunities across the globe has had a great effect on students, \nfamilies, and seniors and will continue to open the doors of \nopportunity for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/23/senate-section/article/S1707-3", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1707-S1708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING RxIMPACT DAY\n\n Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I recognize the seventh annual \nRxIMPACT Day on Capitol Hill. This is a special day where we recognize \npharmacies' contribution to the American healthcare system. This year's \nevent organized by the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, takes \nplace on March 25-26. Nearly 400 individuals from the pharmacy \ncommunity--including practicing pharmacists, pharmacy school faculty \nand students, State pharmacy leaders and pharmacy company executives--\nwill visit Capitol Hill. They will share their views with Congress \nabout the importance of supporting legislation that protects access to \ncommunity and neighborhood pharmacies and that utilizes pharmacists to \nimprove the quality and reduce the costs of providing health care.\n  Advocates from 45 States have traveled to Washington to talk about \nthe pharmacy community's contributions in over 40,000 community \npharmacies nationwide. These important health care providers are here \nto educate Congress about the value of pharmacists and protect access \nto the essential services they provide as part of our health care \ndelivery system. And just as these providers traveled to meet with us, \nMembers of Congress and their staff have toured retail chain pharmacies \nin our own communities more than 325 times since 2009.\n  As cochair of the Senate Community Pharmacy Caucus, I recognize that \nthe local pharmacist is a trusted, highly accessible health care \nprovider deeply committed to providing the highest quality care in the \nmost efficient manner possible. Patients have always relied on their \nlocal pharmacist to meet their health care needs.\n  As demand for health care services continues to grow, pharmacists \nhave expanded their role in health care delivery, partnering with \nphysicians, nurses and other health care providers to meet their \npatients' needs. Innovative services provided by pharmacists do even \nmore to improve patient health care. Pharmacists are highly valued by \nthose that rely on them most--those in rural and underserved areas, as \nwell as\n\n[[Page S1708]]\n\nolder Americans, and those struggling to manage chronic diseases. \nPharmacy services improve patients' quality of life as well as health \ncare affordability. By helping patients take their medications \neffectively and providing preventive services, pharmacists help avoid \nmore costly forms of care. Pharmacists also help patients identify \nstrategies to save money, such as through better understanding of their \npharmacy benefits, using generic medications, and obtaining 90-day \nsupplies of prescription drugs from local pharmacies.\n  Pharmacists are the Nation's most accessible health care providers. \nIn many communities, especially in rural areas, the local pharmacist is \na patient's most direct link to health care. Eighty-nine percent of \nAmericans reside within a 5-mile radius of a community pharmacy. \nPharmacists are one of our Nation's most trusted health care \nprofessionals. Utilizing their specialized education, pharmacists play \na major role in medication therapy management, disease-state \nmanagement, immunizations, health care screenings, and other health \ncare services designed to improve patient health and reduce overall \nhealth care costs. Pharmacists are also expanding their role into new \nmodels of care based on quality of services and outcomes, such as \naccountable care organizations, ACOs, and medical homes.\n  As we refine health care reform and seek new strategies to improve \npatient care, pharmacists will play a critical role. I believe Congress \nshould look at every opportunity to make sure that pharmacists are \nallowed to utilize their training to the fullest to provide the \nservices that can improve care and lower costs. In recognition of the \nseventh annual RxIMPACT Day on Capitol Hill, I would like to \ncongratulate pharmacy leaders, pharmacists, students, executives, and \nthe entire pharmacy community, for their contributions to the good \nhealth of the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/23/senate-section/article/S1708-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/23/senate-section/article/S1708-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA'S FISCAL YEAR (FY) 2015 BUDGET AND FINANCIAL PLAN, \n   RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE ON MARCH 20, 2015--PM 11\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to my constitutional authority and as contemplated by \nsection 446 of the District of Columbia Self-Government and \nGovernmental Reorganization Act as amended in 1989, I am transmitting \nthe District of Columbia's fiscal year (FY) 2015 Budget and Financial \nPlan.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \ncarry out certain major medical facility projects for which \nappropriations were made for fiscal year 2015, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I speak today regarding the \nintroduction of a bill, cosponsored by Senator Boxer, to provide the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs with the authority to obligate and \nexpend previously appropriated funds in order to begin construction on \ncritical projects in Los Angeles, Long Beach, and San Diego, CA, as \nwell as in Canandaigua, NY.\n  In December of 2014, Congress passed the Consolidated and Continuing \nAppropriations Act of 2015, which provided $446,800,000 for major \nconstruction projects at these Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. \nHowever, the Department of Veterans Affairs cannot spend the money that \nhas already been appropriated and begin construction on these projects \nbecause it lacks a separate authorization, which is required by law.\n  The funding provided for the three California projects will be used \nto make critical, time-sensitive seismic safety corrections to \nstructures in West Los Angeles, Long Beach, and San Diego. These \nbuildings, which include a spinal cord injury clinic, a mental health \ncare facility, and a community living center, are at exceptionally high \nrisk of collapse or suffering severe damage during an earthquake. If a \nmajor earthquake struck in proximity to one of these Medical Centers \nwhile it was in use by veterans and the Department's employees, there \ncould be numerous injuries and deaths. The U.S. Geological Survey \nestimates there is a greater than 99 percent chance that a magnitude \n6.7 or greater earthquake will strike California in the next 30 years.\n  It is important to note that even less severe earthquakes can cause \ndamage to seismically unsafe buildings that result in injuries and \ndeaths. The California Governor's Office of Emergency Services believes \nthat the damage to seismically unfit buildings caused by the magnitude \n6.0 earthquake that hit Napa, CA, on August 24, 2014 at 3:20 a.m. would \nlikely have resulted in many more deaths and injuries if it had struck \nduring business hours when these structures were in use. As it was, the \nearthquake caused over 200 injuries and one fatality. In fact, the U.S. \nGeological Survey estimates that a 6.0 magnitude earthquake hits \nCalifornia every 1.2 years on average. This is a terrifying figure, and \nit is why I strongly believe that Congress must enact this legislation \nwithout delay.\n  I appreciate that the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee worked \nextremely hard to pass important legislation last year to address the \nveterans' health care access crisis and that it, therefore, did not \nreport a construction authorization bill. However, in the case of these \nfour projects, the money has already been appropriated and is available \nfor expenditure as soon as an authorization is forthcoming from \nCongress.\n  More hearings and delays are unnecessary to determine whether the \nSenate should pass this legislation. The Senate Appropriations \nCommittee held hearings with the Department on these projects in 2014 \nas it reviewed the President's fiscal year 2015 Budget Request. The \nCommittee marked up and reported the Military Construction, Veterans \nAffairs, and Related Agencies appropriations bill in a bipartisan \nfashion. Congress voted in a bipartisan fashion to pass this bill and \napprove funding for these projects as part of the Consolidated and \nContinuing Appropriations Act of 2015.\n  I want to reiterate that Congress appropriated funding for these four \nmajor medical projects in 2014, and the Department is ready to start \nconstruction today. However, due only to the lack of a separate \nauthorization, the Department cannot start this vital work to protect \nour veterans and Federal employees. This is exactly why Americans \nbelieve that the Federal Government does not work. How does Congress \nexplain this unnecessary delay to veterans who go to medical \nappointments in the buildings at risk of collapse or major damage? \nThere is no reason to delay authorizing these projects when the money \nhas already been appropriated.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in quickly approving this legislation \nso that the Department can begin modification of buildings that \ncurrently leave veterans and the Department's employees in harm's way \nbefore the next earthquake strikes California. Congress must act before \nthe next earthquake strikes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Merkley, Mr. \n        Blumenthal, and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 838.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 838\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nextend the rural add-on payment in the Medicare home health benefit, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nWashington to introduce the Preserve Access to Rural Home Health \nServices Act of 2015 to extend the modest increase in payments for home \nhealth services in rural areas that otherwise will expire on January 1 \nof next year.\n  Home health has become an increasingly important part of our health \ncare system. The kinds of highly skilled--and often technically \ncomplex--services that our Nation's home health caregivers provide have \nenabled millions of our most frail and vulnerable older and disabled \ncitizens to avoid hospitals and nursing homes and stay just where they \nwant to be--in the comfort, privacy, and security of their own homes. I \nhave accompanied several of Maine's caring home health nurses on their \nvisits to patients and have seen first hand the difference that they \nare making for patients and their families.\n  Surveys have shown that the delivery of home health services in rural \nareas can be as much as 12 to 15 percent more costly because of the \nextra travel time required to cover long distances between patients, \nhigher transportation expenses, and other factors. Because of the \nlonger travel times, rural caregivers are unable to make as many visits \nin a day as their urban counterparts. For example, home health care \nagencies in Aroostook County in Northern Maine, where I am from, cover \nalmost 6,700 square miles, with an average population of less than 11\n\n[[Page S1712]]\n\npersons per square mile. These agencies' costs are understandably much \nhigher than other agencies located in more urban areas due to the long \ndistances the staff must drive to see clients. Moreover, the staff is \nnot able to see as many patients due to time on the road.\n  Agencies serving rural areas are also frequently smaller than their \nurban counterparts, which means that their relative costs are higher. \nSmaller agencies with fewer patients and fewer visits mean that fixed \ncosts, particularly those associated with meeting regulatory \nrequirements, are spread over a much smaller number of patients and \nvisits, increasing overall per-patient and per-visit costs.\n  Moreover, in many rural areas, home health agencies are the primary \ncaregivers for homebound beneficiaries with limited access to \ntransportation. These rural patients often require more time and care \nthan their urban counterparts and are understandably more expensive for \nagencies to serve. If the extra three per cent rural payment is not \nextended, agencies may be forced to make decisions not to accept rural \npatients with greater care needs. That could translate into less access \nto health care for ill, homebound seniors. The result would likely be \nthat these seniors would be hospitalized more frequently and would have \nto seek care in nursing homes, adding considerable cost to the system.\n  Failure to extend the rural add-on payment would only put more \npressure on rural home health agencies that are already operating on \nvery narrow margins and could force some of the agencies to close their \ndoors altogether. If any of these agencies were forced to close, the \nMedicare patients in that region could lose all of their access to home \ncare.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will extend the rural add-on \nfor 5 years and help to ensure that Medicare patients in rural areas \ncontinue to have access to the home health services they need. \nMoreover, we would offset costs of the bill by reducing the home health \noutlier fund by .25 percent over the same 5 years.

A bill to expand eligibility for health care under the \nVeterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 to include \ncertain veterans seeking mental health care, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, as we begin this week with the serious and \nnecessary discussions about the budget, I rise today to talk about \nsomething that is very personal to me, something that is incredibly \nclose to my heart--the service and sacrifice of our Nation's finest men \nand women, those who serve in our Armed Forces.\n  As the budget process moves forward, we must ensure that our national \nsecurity needs are met and that our veterans can receive the much-\nneeded care and assistance they deserve.\n  Growing up on a farm in rural southwest Iowa, my parents instilled in \nmy sister, my brother, and me the importance of hard work, service, and \nsacrifice.\n  In the summer between my freshman and sophomore years at Iowa State \nUniversity, I was very fortunate to attend an agricultural exchange in \nUkraine, when it was still part of the former Soviet Union. The Iowa \nstudents and I lived on a collective farm for a number of weeks. In the \nevening, when the community members came together, we did not talk \nabout agricultural practices, like I anticipated. What we talked about \nwas what it was like to be free, what it was like to be an American. \nThose were the things the Ukrainians wanted to know. They wanted to \nknow about freedom, our Republic, and democracy. Just a few short years \nlater, they became an independent nation. They are a sovereign nation.\n  It was then that I better understood what it meant to have freedom \nand how much people elsewhere truly desire it. I wanted to do my part \nto ensure our country always remained free.\n  That realization led me to make a decision when I was 19 years old--\nto join the Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps, commonly known as \nROTC.\n  For over two decades, I have had the great honor of wearing our \nNation's uniform. Today, I serve as a lieutenant colonel in the Iowa \nArmy National Guard, and I have been privileged to have led and \ncommanded at many levels, from platoon to battalion. From 2003 to 2004, \nI served as a company commander in Operation Iraqi Freedom. My unit was \ntasked with running convoys through Kuwait and southern Iraq.\n  As a soldier, I learned firsthand the vital role that our citizen \nsoldiers play. Citizen soldiers are folks who train for military duty \nso they are prepared to defend in the face of an emergency. These men \nand women take on this task voluntarily and can be called upon to serve \nat any time.\n  While overseas, I had the opportunity to serve alongside some of \nAmerica's finest, our bravest men and women. I saw firsthand how \ndangerous threats against our Nation can be.\n  It is becoming increasingly important that our military--Active Duty, \nNational Guard, and Reserve--are always working together as one \ncohesive unit. We are strongest in numbers when working together to \nbuild one another up and support one another. Our mission is clear and \nwe come from all corners of the country united on the same goal--to \ndefend our freedom.\n  I continue to remain focused on strengthening our national security,\n\n[[Page S1717]]\n\nboth in my role in the Iowa National Guard and on the Armed Services \nCommittee, where we discuss ways to support our exceptional military \nand develop bipartisan strategies to confront terrorism and destroy Al \nQaeda, ISIS, and those who are radicalized by them.\n  Here in the Senate, we also have an incredible responsibility not \nonly to make sure our country is protected but also to ensure we live \nup to the promises made to our veterans. These men and women are \ntrained and have selflessly sacrificed in defense of our freedoms and \nour way of life. However, we must ensure that our veterans are prepared \nto transition back to civilian life. They deserve nothing less than the \nbenefits they were promised and a quality of care we can all be proud \nof.\n  Unfortunately, that has not been the case. According to the VA, there \nare approximately 22 veteran suicides per day. We hear this number from \ntime to time. But think about it--22 veteran suicides per day.\n  In November 2014 testimony before the Senate Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, the VA's chief consultant for mental health said the average \nwait time for a mental health appointment at the VA is 36 days. We can, \nand must, do better for our veterans.\n  If a non-VA mental health care professional can reach a veteran 1 \nday, 1 week or even 2 weeks earlier than 36 days, Congress nor the VA \nshould be an obstacle to affording a veteran potentially lifesaving \nmental health treatment.\n  Veterans themselves are the only ones who know their mental health \nlimit, and a veteran should receive the benefit of the doubt about \nwhere that limit is--not the VA.\n  This is an issue that impacts all eras of veterans. Since coming to \nWashington, I have heard from many veterans on this very issue. One \nveteran in particular from the Vietnam war era admitted that he had \ntwice attempted suicide. This veteran felt like he didn't have anywhere \nto go. We have to do better.\n  Today, as my first piece of legislation in the Senate, I am \nintroducing the Prioritizing Veterans Access to Mental Health Care Act.\n  This legislation provides an option for our veterans to receive \nmental health treatment until they can receive comprehensive mental \nhealth care at the VA. This authorization for mental health care \nprovides a backstop--other than the emergency room--for our veterans. \nUltimately, the ER should not be considered a backstop for delayed \nmental health care at the VA. Most veterans who seek mental health \ntreatment at emergency rooms do so when they have reached the limits of \ntheir suffering.\n  There is no acceptable VA wait time for mental health care for our \nveterans. The limits to how much suffering a veteran can endure simply \ncannot be accurately measured by the VA or by any medical professional.\n  Specifically, this legislation puts veterans mental health care first \nand foremost, provides a backstop to VA mental health care, and \nprioritizes incentives to hire more mental health care professionals at \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  The Prioritizing Veterans Access to Mental Health Care Act does \nseveral things.\n  First, it amends the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act \nof 2014 to where a veteran is instantly authorized non-VA care if the \nveteran provides an electronic or hard-copy statement in writing that \nhe or she is not receiving adequate or timely mental health care at the \nVA. This eliminates the 40-mile and VA wait-time triggers for mental \nhealth care under the choice act.\n  Second, it prioritizes incentives for the hiring of mental health \ncare professionals at the VA.\n  And third, it provides the VA 90 days to enact the program.\n  I hope this legislation will receive broad bipartisan support because \nensuring our veterans have access to the mental health care they \ndeserve is not a conservative or liberal concept. It is not a \nRepublican or Democrat idea. It is an American value.\n  If we do not stand up for America's tenacious survivors, who will? \nThanks to these brave men and women, we are able to stand on this floor \nand fight for our beliefs and ideals. These veterans fought for us and \ndefended us tirelessly. They endured more than some of us can ever \nimagine. The invisible wounds of war can no longer go unnoticed. Now, \nit is our duty to do all we can to thank them and ensure they have \naccess to the quality mental health care they deserve.\n  God bless these men and women, and let us strive to do better for \nthem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/23/senate-section/article/S1717-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1717-S1729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 11--SETTING FORTH THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET \nFOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2016 AND SETTING FORTH \n  THE APPROPRIATE BUDGETARY LEVELS FOR FISCAL YEARS 2017 THROUGH 2025\n\n  Mr. ENZI from the Committee on the Budget; submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was placed on the calendar:\n\n                            S.

Res. 107\n\n       Whereas on September 26, 1945, White Sands Missile Range \n     (at that time, known as ``White Sands Proving Ground'') \n     launched its first rocket, a Tiny Tim Boomer, setting in \n     motion 7 decades of world-renowned development, testing, and \n     launches at White Sands Missile Range;\n       Whereas White Sands Missile Range exists as the premier \n     research, development, test, and evaluation facility for the \n     United States and excels in supporting missile development \n     and a diversity of other test programs for the Army, Navy, \n     Air Force, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, \n     other government agencies, and private industry;\n       Whereas White Sands Missile Range employs more than 13,000 \n     civilians and honorable members of the Armed Forces, \n     representing the Army, Navy, and Air Force;\n       Whereas White Sands Missile Range is recognized as the \n     ``Birthplace of America's Missile and Space Activity'' and \n     holds a unique place in history as the site of the first \n     atomic bomb testing, a site that later became known as the \n     ``Trinity Site National Historic Landmark'';\n       Whereas White Sands Missile Range remains the largest \n     overland military test range in the United States, occupying \n     3,200 square miles of southern New Mexico, and the largest \n     airspace controlled by the Department of Defense, comprising \n     9,600 square miles above ground, where the range conducts \n     unparalleled military testing;\n       Whereas White Sands Missile Range is increasingly \n     partnering with Holloman Air Force Base and Fort Bliss to \n     ensure that the unique assets of the region are used to the \n     utmost extent to contribute to national security, including \n     support of testing and training that is realistic, large-\n     scale, and joint or combined;\n       Whereas White Sands Missile Range is a home site of the \n     Network Integration Evaluation, which is a series of \n     semiannual evaluations led by members of the Armed Forces \n     that are designed to further integrate and rapidly progress \n     the tactical network of the Army;\n       Whereas the most recent iteration of the Network \n     Integration Evaluation occurred in October and November of \n     2014 and involved 3,900 members of the Armed Forces, allowing \n     the Army to stay on the cutting edge of technology and \n     providing an invaluable resource to national defense;\n       Whereas the Southern New Mexico-El Paso Joint Land Use \n     Study demonstrates the strong relationship that White Sands \n     Missile Range shares with Holloman Air Force Base and Fort \n     Bliss in western Texas and indicates that the range has an \n     annual economic impact of $1,717,289 on the region;\n       Whereas White Sands Missile Range has the distinguished \n     honor of hosting the annual Bataan Memorial Death March, \n     which commemorates members of the Armed Forces, and forces \n     from the Philippines, who fought and died defending the \n     Philippines\n\n[[Page S1730]]\n\n     only hours after the start of the Japanese attack on Pearl \n     Harbor, and who, after a valiant defense of the Philippines, \n     were captured by the Japanese and forced to march 65 miles \n     without any food, water, or medical care, while the Japanese \n     systematically abused them, leading to the deaths of many of \n     them; and\n       Whereas the mission of White Sands Missile Range remains as \n     pertinent to national security in 2015 as it was in 1945, and \n     the range should be preserved and strengthened presently and \n     for future generations: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commemorates the 70th anniversary of White Sands \n     Missile Range in New Mexico;\n       (2) expresses gratitude and appreciation to the commanders, \n     members of the Armed Forces, civilians, and other individuals \n     who have contributed to the mission and community of White \n     Sands Missile Range throughout its 70-year history;\n       (3) recognizes the great impact that White Sands Missile \n     Range has made on national security in the United States, \n     particularly its contributions in missile defense and space \n     technology;\n       (4) memorializes the sacrifice made by brave members of the \n     Armed Forces, and forces from the Philippines, who defended \n     the Philippines and endured the Bataan Death March;

Mr. President, I would like to make a comment about some \nlegislation that we introduced last week that is going to be of supreme \ninterest to a relatively small number of people--those people in \nAmerica who are general aviation pilots. It actually affects other \npeople too. This is something which is very significant, and I want to \ntalk about it for a minute.\n  It is important to pilots and aviation enthusiasts all over the \nNation. But over the course of my time, I can recall when there were so \nfew of us who were active commercial pilots, and those individuals who \nhad problems--particularly in our State of Oklahoma--would all come to \nme because they knew I had understanding of this. So people have come \nin for help.\n  One such person was Bob Hoover. Bob Hoover arguably may have been the \nbest pilot of his time. He is still flying today. I guess he is in his \nnineties by now. But about 10, 15 years ago, one inspector didn't like \nsomething he did, and he took away his license.\n  There are literally thousands of people who make their living as \nairline pilots. In the case of Bob Hoover, he is the guy who would go \nup in a Shrike--Chris, do you know what a Shrike is? A Shrike is a \ntwin-engine airplane. I used to own a Shrike. It is made by Aero \nCommander. He would put a glass of water up here on the top of the \ndash. He would do a barrel roll, and the water would not tip over. This \nguy was just incredible.\n  Anyway, it took an act of Congress that I introduced and passed to \nget him\n\n[[Page S1736]]\n\nback into the air. That is why this is so important to a lot of people.\n  I never realized, even though I personally helped a lot of people who \nwere having problems with their regulations and with an alleged offense \nby the FAA until it happened to me--when it happened to me, all of a \nsudden I realized just how frustrating and drawn-out the process could \nbe.\n  In 2011, I introduced the Pilot's Bill of Rights. I did that to \naddress some serious deficiencies in the relationship between pilots \nand the FAA. There are a lot of really great people, certainly, in the \nFAA. The occupier of the chair right now and I both are aware of this. \nIn Oklahoma City, we have several hundred such people. They are easy to \nget along with and are not overbearing. But any bureaucracy can have a \nfew people who merely want to create problems and say no.\n  So we introduced the Pilot's Bill of Rights--this was in August of \n2012--to ensure that pilots, like everyone else, would be treated \nfairly and equitably in our justice system. I think pilots are the last \ngroup of people who fall into that category we see so prominently in \nother countries where you are guilty until proven innocent.\n  Anyway, we passed the Pilot's Bill of Rights, and there are a few \nthings in there that did not get the congressional intent that was \noriginally meant to be. To remedy this, we introduced S. 571. It is the \nPilot's Bill of Rights 2. It is bipartisan. Right now, we are sitting \non 12 Republicans and 12 Democrats who will be cosponsors of this bill. \nThere are eight sections in the bill, three general subject areas.\n  First, the legislation reforms FAA's overly burdensome medical \ncertification process by expanding an existing exemption for light \nsport aircraft pilots to include more qualified, trained pilots.\n  Let me speak for a moment on the safety concerns. There is a small \nminority of people who think that expanding an exemption like this \nautomatically decreases safety. That is not true of this bill. I have \nthe numbers to show it.\n  In 2004, the FAA issued a medical exemption for pilots of light sport \naircraft. These are aircraft which weigh less than 1,320 pounds and \nonly have two seats. They had several restrictions. In the entire \ncountry, there are about 9,500 of them. It has been over 10 years since \nthe FAA issued this exemption, and since then, not a single accident by \na light sport aircraft has occurred that was related to a medical \ndeficiency.\n  A joint study was done by the AOPA, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots \nAssociation, and the EAA, the Experimental Aircraft Association, on the \n46,000 aviation accidents that occurred from 2008 to 2012. Of those, \nonly 99 had a medical cause as a factor. That is less than one-quarter \nof 1 percent of all accidents. Of those 99, none would have been \nprevented by the current third-class medical screening exemption that \nwas in the process at that time.\n  Extending that medical exemption for light sport aircraft to include \nplanes weighing up to 6,000 pounds with up to six total passengers, \nincluding the pilot, would add airman and aircraft to an existing FAA-\napproved medical standard--without degrading or creating substandard \nsafety. This approach has been endorsed by the Flying Physicians \nAssociation and the AOPA Medical Advisory Board. Both organizations are \nmade up of pilots who are also medical doctors.\n  This bill does not change the certification standards to obtain a \npilot's certificate, and all pilots still have to possess a pilot \ncertificate and pass the required practical test in flying. The bill \ndoes create consistency for aviators across the country, where \ninconsistency has been felt.\n  The second thing is--in fact, I would say this: We have documented \ncases where you have two people who have the same medical problem--one \nin Detroit and one in Tulsa, OK--and they are treated completely \ndifferently by the medical doctors where they are examined.\n  The second thing it does is it extends the due process rights \npreserved in the original Pilot's Bill of Rights to all FAA certificate \nholders. This would be other people who are holding FAA certificates, \nand it is not necessarily a pilot's certificate.\n  When Congress passed the original Pilot's Bill of Rights, we intended \nto allow pilots to appeal a decision by the FAA to the National \nTransportation Safety Board, the NTSB, and then pilots could appeal to \na Federal court. We did this because the review by the Federal district \ncourt is a de novo. That means they start with the pilot getting a \nwhole new trial, not using the same evidence as was used before the FAA \nor the NTSB.\n  In two separate cases, Federal district courts ruled that my original \nbill did not require a full hearing of the facts. This legislation \nexplicitly spells out the option to appeal an FAA enforcement action to \nFederal district court for a guaranteed de novo trial, meaning a new \nand independent review of the facts is guaranteed for these \nindividuals.\n  This legislation also increases transparency for all FAA certificate \nholders subject to an investigation or enforcement action by holding \nFAA accountable for communicating with certificate holders. The FAA is \nnow required to articulate a specific description of an accident or \nincidents under investigation to parties involved in the investigation \nand provide specific documentation relevant to the investigation.\n  While this is something that has happened in many cases, it has not \nhappened in all of them. This bill ensures that certificate holders--\nthese are pilots who are under investigation--are afforded basic \nfairness. They know why they are being investigated. They have the \nappropriate documentation to prepare a proper defense and can respond \nto the FAA from a position of knowledge and certainty in all cases.\n  I speak from personal experience. This happened to me when I was \ntrying to land in South Texas. They claimed I was not cleared to land. \nIt took me 4 months to get a recording of the particular person who \nhappened to be at the approach control and cleared me to land.\n  I am a U.S. Senator, and it took 4 months for me to get it, so I \nfigured others might not ever be able to wait this out, and they would \nhave lost their certificate. As I say, it is not a big deal to the \ngeneral public, but it is to anyone who is a pilot.\n  I am expanding the original Pilot's Bill of Rights to increase \ntransparency for pilots and certificate holders so they have \ninformation and resources to defend themselves should it be necessary.\n  The third thing it does is it expedites the updates of the notice to \nairmen--a NOTAM. A NOTAM is a notice to an airman, and it is something \nthat has historically been the responsibility of the FAA. If there is a \nproblem on a runway where we are going to land--if it is going to be \nclosed or they are doing repairs or something like that--they have to \npublish a NOTAM, in theory. However, in practice, it doesn't work that \nway.\n  In my case they claimed there was a NOTAM indicating that the runway \nI had to land on was closed. However, there was never a NOTAM. They \nsaid there was a NOTAM, and you just have to take their word for it.\n  The Pilot's Bill of Rights No. 1 was supposed to force the FAA to \npublish NOTAMs in a common place where people would know where they \nare, and they just have not done it. Now we have strengthened that to \nsay if a NOTAM action is not placed where it can be found, then they \ncannot use that as an enforcement action against a pilot. So that \nshould resolve the problem.\n  Fourth, the Pilot's Bill of Rights 2 extends liability protection to \nindividuals designated by the FAA, such as aviation medical examiners, \npilot examiners, and other individuals. That was the intent of the \noriginal one, but it was not specific. This has given a lot of \nindividuals willing to serve as designees a disincentive. My bill \nremoves the disincentive, ensuring increased access to medical \nprofessionals and designees to sign off on check rides and \nflightworthiness of experimental aircraft and all of that. So they \nwould get the same protection.\n  It is kind of the Good Samaritan law. There are a lot of times when \npilots are notified and asked to use their aircraft to help some worthy \ncause. I can remember one time down on the island just off of Caracas, \nVenezuela, it had been wiped out by a tornado. This was many years ago. \nSo I took 14 airplanes\n\n[[Page S1737]]\n\ndown there to help those people out. If something happened to one of \nthe airplanes and caused someone's injury or something, then they would \nnot be protected. They didn't have a Good Samaritan law. A lot of \npeople will not do this. People have actually lost their lives because \nthey didn't get the help they needed because people would not volunteer \ntheir equipment to help people. So we have a Good Samaritan law and \nthat should take care of that problem.\n  Many times I have seen when people are inspired as a volunteer--I \nhave done the same thing myself--but there is a disincentive to do \nthat. So the Pilot's Bill of Rights 2 is sensitive to the needs of \npilots, airmen, and the general aviation community, and they have \nworked closely with me on it.\n  I have to say that the OPA and the EAA have worked all the way \nthrough this thing and they are fully supportive, as are all their \nindividuals. In fact, I don't know of anyone in the aviation community \nwho is not fully supportive of this.\n  We have introduced this bill. It is bipartisan. It is something that \nSenators Manchin and Boozman--they are the cochairs of the Senate \nGeneral Aviation Caucus, and they are cosponsors of this bill.\n  I encourage Members--hopefully this will go to the commerce committee \nand we will be able to get a hearing on it very soon.\n  The House Members are waiting for it to come over, and we are anxious \nto get this bill passed. I know this is something that is not of \nconcern to an awful lot of people in this country, but I can tell you \nit is a big concern to people who are pilots.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/23/senate-section/article/S1737-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
