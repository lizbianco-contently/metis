Mr. President, I rise today to thank Rabbi Harold \nKravitz for offering the opening prayer today in the Senate and to \npraise him for all of his excellent work.\n  Rabbi Kravitz is rabbi at Adath Jeshurun in my State of Minnesota and \nis an important leader in our State. In addition to serving his \ncongregation, Rabbi Kravitz is also a leader in the fight against \nhunger. He is outgoing chair of the board of MAZON: A Jewish Response \nto Hunger, where he has been working to end hunger for all people \nregardless of their faith background.\n  One of the things most notable about Rabbi Kravitz is his commitment \nto bringing together people of all faiths to end hunger. I especially \nwant to recognize Rabbi Kravitz's work in Minnesota to make school \nlunches free and available for all children.\n  No child should ever go hungry. We know kids won't do as well in \nschool when they are hungry. It is also just wrong. That is why I have \ntaken up the issue at the Federal level as well, to try to make this \ncommonsense policy that Rabbi Kravitz has championed in MAZON as \nwidespread as possible.\n  Rabbi Kravitz has done excellent work in Minnesota and as a national \nleader in the fight against hunger.

Mr. President, sometimes the divide between the White \nHouse and reality can be stark. That was evident yesterday when \nPresident Obama told us that Obamacare was ``working'' and that \nessentially ``none'' of the warnings of the law's failures and broken \npromises had come to pass. I imagine the families threatened with \ndouble-digit premium increases would beg to differ, as would the \nmillions of families who received cancelation notices for the plans \nthey had and wanted to keep. That is especially true considering \nsomething else the President said--that Obamacare ``hasn't had an \nadverse effect on people who already had health insurance.'' That is \nwhat the President said, that Obamacare hasn't had an adverse effect on \npeople who already had health insurance. President Obama actually said \nthat. It may border on the absurd, but he did say it.\n  Perhaps the President will make even more bizarre claims today as he \ntries to bolster the image of a law that only 11 percent of Americans \nsay is a success--only 11 percent of Americans say Obamacare is a \nsuccess--or perhaps he will keep realities facing the middle class in \nmind. Instead of jousting with reality again, perhaps he will consider \nthe concerns of constituents who write in literally every day to tell \nus how this law is hurting them. Maybe he will remember the Kentuckian \nwho wrote to tell me this: ``I cried myself to sleep.''\n  ``I cried myself to sleep,'' said this Kentuckian who wrote to me \nabout this law. That is how she felt after losing health coverage with \nher employer and then being forced--forced--into an exchange plan she \ncalled ``subpar'' with a nearly $5,000 deductible. How helpful to most \nmiddle-class people is a health insurance policy with a $5,000 \ndeductible? She said, ``I work hard for every penny I earn, and this is \ncompletely unacceptable.'' It is also another example of a law that has \nfailed, and the sooner President Obama can come to grips with that \nreality, the sooner we\n\n[[Page S3890]]\n\ncan work together to replace the fear and anguish of Obamacare with the \nhope and promise of true health care reform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/09/senate-section/article/S3890-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, the \nDefense authorization legislation before the Senate would authorize the \nprograms and funding that provide the kind of training and equipment \nour military needs in the face of aggressive threats such as ISIL. It \nwould provide a well-deserved pay raise to the brave men and women who \ngive us everything to keep us safe. It contains exactly the same level \nof funding--exactly the same level of funding--President Obama \nrequested in his own budget: $612 billion.\n  It is just the kind of legislation you would expect to receive strong \nbipartisan support. Up until now, it has. The NDAA is a bill we \ntypically consider every year, and it is one that typically passes with \nbipartisan support. This year's House bill passed with votes from both \nparties, while the Senate version of the bill passed the Armed Services \nCommittee by a huge bipartisan margin of 22 to 4. That was in the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, the vote on the bill we have before \nus. It should be sailing through the Senate for passage by a similar \nmargin this week, but some in the Democratic leadership are now trying \nto hold it hostage for partisan reasons.\n  We live in an age when, as Henry Kissinger recently put it, ``the \nUnited States has not faced a more diverse and complex array of crises \nsince the end of the Second World War.'' Yet some Democratic leaders \nseem to think this is the moment to hold our national security hostage \nto the partisan demands for more spending on Washington bureaucracies, \nsuch as the IRS. They seem to think it is OK to hold our troops and \ntheir families to ransom if they can't plus-up unrelated bills, such as \nthe one that funds their own congressional offices.\n  The Armed Services Committee chairman just penned an op-ed on the \nissue that I would ask my colleagues to read. It made many important \npoints, including this one: There is bipartisan consensus that we \ncannot continue to hold defense funding at BCA levels after years of \ndangerous cuts. Military officials have told us that to do so could put \nAmerican lives at risk, which means it is a scenario we should be \nworking to avoid at all costs. But some Democratic leaders seem to view \nsuch a worrying scenario as little more than leverage to extract more \nspending for unrelated bureaucracies.\n  ``It is the first duty of the federal government to protect the \nnation,'' Senator McCain wrote in his piece. ``With global threats \nrising, it simply makes no sense to oppose a defense policy bill full \nof vital authorities that our troops need for a reason that has nothing \nto do with national defense spending.'' He is right.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator McCain's op-ed be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Here is what I am asking today. I am asking every sensible Democratic \ncolleague to keep onside with the American people and pull these party \nleaders back from the edge. I am asking my friends across the aisle to \njoin with us to support wounded warriors instead of more partisan \nbrinksmanship, to give our troops a raise instead of giving gridlock a \nboost. And I am asking them to work with us to defeat the contingency \nfunding amendment offered by the senior Senator from Rhode Island so \nthat we can keep this bill intact and consistent with the budget \nresolution.\n  The new Congress has been on a roll in recent months, getting things \ndone for the American people in a spirit of greater openness and \ncooperation. Let's keep the momentum going. Let's keep that spirit \nalive. If Senators have amendments, I would encourage them to work with \nSenator McCain to get them processed. But above all, let's ignore the \npartisan voices of the past and work together for more shared \nachievements instead. I think our troops and their families deserve no \nless.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Politico, June 9, 2015]\n\n             Obama Is Wrong To Hold Defense Funding Hostage\n\n                         (By Sen. John McCain)\n\n       Congress has passed a National Defense Authorization Act, \n     vital legislation providing the necessary funding and \n     authorities for our military and the men and women who \n     volunteer to defend the nation, for 53 consecutive years. \n     This year's NDAA should be no different.\n       The NDAA delivers sweeping defense reforms that will enable \n     our military to rise to the challenges of a more dangerous \n     world. The legislation contains the most significant reforms \n     in a generation to a broken acquisition system that takes too \n     long and costs too much. It modernizes and improves our 70-\n     year-old military retirement system, expanding benefits to \n     the vast majority of service members excluded from the \n     current system. The NDAA reforms Pentagon management to \n     ensure precious defense dollars are focused on our war \n     fighters, not on expanding bloated staffs, which have grown \n     exponentially in recent years.\n       With $10 billion in wasteful and excessive spending \n     identified in the Pentagon's budget, the legislation invests \n     in crucial military capabilities for our war fighters. The \n     bill accelerates Navy shipbuilding and adds fighter aircraft \n     to address shortfalls across the services. As adversaries \n     threaten our military technological advantage, the bill looks \n     to the future and invests in new breakthrough technologies, \n     including directed energy and unmanned combat aircraft.\n       Despite these critical reforms, President Barack Obama is \n     threatening to veto the NDAA and future defense spending \n     bills for reasons totally unrelated to national security.\n       The Budget Control Act, which set in motion dangerous \n     defense cuts, establishes caps on defense and nondefense \n     discretionary spending. There is bipartisan consensus on the \n     dangerous impact these spending caps would have on defense. \n     All of the military service chiefs testified this year that \n     funding defense at the level of the BCA caps would put \n     American lives at risk.\n       Rather than seeking to avoid this scenario at all costs, \n     the president is using it as leverage to extract increases in \n     nondefense spending. As his veto threat made clear, the \n     president ``will not fix defense without fixing non-defense \n     spending.''\n       Such intransigence shows a disturbing misalignment of White \n     House priorities. It is the first duty of the federal \n     government to protect the nation. With global threats rising, \n     it simply makes no sense to oppose a defense policy bill full \n     of vital authorities that our troops need for a reason that \n     has nothing to do with national defense spending.\n       The NDAA fully supports Obama's budget request of $612 \n     billion for national defense, which is $38 billion above the \n     spending caps established by the Budget Control Act. In other \n     words, this legislation gives the president every dollar of \n     budget authority he requested. The difference is that NDAA \n     follows the Senate Budget Resolution and funds that $38 \n     billion increase through Overseas Contingency Operations \n     funds.\n       Parroting White House rhetoric, some Senate Democrats have \n     been spreading misinformation about OCO funding, saying this \n     funding is inappropriate or somehow limited in its ability to \n     support our military. This is nonsense. The NDAA purposefully \n     placed the additional $38 billion of OCO funding in the same \n     accounts and activities for which the president himself \n     requested OCO money.\n       To be clear, using OCO to pay for our national defense is \n     not my preference. But given the choice between OCO money and \n     no money, I choose OCO, and multiple senior military leaders \n     testified before the Armed Services Committee this year that \n     they would make the same choice for one simple reason. This \n     is $38 billion of real money that our military desperately \n     needs, and without which our top military leaders have said \n     they cannot succeed.\n       It remains my highest priority as chairman of the Senate \n     Armed Services Committee to achieve a long-term, bipartisan \n     solution that lifts the BCA caps once and for all. Obama says \n     this is his goal as well. But the NDAA is a policy bill--not \n     a spending bill--and cannot accomplish that goal. In the \n     absence of such an agreement, I refuse to ask the brave young \n     Americans in our military to defend this nation with \n     insufficient resources that would place their lives in \n     unnecessary danger. Holding the NDAA hostage to force that \n     solution would be a deliberate and cynical failure to meet \n     our constitutional duty to provide for the common defense.\n       It is simply incomprehensible that as America confronts the \n     most diverse and complex array of crises around the world \n     since the end of World War II, that a president would veto \n     funding for our military to prove a political point. The NDAA \n     before the Senate authorizes $612 billion for national \n     defense. This is the amount requested by the president and \n     justified by his own national security strategy. For the sake \n     of the men and women of our military and our national \n     security, it's time the president learned how to say yes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/09/senate-section/article/S3890-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3890-S3891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the majority leader can't seem to let the \nfacts as they exist get in the way of his ideology. The facts are that \nthe Affordable Care Act is working, and 16.5 million people are proof \nof that because they have access to health care, most of whom did not \nhave it before.\n  In the light of day, it has been shown that private insurance \ncompanies were taking advantage of the American people. They cannot do \nthat now under the Affordable Care Act. Companies that are proposing \nthese huge rate increases simply won't get them. Understand that 80 \npercent of every dollar that is charged by an insurance company in \npremiums--80 percent of it--has to go toward caring for people. If it \ndoesn't, there are rebates, and hundreds of thousands of Americans \nduring the last few years have gotten rebates as a result of insurance \ncompanies not spending 80 percent of the money they are getting in \npremiums for health care.\n  The sad commentary is that insurance companies took advantage--took \nadvantage by not insuring people who had preexisting disabilities. One \n``disability'' that insurance companies said was preexisting was the \nfact that you are a woman. Some insurance companies charged more for \nthe same care if you are a woman and not a man. We have wide-ranging \nevidence that was in existence before and I guess my Republican \ncolleagues want back again where insurance companies determine how \nmuch--they could arbitrarily cut off insurance to someone. They had \nthese arbitrary limits. They can't do that anymore. Senior citizens \nhave received millions of benefits from the Affordable Care Act. They \nget a wellness check every year for no cost at all. They no longer have \nto worry about the hole in the doughnut, so to speak, as we call it, on \ncoverage for their prescriptions.\n  There are many things we can talk about. The fact is that the \nAffordable Care Act is working, and we are going to continue to defend \nit as the American people want us to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/09/senate-section/article/S3891-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1521\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this afternoon the Senate will vote on an \nimportant amendment offered by a graduate of the United States Military \nAcademy at West Point, the Senator from Rhode Island, Jack Reed, who is \nalso the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee.\n  I commend Senator Reed for the stellar job he has done in being a \nmanager of this bill. He is one of the most thoughtful and responsible \nMembers of the Senate and always has been. He has great legislative \nexperience, having served in the House before he came here.\n\n  Senator Reed's amendment addresses a major threat to our national \nsecurity and the middle class--sequestration. Sequestration refers to \ndeep, mindless, automatic cuts throughout the government. These cuts \nwere authorized 4 years ago to force Congress to reduce the deficit in \na balanced way.\n  Unfortunately, they did not work. Republicans are unwilling to close \neven a single tax loophole--not a single tax loophole to reduce the \ndeficit. Now we face the prospect of arbitrary and unreasonable cuts \nthat were once assumed to be so stupid that Congress would not allow \nthem to happen. But something that everyone thought was stupid is now \nofficial Republican policy. Unless we can reach a bipartisan agreement \nto fix sequestration, these cuts will occur, not smoothly but as if \ndone by a meat cleaver.\n  That threatens not only our military security but also the economic \nsecurity of America's middle class, which really is our national \nsecurity. The bill aims to avoid sequestration for the Defense \nDepartment with a widely ridiculed budget loophole, which would put \nactual defense spending on the Nation's credit card, increasing our \ndeficit and our debt.\n  I am stunned by my friend, the senior Senator from Arizona. When I \nwas an appropriator, I was on this Senate floor and I watched him, with \nhis staff in the back of the room every time we did an appropriations \nbill. He pored through line by line with his staff of every \nappropriations bill. If there was something he thought was askew he \nwould object to it. We got used to that because, frankly, it saved \nmoney over time.\n  He referred to all the pork that was in these bills, and he and I \ndisagreed on what was determined to be pork, but I understood where he \nwas coming from. I am just flabbergasted now that the senior Senator \nfrom Arizona, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, is agreeing \nto a one-time gimmick. All the experts have said these gimmicks don't \nwork--especially this one. Now, the committee, led by my friend the \nsenior Senator from Arizona, is agreeing to this gimmick. Think of \nthat. The Republicans, led by the senior Senator from Arizona, are \nadvocating deficit spending big time--not a little bit, big time--tens \nof billions of dollars.\n  Our troops deserve better than this. Meanwhile, unless we deal with \nthe impact of sequestration more broadly, middle-class America will \nsuffer drastic cuts in things that matter to them the most--cuts in \npriorities such as education, job creation, and lifesaving research. \nSequestration of nondefense programs is also an attack on our military \nfamilies. For example, sequestration threatens to cut VA spending, \nhealth care spending for the military, job training for returning \nveterans, schools that teach children of military families, and heating \nassistance for veterans who are struggling.\n  If we are going to be fair to military families, just as to millions \nof other working Americans, we need to fix sequestration for more than \njust the Pentagon. We need to fix it for defense and nondefense \nprograms jointly. Defense and nondefense are inextricable. They are \ncertainly things we cannot separate.\n  That is what the Reed amendment is designed to change through \nbipartisan negotiations. There is no reason to wait to negotiate a \nbipartisan budget. It makes no sense to start spending extra money on \ndefense or anything else until we agree on an overall plan. Put simply, \nwe ought to budget first and spend later. That is the only responsible \nway for a family or our Nation to conduct its business.\n  That is why the Reed amendment makes so much sense. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Reed amendment. A plan that avoids \nunnecessary cuts to priorities such as education, job creation, and \nresearch is what the Reed amendment is all about. It is a plan that \nfunds all agencies that protect our security, including the FBI, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, and the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration--all of these vital programs. It is a plan that funds \nour troops, protects military families, and makes the long-term \ninvestment needed to ensure a secure, prosperous future for all \nAmericans.\n  Less than 2 years ago, Democrat Patty Murray and Republican Paul Ryan \nproved it could be done. Let's put an end to the games and gimmicks and \nstart putting together a responsible budget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/09/senate-section/article/S3891-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

When the Senate is functioning properly, 12 separate \nappropriations bills are considered individually in the Appropriations \nCommittee and then brought to the Senate floor for debate and \namendment.\n  This process is designed to allow Senators to carefully examine \nprograms and consider the best and most responsible way to distribute \nfunding. But the\n\n[[Page S3892]]\n\nappropriations process has not worked that way for a while. Too often, \nover the past few years, the majority of the year's appropriations \nbills have been thrown together in one catchall funding bill, greatly \nreducing Senators' ability to take a hard look at spending and to \nensure that funds are being allocated responsibly.\n  Republicans are determined to change that. We started the \nappropriations process by passing a balanced budget resolution for the \nfirst time in over 10 years. This week, we continue the process with \nthe National Defense Authorization Act, which authorizes funding for \nour Nation's defense and our men and women in uniform. This \nauthorization bill is the first step in the appropriations process for \ndefense funding under what we call regular order.\n  This legislation accomplishes a number of important things. It \nauthorizes funding for our military at the President's requested level \nof $612 billion. It also eliminates waste and inefficiencies. \nSpecifically, the bill targets $10 billion in wasteful and unnecessary \nspending and redirects those funds to military priorities such as \nfunding for aircraft and weapons systems and modernization of Navy \nvessels.\n  The bill also focuses heavily on reform. The military's current \nprocess for acquiring new equipment and technologies is inefficient and \nbureaucratic. It wastes our Nation's resources and, even more \nimportantly, it reduces our military readiness by delaying the \nacquisition of essential weapons, equipment, and technology. The \nNational Defense Authorization Act introduces broad reforms to \nmodernize and streamline the acquisitions process, which will \nsignificantly improve the military's ability to access technology and \nequipment when it needs it.\n  The act also implements a number of reforms to the Pentagon's \nadministrative functions. Over the past few years, Army Headquarters \nstaff has increased while combat personnel have been cut. Army \nHeadquarters staff increased 60 percent over the past decade, yet the \nArmy is currently cutting brigade combat teams.\n  From 2001 to 2012, the Department of Defense's civilian workforce \ngrew at five times the rate of Active-Duty military. Prioritizing \nbureaucracy at the expense of our preparedness and our Active-Duty \nmilitary is not an acceptable use of resources.\n  The Defense authorization bill that we are considering changes the \nemphasis at the Department of Defense from administration to \noperations, which will help ensure that our military personnel receive \nthe training they need and that our military is ready to meet any \nthreats that arise. Finally, this bill overhauls our military \nretirement system. The current military retirement system limits \nretirement benefits to soldiers who served for 20 years or more, which \neliminates 83 percent of those who have served, including many veterans \nof the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The National Defense Authorization Act replaces this system with a \nmodern retirement system that would extend retirement benefits to 75 \npercent of our servicemembers. The bill before us today is a strong \nbill. It is the product of bipartisan efforts. It authorizes funding \nfor our troops at the level requested by the President and provides key \nreforms that will strengthen our Nation's defense and improve training \nbenefits and quality of life for our servicemembers.\n  Supporting this legislation should be a no-brainer. Incredibly, \nhowever, the President has threatened to veto this important \nlegislation. His reason is that the President does not want our \nmilitary to receive the increased levels of funding proscribed in this \nbill unless the President's nondefense funding priorities receive an \nincreased level of funding.\n  That is right. Apparently, President Obama is willing to hold up \nfunding for our Nation's military until Congress provides more funding \nfor agencies such as the IRS and the EPA. Well, the President can \ncertainly make his case to Congress when it comes to funding government \nagencies. Holding troop funding hostage for political purposes is \nreckless and irresponsible. If that were not enough, the White House is \nbusy lobbying Senate Democrats to abandon bipartisan efforts that went \ninto this bill and back up a Presidential veto.\n  The National Defense Authorization Act plays a key role in keeping \nour Nation safe. The President's attempt to hijack this bill for his \npolitical purposes is wrong. I very much hope that he will consider the \nimplications of what he is doing and rethink that threat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/09/senate-section/article/S3892-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3892-S3893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               OBAMACARE\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, before I close, I want to take just a few \nminutes and discuss the President's health care law. The President made \nsome comments yesterday on the upcoming Supreme Court ObamaCare \ndecision. Referring to his health care law, the President said:\n\n       What's more, the thing's working. Part of what's bizarre \n     about this whole thing is we haven't had a lot of \n     conversations about the horrors of ObamaCare because it \n     hasn't come to pass.\n\n  That was from the President yesterday. Let me just repeat and put \nthat into context. The President of the United States thinks that \nObamaCare is working and that negative predictions about the law have \nnot come to pass. Well, to respond to that, let me just read a few \nheadlines from the past couple of weeks. This from CNN: ``Obamacare \nsticker shock: Big rate hikes proposed for 2016.'' From the Associated \nPress: ``Many health insurers go big with initial 2016 rate requests.'' \nFrom The Hill: ``Overhead costs exploding under ObamaCare, study \nfinds.'' From the Associated Press again: ``8 Minnesota health plans \npropose big premium hikes for 2016.'' From the Lexington Herald-Leader: \n``Most health insurance rates expected to rise next year in Kentucky.''\n  I could go on. The truth is that not only is ObamaCare not working, \nbut it is rapidly unraveling. A May 1 headline from the Washington Post \nreported: ``Almost half of Obamacare exchanges face financial struggles \nin the future.''\n  Hawaii's exchange has already failed. California's exchange is \nstruggling to sign up consumers. One-third of the consumers who \npurchased insurance on the California exchange in 2014 declined to \nreenroll in 2015. The Massachusetts exchange is being investigated by \nthe Federal Government.\n  Colorado's exchange is struggling financially and has raised fees for \nconsumer insurance plans. Rhode Island's Governor is pushing for new \nfees on insurance plans to help fund the $30.9 million operating cost \nof the Rhode Island exchange. Now, incidentally, that is $30.9 million \nto run an exchange that serves just 30,000 people.\n  The Minnesota exchange was supposed to cover than more than 150,000 \nindividuals in its small business marketplace by 2016. So far, it is \ncovering 1,405 individuals, or approximately 1 percent of the number it \nis intended to cover. The Minnesota exchange has cost Federal taxpayers \n$189 million so far--$189 million for an exchange that provides \ncoverage for just 61,000 people.\n  A recent Forbes article notes that Vermont's exchange ``will need $51 \nmillion a year to provide insurance to fewer than 32,000 enrollees--or \n$1,613 per enrollee in overhead. Before ObamaCare, $1,600 would have \nbeen enough to pay for the entire annual premium for some individual \ninsurance plans.''\n  While the ObamaCare exchanges unravel, health insurance costs on the \nexchanges are soaring. Insurers have requested double-digit premium \nincreases on 676 individual and small group plans for 2016. More than 6 \nmillion people are enrolled in plans facing average rate increases of \n10 percent or more. Around the country, rate increases of 20, 30, 40, \nand even 50 percent are common.\n  One health care plan in Arizona is seeking a rate increase of 78.9 \npercent--so much for the President's promise that his health care plan \nwould ``bring down the cost of health care for millions''. In my home \nState of South Dakota, proposed rate increases range up to 44.4 \npercent. That is not something South Dakota families can afford.\n\n  The discussion about ObamaCare's success or failure is no longer \ntheoretical. The evidence is in, and it shows the President's health \ncare law is broken. It is time to repeal ObamaCare and to replace it \nwith real health care reforms that will actually drive down costs. Five \nyears under ObamaCare is long enough for American families.\n\n[[Page S3893]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/09/senate-section/article/S3893-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      EPA RULE AND BIG STONE PLANT\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the President's \nmisguided plan to reduce carbon emissions from existing powerplants, \nspecifically the impact it is going to have on my home State, South \nDakota.\n  Over the last year, EPA has claimed its rule will grant States \nflexibility to meet burdensome emission reduction targets. However, \nthere is really only one way for South Dakota to meet its staggering \ntarget of a 35-percent reduction; that is, by effectively shutting down \nBig Stone Plant, our only baseload coal-fired plant, which will soon be \namong the cleanest in the country.\n  The plant, which provides affordable power to thousands in South \nDakota and neighboring States, is nearing completion of a $384 million \nenvironmental upgrade project to meet the EPA's regional haze and \nUtility MACT regulations. So as you can see, highlighted on this poster \nby a Watertown public opinion op-ed headline, the clean powerplant \nwould threaten this significant investment.\n  The EPA has required this nearly $400 million upgrade--which is more \nthan the original cost, the entire original cost of the plant itself--\nand is now turning around and saying: That is not enough. We want it \nshut down.\n  Let me repeat that. The EPA has required a $384 million environmental \nupgrade to make the plant among the cleanest in the country and now \nwants to put all that to waste. This isn't right, and this will stick \nSouth Dakotans with holding the bill.\n  When the Obama EPA pushes new regulations to attack affordable and \nreliable coal generation, it is low-income families who take the \nbiggest hit. South Dakotans have already seen their electricity rates \nincreased to pay for that $384 million add-on, but the Clean Power Plan \nwill limit the ability for this investment to be recouped, and now they \nwill be charged even more.\n  This is because the Clean Power Plan would require Big Stone Plant to \nrun less, even on a limited or seasonal basis, not at the high capacity \nfor which it was designed and is most efficient. At the same time, the \nClean Power Plan would require the plan to run more efficiently to meet \nstrict emission requirements. So, again, we have had this nearly $400 \nmillion investment to make the plant cleaner and more efficient in \norder to satisfy the EPA, and now the Obama EPA wants to shut it down.\n  The Obama EPA should not push regulations that result in higher \nutility costs for consumers, less grid reliability, and fewer jobs. \nAffordable and reliable energy helps grow the economy and helps low- \nand middle-income families make ends meet.\n  Unfortunately, the EPA's rule will only increase electrical rates and \nhurt those who can afford it the least by forcing our most affordable \nenergy sources offline.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this burdensome rule and \nto prevent the serious economic burden it will impose on middle-income \nfamilies in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/09/senate-section/article/S3893-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3893-S3894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               OBAMACARE\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, this morning President Obama will be \nspeaking at a meeting of the Catholic Health Association of the United \nStates.\n  Now, the White House says the President will talk about his health \ncare law. The President has already been spending a lot of time talking \nabout the law. At the G7 summit in Germany this past weekend, the \nPresident was asked about the law and what he said is: ``The thing is \nworking.''\n  He said: ``We haven't had a conversation about the horrors of \nObamaCare because none of them have come to pass.''\n  The President must be kidding himself.\n  This morning, when he talks to this Catholic health care group, \nPresident Obama should stop his denial and he should confess the truth. \nIf he gives another rosy speech about the impact of this terrible law, \nhe will be, once again, intentionally and deliberately misleading the \npeople in his audience.\n  The President should not stand on the stage today and pretend his law \nis helping more people than it hurts. He should not stand on that stage \ntoday and pretend he hasn't heard that his law is causing premiums to \nskyrocket. He should not stand on that stage today and pretend he has \nkept his promises about this law. He should not stand on that stage \ntoday without admitting his law has cut into the take-home pay of \nmillions of hard-working Americans.\n  What the President should do is talk about how his health care law \nhas hurt nonprofit hospitals like the Catholic hospitals across the \ncountry. That was the subject of a Wall Street Journal article just \nlast Wednesday with the headline: ``Hospitals Expected More of a Boost \nFrom Health Law.''\n  Now, remember, President Obama said his health care law was going to \nhelp hospitals. He said it would help hospitals because uninsured \npeople wouldn't be coming into the emergency room needing free care \nanymore.\n  Well, that hasn't happened. Even more people are going to the \nemergency room today. According to the Wall Street Journal, nonprofit \nhospitals have seen a huge increase in Medicaid patients--and Medicaid \npays only about half of the cost of caring for patients.\n  The article gives an example of a group of nonprofit hospitals near \nSt. Louis. It has lost about $5 million as a result of President \nObama's Medicaid expansion. That is a big hit for a nonprofit hospital \nto take. It directly affects hospitals' ability to continue providing \nhigh-quality care.\n  If President Obama is honest today, I would say he needs to explain \nto this Catholic health care group why his health care law has not \nlived up to expectations. Is he going to explain why his law is hurting \ntheir ability to provide care? It is not only hospitals that are being \nhurt by ObamaCare, millions of people across the country are seeing the \nnews that their insurance premiums might soar by 20 percent, 30 percent \nor even more next year.\n  In North Carolina, Blue Cross Blue Shield says it needs to raise \npremiums by 26 percent. In Minnesota, Blue Cross wants to raise rates \nby 54 percent. President Obama spent part of his childhood in Hawaii. \nOne insurance company there is planning to raise premiums by 49 \npercent.\n  Will the President explain to this group today why premiums are \nskyrocketing?\n  I will tell you why they are skyrocketing. It is because of the cost \nof all the Washington-mandated services that came from ObamaCare. \nAnother reason costs are going up is all the bureaucracy that came with \nthe health care law.\n  There was an article in The Hill newspaper May 27 with the headline: \n``Overhead costs exploding under ObamaCare, study finds.''\n  The article says:\n\n       Five years after the passage of ObamaCare, there is one \n     expense that's still causing sticker shock across the health \n     care industry: overhead costs.\n\n  It continues:\n\n       The administrative costs for healthcare plans are expected \n     to explode by more than a quarter trillion dollars over the \n     next decade, according to a new study.\n\n  This is $270 billion ``over and above what would have been expected \nhad the health care law not been enacted.''\n  That is what this study found.\n  Under the health care law, Washington has been spending billions of \ntaxpayer dollars on health care: $1 out of every $4 is going to \noverhead--not to treat sick or injured people, not to help or prevent \ndisease, no, to overhead. It is the President's law. It is incredible. \nThis money isn't being used to help one sick child, to provide medicine \nfor a single individual, it is overhead.\n  As one of the study's authors put it, the money ``is just going to \nbureaucracy.'' According to this study, this works out to $1,375 per \nnewly insured person per year under Obama's health care law. Now, of \ncourse, people's premiums are going through the roof. The health care \nlaw created or raised 20 different taxes.\n  Maybe President Obama today should explain why $1 out of every $4 \nthat Washington spends on health care should go to bureaucracy instead \nof caring for patients. The President's health care law is hurting \nhard-working American families who are going to have to pay premiums of \n40 to 50 percent more next year. It is hurting the hospitals that are \nsupposed to provide\n\n[[Page S3894]]\n\nthe actual health care to those patients. It is wasting hundreds of \nbillions of dollars on overhead and bureaucracy instead of caring for \nsick people.\n  ObamaCare is an expensive disaster. Now, that is not just my opinion. \nA new poll came out the other day from CNN. It found only 11 percent, \nonly one in nine Americans say the law is a success. President Obama \nsays the law is working. Well, only one in nine agree with him. In \nanother poll, just 39 percent of people support the law. That is down \n10 percentage points in 1 year.\n  You ask: Why is it?\n  Well, because people look at it and say it is a bad deal for them \npersonally.\n  The President made promises, and he has broken them. He said: If you \nlike your coverage, you can keep your coverage.\n\n       Millions lost their coverage. He said the cost of insurance \n     premiums would drop by $2,500 per year.\n\n  Costs have exploded, the cost of the premiums, the cost of the \ncopays, the cost of the deductibles, and many people who have this \nexpensive new insurance cannot get care. Coverage does not equal care. \nThat is why this health care law is more unpopular now than ever \nbefore.\n  Sometime this month the Supreme Court could make an important \ndecision about the health care law. The Court is set to rule on whether \nsome of the billions of taxpayer dollars that President Obama has been \nspending were even supposed to be spent under the law. This decision \ncould affect more than 6 million Americans. So you would assume the \nWhite House is prepared for the decision. You would assume the White \nHouse would have a plan.\n  Well, does the White House have a plan for these 6 million Americans \nwho are worried about how they will pay for their expensive, new \nObamaCare plans with all of its mandates? Not according to the \nPresident.\n  In Germany yesterday, the President refused repeatedly--refused--to \ntalk about a plan B. The closest he came was to say, ``Congress could \nfix this whole thing with a one-sentence provision.'' That is not a \nreal solution. People see their premiums going up, and they are very \nconcerned.\n  President Obama owes America a serious answer. Republicans aren't \ninterested in a one-sentence fix unless that sentence is: ObamaCare is \nrepealed.\n  We want to protect the American people from this complicated, \nconfusing, and costly health care law.\n  If the Court rules against the President, then Republicans will be \nready to sit down with Democrats to get some things right. That means \nstopping ObamaCare's broken promises and its harmful mandates.\n  Republicans will offer a plan, and we will work with the President to \ngive people back the freedom, the freedom to make health care choices \nthat work for them and for their families. It will be up to the \nPresident and Democrats in Congress whether they want to join us or if \nthey want to continue with their partisan fight and their delusions \nthat this law is popular and working. I hope they will work with us on \nthe reforms the American people need, want, and deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/09/senate-section/article/S3894-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3894-S3895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               ARENA ACT\n\n  Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I rise to speak about our Nation's energy \neconomy.\n  ``Alpha Natural to Lay Off 439 at West Virginia Coal Mine''; ``Murray \nEnergy expects more than 1,800 coal mine layoffs''; ``Job Cuts Are \nDevastating Blow for Ohio Valley Coal Miners''; ``Coal analyst says \nindustry facing toughest time''; ``Power Bills To Get Higher''--these \nare just some of the headlines that have been in the recent news in my \narea. These headlines are a stark reminder of the impact misguided \nFederal policies will have on the lives of real people.\n\n  West Virginia and other energy-producing States have suffered \ndevastating blows. Hard-working Americans are losing their jobs as \ntheir energy bills keep climbing. I come to the floor to encourage my \ncolleagues to stand up for our Nation's energy future.\n  Last month, I introduced the Affordable Reliable Energy Now Act--the \nARENA Act--with Leader McConnell, Chairman Inhofe, my fellow West \nVirginian Joe Manchin, and nearly 30 of my colleagues. This bipartisan \nlegislation would empower States to protect families and businesses \nfrom electricity rate increases, reduced electrical reliability, and \nother harmful effects of the Clean Power Plan.\n  The ARENA Act would require that any greenhouse gas standards set by \nthe EPA for new coal-fired powerplants are achievable by commercial \npowerplants, including highly efficient plants that utilize the most \nmodern, state-of-the-art emissions control technologies.\n  Back in February, I asked EPA Acting Assistant Administrator Janet \nMcCabe to explain why, despite multiple invitations from Federal and \nState legislators, the EPA did not hold a public hearing on its \nproposed Clean Power Plan in West Virginia, given the large role coal \nplays in our economy and our electricity generation. And do you know \nwhat she said? She told me public hearings were held in places where \npeople were ``comfortable.'' Well, that response is unacceptable to me \nand to the people of my State. That response, which represents EPA's \ndisregard for the real-world impacts of its policies, helped shaped \nthis legislation.\n  The EPA's proposed greenhouse gas regulations will negatively impact \nboth energy affordability and energy reliability. Coal provided 96 \npercent of West Virginia's electricity last year and West Virginia was \namong the lowest electricity prices in the Nation. Last year, the \naverage price was 27 percent below the national average, but these low \nprices are not likely to survive this administration's policies.\n  Studies have projected that the Clean Power Plan will raise \nelectricity prices in West Virginia between 12 and 16 percent. Just \nlast month, 450,000 West Virginia families learned of a 16-percent \nincrease in the cost of electricity. While there were multiple factors \nthat contributed to this rate increase, compliance with previous EPA \nregulations played a significant role. If we allow EPA's plan to move \nforward, last week's rate increase will only be the tip of the iceberg.\n  Affordable energy matters. Mr. President, 430,000 low- and middle-\nincome families in West Virginia, which is nearly 60 percent of our \nState's households, take home an average of less than $1,900 a month \nand spend 17 percent of their aftertax income on energy. These families \nare especially vulnerable to the price increases that will result from \nthe Clean Power Plan.\n  Other West Virginia families will bear the brunt of the EPA's policy \nmore directly. In the past few weeks, 1,800 West Virginia coal miners \nreceived layoff notices. The notices came at Alpha Natural Resources \nand Murray Energy--the two largest coal companies in our State. Patriot \nCoal also filed for bankruptcy for a second time. Three coal-fired \npowerplants closed, also costing more jobs in the State of West \nVirginia.\n  When mines and coal-fired powerplants close, the ripple effect is \nfelt throughout our entire economy. The Wheeling Intelligencer reported \nthat the Murray Energy layoffs alone would mean almost $62 million in \nannual lost wages for Ohio Valley residents.\n  Other parts of our State have been hit just as hard. In Nicholas \nCounty, the local government was forced to lay off employees, including \na number of sheriff's deputies, because of a drop in the coal severance \ntax.\n  Last month, the Energy Information Agency released its analysis of \nthe proposed rule. The administration's own energy statistician found \nthat the Clean Power Plan would shut down more than double the coal-\nfired powerplant capacity we have by the end of this decade.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to give my overall support for the \ncontent of the Defense authorization bill, but my considerable concern \nand, therefore, my ``no'' vote on final passage in the Committee on \nArmed Services was because the bill, as crafted by the majority in the \ncommittee, is a travesty, using an artificial budget to authorize the \nnecessary operations and troop readiness of our military establishment.\n  Now, that is what the bill does. It is an artificial budget. That may \nnot sound particularly offensive, particularly when as a policy bill \nthere are many good things in this Defense bill; things such as \nproviding for the increase of our military services; things such as \ncertain weapons systems that are authorized.\n  Historically, this bill has been recognized as being bipartisan, and \nit addresses the problems posed by an increasingly dangerous world. The \nDefense authorization bill has historically provided the military with \nthe resources our Nation needs. But the ranking Democrat, the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island, and I are compelled to oppose this bill because it \naddresses these problems with an artificial budget that treats an \nessential part of our military, which is preparedness--the necessary \noperations training and maintenance, preparedness of our military--in \nan unplanned way. They are treating it as an expense by sending it over \nto an account that is not even on the budget--an account called \noverseas contingency operations or the funds for what used to be the \nIraq war and is now the winding down of the Afghanistan war. This is an \nunbudgeted item--operations readiness, training--necessary for our \nmilitary to be ready, and they are taking it out of the Defense \nDepartment budget and sticking it over here. Now, that doesn't make \nsense.\n  Some might say: Well, why in the world would they do that? Because \nfolks around here are concerned about something called the sequester, \nwhich is supposedly an artificial limit on keeping expenditures of the \nFederal Government below a certain level. That may sound like a good \nthing, if it is done with legitimate numbers, but when in fact you are \ncreating that artificial limit pressing down on Federal spending, but \nyou take a major part of that Federal spending out and put it over here \nin an unaccounted-for account that doesn't reach those budgetary caps, \nthat is nothing more than--I will put it politely--budgetary sleight of \nhand. I will put it more directly: That is budgetary fakery. Therefore, \nthis Senator is going to oppose the bill.\n  The Senate Committee on Armed Services has received testimony from \nmilitary leader after military leader--chief master sergeants, \ngenerals, admirals--who have said the policy of this arbitrary budget \ncap called sequestration is harming our national security and is \nputting our military strategy at risk.\n  Our strategy is not just dependent on defense spending, but it is \nvery dependent upon nondefense spending, which in this bill is not even \nbeing addressed because that artificial ceiling--the sequestration--is \nlike a meat ax right across the Federal budget. That is affecting--and \nevery one of those military leaders will tell you--that is affecting \nour military preparedness.\n  These arbitrary budget caps impact this nondefense spending. It keeps \nus from providing funds for other agencies that are so essential to the \nnational security. The Coast Guard, they are out there in the war zone. \nThey are in another war zone down in the Caribbean as they are \ninterdicting all kinds of drug smugglers. What about the FBI, the CIA, \nthe DEA, Customs, Border Patrol, Air Traffic Control, TSA? All of those \nare affected and affect national security.\n  So if we are going to continue to budget like this, the result is \ngoing to be more budget uncertainty for our military, and it is going \nto end up bleeding funds away from our military readiness.\n  What we are doing is we are avoiding the obvious. The obvious is \nworking around to bring those numbers down under those artificial \nbudget caps. So it is time for us to get rid of the sequester. We did \nit before, 2 years ago, with a bipartisan budget--the one known as \nMurray-Ryan. We need to do it again. Otherwise, right now, we are \nwasting our time working on bills that have no chance of becoming law. \nWe need to fix the budget caps for defense and nondefense spending. You \ndo not use a bandaid when you have an artery that is gushing blood.\n  Now, it is not just this. There are other examples. Take, for \nexample, a program that I have some familiarity with--our Nation's \nspace program. We have been trying since 2010, since Senator Kay Bailey \nHutchison, a Republican from Texas, and I passed a NASA authorization \nbill that put us on the course that will ultimately, as the President \nhas now announced, take us to Mars. But we can't get the policy updated \nbecause we can't pass another NASA authorization bill. So what happens? \nIt goes to the Committee on Appropriations. Thank goodness we have \nfolks such as Senator Shelby and Senator Mikulski who direct that.\n  But now what is happening to appropriations bills? They are being put \nunder this sequester, and, because of that, it is going to be hard in \nthis Chamber to get 60 votes to pass appropriations bills. As a result, \nwe are going to be in near cardiac arrest right at the end of the time, \nduring a continuing resolution, which is no way to run a railroad when \nyou appropriate money. We have to come to the altar and realize what we \nare facing, and that is this artificial budgetary cap.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to support amendment No. \n1521, which would limit the use of overseas contingency operations, or \nOCO, funds. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment, which was \nfiled by the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nSenator Jack Reed.\n  I wish to start by thanking Senator McCain and Senator Reed for their \nleadership in producing the underlining bill. Drafting the National \nDefense Authorization Act, NDAA, is no small task, and I support many \nimportant provisions included in the bill. As Ranking Member of the \nSeapower Subcommittee, I worked with Chairman Wicker to include \nprovisions that will strengthen and support our Navy and Marine Corps.\n  Every Defense bill presents challenges and tradeoffs. There are \ncompeting priorities and compromises. For 52 consecutive years, both \nChambers have debated the details and come up with a product that \nsupports and enhances our national security. However, this year's bill \npresents more than just a difference over details. The overall \nframework of this bill is a problem. Before us is a bill that presents \na serious question about our national values--a question that the Reed \namendment would help to answer.\n  Earlier this year, the Republicans pushed through a budget \nresolution. That resolution clearly set forth the framework that \nChairman McCain had to work within. That framework basically said: We \nare not going to address sequestration in a meaningful way. Instead, we \nare only going to provide sequester relief for the defense budget. I \nnote that this budget resolution passed the Senate without a single \nDemocratic vote. I ask my colleagues to join me in objecting to an \napproach that bifurcates sequester relief as though our country's \nnational security lies only with the Department of Defense, because \nthat is what this NDAA bill does. How? The bill before us takes $38 \nbillion out of the base budget at the Department of Defense and moves \nit into the OCO budget. The OCO budget is not subject to Budget Control \nAct caps. The reason for this is that OCO funds are intended to support \nthe unknown unknowns that arise during our security operations abroad. \nUsing the OCO account to fund noncontingency items is irresponsible. It \nis a 1-year fix, and it adds to our budget deficit. It is not fair to \nour commanders on the ground, who\n\n[[Page S3896]]\n\nhave told us that we need to fix sequester permanently so they can \nprepare for the long term. Using the OCO account to shield the DOD from \nsequester has been called a gimmick by many.\n  I am for a strong national defense. However, the foundation of our \nmilitary strength is the strength of our economy. It is the strength of \nour communities. It is the strength of our future. Failing to fix \nsequestration for both defense and nondefense will undermine the \nstrength of our national defense. Again, our national security is not \njust tied to our military strength. There are other national security \ninitiatives that are not funded by the Department of Defense. For \nexample, we have the State Department, the FBI, Homeland Security, the \nCoast Guard, and other law enforcement agencies and programs that are \nall important components of our national security. None of these \nprograms is funded by the Department of Defense.\n  In addition, the Department of Defense has said that fewer than one \nin four Americans in the eligible age range are qualified to enlist in \nthe Armed Services. This is due to a variety of reasons, including \nhealth, obesity, fitness, mental aptitude, et cetera. Cutting funding \nto nutrition programs, education initiatives, preventative health \nmeasures, and fitness programs will result in even fewer individuals \nqualifying for our Armed Services. By not fixing both the military and \ndomestic sides of the budget, we are undermining the foundation of our \nsecurity and our future.\n  America is one country, and the decisions we make in Congress should \nreflect that reality. We need to eliminate the sequester because these \nacross-the-board cuts hurt our middle-class families, our small \nbusinesses, our military, and our national security. We need to \neliminate the sequester--period. To continue to be bound by mindless, \nacross-the-board cuts to both our defense and domestic budgets--cuts \nthat were never supposed to become reality--is pure folly. Congress \nshould come together in a spirit of bipartisan cooperation to fix \nsequester.\n  This proposal by Senator Reed just fences the $38 billion in OCO \nfunds until Congress comes together to do just that. It doesn't take \nthe funding out of the budget. But it does prevent spending it before \nrelief from Budget Control Act cuts are achieved on both the defense \nand domestic sides.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Reed amendment to provide for a \nresponsible defense budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I have always said that being a \nsuperpower means more than super military might. It means super \ndiplomacy. It would contain restraint and super fiscal responsibility. \nAll of these are part of being a superpower.\n  Admiral Mullen, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nonce said that the greatest threat to our national security is our \ndebt--not another nation, not another army, not the fear of terrorism, \nbut basically our debt.\n  The United States has and will continue to have the greatest military \nin the world. But in order to remain the most powerful, we have to get \nour financial house in order. I think we all agree to that, but we \ndon't seem to be practicing it very much.\n  I fully support Senator Reed's amendment to basically fence the OCO \nfunding.\n  If we look to see how we have gotten ourselves into the situation we \nhave now, it is not Democrat or Republican. It is our fault, and it is \nour responsibility to fix it. Basically, we have had two wars in \nAfghanistan and Iraq that we didn't fund. We did it through accounting \nprocedures, emergency procedures, and contingency funds. Now we \ncontinue to expand upon that, if we go down this route without fixing \nit with Senator Reed's amendment.\n  Ensuring the safety of the American people does not mean increasing \ndefense spending to fund never-ending wars in the Middle East while \nignoring nondefense programs that are also crucial to our national \nsecurity. I have said this over and over. If we thought money and \nmilitary might could fix that part of the world, the United States of \nAmerica would have done it by now.\n  For years, critical nondefense programs, such as the Department of \nHomeland Security and the State Department, have been forced to absorb \ndamaging across-the-board cuts. They are also extremely important in \nsafeguarding the homeland.\n  While we continue to keep in place the budget cuts for these \nagencies, we have underhandedly gone around spending limits and \nimproperly increased war funding. The most recent gimmick we are \ntalking about, which has been explained, is an attempt to transfer \nroughly $39 billion from the base budget to the OCO budget to increase \nfunding for overseas conflict. I have said time and again that after a \ndecade of war in the Middle East, costing more than $1.6 trillion, does \nanyone believe we haven't done our part and tried? If money and might \ncould have changed it, we would have done it by now.\n  What is more important is that we are denying the funding from other \nimportant programs that desperately need these funds to keep our \ncountry stable, safe, and secure. In order to be truly secure, we need \nour non-Department of Defense departments and agencies to be able to \nfunction at full capacity also. The Pentagon simply cannot meet the \ncomplex set of national security challenges without the help of other \ngovernment departments and agencies. We are all in this together. We \nare all responsible to protect this country. But we are all responsible \nto make sure that we can properly ensure that people have the \nopportunity to take care of themselves also.\n  Retired Marine Corps General Mattis said: ``If you don't fund the \nState Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition.'' He might \nhave said that in jest, but I think underlying it he really meant it. \nAnd last week showed how vulnerable our networks are to cyber attacks \nfrom foreign nations and those who wish us harm.\n  We have had a cyber bill before us for many years now. We have been \ntold on an almost weekly or monthly basis of the threat we face from \nall different countries trying to hack in to do us harm. Yet we haven't \nbeen able to move because of the toxic political atmosphere we have \nhere.\n  Our national security is also inherently tied to our economic \nsecurity. Failures to invest in programs such as STEM education and \ninfrastructure projects are short sighted. Failing to provide BCA cap \nrelief to non-DOD departments and agencies would also shortchange our \nveterans who receive employment services, transition assistance, and \nhousing/homeless support through other agencies such as the Department \nof Labor. The bottom line is that we need to get our long-term budget \nthat reduces the deficit in line. Increasing the OCO money, as the bill \ndoes right now, only hurts that goal and makes it much more difficult \nand elusive.\n  Defense budgeting needs to be based on our long-term military \nstrategy, which requires the Department of Defense to focus at least 5 \nyears into the future. This is only a 1-year plan. Do we think it is \nnot going to be extended and extended and extended? Do we think we are \ngoing to start it and stop it in 1 year? I don't think so.\n  The fiscally responsible approach we need to take is to fix the BCA \ncaps. We are hearing about the whole issue of sequestration and how \nhorrible it is. Well, let me tell you how you can fix it: Sit down and \nput together a budget that is realistic and makes our long-term \nfinancial plans solid. That is all it takes. Yet we are unwilling to do \nit. We are just condemning it. We are condemning it because it \nconstrains how we want to do business, which means not being held \naccountable or responsible. That is all.\n  Every meeting I go to, whether it is nondiscretion or military \nspending--we all need more to expand programs. Yet we never take the \nGAO's report. The General Accountability Office says we could save $300 \nbillion to $400 billion a year if we could just get rid of the waste \nand the redundancies that go on, and we are not doing anything about \nthat.\n\n[[Page S3897]]\n\n  I say again that our national debt is not a Democratic problem or a \nRepublican problem. It is our problem. We all own this one.\n  In 2008, our country faced one of the worst financial crises in our \nNation's history. We added $1 trillion to our debt--on top of the \ntrillions of dollars already spent on two costly wars and the Bush tax \ncuts, which President Obama basically extended twice.\n  Between the wars, the tax cuts, the recession, and our out-of-control \nspending, our Nation's debt has exploded from $5 trillion to $18 \ntrillion. Currently, our deficits are decreasing, from $1.4 trillion in \n2009 down to a little under one-half billion dollars, according to the \nCBO, and it is expected to remain stable for the next couple of years.\n  The bad news is that after 2017, if we don't change our ways, the \ndeficits are projected to increase over $1 trillion a year through \n2025. Unless Congress can put aside partisan politics and put the \ncountry on a fiscally sustainable path, we will add over $7.5 trillion \nto our debt in the next 10 years. That is adding $7.5 trillion to $18 \ntrillion of debt we have right now. There is no way the next generation \nand the generation after will ever be able to dig out of this hole if \nwe don't fix it now. But we have to be smart about how we reduce \nspending.\n  As we saw in the 2013 sequestration, indiscriminate, across-the-board \ncuts harmed bad and good programs alike, did nothing to reduce waste \nand abuse, and caused individuals to be furloughed and lose their jobs.\n  I have always said this: When you start cutting, you don't cut, \nbasically, the items that continue to make progress for you. When the \nIRS doesn't do its job and it is incapable of doing it--the revenues \nowed to this country and the taxes that people should be paying--we \ncan't cut back on that and expect it to be solid.\n  I have pushed hard for a bipartisan compromise that would reduce \nspending, fix our broken tax system, and reform entitlement programs in \norder to reduce our debt and provide the economy with certainty and \nstability.\n  For instance, we could enact $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction over \nthe next 10 years if we just follow the Simpson-Bowles \nrecommendations. It is an all-encompassing approach that raises revenue \nand promotes growth through comprehensive tax reform that brings our \nTax Code into the modern age--increasing efficiency and simplifying the \nprocess for both individuals and businesses.\n\n  Additionally, the plan enacts serious entitlement reform and makes \nadditional targeted spending cuts aimed at long-term deficit reduction \nso that we can encourage economic growth. It is crucial that we make \nthe necessary reforms that will make this Nation a better place for \nfuture generations.\n  With that being said, I again express my support for Senator Reed's \namendment to the defense budget that would block any additional \nunnecessary, unaudited spending for a continual war effort where we \nhave no oversight. We were elected to basically look at the process we \nhave.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an extra 2 minutes, if I could, to \nfinish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. With that being said, Mr. President, all I am saying is \nthat we should be smart and learn from our past and the experiences we \nhave had. It has not worked well for us right now, and we can change \nit. We are the only ones who can change it.\n  This country has a strong economy. It could be even stronger if we \nwork together. The bottom line is we want to be smart. We want to be \nsmart about where we invest our money and where we send our troops and \nput Americans in harm's way. We want to be smart in the domestic \ninvestments we make here in this country. We want to make sure they are \nworking. If they are not working, then, you know what, do not be afraid \nto say: I tried and it did not work. I am going to try something \ndifferent.\n  Basically, if you have two programs doing the same thing, \nconsolidate. Let's start looking for ways that we can run this country \nthe way each American is expected to run their life. Every small \nbusiness or large business is expected to make prudent investments and \nwork efficiently. That is all we have asked for. This type of spending, \nbasically unaccountable, will lead us down the path to increase the \ndebt and does not make us any more secure and gets us involved in \nplaces where we do not have any oversight or any input.\n  I do not--I do not--as a U.S. Senator wish to walk away from my \nresponsibilities to make recommendations for what I think would be best \nfor not only the West Virginia people, whom I represent, but for this \nentire country, which I love.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I voted against the Budget Control Act as \na Member of the House of Representatives because I did not think it was \na responsible course for our country. To me, ``sequestration'' is just \na fancy term for mindless budget cuts. Unfortunately, sequestration \nbecame law and the mandated across-the-board spending cuts went into \neffect in March of 2013.\n  I have been fighting to completely eliminate sequestration through a \nbalanced approach to Federal spending and changes to our Tax Code to \nreduce our budget deficit. That is why I am very disappointed that the \nDefense authorization bill we are considering today uses a budget \ngimmick to end sequestration cuts for defense spending but continues to \nimpose mandatory cuts for critical domestic priorities, such as \neducation, health care, and medical research.\n  This legislation transfers nearly $40 billion in defense spending to \na glorified slush fund called the overseas contingency operations \naccount, OCO account, as a way to avoid triggering sequestration cuts. \nLet's be clear. OCO really stands for ``open checkbook operation'' for \nour budget, and it stands for ``outrageous copout'' by the GOP.\n  Instead of cutting funding for defense, Republicans choose instead to \ncut programs for the defenseless. This is not responsible budgeting; it \nis a cynical game. The majority is attempting to avoid its \nresponsibilities under sequestration that they themselves demanded be \nenacted into law just a few years ago. Instead, we get $40 billion in \nadditional spending for the Pentagon and $36 billion in cuts to food \nstamps, Head Start, preventive health care, and critical social \nprograms.\n  This is what the game is all about. Sequestration is now being \ndishonored. They believe they have found an exit ramp for the Defense \nDepartment for the cuts that they had accepted as a party--the \nRepublicans--would be imposed if the Democrats would accept in equal \nmeasure cuts in social programs. That is the deal, a sword of Damocles \nhanging over both programs, defense and nondefense--that is civilian \nand domestic programs--to force us as an institution to work together \nin a responsible fashion. That was the deal with sequestration. That \nwas the point of it. It was to force us to work together. Instead, the \nRepublicans want an exit ramp for the Defense Department out of the \nsequestration program while allowing the social programs for the poor, \nfor the sick, and for the elderly to stay inside of these cuts that \noccur under a sword of Damocles on an automatic basis.\n  We are endangering our ability to teach our kids the skills they will \nneed for the jobs of the future. We are making it harder for poor \nfamilies in Massachusetts and across the country to put food on the \ntable. We are jeopardizing the health of grandma and grandpa.\n  And what are we really protecting when we mandate these cuts for \ncritical social programs but not for our defense spending? We are \nprotecting America's nuclear arsenal budget of $50 billion a year that \nis filled with waste and can be cut significantly without harming our \nnational security. We spend more money on nuclear weapons than all \nother countries combined. This is the epitome of overkill. Can we find \nanything in the nuclear weapons budget that could be cut? Absolutely \nnot, say the Republicans. We have to increase that budget. How are we \ngoing to pay for it? We are going to pay for it from poor children, \nfrom the elderly in our country.\n  We spend more money on nuclear weapons just because the Defense \nDepartment and the military contractors want them. That is why I have \nintroduced legislation with Jeff Merkley,\n\n[[Page S3898]]\n\nBernie Sanders, and Al Franken called the SANE Act, the Smarter \nApproach to Nuclear Expenditures Act. It would cut $100 billion over \nthe next 10 years from our bloated nuclear weapons budget.\n  It is time to stop funding a nuclear weapons budget that threatens to \nundermine our long-term economic security. We should be funding \neducation, not annihilation. We should be helping people find jobs, not \nhelping to build new nuclear weapons. We should be curing diseases, not \ncreating new instruments of death.\n  Even within our own budget, the Department of Defense should be \nprioritizing higher pay for marines, not more Minutemen missiles. \nSomewhere, Dr. Strangelove is smiling from the grave while millions of \nAmerican families struggle to meet the daily budget they have to \nbalance.\n  I am a cosponsor of the Reed amendment to stop any increase in this \nso-called OCO account until the Budget Control Act caps for both \ndefense and nondefense spending are lifted equally.\n  For those who say the cuts to defense spending endanger our security, \nI say we face a very real type of economic security threat here at \nhome. Millions of seniors worry about an end to Medicare and Medicaid. \nMillions of students need help to pay for college. Millions of American \nworkers cannot make ends meet on the minimum wage.\n  I support the Reed amendment. That will keep America truly safe, \nhealthy, and secure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Obama administration is also unsure about how \n     strongly it should push back against what US officials see as \n     a long-term Chinese plan to control the region's waters.\n\n  Finally, this is an article that is in Politico today:\n\n       Actually, the United States does have a strategy to fight \n     the Islamic State, a State Department spokesman says.\n       ``The president was referring yesterday to a specific plan \n     to improve the training and equipping of Iraqi security \n     forces, and the Pentagon is working on that plan right now. \n     But absolutely, we have a strategy,'' Kirby said Tuesday on \n     MSNBC's ``Morning Joe.''\n\n  I would be overjoyed to have a complete strategy and that plan \npresented to Congress and the American people. It would be a wonderful \nevent. The fact is they have no strategy or policy and the world is on \nfire, and here we are trying to pass an amendment which would deprive \nthe men and women who are serving the means and wherewithal to defend \nthis Nation.\n  I hope my colleagues will strongly reject the amendment that will be \npending before this body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nMikulski, Senator Merkley, Senator Udall, Senator Leahy, Senator \nDonnelly, Senator Boxer, Senator Menendez, Senator Booker, Senator \nFeinstein, Senator Cardin, Senator Klobuchar, and Senator Peters as \ncosponsors of the Reed amendment No. 1521 to H.R. 1735.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to discuss my amendment No. 1521 to \nfence all funding above $50.9 billion in the account for overseas \ncontingency operations until budget caps on both defense and nondefense \nhave been raised. My amendment specifically recognizes the need for \nthese resources, but it objects to the way this OCO fund is being used \nas a way to circumvent the Budget Control Act. It does so, I think, on \na very sound ground that over the long run will be beneficial to the \nDepartment of Defense and to everyone who is engaged in the defense of \nthe United States.\n  We debate and vote on many issues in the Senate. While all of the \nissues are important, occasionally we must face an issue that could \ntruly change the course of our Nation because the consequences of our \nactions are often not known for years. The votes may be very difficult \nwhen they are taken, but they are very important.\n  One example of such an issue is Iraq. Thirteen years ago, the \nmajority of the body--79 Senators from both parties--voted to go to war \nin Iraq. I did not vote in favor of the war. In fact, I spoke against \nit. I think the outcome could have been very different back then if we \nhad more of a debate about the true costs and the long-term costs, the \nthousands of lives lost, and the countless wounded--some with invisible \nscars--if we had thought the United States would be on a war footing \nfor over a decade and American taxpayers would be on the hook for \ntrillions of dollars and that we would perhaps even contribute by our \nactions to new threats we are facing today.\n  Back then it was implied and sometimes stated that opposing the Iraq \nwar meant you didn't support the troops or were weak on national \nsecurity. I think the intervening years have shown that to be \ninaccurate.\n  We are hearing echoes of that rhetoric again: If you don't support \nthis version of the NDAA, then you don't support the troops or terms \nlike ``taking this bill hostage.'' That is just not the case.\n  Since 2005, Senate Republicans voted against cloture on the NDAA, the \nNational Defense Authorization Act, 10 times, and over that same \nperiod, they cast votes against final passage of the NDAA on the Senate \nfloor 8 times. Sometimes it was because of policy differences, such as \nending ``don't ask, don't tell.'' Other times it was over something \nlike gas prices at the pump or other issues. But I don't think anyone \nhas ever done it to be unpatriotic.\n  We can't change history, but we can certainly learn from it. We can't \nsee into the future, but we know we must plan for it, and we must pay \nfor it by making strategic investments today. This debate really boils \ndown to this: What is the most effective way to provide for our \nnational defense? I don't think inflating the overseas contingency \noperations, OCO, is the way to go because it complicates rather than \nhelps the Pentagon's budgetary problems. It doesn't allow the military \nto effectively plan for the future.\n  We need to replace the senseless sequester with a balanced approach \nthat keeps America safe and strong at home and abroad. When it comes to \nthe defense budget, Congress should adhere to the same standards of \nhonesty, transparency, and discipline that we demand for our troops. \nBut right now there is a serious disconnect in the OCO mechanism of \nthis bill, and Congress needs to step up and fix it.\n  The President's fiscal year 2016 budget request for defense was $38 \nbillion above the 2011 Budget Control Act, the BCA--their spending \ncaps. The President requested this $38 billion be authorized and \nappropriated as part of the annual base budget so they could be part of \nthe Defense Department's funding, not just for 1 year, as OCO is, but \nin the budget for an indefinite period of time.\n  The request also contained $50.9 billion for the OCO account, meaning \nfunding for truly war-related expenses and not enduring base budget \nrequirements. However, this bill, following the\n\n[[Page S3900]]\n\nlead of the majority's budget resolution, does not address the BCA's \ndamaging impacts on defense and nondefense. Instead, it turns to a \ngimmick.\n  This bill initially transferred $39 billion from the base budget \nrequest by the President to the OCO budget, leaving a base budget \nconveniently below the BCA levels in order to avoid triggering \nautomatic reductions for sequestration. The funding shifted to OCO is \nfor enduring requirements of military services, not direct war-related \ncosts and not those costs generated in Iraq, Afghanistan, and \nelsewhere. It includes flying hours for aircraft, steaming days for \nships and submarines, and all training that supports the ``National \nMilitary Strategy.'' These are not appropriate OCO expenses. These are \nthe expenses of the Department of Defense facing the long-term \nchallenges and maintaining the long-term capabilities of the U.S. \ndefense forces.\n  Some have said we should avoid subjecting defense spending to the \nbudget control caps through this OCO approach for a year while a deal \nto revise or eliminate the BCA caps is negotiated. I couldn't disagree \nmore, because if we used this approach--this gimmick--for 1 year, it \nwould be easier to do it next year and the year after and the year \nafter that, ensuring an enduring imbalance between security and \ndomestic spending. Using OCO in this way is completely counter to the \nintent of the BCA, the Budget Control Act.\n  The BCA imposed steep cuts to defense and nondefense spending to \nforce a bipartisan compromise. This approach unilaterally reneges on \nthat bipartisan approach. Rather than generating momentum for a \npermanent solution to sequestration, this approach essentially exempts \ndefense spending from the BCA caps and releases all pressure to find a \nsolution that provides similarly for domestic spending priorities.\n  The President's defense budget request placed the needed funding in \nthe base where it should be and provided for the OCO funds for \ncontingencies overseas that exist today. The budget resolution and the \nbill before us met the President's request for overall funding. This is \nnot a question of whether the President asked for a certain amount of \nmoney and my Republican colleagues are asking for more. What they did \nis essentially say: We are not going to technically--and I emphasize \n``technically''--violate the BCA account. We are just going to move \nmore money into OCO. So we can stand up with a straight face and say: \nWell, BCA applies across the whole board. Every government agency is \nsubject to the same tight limits that the Budget Control Act imposes. \nBut, of course, the truth is that through the use of OCO those limits \ndon't apply to the Department of Defense.\n\n  It is particularly startling when you look at the President's request \nfor domestic agencies. He asks for $37 billion for all of the other \ndomestic agencies above the BCA cap. Without that money they are going \nto have a very difficult--indeed, perhaps impossible--challenge of \nmeeting the basic needs of the American public--needs that every \ncolleague in this Chamber recognizes. Some might disagree with them, \nbut they recognize that we need to support education, as we have done \nfor decades through the Title I Program. We need to support people--our \nseniors, particularly--through senior housing programs. In every State, \nin every community, that has to be done. But if we follow this path, it \nwill be harder and harder for nondefense agencies to do this.\n  What we have created is a huge loophole through the BCA for defense. \nAgain, let me remind you, the President and my colleagues on the other \nside are not arguing about the resources necessary for defense. They \nhave picked the same number. But what they have done on the other side \nis funded that--not straightforwardly, not recognizing that we have to \ndeal with this--instead by using this gimmick.\n  If it remains in the bill, I believe this approach will be a magnet \nfor nondefense spending in future years. Not only will we become \naddicted to OCO spending, many interesting things will find their way \ninto the OCO account.\n  For example, in fiscal year 1992 Congress added funds to the Defense \nbill for breast cancer research. At the time, spending was subject to \nstatutory caps under the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990. This is the \nfollow-on to the Graham-Rudman-Hollings act of 1985. What we had done \nwas to establish caps on discretionary domestic spending, but there \nwere no similar caps on the other side. That is precisely what the \neffect of this proposal is today.\n  The initial funding led to the establishment of the Congressionally \nDirected Medical Research Programs or CDMRP. Every Senator is familiar \nwith this important program. I would suspect every Senator has stood \nand said: Yes, that research on breast cancer is so important; that \nresearch on other diseases is so critical and so important. It has \nstrong bipartisan support.\n  Each fiscal year Congress authorizes and appropriates hundreds of \nmillions of dollars to the CDMRP for cutting-edge and critically \nessential medical research areas. In fact, since 1992, CDMRP funding \nhas received over $13 billion. While this program is funded through the \nDefense bill, and the program is managed by the Army, the Department of \nDefense does not execute any of the money itself. It is a competitive \ngrant process, and proposals are subjected to stringent peer and \nprogrammatic review criteria. DOD acts as a passthrough because, back \nthen, the only way you could get this done was because there were no \ncaps effectively on defense spending. I would suggest that is going to \nrepeat itself over and over if we start on this path.\n  That is why we can look today and say we have these pressing crises \nall across the globe, and it is true. But if we go down this path, we \nwill see these types of developments. Again, I am a strong supporter of \nmedical research. These programs have saved countless lives. I will \nsupport the funding in this bill. I think it is a way that we have \nestablished to deal with these programs. But we should recognize that \nit came about not because it was the most logical place to put medical \nresearch funding, but it was a budgetary precedent, just like this \napproach today, and it will be replicated.\n  Looking forward 10 years, I would suggest that you will see lots of \nmeritorious programs that bear less and less connectivity to our \noverseas operations included in OCO, if that is the way we choose to \nget around the BCA. And that is what this bill is doing.\n  There is another point I would like to add. Moving this funding from \nthe base budget to OCO has no impact on reducing the deficit. OCO and \nemergency funding are outside budget caps for a reason. They are for \nthe costs of ongoing military operations or responding to other \nunforeseen events such as natural disasters. To suddenly ignore the \ntrue purpose of OCO and to treat it as a budgetary gimmick or slush \nfund to skirt the BCA is an unacceptable use for this important tool \nfor our warfighters.\n  Just to highlight how this OCO approach skews defense spending, \nconsider the amount of OCO in relation to the number of deployed \ntroops. You can ask someone on the street: Are these overseas funds \nused to support our forces overseas? There has to be some relationship \nbetween the number of our forces overseas and our OCO spending. Well, \nlet's see. In 2008, at the height of our Nation's troop commitments in \nIraq and Afghanistan, there were 187,000 troops deployed. We spent \napproximately $1 million in OCO funding for every servicemember \ndeployed to those countries. Under this bill, we would expend \napproximately $9 million in OCO for every servicemember who served in \nIraq and Afghanistan, roughly 9,930 military personnel. We are doing a \nlot more than spending for OCO in this bill--deliberately a lot more. \nWe are doing what we used to do and what we should do in the base \nbudget of the Department of Defense.\n  It circumvents the law, the BCA. It is not fiscally responsible, and \nit is not an honest accounting to the American public. If years ago, \nwith 187,000 troops, our OCO costs were about $1 million per troop and \nnow we are at $9 million, something is askew.\n  Adding the funds to OCO does not solve--and in some cases \ncomplicates--the DOD's budgetary problems.\n  As Army Chief of Staff General Odierno said:\n\n       OCO has limits and it has restrictions and it has very \n     strict rules that have to be followed. And so if we're \n     inhibited by that, it\n\n[[Page S3901]]\n\n     might not help us. What might happen at the end of the year, \n     we have a bunch of money we hand back because we are not able \n     to spend it.\n\n  The defense budget needs to be based on a long-term military \nstrategy, which requires the DOD to focus on at least 5 years in the \nfuture. A 1-year plus-up to OCO does not provide DOD with the certainty \nand stability it needs when building a 5-year budget. As General \nDempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff testified, ``we need \nto fix the base budget . . . we won't have the certainty we need,'' if \nthere is a year-by-year OCO fix. Defense Secretary Carter added that \nraising OCO does not allow the Department of Defense to plan \n``efficiently or strategically.''\n\n  Adding funds to OCO is a managerially unsound approach to what should \nbe a multiyear budget process. As the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army \nGeneral Allyn said:\n\n       The current restrictions on the employment of OCO will not \n     allow it to be a gap-filler that is currently being proffered \n     to offset the reduction in our base budget that is driven by \n     the current proposals that are before Congress. In order to \n     meet the needs of our Army, it must have greater flexibility \n     . . . it must be less restrictive and must enable us to \n     sustain and modernize as we go forward.\n\n  This instability undermines the morale of our troops and their \nfamilies, who want to know their futures are planned for more than 1 \nyear at a time, and the confidence of the defense industry partners \nthat we want to rely on to provide the best technologies available to \nour troops.\n  Abuse of OCO in this massive way risks undermining support for a \ncritical mechanism used to fund the incremental increased costs of \noverseas conflicts. We have to have a disciplined system for estimating \nthe cost and funding the employment of a trained and ready force.\n  The administration has indicated that legislation implementing the \nmajority's budget framework will be subject to veto. As Secretary \nCarter has said, this approach is ``clearly a road to nowhere. I say \nthis because President Obama has already made clear that he won't \naccept a budget that locks in sequestration going forward, as this \napproach does, and he won't accept a budget that severs the vital link \nbetween our national security and our economic security.''\n  When we talk about national security, true national security requires \nthat non-DOD departments and agencies also receive relief from BCA \ncaps. The Pentagon simply cannot meet the complex set of national \nsecurity challenges without the help of other government departments \nand agencies, including State, Justice and Homeland Security. In the \nArmed Services Committee, we have heard testimony on the essential role \nof other government agencies in ensuring that our national defense \nremains strong. The Defense Department's share of the burden would \nsurely grow if these agencies are not adequately funded as well.\n  There is a symbiotic relationship between the Department of Defense \nand other civilian departments and agencies that contribute to our \nnational security. It has to be recognized that a truly whole-of-\ngovernment approach requires more than just a strong DOD.\n  The BCA caps are based on a misnomer--that discretionary spending is \ndivided into security and nonsecurity spending. But Members need to be \nclear: Essential national security functions are performed by \ngovernment agencies and departments other than the Defense Department.\n  According to the Commander of the U.S. Southern Command, General \nKelly:\n\n       We do not and cannot do this mission alone. Our strong \n     partnerships with the U.S. interagency--especially with the \n     Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Coast Guard, the \n     Drug Enforcement Administration, the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation, and the Departments of Treasury and State--are \n     integral to our efforts to ensure the forward defense of the \n     U.S. homeland.\n\n  Retired Marine Corps General Mattis said: ``If you don't fund the \nState Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition.'' General \nMattis' point is perhaps best illustrated in the administration's nine \nlines of effort to counter the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and the \nLevant, or ISIL, which 83 percent of Americans think is the No. 1 \nthreat to the United States. Of the administration's nine lines of \neffort, only two--which are security and intelligence--fall squarely \nwithin the responsibilities of the Department of Defense and \nintelligence community. The remaining seven elements of our counter-\nISIL strategy rely heavily on civilian departments and agencies.\n  For example, No. 1 is supporting effective governance in Iraq. No \namount of military assistance to the Government of Iraq will be \neffective in countering the ISIL threat in Iraq if the Abadi government \ndoes not govern in a more transparent and inclusive manner that gives \nSunnis hope that they will participate politically in Iraq's future. We \nneed our diplomatic and political experts in the State Department to \nengage with Shia, Sunni, Kurd, and minority communities in Iraq to \npromote and build reconciliation in Iraq and build the political unity \namong the Iraqi people needed to defeat ISIL. That is not strictly a \nDefense Department issue.\n  No. 2, we have to build partner capacity. The coalition is building \nthe capabilities and capacity of our foreign partners in the region to \nwage a long-term campaign against ISIL. While the efforts to build the \ncapacity of the Iraqi security forces and some other foreign partners \nare funded by the Defense Department, the State Department and USAID \nare also responsible for billions of dollars in similar activities and \nacross a broader spectrum of activities. Under the Republican plan, \nnone of the State and USAID programs will be plussed-up. Their \nunwillingness to address this gap is a threat to our Nation's efforts \nto combat ISIL.\n  No. 3, we have to disrupt ISIL's finances. ISIL's expansion has given \nit access to significant and diverse sources of funding. Countering \nISIL's financing will require the State Department and the Treasury \nDepartment to work with their foreign partners and the banking sector \nto ensure that our counter-ISIL sanctions regime is implemented and \nenforced. These State Department and Treasury Department efforts are \ndeemed to be nonsecurity activities under the BCA caps and, under the \nRepublican approach, our efforts to disrupt the finances of ISIL may be \nhampered. It is also notable that the Office of Foreign Assets Control \nand the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence in the Treasury \nDepartment are also characterized as nonsecurity activities under the \nBCA caps.\n  The Republican funding strategy not only means that our counter-ISIL \nefforts will be hampered, so too will our efforts to impose effective \nsanctions against Iran, Sudan, and individuals who support their \nillicit activities also be affected.\n  We have to continually expose the true and brutal nature of ISIL. Our \nstrategic communication plan against ISIL requires a truly whole \ngovernment effort, including the State Department, Voice of America, \nand USAID. The Republican approach to funding our strategic \ncommunication strategy is a part-of-government plan, not a whole-of-\ngovernment plan.\n  We have to disrupt the flow of foreign fighters. They are the \nlifeblood of ISIL. Yet key components of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity would be facing cuts under the Republican budget proposal, \nundermining efforts to disrupt the flow of foreign fighters to Syria \nand Iraq. Without the efforts of our diplomats prodding our foreign \npartners to pass laws or more effectively enforce the laws on their \nbooks, the efforts of the coalition to stem the flow of foreign \nfighters will never be successful.\n  My colleague Senator McCain pointed out the huge refugee crisis. \nAgain, our first agency typically to respond to refugees is USAID--the \nUnited States Agency for International Development--and other State \nDepartment agencies. We will not be able to effectively deal with that \nissue if those budget caps are imposed on USAID and other agencies. \nThose refugee camps are one of the breeding grounds for the foreign \nfighters who flow back into the conflict zone.\n  Unless we adopt a much broader approach, unless we do something other \nthan simply plus-up defense, we will not achieve true national \nsecurity. Of course we have to protect the homeland. While a small \nportion of the Department of Homeland Security is considered security \nrelated, under the BCA, the vast majority of the Department falls under \nthe nonsecurity BCA\n\n[[Page S3902]]\n\ncap. This further demonstrates that the Republican plan is a misnomer. \nIt is an effort to play a game of smoke and mirrors with the American \npublic. The agents at the Department of Homeland Security who are on \nguard, the DEA agents who pick up intelligence about threats to the \nNation--all of them vitally contribute to our national security, but \nthey will be treated distinctly different than our military if we adopt \nthe approach that is included in this Defense authorization bill.\n  I talked about the refugee crisis. Virtually none of the activities \nthat support our humanitarian efforts in the region are considered \nsecurity activities. Military commanders routinely tell us that the \nefforts of State, USAID, the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance are \ncritical to our broader security efforts. This is particularly true \nfrom a counter-ISIL campaign.\n  Again, those refugees who are flooding into the countries adjacent to \nSyria and to Iraq have to be dealt with not only on humanitarian \ngrounds but also as potential sources of foreign fighters. That is \ngoing to require a whole-of-government approach, not simply using OCO \nto beef up our defense spending. Taken together, the Republican plan \ncould compromise our broader campaign against ISIL and deprive \nsignificant elements of our government of the resources needed to do \nthe job to protect the American people.\n  The men and women of our military volunteer to protect this Nation \nand are overseas fighting for our ideals, including good education, \neconomic opportunity, and safe communities. Efforts to support all of \nthose goals will be hampered unless civilian departments and agencies \nalso receive relief from the BCA caps.\n  I had the privilege of commanding a paratrooper company at Fort \nBragg, NC. We fought for many reasons, including to give people a \nchance in this country--not just to protect them from a foreign threat \nbut to give them real opportunities here.\n  By the way, our servicemembers and their families rely on many of the \nservices provided by non-DOD departments and agencies. For example, the \nDepartment of Education administers Impact Aid to local school \ndistricts, where children of servicemembers go to learn. The Department \nof Agriculture supports the School Lunch Program, from which troops and \ntheir children and their families benefit. The National Institutes of \nHealth supports lifesaving medical research, including by contributing \nto advanced efforts on traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress, \nand suicide prevention. The Department of Health and Human Services \nruns Medicare, which provides health care for retirees and disabled \nindividuals, and Medicaid, which provides services to parents, \nincluding military parents with children with special needs.\n  Failing to provide BCA cap relief to non-DOD departments and agencies \nwould also shortchange veterans who receive employment services, \ntransition assistance, and housing and homelessness support.\n  Not only does this approach fail to support, potentially, our \nservicemen through schooling and through other aspects, our national \nsecurity is also inherently tied to our economic security. Secretary \nCarter made this very clear. He said the approach that is being \nproposed disregards ``the enduring, long-term connection between our \nnation's security and many other factors. Factors like scientific R \nto keep our technological edge, education of a future all-volunteer \nmilitary force, and the general economic strength of our country.''\n  Where will we get the soldiers of the future who have the skills and \nthe training and the expertise if we are underinvesting in the basic \neducation for all of our citizens?\n  My amendment would keep the pressure on for a permanent solution to \nthe BCA caps and sequestration by requiring that the BCA caps be \neliminated or increased in proportionally equal amounts for both \nsecurity and nonsecurity spending before the additional OCO funds are \navailable for obligation or expenditure.\n  Let me again emphasize that we are not taking away these funds. We \nsimply say what I think makes a great deal of sense: Until we develop \nan approach to BCA that allows us to provide for a comprehensive \ndefense of the Nation and to invest in the economic health of the \nNation, then these funds will be reserved. Once we do that, then \nautomatically all of the funding that is included in this bill will \nbecome available to the Department of Defense.\n  We have heard colleagues on both sides of the aisle talk for years \nnow about the need to resolve the BCA, to end sequestration. Every \nuniformed servicemember who came forward, every chief of service said \ntheir No. 1 priority was to end sequestration, end the BCA. This bill \ndoes not do it; it sidesteps the issue. We can no longer sidestep the \nissue. We have to engage on this issue. I think we have to move \npromptly and thoroughly and thoughtfully forward to resolve the BCA.\n  The legislation I have proposed recognizes the need for these \nresources but also recognizes the overarching issue: Unless we are able \nto effectively modify or eliminate the BCA, our comprehensive national \nsecurity will be threatened, our economic progress will be threatened, \nand our aspirations for the country could be thwarted.\n  My amendment seeks to implement, by the way, a sense-of-the Senate \nthat is already in the bill, and it clearly states that sequestration \nrelief should include equal defense and nondefense relief. We have \nmade--and I commend the chairman for this--a statement--without an \neffective means of implementation. It is a statement, an aspirational \ngoal, that we should fix BCA and relieve defense and nondefense \nspending. I think that is an important statement, but my amendment \nmakes sure we go further and provide an action to do this.\n  I believe very strongly in this amendment. I believe it is relevant \nto the consideration of this bill. I believe it goes to the heart of \nthe most important questions we face in the country today: How do we \nprovide for the comprehensive defense of the Nation? How do we invest \nin our people so that we will continue to be strong? I think if we do \nnot provide this type of mechanism to start this discussion on the BCA \nand hopefully promptly complete it, then we will be missing not only a \nhistoric opportunity, we will be locking ourselves into a road that \nwill leave us less secure in the future, less productive, and less \nstrong as a nation.\n  Let me remind people that the stated purpose of the bill is ``to \nauthorize appropriations for fiscal year 2016 for military activities \nof the Department of Defense.'' We have to begin this appropriations \nprocess by recognizing that the BCA will not help us going forward, and \nwe must move to modify or repeal it.\n  With that, I will close simply by saying again that if we continue \nthese caps going forward, it will harm our military readiness. Our \nnational defense should be based upon long-term needs. They should be \nreflected in a transparent, forthright budget that puts the money in \nthe base, provides contingency funds for true contingencies overseas \nbut does not turn things upside down and make our contingency funding \nreally the heart of the bill in so many respects.\n  We have to work together. We have to make sure every Federal agency \ncan benefit because every Federal agency contributes to the country. So \nI strongly urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment, to begin this \ndialogue, and to move forward, the sooner the better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, how does the budget fund defense? That is \nwhat we are talking about. The balanced budget resolution recently \napproved by Congress recognizes the responsibility that the Federal \nGovernment has to defend the Nation while recognizing the threats our \noverspending and growing debt pose to our national security. That is \nwhy the balanced budget approved by Congress last month makes national \ndefense a priority and provides for the maximum allowable defense \nfunding under current law.\n  Let me say that again. The budget provides for the maximum allowable \ndefense funding under current law. That current law is a law which was \nsigned by this President and provides vital support for our military \npersonnel and their families, the readiness of our Armed Forces, and \nthe modernization of critical platforms.\n  Does anybody deny that this is a critical time? With the increasing \nnumber\n\n[[Page S3903]]\n\nof threats around the world, our total defense spending level should \nreflect our commitment to keeping America safe and ensuring that our \nmilitary personnel are prepared to tackle all challenges. While we have \ntroops in harm's way, we need to do all we can to protect them. Given \nthe global threat environment, the funding approach taken by the \nSenator from Arizona and the Armed Services Committee, which was \nbipartisan, ensures that the men and women of our Armed Forces have the \nresources they need to confront an increasingly complex and dangerous \nsecurity environment.\n  Is sequestration a threat to our military? If appropriated at the \nlevels provided by the NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act, \nthe defense budget would not face indiscriminate, across-the-board cuts \nknown as sequestration, while it provides for the needs we are \nreviewing right now. People have a chance to amend the needs right now. \nIf they think there is something in there that is not needed, they can \namend it--they can try to amend it. There should be justification for \nwhat they want.\n  This bill puts us on a path to spend $612 billion on defense this \nyear. This is the same overall amount that was requested by the \nPresident earlier this year. Numerous officials at the Pentagon have \nmade it clear that they see this funding level as the bare minimum \nbudget needed to execute our defense strategy. So why are some Senators \nconcerned about the level of budgetary resources this bill provides to \nthe Department of Defense? They simply do not like the use of the \noverseas contingency operations funding, the OCO.\n  It is important to note that those not familiar with the Budget \nControl Act--that is not the budget; that is the Budget Control Act. It \nwas passed with bipartisan support and signed into law by President \nObama back in August of 2011. It established a discretionary spending \ncap, but it also allowed for certain cap adjustments. The BCA caps can \nbe adjusted for emergencies, disasters, program integrity initiatives, \nand OCO.\n  Yes. That is in the Budget Control Act, the Budget Control Act passed \nAugust 2011 and signed by President Obama. Those are the four ways you \ncan adjust the budget caps without forcing sequestration. Now, in the \ncase of OCO--overseas contingency operations--funding, both Congress \nand the President have to agree that the funding should be designated \nin that manner. Therefore, the OCO funding in this bill will only occur \nif Congress appropriates it and the President agrees to it in the \nfuture. I would hope that when the President and his advisers said this \nis the overall level of funding they needed for defense, they meant it. \nBut only time and the appropriations process will tell.\n  Did the budget account for OCO spending? While there is no \nrequirement to offset OCO spending, when we addressed the issue in our \nbudget resolution, we accounted for every single dollar of OCO we \nassumed would be spent. Even with these OCO levels, the budget \nresolution still met its overall goal of balancing within 10 years. Let \nme repeat that. We accounted for every single dollar of OCO that we \nassumed would be spent. Even with these OCO levels, the budget \nresolution still met its overall goal of balancing within 10 years.\n  It is good to see my colleague so concerned about the deficit, and I \nlook forward to working with him to fully implement our balanced \nbudget. This will ensure that we can get our Nation's fiscal house in \norder while providing resources needed for our national defense.\n  Unfortunately, the concern expressed over providing OCO funding \ndoesn't seem to be centered on the fiscal concerns because even most \ncritics support the need for more defense money. No, their concerns are \nbased on the demand to increase nondefense discretionary spending on a \ndollar-for-dollar basis with defense spending. But the only way to do \nthis in the short term is by raising taxes on hard-working American \nfamilies. Defense is making its case and has made its case. Nondefense \nhas not.\n  Do we really need to increase the caps? If we want to increase \nnondefense spending, Congress should take a closer look at what we are \nactually funding. Last year, we provided nearly $293.5 billion for more \nthan 260 authorizations that have expired. Yes, we have 260 \nauthorizations. That is where Congress says this is what we ought to be \nspending our money on.\n  They expired, and we are still spending money on them--$293.5 billion \na year. Usually, we talk about over 10 years here. That would \npractically balance the budget by itself over a 10-year period. Those \nare programs we need to take a look at. Those are programs that have \nexpired. Some of those programs expired as long ago as 1983, but we are \nstill spending money on them every year. That means we have been paying \nfor some of these expired programs for more than 30 years, and it is \nnot just the length of time these programs have overstayed their \nwelcome, the funds we allocated to them every year are more than what \nthe law called for in those authorizations when passed. In some cases, \nthat means we are spending as much as four times what the bill allowed.\n  Savings usually are found in the spending details, but Congress \nhasn't examined the details in some time, except on defense. We do the \nDefense authorization every year. These others, well, I mentioned one \nof them expired in 1983, some in 1987. I mentioned it is 260 \nauthorizations. It affects 1,200 programs. Do you think in 1,200 \nprograms for $293 billion a year we couldn't find $38 billion to match \nwhat we are doing in defense? We ought to be ashamed if we can't.\n  It is time for Congress to take a look at these programs and decide \nif they are even worth funding anymore. After all, a project not worth \ndoing well should not be worth doing at that time all. But how would \ncommittees know if they haven't looked at these programs in years? How \nwould they know if they don't have a way to measure how well the \nprograms are working?\n  Were defense and nondefense spending treated equally under the BCA \nunder the budget caps? The insistence that any change to the \ndiscretionary changes be based on dollar limits for both categories of \nspending fails to take into account the different treatment each took \nunder the budget caps, the BCA.\n  Defense spending, which makes up less than one-fifth of all \ngovernment spending, received less than half of the reductions in the \nBCA. Defense spending also faced more budgetary pressure than \nnondefense spending because it is largely discretionary. Nondefense \nspending was able to distribute its BCA reductions over a larger amount \nof accounts and over a larger portion of mandatory programs. That \nprovides a fudge factor.\n  The continued insistence on tying both defense and nondefense \nspending together has left only the approach taken by this bill to fund \nthe defense at the President's level.\n  We know from the administration that the President's advisers are \nrecommending he veto this bill. We also know some of my colleagues are \nconsidering blocking appropriations bills this year to force a \ngovernment shutdown.\n  Every bill should stand on its own for justification. No one is \narguing the need for national defense. What they are actually arguing \nis the need for the nondefense increases. This is an attempt to \nleverage defense programming to get nondefense, which I mentioned the \n260 programs, $293.5 billion a year that has expired--so they want this \nOCO to be replaced with a deal.\n  What we are supposed to do in Congress is legislate, not deal make. \nBut that is what is being proposed. Let's make a deal. Now, if they \nstep back and look at the facts laid out today, hopefully, they can \nmove away from this brinkmanship and realize the path they are on only \nleads to more uncertainty for the men and women in our Armed Forces. \nStrengthening our national defense and providing for the brave men and \nwomen of our military should be something both sides agree on.\n  So what is the future of the BCA caps? It is time both parties get \nserious about addressing our Nation's chronic overspending. We know \nsome on both sides want the caps from the Budget Control Act changed--\nbut at what price for our Nation and the hard-working taxpayers? \nWithout any changes to the BCA structure, just raising these budget \ncaps without increasing the debt in the short-term\n\n[[Page S3904]]\n\nwould require increasing taxes. That is why we asked for the extra year \nto be able to work on this whole thing.\n  If Congress is serious about addressing the challenges of the Budget \nControl Act, it has to first start by tackling its addiction to \noverspending and once again become good fiscal stewards of the taxes \npaid by each and every hard-working American.\n  Of course, if the administration would stop overregulating, the \neconomy would grow, and in a short time we would have more revenue \nwithout raising taxes. Yes, that is what both the Congressional Budget \nOffice and the Office of Management and Budget--one works for Congress \nand one works for the President--said; that if we could just raise the \neconomy by 1 percent a year, CBO says that would provide $300 billion. \nThe President's office says that would provide $400 billion in taxes.\n  We are receiving more tax revenue right now than we have in the \nhistory of the United States, but we spend more than that. Of the \namounts that we get to make a decision on, we are spending almost 50 \npercent more than what we take in. We can't continue to do that. We \ncan't continue to afford the interest on the debt if we keep doing \nthat.\n  Americans are working harder than everyone to make ends meet. \nShouldn't their elected officials be doing the same thing? By tackling \nthese issues honestly and directly, we can help ensure that our Nation \nis safe and secure by investing in America's Armed Forces while also \nmaintaining fiscal discipline.\n  On a related note, the Senate Budget Committee has produced an \nindepth analysis of defense spending and the OCO funding provision as \npart of our June budget bulletin, which was published today. People \ninterested in learning more can do so by going to our Web site: \nbudget.senate.gov or contact on twitter@budgetbulletin.\n  I close with some words from today's paper from the Casper Star-\nTribune editorial:\n\n       Many of the servicemen and servicewomen returning from \n     faraway battlefields--Vietnam or any other place of \n     conflict--have seen horrible, unspeakable things. They've \n     been courageous in the face of death and destruction. Some \n     gave up a relatively easy, safe life to travel far from home \n     and fight for what we as a nation believe the world should \n     be, or could be, someday. That kind of commitment doesn't \n     come without pain or sacrifice--immense pain and sacrifice, \n     in some cases.\n       None of that has anything to do with politics. Politics is \n     the arena of our elected leaders, not our troops, and it's \n     both necessary and patriotic for us as voters to evaluate \n     those leaders' decisions and actions and speak out against \n     the ones we disagree with. That's democracy and dissent.\n       But our troops are our representatives on the ground. We \n     must not use our vaunted system of democracy as a tool to \n     inflict pain on this brave group of people. They're not \n     obligated to support our leaders' political ideologies any \n     more than the rest of us, but uniquely, they have made it \n     their responsibility to represent our treasured way of life \n     at home and abroad in pursuit of a better, more peaceful \n     world. And after they do that, they deserve the thanks of a \n     grateful nation.\n       That's how it should have been in the 1970s. That's how it \n     is now. We must make it our responsibility to ensure that \n     this is how it will always be.\n\n  We have a crucial decision to make on funding our national defense. I \ndon't think it should be held hostage to other budget concerns. Each of \nthose should stand on their own. Each of those should review all of the \nthings under their jurisdiction. I ask for you to defeat the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. First, I thank my friend from Wyoming for his remarks. I \ndon't always agree with him, but he is sincere, thoughtful, and puts \nevery effort into coming up with a decision he believes is right, so we \nappreciate that very much.\n  I also thank my colleague from Rhode Island, our ranking member on \nArmed Services, who has laid out in very careful terms why the \namendment, the Reed amendment, is so important. I thank him. He has \nalso, like my friend from Wyoming, been assiduous, diligent, and \ncareful in his work on the Armed Services Committee, and I thank him \nfor offering this amendment.\n  We have come to the floor with a very simple message for our \nRepublican colleagues, and it is articulated in this amendment. If you \nwant to make America strong by replacing the harsh and arbitrary \nautomatic cuts in this budget as we do, then you have to do it in a way \nthat makes sure we will have a strong military abroad and the things we \nneed to be strong and secure at home as well.\n  That means equally replacing cuts to both defense and domestic \nbudgets--$1 for defense, $1 for the middle class--in the hopes that \nthey can raise their income levels, and it can be easier for others who \nare not yet in the middle class to reach. That is what the amendment \nwould require.\n  The truth is, the way the Republicans have put this bill together \nsignals a poor approach to both major areas of our budget. It locks in \nthe sequester cuts for our men and women in uniform, instead using the \nOCO, essentially a wartime account, as a one-time gimmick to make up \nfor shortfalls. That is a bad idea.\n  Using the OCO account to pay for our troops, maintain and operate our \nmilitary or purchase weapons that will keep us safe is a terrible \nmistake. Why is that? It is 1-year funding. You have to do a plan for 3 \nyears. You have to build a submarine that takes 4 or 5 years.\n  I talk to defense contractors. I talk to military leaders. They can't \ndo it 1 year at a time. It doesn't make sense. Our military families \nneed stability and support. They need to know that programs that \nbenefit them--suicide prevention, sexual assault--will be fully funded \nwhen other defense priorities come back into the base budget for future \nyears. Under OCO, these things could get squeezed out. Our military \nbrass needs to know that the weapons systems they are relying on 4 \nyears from now--but being paid out of OCO this year--can be funded and \nfinished. So our military doesn't deserve budget gimmicks, they deserve \nreal support.\n  What my friends on the other side of the aisle have done with this \nOCO increase is a budgetary sleight of hand--a half-hearted attempt to \nfund the Defense Department while leaving key, middle-class programs \nbehind. Our Defense Department gets budget work-arounds and exceptions, \nwhile hard-working families must continue to feel the harsh cuts \nimposed by sequestration. That is a double standard because we need \nboth for a strong America. We need a strong military, and we need a \nstrong middle class. To choose one over the other--and do it by \nbudgetary sleight of hand--is nothing anyone can be proud of, in my \nopinion.\n  So regardless of what happens with NDAA this month, one thing should \nbe absolutely clear to my Republican friends--and I see our ranking \nmember of Appropriations who has led this fight on the floor. Democrats \nwill not vote to put a defense appropriations bill on the floor that \nuses accounting trickery or budgetary gimmicks to fund our troops. We \nwill not vote to proceed to the Defense appropriations bill or any \nappropriations bill until our colleagues from the other side of the \naisle have sat down at the table and figured out with us how we are \ngoing to properly fund the Defense Department and the key priorities \nthat help families, fuel economic growth--in short, keeping us safe and \nstrong both at home and abroad.\n\n  We simply cannot and will not move forward with one acceptable bill \nat a time on the appropriations side until we are able to sit down and \nreach an agreement that replaces cuts equally for our military and our \ndomestic needs.\n  This amendment requires that balance. That is why I salute the \nSenator from Rhode Island, my dear friend, the ranking member of the \nCommittee on Armed Services for putting it together. It says that the \nextra money in OCO cannot be used unless we give equal or greater \nrelief to domestic programs that help the middle class.\n  If my friends on the other side of the aisle are serious about \nescaping the senseless, obtuse budget cuts imposed by the sequester and \ntheir use of OCO, admittedly a gimmick--they are admitting that is the \ncase, that we have to do more and go above sequestration for military \nand average families--they will wholeheartedly support the Jack Reed \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n[[Page S3905]]\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed. Characteristic of \nhim, it is a thoughtful solution to a very serious problem related to \nthe funding of our national security needs.\n  I would like to support and salute Senator Reed for his outstanding \njob. Many don't realize that Senator Jack Reed is a graduate of West \nPoint. He served in the U.S. military, bringing that breadth of his \nconsiderable background to additional public service, both in the House \nand now in the Senate. He is the ranking member on the defense \nauthorization committee and also serves in great capacity on the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  Now, let us talk about the Reed amendment and the funding for the \nDepartment of Defense. I want to be very clear. I do want to support \nfunding for the national security of the United States of America. We \ntake an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and \ndomestic, and we must uphold that oath not only with lip service but \nwith real money in the real Federal checkbook. We need to do it in a \nway that doesn't use gimmicks or smoke and mirrors to end sequester or \nto finesse or do a shell deal behind the budget caps.\n  Remember, we passed a bill that does have significant budget caps. \nBut the way to deal with that problem is not to cap the Department of \nDefense but to be honest about what it takes to fund national security. \nThe Reed amendment does that. It makes clear that the Department of \nDefense should receive $38 billion, but in its base budget to take care \nof the troops, to protect the troops while they protect us, to make \nsure they have the right gear, the right equipment, the right \ntechnology, and also the right intelligence to be able to do their job. \nThe Reed amendment also looks out for military families. It does what \nwe need to do.\n  Only when there is a new budget agreement that increases the defense \nbudget as well as the budget for domestic programs will we be able to \nsolve the problem that is facing us.\n  Now, what our generals have told us is we cannot meet our defense \nneeds with the current budget caps. They also say: Senator--this is \nGeneral Dempsey, and this is General Odierno, who spoke so well at the \nfuneral of the Vice President's son on Saturday; these men have devoted \ntheir lives to the defense of our country and to have the best military \nin the world--don't give us sequester. Instead of figuring out how to \nfight terrorism, we have to figure out how to fight the stupidity of \nCongress.\n  Now, they do not use those words; I am using those words. When we \ninstituted sequester, it was a technique to force us to make the tough \ndecisions. We keep hiding behind the technique. We need to change that. \nThe bill we have now raises funding for something called the overseas \ncontingency fund by $38 billion, but it uses it to fund activities that \nshould be in the base bill rather than the war cost it was intended \nfor. Essentially, it is a budget gimmick.\n  What is the overseas contingency fund? It was meant to be a line item \nwhere we could actually see what war costs us. In Afghanistan and Iraq \nit was kind of commingled through a lot of the other items related to \ndefense, but we didn't know the actual cost of the war. OCO is meant \nfor war. It is not meant to be a way to avoid the budget caps. Instead \nof just raising the caps and funding DOD at the needed level, this bill \nuses this gimmick, so nothing about it is really in the national \ninterest.\n  Our military leaders tell us: No. 1, get rid of sequester. No. 2, you \nmust increase the base bill.\n  Defense budgeting cannot be done on a year-to-year basis. It must be \nmultiyear because it is for the planning of procurement for them to \nhave the best weapons systems. It is recruitment and training and \nsustaining of the military and their personnel needs.\n  Defense Secretary Ash Carter said: ``Our defense industry partners, \ntoo, need stability and longer-term plans, not end-of-year crises.'' \nGEN Dan Allyn, Army Vice Chief of Staff, said: ``OCO does not give you \nthe predictable funding to be able to plan the force we are going to \nneed.''\n  I want to make another point. The defense of the United States \ndoesn't lie only with DOD. That is our warfighting machine. But we have \nother programs that are related to national security that come out of \ndomestic discretionary spending that are shortchanged and are shrinking \nand, quite frankly, I am concerned about it.\n  What am I talking about? In order to have national security, you need \nto have a State Department. You need to have a State Department to do \nthe kind of work that involves diplomacy. That involves working with \nnations around the world and the needs of these nations and also to \nengage in important negotiations such as we have now ongoing on the \nIran nuclear. That is not done by generals. That is done by diplomats. \nYou need to have a Department of State. Look at what happened in \nBenghazi, where there is so much focus on this. While they are \nfocusing--and we should focus--on Benghazi, we appropriators are \nfocusing on embassy security. Embassy security is funded through the \nDepartment of State and funded by discretionary spending. If you want \nto protect Americans overseas, you have to have embassy security. You \nhave to have a Department of State.\n  Then we have the Department of Homeland Security. Look at all the \ncyber attacks on us right at this minute. We need to have a cyber \ncomponent to defense, but we need to have the cyber defense strategy at \nthe Department of Homeland Security. Even our military is being hacked. \nInsurance programs are being hacked. People in the United States are \nhaving important information about their health records, their Social \nSecurity numbers, and so on being stolen. We need to have a robust \nDepartment of Homeland Security. They have a program called Einstein \nthat is supposed to do it, but we don't have to be Einsteins to know \nthat in order to protect America we also have to protect the Department \nof Homeland Security.\n  Then of course there are the promises made and promises kept. There \nis the Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and \nRelated Agencies. We must fund our promises made to our veterans. That \nis out of discretionary spending. That is not out of defense. But the \ninfrastructure for our military, our military bases here in our own \ncountry, come out of military construction.\n  I don't want to sound as if I am defending government programs. That \nis not what I am here to do. I am here to defend the Nation and defend \nit the right way. We need to be able to put money in the Federal \ncheckbook that funds our Department of Defense without gimmicks, \nwithout sleight of hand, without finessing or playing dodge ball. We \nhave to play hard ball with the terrorists and others who have \npredatory intent against the United States.\n  We have to be Team U.S.A. not only on the sports field but on this \nplaying field right here on the floor of Congress. Let us work \ntogether. Let us get a new budget agreement. Let us solve the problems. \nLet us end sequester. Let us work together to be able to do it. I \nbelieve a big step forward would be supporting the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed. I ask, in the interest of \nnational security, that we vote for the Reed amendment and that we go \nto the budget. Let's go to the negotiating table and come up with a \nreal framework to fund the compelling needs of our Nation, and let's do \nit, Team U.S.A.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/09/senate-section/article/S3905-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority whip.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1486\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this Chamber is currently having a very \nimportant debate about our national security priorities, including the \nauthorized funding levels for our Nation's Armed Forces. But I would \nlike to\n\n[[Page S3906]]\n\nspeak just briefly about an element of our national security that is \noften overlooked, and that has to do with the interconnection between \nour energy resources here in America and global security.\n  I will start by quoting the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nGEN Martin Dempsey, who said: ``I think we've got to pay more and \nparticular attention to energy as an instrument of national power.''\n  Well, I could not agree, in this instance, with General Dempsey more. \nSo I want to again address a way in which I believe the United States \ncan utilize our vast domestic energy resources to not only enhance our \neconomy but also help enhance our national security and help us meet \nour strategic objectives around the world and specifically by helping \nmany of our NATO allies in Europe in this process.\n  As I mentioned on the floor last week, many of these countries rely \nheavily on energy resources from Russia, creating strategic \nvulnerability for them as well as for the United States, their treaty \nally. This is not a hypothetical matter because we know Vladimir Putin \nhas literally turned the spigot off to countries like Ukraine and \nthreatens to do so to Europe if they happen to disagree with Russian \npolicy, particularly with regard to its expropriation of Crimea and \nUkraine.\n  But the United States can use its energy resources to reassure our \nallies and partners and to lessen, reduce, at the same time, their \ndependence on bad actors like Russia and Iran. So it is as simple as \nhelping our friends and checking the abuse of power by our adversaries.\n  Now, while allowing energy exports to some of our allies when their \nsecurity is threatened probably sounds like a commonsense notion to a \nlot of people, there are some skeptics. One of our colleagues, the \njunior Senator from Massachusetts, has suggested that approving crude \noil exports to anybody--including on a limited basis to our allies who \nare being coerced and under duress from Vladimir Putin--that somehow \nthat would result in a tax on consumers at the pump. In other words, he \nis arguing that exporting our natural resources around the world would \nactually cause gasoline prices to go up.\n  Well, I am here to say that is a faulty assumption and it is simply \nnot grounded in fact. It is at odds with the research and leading \nopinions of multiple experts, think tank organizations, and officials. \nAnd you know what. It is even at odds with the Obama administration's \nleading expert in this field. Here is what Secretary Moniz said on \nFebruary 12, 2015, about the effect of crude oil exports on U.S. gas \nprices. He said there would be no effect on gas prices. He said: ``And \ntheir [EIA's] conclusion was, probably none to possibly minor decreases \nin domestic prices.''\n  So if you think about it, actually more American supply increases the \nworld's supply of oil. Indeed, gasoline is already sold around the \nworld at a global price. So more supply of oil, which is the chief \ncomponent of gasoline, would actually increase the supply. Even \naccording to a recovering lawyer who is not an economist, on a supply-\nand-demand basis, with static demand increasing, the supply is actually \ngoing to bring down the price.\n  The Energy Secretary is not the only one who believes there will \neither be no change or actually a downward price to consumers on \ngasoline.\n  After reviewing several studies on this issue, the Government \nAccountability Office noted that ``consumer fuel prices, such as \ngasoline, diesel, and jet fuel, could decrease as a result of removing \ncrude oil export restrictions.'' So this is the Government \nAccountability Office that said that, actually confirming, essentially, \nwhat Secretary Moniz said; that we would actually see gasoline prices \ngo down at the pump were we to lift this domestic sanction we have \nimposed upon ourselves when it comes to exporting crude.\n  Another think tank, the Aspen Institute, said it would have \n``significant positive and durable effects on [our gross domestic \nproduct], aggregate employment and income.''\n  The Aspen Institute, just as another example, thinks it would be good \nfor income, it would be good for jobs, it would be good for our \neconomy.\n  So it seems the only people who do not think lifting the ban would be \ngood are limited to the Halls of Congress or perhaps some of the \nlobbyists who raise money scaring people when it comes to the use of \nour fossil fuels, particularly oil and gas.\n  While I think it is important to come and rebut this faulty argument, \nthe amendment that is pending to the underlying bill is actually much \nmore narrowly targeted. It simply ensures that we will have a reliable \nsense of the energy vulnerabilities of our European partners. In fact, \nwe are a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and under \narticle 5, were they to be attacked, all members of the treaty would be \nrequired to come to their assistance. So why in the world would we not \nwant to reduce their vulnerability to economic hostage-taking?\n  We also want to get a better understanding of Russia's ability to use \nthis dependency against our allies in NATO and Europe in general. So my \namendment would allow us to see the big picture when it comes to just \nhow dependent our allies in the region are on nations that wield their \nenergy supply as a weapon.\n  Now, I just want to make clear my amendment would actually not change \nany of the current law. It would not change any of the current law. It \nsimply restates the current authority that the President has in his \ndiscretion to allow crude oil and natural gas exports, if determined to \nbe consistent with the national interest.\n\n  I would say, even though Russia and Europe and NATO are the primary \nfocus, this is not just limited to NATO. It could include important \nallies of ours in the Middle East, like Israel, as well. My amendment \nreiterates this existing authority, and it encourages the President to \nuse it to help reduce the vulnerabilities of our allies in Europe and \naround the world when it is determined to be in our national interest. \nIt does not add to that authority, and it does not constrain it either.\n  Well, the President just returned from the so-called G7 summit--\nrepresenting the leading seven economies of the free world--and here is \nwhat the G7 said about this topic. The G7 leaders said that ``we \nreaffirm our support for Ukraine and other vulnerable countries . . . \nand reiterate that energy should not be used as a means of political \ncoercion or as a threat to security.''\n  So if that is the position of the G7, if the Obama administration \ntakes the position that lifting the ban on exports of oil will not do \nanything to raise the price of gasoline at the pump and could well \nreduce it, then I think the Senate would be well advised to support the \namendment I have offered which, again, just restates the current \nauthority, does not expand it, and then asks the Defense Department and \nthe intelligence community to do an assessment of how we can better \nunderstand the role our energy assets play as an element of our soft \npower and national security.\n  Our allies are pretty clear-eyed about all this. They recognize that \nshrinking their dependence will not be complete or easy. But one goal \nthis amendment seeks to recognize is that we have allies that are \nasking for help that will put them on a path toward less reliance and \nwill put Russia on notice that they will not be able to hold these \ncountries hostage to energy.\n  This is about options, alternatives, and a stable supply on the world \nmarket that are all helped by increased U.S. production and this \nrenaissance in natural gas and oil that has been brought about thanks \nto the great innovation and technology improvements in the private \nsector, created here in the United States but benefiting the entire \nworld.\n  The G7 leaders noted that the diversification of the world's energy \nsupply is ``a core element of energy security,'' including a diversity \nof ``energy mix[es], energy fuels, sources, and routes.''\n  So my amendment is based on the idea that we may supplement the \nglobal market, and that ultimately brings about increased diversity in \nfuel supply, which benefits everyone.\n  My amendment is not about limiting the President's authority under \ncurrent law. I did not intend to do that. This amendment does not do \nit. It is about taking a modest first step toward addressing the \nrequests, the pleas, in some cases, of our allies and our partners in \nan increasingly unpredictable world.\n\n[[Page S3907]]\n\n  So I would encourage our colleagues to support this amendment and, in \ndoing so, take the long-term view of our national security interests as \nwell as the peace and stability of our most trusted allies and \npartners.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. President, if I may withhold that request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time in the quorum call be equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REED. Will the Senator repeat his request?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will be glad to restate it. I am asking unanimous \nconsent that the time in the quorum call be equally divided between the \nsides.\n  Mr. REED. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is currently considering H.R. 1735.\n  Approximately 22 minutes remain on the majority side.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Twenty-two minutes on the majority side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, and 11 minutes on the minority side.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that such time as the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island may need to conclude the debate be in order and I \nhave 10 minutes in order before the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we have Senator Stabenow and Senator Durbin \ncoming, and I believe we have heard that Senator Grassley is also \ncoming, and with the Senator's 10 minutes, I think that will fill up \nthe time until the vote at 3 o'clock.\n  Mr. McCAIN. We have Senator Sessions as well.\n  Well, let me suggest the absence of a quorum first, and then we will \nwork it out.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1521\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I am here on the floor to speak to the \namendment we will be voting on as it relates to Senator Reed's \namendment.\n  I first thank both of the leaders of this committee for important \nwork that is being done. But the amendment in front of us is absolutely \ncritical for the safety and security of the American people and \ncertainly for our troops. We all agree--we need to agree--that our \ntroops deserve more than budget gimmicks. What we have in here are too \nmany budget gimmicks that do not reflect the commitment we need to have \nto our troops and their families.\n  Further, it does not allow us to fully fund the security needs of the \ncountry. We are going to be having a very important debate after this \nlegislation on what to do around appropriations, and it is critical \nthat Senator Reed's amendment be passed so we have the opportunity to \nfully fund the full range of security needs of our country--not only in \nthe Department of Defense, which we all know is very important, but our \nborder security, cyber security, counterterrorism, police and \nfirefighter efforts--those on the frontlines. Whom do we think is \ncalled when we dial 911, when there is an emergency of any kind. It is \npolice officers and firefighters that, unfortunately, without the Reed \namendment, will not receive the kind of support and funding needed to \nkeep our communities safe.\n  We need to stop weapons of mass destruction, focus on airport \nsecurity. We are on and off airplanes every single week, as are \nmillions of Americans. We know how critical it is that we be funding \nour airport security. We know there are outbreaks, like Ebola and other \ninfectious diseases and attacks that may come from that, that are not \nin the bill in front of us but are critical to the funding of the \nnational security interests of our families, our communities, and our \ncountry.\n  Senator Reed has put forward an amendment that would guarantee we \nwould not only think of security in the context of the Department of \nDefense but that we would understand it is throughout the Federal \nGovernment--all of the various services and folks coming together from \nborder security, cyber security, counterterrorism, local police and \nfirefighters on the frontline, the ability to stop weapons of mass \ndestruction, airport security, Ebola protection with the Centers for \nDisease Control and Protection, and so much more. The people of the \ncountry understand it is not just about the Department of Defense.\n  Certainly, we need to make sure that even within the Department of \nDefense budget, we are doing more than budget gimmicks. Certainly, our \ntroops deserve that. But without the amendment that Senator Reed has so \nthoughtfully put forward and designed, we will be undercutting critical \nparts of national security for our people.\n  So I strongly urge that we come together on a bipartisan basis. We \ntalk a lot about border security. We hear a lot about that here. We \ncertainly understand what is happening in cyber security and the needs \nof our country. We could go through all of the other parts of the \nFederal budget that impact security and realize that if we aren't \nwilling to look at security for our families and communities and our \ncountry as a whole, as Senator Reed does, we will be undercutting the \nsafety and security we all want for our families and communities.\n  So I strongly support and urge colleagues to come together and vote \nfor the Reed amendment.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nSenators be permitted to speak before the vote: Senator Durbin for 8 \nminutes, Senator Sessions for 8 minutes, Senator McCain for 7 minutes, \nand Senator Reed for 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                  For-Profit Colleges and Universities\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we have an industry in America called for-\nprofit colleges and universities. It is a unique part of America's \nprivate sector--and I use the phrase ``private sector'' with some \ncaution. These are profitable entities which portray themselves as \ncolleges and universities. We know their names: the University of \nPhoenix, DeVry University, Kaplan University, and--until very \nrecently--Corinthian, one of the largest for-profit schools. What do \nthey do? They entice young people to sign up at their for-profit \ncolleges and universities and promise them they are going to give them \ntraining or education to find a job.\n  Now, it turns out that as alluring as that is, it doesn't tell the \nwhole story. The real story about the for-profit college industry can \nbe told with three numbers:\n  Ten. Ten percent of all high school graduates go to these for-profit \ncolleges and universities.\n  Twenty. Twenty percent of all the Federal aid to education goes to \nthese for-profit colleges and universities. About $35 billion a year \nflows into these schools. If it were a separate Federal agency, it \nwould be the ninth largest Federal agency in Washington, DC--$35 \nbillion.\n  But the key number we should remember is 44. Forty-four percent of \nall\n\n[[Page S3908]]\n\nthe student loan defaults in America are students at for-profit \ncolleges and universities.\n  How can that be--10 percent of the students and 44 percent of the \nloan defaults.\n  First, they overcharge their students; secondly, when the students \nget deeply in debt, many of them drop out; and, third, those who end up \ngraduating find out many times the diploma is worthless. That is what \nhas happened.\n  Back in December of 2013, I wrote to the Department of Education \nasking them to investigate Corinthian Colleges. There was an article in \nthe Huffington Post that drew my attention to it, as well as the \nactions by the California attorney general, Kamala Harris. It turned \nout that Corinthian was lying. It was lying to the students about \nwhether they would ever end up getting a job, and it was lying to the \nFederal Government about their performance and how well they were \ndoing. They were caught in their lie. As a consequence, the Department \nof Education started threatening Corinthian Colleges for defrauding \ntaxpayers and the government in their official reports. Things went \nfrom bad to worse. Corinthian Colleges declared bankruptcy.\n  What happens when one of these for-profit colleges and universities \ndeclares bankruptcy? Well, the students many times are left high and \ndry. They have nothing, no school to go to. Oh, wait a minute. They \ndon't have ``nothing.'' They have something. They have debt--a debt \nthat they carry away from these failed schools.\n  Well, we have a provision in the law which says if your school goes \nbankrupt, you might be able to walk away from your student debt.\n  The Department of Education made an announcement yesterday, which I \nsupport, that says that they are going to work with these students who \nhave been defrauded by Corinthian Colleges and misled into believing \nthis college was worth their time and money. Some of these students \nwill get a chance to be relieved from their college debt.\n  It is a good thing because student loan debt is not like a lot of \nother debts. It is not like the money you borrowed for a car. It is not \nlike the money you borrowed for a home. Student loan debts are not \ndischarged in bankruptcy. You have them for a lifetime. If you make a \nbad decision when you are 19 years old and sign up for $18,000 a year \nat Corinthian Colleges or at ITT Tech, you have it until you pay it \noff. We find that many of these schools garnish Social Security checks. \nThey will stay with you for a lifetime. So now the Department of \nEducation is working on this, trying to do the right thing by these \nCorinthian students.\n  I have been in touch with Arne Duncan, Secretary of Education, whom I \nrespect. I told him this is, unfortunately, an early indication of an \nindustry that is on hard times. The stock prices of these for-profit \nschools are in deep trouble across the board. People are finally \nrealizing there is too much fraudulent activity going on at these \ninstitutions.\n  Who are the losers? It is not just the students with debts from these \nworthless schools but taxpayers. We are the ones who send these \nbillions of dollars to these so-called private companies that have \ntheir CEOs take home millions of dollars while the kids are getting \nlittle or no education. They are the losers.\n  What should we do about it? I think we ought to be a lot tougher when \nit comes to the for-profit colleges and universities--holding them \naccountable for what they are doing to these young people and their \nfamilies, holding them accountable for what they have done to \ntaxpayers.\n  Do you know how much money we sent to Corinthian after it became \nclear they were lying to us? It was $1 billion dollars--$1 billion \ndollars, Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer. There are schools like that, \nunfortunately, across this country.\n  The last point I will make on this is that, speaking to the Secretary \nof Education and others, the real losers many times are also veterans--\nveterans. The GI bill was offered to veterans after they served our \ncountry for a chance to get an education, training, and to make a life. \nThey used it, sadly, at worthless for-profit colleges and universities, \nand they have used up a once-in-a-lifetime chance to build a future. \nThey are left high and dry, not with a student-loan debt but with an \nempty promise that this education is going to lead to something.\n  I am going to continue to work with my colleagues, including Senator \nBlumenthal of Connecticut, to change that and to protect our veterans. \nBut I am also going to continue to work on these for-profit colleges \nand universities. America can do better. These schools with 10 percent \nof the students, 20 percent of the Federal aid to education, and 44 \npercent of the student loan defaults have to be held accountable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask that I be notified after 7 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I start by saying Commander Pilcher is a \nfabulous naval officer. He is doing great work in our office as we deal \nwith the defense issues in this country, and he has been of real \nassistance to us. I have to say that I am proud of him. He reflects \nwell on the Navy and the people who defend this country every day.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1521\n\n  Mr. President, what is happening now is unfortunate. On the Defense \nbill that came out of the Armed Services Committee, of which I am a \nmember, that ranking member Senator Reed and Senator McCain worked on, \nwe have had virtually no significant disagreements except this one. \nWhat our Democratic colleagues are insisting upon, driven by the \nPresident and political interests, is that defense gets no increase in \nfunding unless nondefense gets an increase in funding over the budget \ncap established by the Budget Control Act.\n  In 2011, we passed the Budget Control Act. A part of that was the \nsequester, and it was not something that was never intended to occur, \nas some of my colleagues have claimed. It was in the law. They always \nsay: Well, we never intended this to occur. Not so--we passed it into \nlaw. It said there would be a commission and the commission could look \nat entitlements and other things with the hope that we would come up \nwith some way to save more money and put us on a sound financial path.\n  They said if they did not come up with that agreement, then what we \nput in the law would take effect as limits on defense and nondefense \ndiscretionary spending.\n  Under the Budget Control Act, next year will be the last year it \nholds those limits. It will be basically flat spending again this year, \nbut it will increase thereafter at 2.5 percent a year. We are not \ndestroying nondefense discretionary spending.\n  Remember, this legislation was passed in 2011. That is the year \nPresident Obama said: Iraq is settled; we are going to pull all the \ntroops out. Senator McCain pleaded with him not to do that. He said we \ncould have danger in the future. He warned that if we did that, chaos \ncould occur. But no, the President, to comply with his campaign \npromise, said we were pulling them all out.\n  Unfortunately, Senator McCain was correct. We have ISIS. Iraq is in \nturmoil. The Syrian turmoil has gotten worse. Since 2011, Russia \ninvaded Crimea. Yemen is in trouble. Iran is hardening its position \nwith regard to nuclear weapons. Libya is experiencing serious problems.\n  All of this, I suggest, was the result of an unwise, unclear, and \nweak foreign policy. Every one of those situations could be better \ntoday had we had clearer leadership and people that listened to someone \nsuch as Chairman McCain, who knew what he was talking about. But that \nis all water over the dam at this point.\n  What do we do now? We have to have more money for defense. I am a \nbudget hawk. I was ranking member on the budget when we did the 2011 \ncap and limit on spending. I defended it consistently. But I have to \ntell you, colleagues, both the President, our Democratic Members, and \nRepublican Members believe we are going to have to increase our defense \nbudget.\n  What is the problem? The problem is our colleagues are saying: Well, \nyou cannot increase defense unless you increase nondefense by the same \namount.\n\n[[Page S3909]]\n\nHow silly is that? Imagine, you have a tight budget at home, and a tree \nfalls on your house. Emergency--you have to go out and find money, \nborrow money to fix the roof. Does that mean now that you are going to \nspend twice as much on your vacation? Are you going to go out and buy a \nnew car that you did not plan to buy because you had to spend more \nmoney to fix the house?\n  How irresponsible is that? It is unbelievable to me. This is exactly \nwhat has occurred. They are demanding that we will not get a defense \nbudget until we give more money for the nondefense account and spend \nabove what we agreed to spend in the Budget Control Act. Remember, it \nwill soon begin to grow at 2.5 percent a year. We have saved money \nthrough the Budget Control Act. It was a successful thing. We do not \nneed to destroy it and give it up.\n  I want to say that I wish we had not had these dangerous conditions \nerupt throughout much of the world. I wish it had not happened. Senator \nMcCain warned that the foreign policy we were executing was going to \nresult in just this kind of problem. But it has resulted, and we are \ngoing to have to defend our country. These are overseas contingency \noperations that we will be funding. If we do this, it does not mean we \nhave to increase equally nondefense spending.\n  Let me just repeat the bad news I think most of us know. Every penny \nincreased on the defense budget is borrowed money. If we increase \nnondefense spending, that is going to be borrowed, too. We do not need \nto borrow more money than necessary. Just because we have to spend more \non defense does not mean we have to spend more on nondefense.\n  That is all I am saying. I think it is a mistake for our colleagues \non the Democratic side to try to use the security of America as a \nleverage to demand more nondefense spending.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nAlabama for his very important remarks.\n  I rise to oppose this amendment. I do so with the great respect that \nI have for my friend and colleague, the ranking member. The Senator \nfrom Rhode Island and I have worked together very closely on every \naspect of this legislation. We agree on the overwhelming majority of \nits provisions. As I have said before, this legislation is better \nbecause of the good work and cooperation that I have enjoyed with my \nfriend from Rhode Island. I respect his knowledge of and experience on \nnational defense issues, and I agree that we must fix sequestration. I \nalso agree with him that our national security does not depend solely \non the Department of Defense. But unfortunately, I disagree with my \nfriend on the amendment before us.\n  Since the Budget Control Act became law, threats to this country have \nonly increased and increased dramatically. Today, the United States \nfaces the most diverse and complex array of crises around the world \nsince the end of World War II. In the face of these global challenges, \nthis amendment would prevent the Department from using $38 billion of \nvital budget authority through overseas contingency operations, known \nas OCO.\n  Despite the claims that OCO is a slush fund, the entirety of the OCO \nbudget goes towards real defense requirements. With this budget \nauthority, we are supporting our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq, \noperations against ISIL, and broader counterterrorism efforts. The \nArmed Services Committee has also funded a portion of operation and \nmaintenance activities in OCO. These activities are directly tied to \nsupporting our operating forces. They pay for training, transportation, \nfuel, and maintenance of our combat equipment. These budgetary lines \npay for the readiness of our Active Forces and directly support our \nongoing military operations.\n  It would be a disaster if this $38 billion is removed from what we \nare trying to achieve in this legislation. That is why it is not \nsurprising the President himself has requested OCO funding for the \nexact same activities. The NDAA funded $38 billion of operation and \nmaintenance with OCO money because the President had requested OCO \nfunding for these activities already. They were the most closely linked \nto the government's growing number of overseas contingencies in which \nwe are engaged.\n  To reiterate, I agree with Senator Reed that we must absolutely fix \nthe Budget Control Act. Finding a bipartisan solution to do so remains \nmy top priority. But in absence of such an agreement, I refuse to hold \nfunding for the military hostage, leaving defense at sequestration \nlevels of spending that every single military service chief has \ntestified would put more American lives at risk of those serving in the \nArmed Forces of the United States. We cannot do that. We cannot add \ngreater danger to the lives of the men and women who are serving in the \nmilitary. This amendment would do that.\n  The NDAA is a policy bill. It cannot solve the Budget Control Act. It \ndeals only with defense issues. It does not spend a dollar. It provides \nthe Department of Defense and our men and women in uniform with the \nauthorities and support they need to defend the Nation.\n  The NDAA is a reform bill--a reform bill, my friends--that will \nenable our military to rise to the challenge of a more dangerous world. \nIt tackles acquisition reform, military retirement reform, personnel \nreform, even commissary reform, and headquarters and management reform. \nThe list goes on and on. The Armed Services Committee identified $10 \nbillion of excess and unnecessary spending from the President's defense \nbudget request, and we are reinvesting it in military capabilities for \nour warfighters and reforms that can yield long-term savings for the \nDepartment of Defense. We did all of this while upholding our \ncommitments to our servicemembers, retirees, and their families.\n  Members of the Armed Services Committee understand the need to fix \nthe Budget Control Act. That is why we included a provision in the bill \nthat would authorize the transfer of the additional $38 billion from \nOCO to the base budget in the event that legislation is enacted that \nincreases the budget caps on discretionary defense and nondefense \nspending in proportionately equal amounts. This was the product of a \nbipartisan compromise, and it was the most we could responsibly do in \nthe committee to recognize the need for a broader fiscal agreement \nwithout denying funding for our military.\n\n  Every one of us has a constitutional duty to provide for the common \ndefense, and as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, that is my \nhighest responsibility. Funding our national defense with OCO is not \nideal, but it is far better than the alternative, which is to deny the \nmen and women in uniform the $38 billion they desperately need now. The \nPresident requested $38 billion, and our military leaders have said \nthey cannot succeed without that $38 billion.\n  Regrettably, that is what this amendment would do, and I oppose it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, first, let me say with great respect how I \nappreciate the collaboration and cooperation of the chairman on so much \nof the bill where we worked together, but this is an issue that I feel \nvery strongly about.\n  Let me be very clear about what this amendment does. First, it \nrecognizes the need--as the President did in his budget submission--for \nadequate resources for our Department of Defense. But what it does is \nit says that the additional money above the President's request for \nOCO--the $38 billion which was taken from the base and put into this \noverseas account--would be essentially fenced or set aside until we \nresolve the Budget Control Act, and I think we have to begin that \nprocess immediately.\n  Senator McCain has said quite sincerely and quite persistently that \nwe have to fix sequestration. Every uniformed service chief who came \nbefore our committee said we have to fix sequestration and the budget \ncontrol caps. The reality is that this legislation does not do that. \nIndeed, my amendment does not do it, but it points us in that direction \nand gives us a strong incentive to fix the BCA and to do what all of \nour defense leaders have asked us to do for the welfare and safekeeping \nof our troops and forces in the field.\n  The President recognizes this need. His budget is virtually identical \nto the\n\n[[Page S3910]]\n\ntop-line number we are talking about today. But what he also recognized \nis that we had to put this money into the base budget of the Department \nof Defense, not into the OCO account.\n  OCO was created because of our contingency operations overseas in \nAfghanistan and Iraq. It was created to fund those unpredictable year-\nby-year needs that arise when you have forces in conflict and in \ncombat. It was not designed to be a fund that would take care of long-\nterm, routine demands of the Department of Defense.\n  Interestingly enough, in 2008 we had 187,000 troops deployed in \nAfghanistan and Iraq. If we look at the OCO number for that year, we \nwere spending approximately $1 million per troop--all the costs, such \nas the fuel, the ammunition, and their own safekeeping. Today, we have \n9,930 troops deployed in these combat zones. Yet, if we look at the \nsame ratio we are asking for in this bill, it is about $9 million per \nindividual soldier, sailor, marine, and airman. That shows us that this \nfund has gone way beyond its intent. It has become an escape valve from \nthe Budget Control Act just for the Department of Defense.\n  It is important to emphasize that our defense is not just the \nDepartment of Defense. Our national security rests on a strong Homeland \nSecurity Department that protects our borders. It rests on our Border \nPatrol, which is part of Homeland Security. It rests on the Coast \nGuard, which patrols our waters, the Justice Department, and the FBI.\n  We had an incident just a few days ago in Massachusetts where an FBI \nagent and a Massachusetts police officer confronted an alleged \nterrorist. It wasn't military forces, it was the local police force and \nFBI agents who were protecting our neighborhoods and communities. Those \nfunctions will not be adequately funded if we get on this path for OCO. \nIn fact, that is my greatest concern. If this were a 1-year, temporary \nfix, we might be able to justify it, but what we are seeing is a \npathway that will have us taking more from OCO every year, and there \nwill be more interesting and more remote uses of OCO funds. \nUnfortunately, that is the way it tends to be around here. You go where \nthe money is, and right now the money is in OCO.\n  I think we should step back and do what the chairman said. We have to \nfix it. And he is committed to fixing it, but we have to begin now. We \nhave to make the case now. We can't simply sit back and say we will \ntake it up later. And that is at the heart of this.\n  The other issue here is very clear: OCO is not a perfect fix for the \nDepartment of Defense. As the Chief of Staff of the Army said, it has \nlimits, it has restrictions, and it is funded for 1 year, but it is \nthere, and they will take the money. We know that. But it is our duty \nand responsibility to have a more thoughtful, long-term approach, and \nin doing so, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It does \nnot take away the resources. It simply says that these resources will \nbe there once we fix the Budget Control Act, and that is what I hear \neveryone in this Chamber--practically everyone--saying every day: We \nwill fix it. We will fix it. When we do, this money will already be \nauthorized.\n  I am convinced that unless we stand up right now and say--hopefully \nwith one voice--in a formal way that we have to get on the task of \nfixing the Budget Control Act, days will pass, weeks will pass, and \nmonths will pass to the detriment of our country, to the detriment of \nour military forces, and ultimately we will find ourselves, both in \nterms of national security and a whole range of programs, in a very bad \nposition.\n  I ask that all of my colleagues consider this amendment and give it \nsupport.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I believe the vote on my amendment is in order at this \ntime, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford).

The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1825 to Amendment No. 1463\n\n(Purpose: To authorize appropriations for national security aspects of \n   the Merchant Marine for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1825.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mrs. Fischer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1825 to amendment No. 1463.\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of June 8, 2015, under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise to speak about Senate amendment \nNo. 1825, the Maritime Administration Enhancement Act, which would \nreauthorize the Maritime Administration, or MARAD, for fiscal years \n2016 and 2017. MARAD will be and traditionally has been added to the \nNational Defense Authorization Act on the Senate floor.\n  MARAD strengthens our national security through its numerous programs \nto maintain a U.S. Merchant Marine fleet. Under the bipartisan \namendment, MARAD will be authorized at $380 million, which is similar \nto the levels authorized in the House NDAA. This bipartisan agreement \nwill authorize MARAD spending above current authorized levels, as \nrequested by the White House, while providing support to MARAD's \neconomic and national defense programs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I want to speak on my amendment but \nnot call it up at this moment. It is amendment No. 1578. The purpose of \nthe amendment is to create an unbiased military justice system. I \nbelieve the Senate needs to vote on this amendment.\n  Over the last few years, Congress has forced the military to make \nincremental changes to address the crisis of sexual assault. After two \ndecades of complete failure and lip service to zero tolerance, the \nmilitary now says, essentially: Trust us. We have got it this time.\n  They spin the data, hoping nobody will dig below the surface of their \ntop lines, because when you do, you will find the assault rate is \nexactly where it was in 2010.\n  We see an average of 52 new cases every day. Three out of four \nservicemembers who are survivors still don't think it is worth the risk \nof coming forward to report these crimes committed against them. One in \nseven victims was actually assaulted by someone in their chain of \ncommand. In 60 percent of cases, the survivor says a unit leader or \nsupervisor is responsible for sexual harassment or gender \ndiscrimination. So it is no surprise that one in three survivors \nbelieves reporting would hurt their career.\n  For those who do report, they are more likely than not to experience \nretaliation. Despite the much touted reform that made retaliation a \ncrime, the DOD has made zero progress on improving the 62-percent \nretaliation rate we had in 2012. So in 2012, 62 percent of those who \nreported a crime against them were retaliated against for doing so. In \n2014, again, 62 percent were retaliated against.\n  Human Rights Watch looked into these figures and into the stories, \nand they found the DOD could not provide a single example from the last \nyear where disciplinary action was actually taken against someone for \nretaliation. A sexual assault survivor is 12 times more likely to \nsuffer retaliation than see their offender get convicted of sexual \nassault.\n  In my close review of 107 cases from 2013 from our four largest \nmilitary bases--one for each service--I found that nearly half of those \nwho did move forward to report in an unrestricted report, half of them \nwithdrew from their case during the first year.\n  So we can talk all we want about reporting, reporting, but if half of \nthose who report withdraw during the year of their prosecution, it \nshows there is no faith in the system. Survivors do not have faith in \nthe current system. Under any metric, the system remains plagued with \ndistrust and does not provide fair and just process that survivors \ndeserve.\n  Simply put, the military has not held up to the standard posed by \nGeneral Dempsey 1 year ago when he said the Pentagon was on the clock.\n  I urge my colleagues to hold the military to this higher standard. \nLet us put these decisions into the hands of trained military \nprosecutors. Enough is enough with the spin, with the excuses, and with \nfalse promises. We have to do the right thing and we have to act.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I rise to speak about an amendment--\namendment No. 1628--to the Defense Authorization Act. This is an \namendment I\n\n[[Page S3912]]\n\nhave submitted with Senator Peters, and it has strong bipartisan \nsupport.\n  This is about the threat of tunnels--tunnels used by terrorists. We \nsaw those tunnels being used in the 2014 conflict that Israel had with \nHamas. Israel found more than 30 terror tunnels that had been dug by \nterrorists to infiltrate and attack Israel.\n  The Israeli military said these tunnels were intended to carry out \nattacks, such as abductions of Israeli citizens and soldiers, \ninfiltrations into Israeli communities, mass murders and hostage-taking \nscenarios.\n  In one disturbing attack in July of 2014, Hamas terrorists used one \nof these terror tunnels to sneak into Israel and then attack and kill \nfive Israeli soldiers.\n  This is a picture of one of these terror tunnels. You can imagine, if \nterrorists can use a tunnel to come into your country, the feeling of \nfear that can create in the civilian population.\n  Unfortunately, terror tunnels are not a new problem. In 2006, \nterrorists used tunnels to capture Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. They \nused tunnels to take Gilad back to Gaza and held him captive for 5 \nyears. Two other soldiers were killed in this same attack where these \nterror tunnels were used.\n  Again, this issue of terror tunnels is not unique to the conflict the \nIsraeli people have been subjected to. In fact, one of Israel's primary \nobjectives in Operation Protective Edge last year was to destroy these \nterror tunnels that posed unacceptable risk to the Israelis and to \ntheir national security. That is why Israel has devoted so much \nattention to this problem and how to destroy these terror tunnels.\n\n  But not only are terror tunnels a leading security concern for the \nGovernment of Israel, tunnels are being used by terrorists in Syria and \nin Iraq. According to a public report yesterday, ISIS used several \ndozen tunnel bombs in Syria and used tunnels to help take the Iraqi \ncity of Ramadi. On March 11, ISIS reportedly detonated a tunnel bomb \nunder an Iraqi Army headquarters, killing an estimated 22 people. On \nMarch 15, a second tunnel bomb was reportedly used to attack Iraqi \nsecurity forces.\n  Terror tunnels can also be used to threaten U.S. Embassies and \nforward-deployed U.S. military personnel. In addition, drug trafficking \norganizations and international criminal organizations continue to \nconstruct tunnels on our southern border in order to illegally move \npeople, drugs, and anything else they think will advantage them into \nthe United States. Drug cartels are exploiting vulnerabilities on our \nborder. While this undoubtedly affects border communities and border \nStates, it has consequences far beyond the border States.\n  In my home State of New Hampshire, heroin is killing people. It is a \npublic health epidemic. I have spoken to law enforcement, first \nresponders, firefighters, and public safety officials, and we have seen \na dramatic increase in the number of people dying in my State. \nAccording to a recent DEA report and drug control experts, heroin is \nmost commonly being brought into the United States via the southwest \nborder.\n  In many places on our border with Mexico, we have fences. \nUnfortunately, these criminals and their syndicates--by the way, we \nhave heard from the commander of Southern Command, and he believes \nthese networks could be used by terrorists if they wanted to infiltrate \nour country. Unfortunately, they are being dug on our southern border.\n  This is a picture of a tunnel built on our southern border that is \nused to smuggle drugs, smuggle people--smuggle anything criminals and \nother bad people want to move into our country.\n  In a 2-day period alone in April, two tunnels were discovered beneath \nthe California-Mexico border. Again, these tunnels are often used to \nsmuggle almost anything you can think of into this country, drugs being \nthe most prominent thing smuggled in. According to public reports, \ndozens of smuggling tunnels have been discovered on our southern \nborders since 2006.\n  The amendment I have submitted to the Defense authorization, along \nwith my colleague, Senator Peters from Michigan, is an amendment that \nbuilds on a provision already in the Defense authorization that I had \nincluded in section 1272. Our amendment promotes and authorizes greater \ncooperation between Israel and the United States to counter terror \ntunnels in Israel.\n  If we work with close allies such as Israel to develop better \ncapabilities to detect, map, and neutralize tunnels, not only can we \nhelp defend Israel and Israel defend itself against terrorist groups \nsuch as Hamas and Hezbollah, but we can also use the capabilities we \ndevelop together to better protect our own border, our own U.S. \nEmbassies, and our forward-deployed U.S. troops.\n  My amendment specifically highlights the tunnel threat on our \nsouthern border. It calls on the administration to use the anti-\ntunneling capabilities developed to help Israel to better protect the \nUnited States, our people, our interests, and our border. In short, \nthis amendment will help Israel, our closest and most reliable ally in \nthe Middle East. It will help us defeat the use of terror tunnels. It \nwill better equip officials on our southern border to find and shut \ndown tunnels that are being used to smuggle drugs and that can be used \nto smuggle other dangerous items into the United States of America by \nthese criminal syndicates.\n  Again, the commander of our Southern Command said he believes this \nnetwork can also be used by terrorists.\n  Not surprisingly, this effort and this amendment have received strong \nbipartisan support. I thank all of my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle who have sponsored this amendment. This is a commonsense \namendment, and I hope my colleagues, when it is offered for a vote on \nthe Senate floor, will support this amendment so that we can work with \nthe Israeli Government, that we can share our understanding of how to \nstop these terror tunnels and we can deploy that same technology on our \nsouthern borders to keep our country safe.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I rise in support of the national \ndefense authorization bill and would point out to my colleagues that \nthis is a piece of legislation which for half a century has enjoyed \nbipartisan support--during Republican administrations, Democratic \nadministrations, and during times of majority on the Democratic side \nand on the Republican side.\n  Regrettably, last year this Chamber did not take up the NDAA until \nDecember--months after it had been approved in committee. I commend \nSenator Levin, the former chairman of the Armed Services Committee, for \nreporting the bill out of his committee during Democratic majorities, \nand if he had his way, we would have taken up the bill much earlier.\n  I also want to commend Senator McCain, our current Republican \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee\n\n[[Page S3916]]\n\nfor again, in a timely way, reporting this bipartisan bill. And then I \nthink commendation is due to the new leadership of this Senate for \ntaking up this bill in a timely fashion in June rather than waiting \nuntil December.\n  It has been said by the distinguished minority leader that taking up \nthis bill is a waste of time because the President has said he would \nveto this bill. It is curious that he would say so because this bill \nfunds national security at the amount requested by the President of the \nUnited States. I think to people out there listening in the public, it \nis curious the President would say ``I am going to veto a bill'' that \nactually funds security items at the administration's requested level.\n  I would also point out to my colleagues that this is not the first \ntime the President has issued a veto threat. This happened on the Iran \nnuclear negotiations bill, where at first the President said: If the \nHouse and Senate send me such a bill, I will veto it. But the more we \ntalked about it and the more we brought the American people into the \ndiscussion and the more the light was shown on the issue and the \nAmerican public opinion began to be known, the more popular the idea \nbecame in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  At the end of the day, it was unanimous or virtually unanimous in the \nForeign Relations Committee that the Senate and the House should be \nheard on the issue of any negotiations this administration has, as the \nSecretary of State might have with the Iranian leadership. At the end \nof the day, it passed overwhelmingly, and the President actually \nchanged his mind. Having said he would veto that Iranian nuclear bill, \nhe changed his mind and sent word that he would, in fact, sign it.\n  I hope the same thing will happen in this situation. I hope the \nPresident will rescind his veto threat and, after we have worked our \nwill and after this bill has gone over to a conference committee with \nthe House of Representatives and we have come up with a compromise \nbetween the House and the Senate, I hope the President will, in fact, \nchange his mind and change his position as he did on the Iranian bill \nand sign it. I do not think it is a waste of time. I think it is \ncritical that we do this.\n  It is often that we start off on a partisan basis. I have the highest \nregard for the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee. He and I \nserved together in the House of Representatives. It has been my \nprivilege to serve on the committee with the distinguished ranking \nmember for some time. I think he would acknowledge that we started off \nthe defense markup with all Republicans saying they were going to vote \nfor it and with all Democrats saying they would be a ``no'' vote. But \nthe more we got into that issue and the more Senator McCain began to \nwork with Members on both sides of the aisle and amendments were \noffered and debate was held, that opposition began to melt away.\n  At the end of the day, on this bill that is before us today, there \nwere eight Democrats who voted aye in the committee and only four \nDemocrats who voted no. As I recall, all of the Republicans on the \ncommittee voted yes. It was an overwhelmingly bipartisan support of \nsomething that started off dividing us, Republicans versus Democrats.\n  It is important that we continue to do that. The focus should be on \nour national security priorities. The focus should be on the troops. \nThis bill funds the troops in a very meaningful and a very reform-\noriented way. This is necessary under the current times.\n  I want to quote from an earlier Armed Services hearing we had, \nwherein Director of National Intelligence James Clapper warned the \ncommittee. I will quote the Director of National Intelligence. He said \nthat ``unpredictable instability is the new normal.'' ``Unpredictable \ninstability is the new normal.''\n  He pointed out that ``last year was the most lethal year for global \nterrorism in 45 years.'' It so happens that we have only been keeping \nstatistics on the lethal degree of terrorism for 45 years. In the \nrecorded 45-year history of keeping tabs on this, this is the most \nlethal year, this past year--tough times, dangerous times.\n  This was underscored by former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, \nwhen he testified at a hearing before the committee earlier this year. \nHe said that ``the United States has not faced a more diverse and \ncomplex array of crises since the end of the Second World War.''\n  This is a dangerous world. This is a dangerous time. We have a bill \nthat addresses these times, and I think we should move forward with it. \nThe Obama administration may be unwilling to admit that the world is \nless safe, but there is no denying the extraordinary challenges. I \nthink Members on both sides of the aisle would acknowledge this: ISIS \nor ISIL, the newly resurgent and aggressive Russia and what they have \ndone in invading Crimea and eastern Ukraine, the havoc across the \nMiddle East in nations such as Yemen and Syria, nations that are \ncollapsing into chaos. These are serious times.\n  Yet our President said, on the European Continent yesterday, that \n``we don't have a complete strategy'' for dealing with ISIS in Iraq.\n  This is not a time to block resources our military needs. As a matter \nof fact, it is a time for us to act as Americans and not as partisans. \nThere are several reasons why passing this bill this month should not \nbe controversial:\n  First, it would authorize the same amount of funding as requested by \nthe President.\n  Second, it contains one of the most substantive defense reforms we \nhave seen in years. It would adopt $10 billion worth of efficiencies \nthat would pave the way for long-term savings at the Department of \nDefense.\n  Third, the bill champions greater efficiency by reducing bureaucracy \nat the Pentagon and reforming the weapons acquisition system. Just \nbecause we need to spend more money for defense does not mean we need \nto spend more money to hire bureaucrats and staffers at the Pentagon.\n  Fourth, it is very important to point out the reforms in this bill \nmake sure that the men and women who fight for our country, including \nthose who are wounded or who have retired, have the quality of life, \nhealth care and support they deserve.\n  Fifth, this bill would modernize the military retirement system. \nSomething that has been recommended to us by experts in the military \nand by retired military people. It would not only extend benefits to \nmore servicemembers, but also give them more value. It would give our \nservicemembers more choice in their retirement system. Too many of our \nmembers are being excluded from the current system. Maintaining our \nAll-Volunteer Force requires taking care of those who have chosen to \nserve.\n  Let me give a big shout-out and thank-you to Senator Mazie Hirono, my \nranking member on the Seapower Subcommittee. We have worked closely in \nthe Seapower mark of this legislation. As a matter of fact, I regret \nthat Senator Hirono and I could not do our two speeches on this bill \ntogether. That was our intent, for me to speak as chair and for her to \nspeak as ranking member because we have cooperated so much in our \nSeapower title.\n  Our title in the bill addresses shortfalls in the Navy's ability to \nmeet requirements. We have 30 ships and our Navy's amphibious fleet is \nmuch smaller than the Marine Corps tells us is required. Last year, the \nChief of Naval Operations, ADM Jonathan Greenert, said that more like \n50 ships are required if we want to do everything the military is being \nasked to do. We need to address this and at least move from 30 ships \ntoward that goal of 50 that Admiral Greenert suggested.\n  This year's NDAA would authorize $199 million for an additional \nAmerican-class amphibious assault ship as well as $80 million in \nresearch and development. This sends a powerful message to anyone who \nwould be our adversary. These ships are known as the ``Swiss Army \nKnives'' of the sea because they are so versatile and because they \nrespond to so many of the threats, including counterterrorism, piracy, \ncombat missions, and humanitarian crises.\n  We also recognize the need to modernize our submarine fleet. Again, \nthank you to Senator Hirono, the ranking member, for working with us on \nthis. The Seapower Subcommittee is preparing for the eventual \nconstruction of the Ohio-class replacement submarine program. This is \nan expensive\n\n[[Page S3917]]\n\nprogram. It is necessary. It is expensive. We are about the business of \nproviding the necessary funds to mitigate higher costs for the \nsubmarine program on our shipbuilding budget.\n  I am so pleased we addressed these Seapower needs. In addition, we do \nour best to meet the needs of the National Guard, to support a modern \nfleet for the Army, for mental health services for our troops and \nveterans, and the protection for our servicemembers' religious \nconvictions. It is a comprehensive reform bill that ought to have the \nsame sort of bipartisan support we have had for last 50 years.\n  We need a bill, in conclusion, that takes an honest look at our \ncurrent challenges and implements necessary reforms. I am pleased to \nsay this bill does so, and I hope we move forward, get past this moment \nof suiting up in a partisan fashion, and send this bill with an \noverwhelming vote from the U.S. Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Youth Unemployment\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, it sometimes happens that issues of \nenormous consequence seem to be ignored and do not get anywhere near \nthe discussion it requires. One such issue which needs to be put on the \ntable that needs to be dealt with and needs to be resolved is the \ncrisis of youth unemployment in America, in general, and specifically \namong Black and Hispanic youth.\n  Let me provide you with some new information that I recently received \nfrom the Economic Policy Institute, one of the important nonpartisan \neconomic think tanks in our country. What this information tells us is \nthat the level of youth unemployment in this country has reached tragic \ndimensions, and it is especially tragic for the African-American and \nHispanic communities.\n  The Economic Policy Institute recently analyzed census data on \nunemployment among young people--those people who are either jobless, \nthose people who have given up looking for work or those people who are \nworking part time when they want to work full time; in other words, \nwhat real unemployment is about.\n  This is what they found. They found that during April of 2014 to \nMarch of 2015, the average real unemployment rate for Black high school \ngraduates, ages 17 to 20, was 51.3 percent. Let me repeat. Over the \nlast year, from April 2014 to March of 2015, the average real \nunemployment rate for Black high school graduates was 51.3 percent. The \njobless figure for Hispanics in the same age group was 36.1 percent, \nand for young White high school graduates the number was 33.8 percent.\n  This is an issue which cannot be ignored. An entire generation of \nyoung people who are trying to get their lives together, trying to earn \nsome money, and trying to become independent are unable to find work. \nThis is an issue which must be dealt with. Even young Americans with a \ncollege degree are finding it increasingly difficult to get a job. The \nreal unemployment rate for young Black college graduates between the \nages of 21 and 24 was 23 percent, the figure for Hispanics was 22.4 \npercent, and the figure for Whites was 12.9 percent.\n  Today in America, over 5\\1/2\\ million young people have either \ndropped out of high school or have graduated high school and do not \nhave jobs. It is no great secret that without work, without education, \nand without hope, people get into trouble, and the result is--and this \nis not unrelated--that tragically in America today we have more people \nin jail than any other country on Earth, including China, an \nauthoritarian, Communist country with a population four times our size. \nHow does that happen? How is it that this great Nation has more people \nin jail than any other country and far more than a Communist, \nauthoritarian society in China, a country that is four times our size?\n  Today, the United States is 5 percent of the world's population; yet, \nwe have 25 percent of the world's prisoners. Incredibly, over 3 percent \nof our country's population is under some form of correctional control. \nAccording to the NAACP, from 1980 to 2008, the number of people \nincarcerated in America quadrupled from roughly half a million to 2.3 \nmillion people. If current trends continue, the estimate is that one in \nthree Black males born today can expect to spend time in prison during \nhis lifetime.\n  This is an unspeakable tragedy. This is an issue which has to be put \non the table and has to be discussed. And this crisis is not just a \ndestruction of human life, it is also a very costly issue to the \ntaxpayers of our country. In America, we now spend nearly $200 billion \na year on public safety, including $70 billion on correctional \nfacilities each and every year.\n  It is beyond comprehension that we as a nation have not focused \nattention on the fact that millions of our young people are unable to \nfind work or begin their careers in a productive economy. This is an \nissue which we must deal with--and I know I speak for the Senator from \nMichigan--and we will make sure this country pays attention to and \ndeals with this issue.\n  Let me just say that it makes a lot more sense to invest in jobs and \neducation for our young people than to spend incredible amounts of \nmoney on jails and incarceration. Let's give these kids a shot at life. \nLet's give them a chance. Let's not lock them up.\n  The time is long overdue for us to start investing in our young \npeople, to help them get the jobs they need, the education they need, \nand the job training they need so they can be part of the American \nmiddle class.\n  The answer to unemployment and poverty is not and cannot be the mass \nincarceration of young Americans of all races. It is time to bring hope \nand economic opportunity to communities throughout this country.\n  Last week, I introduced legislation with Congressman John Conyers and \nSenator Debbie Stabenow to provide $5\\1/2\\ billion to immediately begin \nfunding States and localities throughout this country to employ 1 \nmillion young people between the ages of 16 and 24 and provide job \ntraining to hundreds of thousands of young Americans.\n  Some people may say: Well, this is an expensive proposition.\n  I guarantee that this investment will save money because it costs a \nheck of a lot more money to put people in jail than to provide them \nwith jobs and education. We will save lives and create taxpayers and a \nmiddle class rather than having more and more people in jail.\n  I just wanted to mention that this is an issue which has to be \ndiscussed. I look forward to working with the cosponsor of this \nlegislation, Senator Stabenow, and we will bring attention to this \nissue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, before the Senator from Vermont \nleaves, I have to say that I am very proud to be a partner with him on \nthis legislation and how critically important it is that we give young \npeople the opportunity to have a job. On the last immigration bill, we \nwere able to add dollars to the bill, which helped to create funding \nfor young people. Youth unemployment is a huge issue, and we need to \ngive them a path forward on jobs, hope, and economic opportunity. I \nagain thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  Madam President, I also have to say I am very disappointed that \nSenator Reed's amendment was not successful. Unfortunately, it was \nvoted down today on a partisan vote. We all know there are way too many \nbudget gimmicks in this authorization, as important as it is, and what \nwe ought to be doing is making sure all of the security needs of our \nfamilies--not just those at the Department of Defense but those in \nother parts of the budget have the adequate resources they need so \ntheir families are truly safe.\n\n\n                           Highway Trust Fund\n\n  I wish to speak specifically about another piece of legislation which \nwill help to ensure our safety, and that is economic safety and \nsecurity. This is something which also deserves our time and attention, \nand time is running out right now. We have 52 days before the highway \ntrust fund will be empty, shut down; 52 days and we have not yet done \neven one hearing in the Finance Committee. I respectfully ask that our \nchairman, for whom I have tremendous respect, have hearings and \ndiscussions so we can work together and talk about how we are going to \nfund this bill. We have not yet seen legislation on the floor that will \nallow us\n\n[[Page S3918]]\n\nto move forward on a long-term funding bill for economic security.\n  Our Republican colleagues need to join with us and provide leadership \non this issue which affects millions of jobs and, frankly, affects \nevery single American. There was a time when Republicans were the \nleaders of building our roads, bridges, airports, railroads, and all of \nour infrastructure, and that came in the form of President Eisenhower, \nwho said in 1952 that ``a network of modern roads is as necessary to \ndefense as it is to our national economy and our personal safety.''\n  We are on the floor talking about legislation to authorize moving \nforward to support our troops and making sure we are authorizing \nprograms for our national defense. Yet, in 1952 President Eisenhower \nsaid that ``a network of modern roads is as necessary to our defense as \nit is to our national economy and our own personal safety.'' But in \nonly 52 days, there will be zero in our Nation's highway trust fund.\n  By the late 1950s, our interstate highways were responsible for 31 \npercent of the annual economic growth of our country--an economic \nengine of our country. Thanks to President Eisenhower's leadership, our \nroads in the mid-20th century were the envy of the world. Now we see \nother countries that want to be like America--a global economic power--\nand they are rushing to invest in their roads, bridges, airports, \nrailroads, and other infrastructure, countries such as China and \nBrazil.\n  China is taking 9 percent of their GDP and using it to invest in \njobs, and those things that will allow them to create jobs and be a \nworld economic power. They are wooing businesses there because they \nhave the most modern infrastructure, and frankly, we are playing \ncatchup. There is absolutely no reason that should be happening.\n  Our European competitors spend twice what we do on transportation and \nfunding for critical roads and bridges and other transportation needs. \nThe Chinese Government spends four times what we are spending right \nnow.\n  The World Economic Forum's ``Global Competitiveness Report'' for 2014 \nand 2015 ranks America 16th in the quality of roads. We are one spot \nbehind Luxembourg and one spot just ahead of Croatia. Can you imagine? \nYay. We are just ahead of Croatia in investing in the future in \ntransportation technology and safety for our roads, bridges, and \nairports--all of those things which create economic security and, in \nthe words of President Eisenhower, national security.\n  The World Economic Forum has its own rankings. In 2002, America had \nthe fifth best transportation system in the world. In their most recent \nrankings, we were 24th.\n  The American Society of Civil Engineers' most recent report card for \nAmerica's infrastructure--our transportation, roads and bridges--gave \nus a D on our roads. I don't think any of us would be happy if our \nchildren brought home a report card that had a D on it; yet, that is \nwhat we are now seeing in Congress. The report card that we are \npresenting to the American people has a D on it. It says that 42 \npercent of major urban highways are congested and that it costs over \n$101 billion in wasted time and fuel every year.\n  One of my constituents recently told me that he hit a pothole on the \nway to the Detroit Metro Airport, and he had to replace all four tires \non his car. He actually went through seven tires in 1 year. That is a \nlot of money; that is a lot of tires. He went through seven tires in 1 \nyear because of the bad roads in Michigan.\n  The average Michigan resident spends $357 a year on repairing the \ndamage to their automobiles caused by broken roads. That is more than \ntwice the amount that average people pay in taxes to go to improving \nour roads and bridges. It is more than twice what it would take to \nactually fix our roads and bridges and actually be able to move \nforward. It is not fair. It is not fair to neglect responsibility to \nmaintain our Nation's basic roads and bridges and other infrastructure \nand let the American people pay for that neglect, which is exactly what \nis happening.\n  We can't expect our workers and our companies to compete in the 21st-\ncentury global marketplace if they are forced to use 20th-century roads \nand bridges, and we are on our way to the 19th century. Some places are \nso crumbled up, we are going from pavement back to the dirt underneath \nit. It is crazy, and there is no excuse for it.\n  Every time we pass a short-term patch that goes 1 or 2 or 6 months \ndown the road, we let our workers, businesses, and our families down. \nCongress needs to step up. We are ready, and we are looking for \nRepublican partners to join with us in a long-term solution. The \nmajority needs to step up.\n  We have 52 days and counting until the highway trust fund is empty--\nat zero. We shouldn't see the majority kick the can down the road again \nor come up with some kind of short-term suggestion or crazy things such \nas cutting people's pensions to pay for roads and bridges. Together, we \nneed to do what the American people expect us to do and sit down and do \nwhat has been done over the course of history in the United States: \nFund a long-term transportation bill that moves us forward in our \neconomy, jobs, and creates the kind of competitive edge we have \ntraditionally had in the United States.\n  A grade of D on roads is an embarrassment. We need our Republican \nmajority to step up with us, because we are waiting. We are anxious to \nput together a long-term strategy on funding for our roads and bridges. \nThis is pretty basic when we look at the responsibilities that Congress \nhas on behalf of the American people--maintaining airports, railroads, \nshort rail for agriculture, as well as our long distance rail, roads, \nbridges, and all of the other things that comprise the basic format. We \nare 52 days away from the highway trust fund going empty.\n  Let's get busy. It is time to make sure we are doing the right thing \nin moving the country forward.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Gaspee Days\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I am here on the floor today to \ncelebrate a significant event in our country's history and in Rhode \nIsland. Every student of American history knows the story of the Boston \nTea Party. We all learned about Samuel Adams and the Sons of Liberty \ndumping chests of tea into Boston Harbor to protest British taxation \nwithout representation.\n  What many students don't know is that down in Rhode Island, more than \na year earlier, a group of Rhode Island patriots made an even harsher \nchallenge to the British Empire one dark night in June of 1772. I am \nhere to tell their story.\n  The episode began when amid growing tensions with colonists, King \nGeorge III moved the HMS Gaspee, an armed British customs vessel, into \nRhode Island's Narragansett Bay. The Gaspee and its captain, Lieutenant \nWilliam Dudingston, were known for seizing cargo and flagging down \nships only to harass, humiliate, and interrogate the colonials. As Nick \nBunker, author of the book ``An Empire on the Edge'' wrote, this \nharassment did not sit well with Rhode Islanders, who had grown \naccustomed to a level of freedom unique in that time. ``Even by \nAmerican standards, Rhode Island was an extreme case of popular \ngovernment.''\n  The chapter in his book in which he describes this is entitled `` \n`This Dark Affair': The Gaspee Incident.'' Bunker went on to say: ``Out \nof all the colonies, Rhode Island was the one where the ocean entered \nmost deeply into the lives of the people.'' And we wanted it free.\n  In July of 1663, over 100 years before the Gaspee incident, King \nCharles II had granted a royal charter establishing the colony of Rhode \nIsland and Providence Plantations in New England. And the charter said \nit was ``to hold forth a lively experiment . . . that a most \nflourishing civil state may stand and best be maintained with full \nliberty in religious concernments.''\n  The ``lively experiment'' in Rhode Island blazed the path for \nAmerican freedom of religion, a fundamental right of\n\n[[Page S3919]]\n\nour great Nation. In Rhode Island, what were then considered radical \nideologies of freedom ran very deep. A century later, William \nDudingston would learn just how deep, as he went about harassing \nAmerican vessels and confiscating their cargo. ``The British Armed \nForces have come to regard almost every local merchant as a smuggler \nand a cheat,'' Bunker wrote. Rhode Islanders were fed up with the \nabuse. Something was bound to give.\n  In March of 1772, local seamen and traders led by John Brown signed a \npetition against the Gaspee. They brought it to Rhode Island Chief \nJustice Stephen Hopkins, a political leader in Providence and a \nrelentless advocate for liberty.\n  Nick Bunker wrote:\n\n       For Brown and Hopkins, the only law they recognized was \n     theirs, laid down by their assembly and their local courts. \n     They saw no role in Rhode Island for the English laws that \n     gave the navy its authority.\n\n  This is in 1772. Chief Justice Hopkins provided a legal opinion \nsaying that British officers needed to present their orders and \ncommission to Rhode Island's Governor before entering local waters. \nWell, Dudingston refused and, indeed, threatened to hang ``any man who \ntried to oppose the Gaspee.''\n  So the fuse was lit. It all came to a head on June 9, 1772. Rhode \nIsland Captain Benjamin Lindsey was sailing to Providence from Newport \nin his ship, the Hannah. He was accosted and ordered to yield for \ninspection by the Gaspee. Well, Captain Lindsey refused. He raced up \nNarragansett Bay, despite warning shots fired at the Hannah.\n  The Gaspee gave chase and Captain Lindsey, who knew the waters of \nRhode Island far better than did Dudingston, steered his ship north \ntoward Pawtuxet Cove in Warwick, right over the shallow waters of \nNamquid Point. There, the lighter Hannah shot over the shallows, but \nthe heavier Gaspee ran aground and stuck firm.\n  The British ship and her crew were caught, stranded in a falling \ntide. They would need to wait many hours for a rising tied to free them \nagain. According to Nick Bunker, as night fell, the Gaspee crew turned \nin, leaving only one seaman on the deck. Spotting an irresponsible \nopportunity, Captain Lindsey sailed on to Providence. There he enlisted \nthe help of John Brown, the respected merchant and statesman who had \nled that petition against the Gaspee back in March.\n  Brown was from one of the most prominent families in the city. He \nultimately helped found what we know today as Brown University. Brown \nand Lindsey rallied a group of Rhode Island patriots at Sabin's Tavern, \ndown in what is now the East Side of Providence, along the waterfront. \nRefreshments, no doubt, were served. Refreshed or not, the group \nresolved to end the Gaspee's menace in Rhode Island waters. That night, \nthose raiders, led by what Nick Bunker called the ``maritime elite of \nProvidence,'' set out with blackened faces, in long boots, and rowed \ndown the bay with their oars muffled to avoid detection. They made \ntheir way to the stranded Gaspee and surrounded it.\n  As Daniel Harrington recounted in a recent op-ed that he wrote in the \nProvidence Journal, ``Capt. Abraham Whipple spoke first for the Rhode \nIslanders, summoning Dudingston: `I am sheriff of Kent county, \n[expletive]. I have a warrant to apprehend you, [expletive]; so \nsurrender, [expletive].' It was a classic Rhode Island greeting!''\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Harrington's article be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Lieutenant Dudingston, of course, refused Whipple's demand, and \ninstead ordered his men to fire upon anyone who attempted to board the \nGaspee. The Rhode Islanders saw their advantage. They outnumbered the \nBritish, and they swarmed on the Gaspee. Shots rang out in the dark. \nLieutenant Dudingston fell wounded in the arm and the thigh. That night \nin the waters off Warwick, RI, the very first blood in the conflict \nthat was to become the American Revolution was drawn by American arms--\na little bit more than just tea over the side into Boston Harbor.\n  As the patriots commandeered the ship, Brown ordered one of his Rhode \nIslanders, a physician named John Mawney, to tend to Dudingston's \nwounds. Mawney was an able doctor and saved the lieutenant. Brown and \nWhipple took the captive English crew ashore, and then they returned to \nthe despised Gaspee to rid Narragansett Bay of her detested presence \nonce and for all. They set her afire. The blaze spread, reaching the \nship's charges of gunpowder and cannons, setting off explosions like \nfireworks.\n  Ultimately, the flames reached the Gaspee's powder magazine, and the \nresulting blast echoed across Narragansett Bay, as airborne fragments \nof the Gaspee splashed down into the water beneath a moonless sky. Nick \nBunker wrote that the British had never seen anything quite like the \nGaspee affair. Their attack on the ship amounted to a complete \nrejection of the empire's right to rule.\n  According to Dan Harrington's op-ed, King George III was furious and \noffered huge rewards for the capture of the rebels. Inquiries were made \nand nooses fashioned. But in the end, not one name was produced, as \nthousands of Rhode Islanders remained true to silence. The site of this \nhistoric victory is now named Gaspee Point in honor of this incident \nand the audacious Rhode Islanders who accomplished it.\n  According to Bunker, the Rhode Island patriots successfully organized \n``a military operation 3 years ahead of its time, that arose not merely \nfrom a private quarrel but also a matrix of ideas''--the ideas of \nliberty. Rhode Islanders have made a tradition of celebrating the \nGaspee incident. This year marks the 50th annual Gaspee Days \ncelebration in Warwick. Over the years, we celebrate by marching in the \nannual parade, as we recall the courage of the men who fired the first \nshots and drew the first blood in the quest for American independence.\n  I would like to thank the Gaspee Days Committee for their continuing \nefforts to host this annual celebration and my friend, State \nRepresentative Joe McNamara, for his work each year in making this \nevent so special. I come to the floor every year at this time to speak \nabout the burning of the Gaspee, because as proud as I am of what those \nbrave Rhode Islanders did back in 1772, I am also disappointed that \ntheir story has largely been lost to history outside our little State.\n  I hope these speeches will help new generations to learn about this \nimportant American event. In Rhode Island, of course, we will never \nforget. As Mr. Harrington wrote in his piece in the Providence Journal, \n``Through the ages, noble Rhode Islanders have named their daughters \nHannah in honor of the ship that long ago led a fledgling young country \ntoward independence and helped create the finest nation ever born of \nman.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Providence Journal, June 2, 2015]\n\n                    The Gaspee, the Hero and the Dud\n\n                       (By Daniel F. Harrington)\n\n       Every story needs a good villain, and 243 years ago the \n     British dropped a big one on us. His name was Dudingston. His \n     job? Preventing piracy on Narragansett Bay--or, in layman's \n     terms, shaking down every merchant he could catch.\n       Lt. William Dudingston, 31, and his dreaded ship the HMS \n     Gaspee arbitrarily halted and often seized the cargo of Rhode \n     Island ships at will. And he did it all in the name of \n     taxation. Think of him as an Internal Revenue Service agent \n     and mob boss rolled into one.\n       He wore a gold-trimmed cap and had a proclivity for rum.\n       The governor of Rhode Island repeatedly challenged the \n     Crown to check the lieutenant's brazen misbehavior, but his \n     requests were largely ignored. So on Dudingston went.\n       Until he met our heroes.\n       The first was Capt. Benjamin Lindsey, who skippered a sloop \n     called the Hannah. He had had enough. Returning from New York \n     on June 9, 1772, he was greeted in Newport with cannon fire \n     from the Gaspee after refusing Dudingston's command to strike \n     his flag. Then, trusting ``the Dud'' knew more about \n     extortion than navigation, Lindsey led him on a four-hour \n     chase up Narragansett Bay. It was the Dud's guns versus \n     Lindsey's guts.\n       Lindsey skillfully piloted his ship toward Pawtuxet Cove \n     and specifically to a menacing sandbar, trusting the heavy \n     Gaspee and its rum-fueled captain would run aground.\n       They did!\n       But Lindsey didn't stop there. He sailed north to \n     Providence and informed fellow merchant John Brown about the \n     sitting Dud. At dusk, Brown sent a town crier through the \n     streets of Providence and assembled a raiding party of \n     tavern-friendly professional men.\n\n[[Page S3920]]\n\n       Rowing to the doomed ship in long boats, the Patriots \n     reached the Gaspee around midnight.\n       Capt. Abraham Whipple spoke first for the Rhode Islanders, \n     summoning Dudingston: ``I am sheriff of Kent county, Goddamn \n     you. I have a warrant to apprehend you, Goddamn you; so \n     surrender, Goddamn you.'' It was a classic Rhode Island \n     greeting!\n       Then a shot rang out. Dudingston fell when a ball hit him \n     five inches below his navel. ``Good God, I am done for!'' he \n     cried.\n       And then a miracle.\n       As the Dud lay bleeding to death, a raider stepped forward. \n     It was 21-year-old physician--and genius--John Mawney, who \n     performed life-saving surgery on him. Astonished, Dudingston \n     then offered the doctor a gold buckle. Mawney refused it, but \n     accepted a silver one.\n       The Rhode Islanders then set the Gaspee aflame and the \n     warship exploded, lighting up Narragansett Bay as never \n     before--or since.\n       King George III was furious and offered huge rewards for \n     the capture of the rebels. Inquiries were made and nooses \n     fashioned, but in the end, not one name was produced, as \n     thousands of Rhode Islanders remained true to silence.\n       The burning of the Gaspee steeled the resolve of all the \n     colonies and inspired the Boston Tea Party 18 months later. \n     In 1922, The New York Times memorably editorialized that the \n     boldness of the Gaspee incident made The Boston Tea Party \n     look, by comparison, like a tea party!\n       Meanwhile, back in Britain, Dudingston would survive court \n     martial for losing his ship, receive a disability pension and \n     live another 45 years and become a rear admiral.\n       One man remains lost to history.\n       No one knows what happened to America's first hero, Captain \n     Lindsey. The most wanted man in the world quickly disappeared \n     and dissolved into time. We've never found his resting \n     place--probably because he was buried at sea. So he eludes us \n     still, although some say you can still hear him rousing the \n     Hannah when the fog of Narragansett Bay is unusually thick  . \n     . .\n       Not all have forgotten. Through the ages, noble Rhode \n     Islanders have named their daughters Hannah in honor of the \n     ship that long ago led a fledgling young country toward \n     independence and helped create the finest nation ever born of \n     man. And her name is still sweet, for it echoes the refrain \n     of liberty and recalls the powerful truth that ``God hath \n     chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things \n     that are mighty.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, we are hopefully going to be able to \nvote very shortly on an amendment to the NDAA that I have submitted, \nNo. 1901, which speaks to a pretty simple concept that when we spend \ntaxpayer money and 70 percent of the goods that we purchase with \ntaxpayer dollars come through the Defense Department, we should be \nspending that money on American companies.\n  We should be using our resources as a nation to purchase things from \ncompanies here in the United States. That has been the law on the books \nsince the 1930s. The Buy America Act, for economic and national \nsecurity reasons, directs the U.S. Government to buy at least 50 \npercent of the components of any good from U.S. companies. The problem \nis that over time, loophole after loophole and exception after \nexception have been built into the Buy America Act, such that today the \nexceptions really are the rule.\n  The consequences are pretty dire for American workers. It means that \nthousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of workers have \nlost their job because work that should have gone to American companies \nto build components for jet engines, tanks, and submarines are going \noverseas. But for our national security, we also are faced with issues \nas well, given the fact that as our supply chain becomes much more \ninternationalized, we are relying on countries that today might be our \nallies to supply parts but that tomorrow might not. It puts us at risk \npotentially down the line.\n  So I am proposing a pretty simple amendment here, which is really \njust about sunlight. I had previously hoped to push an amendment that \nwould have actually cut down on one of the waivers that is the most \negregious. But I am hoping for a consensus on an amendment that would \njust make clear that we have to get some more information about some of \nthe worst loopholes to the ``Buy American'' law. The worst of them, \nand, in fact, the majority of the waivers for the Buy American Act come \nthrough one specific waiver.\n  There are about eight ways to get around buying things in the United \nStates for the U.S. military. But one of them is that if you can prove \nthat the usage of the good is going to be primarily overseas, you can \nbuy that good overseas. Now, that is an understandable exception if you \nare talking about the purchase of something such as fuel or food that \nsimply does not make sense to import from the United States. But \nbecause there is really no oversight at all on this waiver and because \nover the last 10 years, having fought two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, \nthis relatively small loophole, as it appears on the written page, has \nbecome an enormous loophole.\n  So $17 billion in goods were made overseas, and in 2014, 83 percent \nof them were done through this particular ``Buy America'' loophole. So \nI want to just talk for a second about what some of these waivers are \nbeing used to purchase. This is an Opel light-duty cargo van that has \nbeen purchased by the U.S. military for a variety of activities. This \nwas not an emergency expenditure. Very clearly, you are buying this van \nfor activities that you can plan for. It is not something that you \ncould not import from the United States.\n  This contract, which was entered into at the height of the auto \ncrisis, was $2.9 million in total--$2.9 million that went to a foreign \nauto company instead of going to a company in the United States. This \nis clearly something--a cargo van--not being used on the frontlines of \nour wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that could have been bought from an \nAmerican auto company. Ford, Chevrolet, and Chrysler make versions of \nthis van that are produced by American workers.\n  There were $39 million worth of waivers for jet engines and gas \nturbines. There was $28 million worth of waivers simply for men's \nclothing. There were $11 million of waivers that were used for shoes, \nfor men's footwear. So it is clear that these waivers are being used \nnot for goods that are urgently needed in the field that had to be \npurchased in a place such as Afghanistan or Iraq or in the region but \nsimply to avoid the ``Buy American'' law.\n  I want to amend my previous statement. It was not $17 billion in \ngoods that were bought from foreign firms, it was $176 billion in \nmanufactured goods that were bought--and services--from foreign firms. \nSo if it were up to me, we would tighten this loophole. We would bring \nbillions of dollars of work back to the United States simply by saying \nthat you have to have an urgent national security need in order to buy \nthe good overseas.\n  But if it is not urgent, if you are just buying some vans to cart \naround equipment or people, then you should buy them from the United \nStates. But amendment No. 1901 is a little bit simpler, in that it just \nrequires that we continue to get reports from the Department of Defense \ndetailing the waivers that they have been granted for the ``Buy \nAmerican'' law, so that we have a pretty good idea as to how much work \nwe have lost to foreign firms, how many U.S. workers have lost their \njobs because taxpayer dollars are going overseas.\n  It adds a little new wrinkle to these reports so that when it comes \nto these waivers, the waiver for goods that are primarily used \noverseas, which was 83 percent in 2014 of all of the waivers that were \ngranted, we get a little bit more information so that for waivers for \ncontracts over $5 million--these are pretty big contracts--we know what \nyou are buying, why you need it, and why you are required to buy it \noverseas.\n  I think that this information is just sunlight on the waiver process. \nAgain, a waiver process which is sending overseas $176 billion worth of \nAmerican taxpayer paid-for jobs should have more information so that we \ncan make decisions. It is funny, when I talk to my constituents and I \ntell them that I am fighting for the ``Buy American'' law and that I am \nfighting to make sure that at least 50 percent of their dollars get \nspent to buy things from American companies when they are used by the \nU.S. military, they have a bewildered look on their face because they \nassume that is the policy of the U.S. Government to begin with.\n  Why on Earth would our taxpayer dollars be used to buy things \noverseas?\n  There are some commonsense reasons why that happens. Obviously, as I \nsaid, when you are buying something like food or fuel for the \nmilitary's use in Afghanistan or in Iraq, it makes sense to buy that \noverseas. If you can't find it\n\n[[Page S3921]]\n\nin the United States, if there is not a single contractor that makes \nwhat you are looking for in the United States, then, by all means, you \nare going to have to buy that overseas. If there is such a price \ndifferential, such an enormous price differential that it is a waste of \ntaxpayer dollars to buy it from American companies--and, frankly, those \nare fairly minute exceptions--then it makes sense to do a work-around \non the ``Buy American'' law.\n  But we have seen hundreds of billions of dollars in waivers, waivers \nthat are being used for reasons that you just can't justify but also \nthrough a process that includes really no oversight. On that waiver \nthat allows for goods to be purchased overseas when you can't find it \nin the United States, there are examples where a simple Google search \ncould have found the item in the United States, but a waiver was still \nsigned, allowing it to be bought overseas because it wasn't available \nhere--just no oversight, making sure we are only giving these waivers \nin the right circumstances.\n  I have talked a number of times on this floor about a company that \nfolded up shop in Waterbury, CT, a legacy company in the Naugatuck \nValley, Ansonia Copper & Brass. It made the copper nickel tubing for \nthe American submarine fleet. It was the only company in the United \nStates that made this particular item.\n  It is out of business today because of the loopholes in the ``Buy \nAmerican'' law. We are now buying our copper nickel tubing from a \nforeign company. Now, that put dozens of people out of work in \nConnecticut, but it also put in jeopardy our national security. If the \nsupplier of this copper nickel tubing, which is not something you can \nmake easily--it requires incredible expertise, complicated machinery. \nIf the country we are getting it from today decides they are not going \nto supply it to us because they oppose the way in which we are using \nit, we can't make it in the United States any longer. You can't just \nreassemble the ability to make that particular good, complicated tubing \nthat goes inside one of the most complicated pieces of machinery in the \nU.S. Navy, a submarine. You can't just do that overnight. So at the \nvery least, we should be getting all of the information we need to do \nproper oversight on this process of granting waivers.\n  I have been pleased at the willingness of Chairman McCain and his \nstaff, along with the ranking member Senator Reed, to work with us on \nthis amendment, this sunlight amendment, this disclosure amendment. \nHopefully, over the course of today or tomorrow, we will be able to \ninclude this in one of the managers' packages that we adopt on the \nSenate floor, and it will allow us to have a more robust conversation \nas to why on Earth we spent U.S. taxpayer dollars on this van, when $3 \nmillion--at the height of the auto crisis--could have gone to an \nAmerican company making a similar vehicle. That is a conversation that \non behalf of the literally hundreds of thousands of American workers \nwho don't have jobs today because we are spending taxpayer dollars \noverseas--for their sake, they deserve for us to have that debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner).

Mr. President, for years, we have witnessed Vladimir \nPutin, the President of Russia, wreak havoc across Europe. Putin has \ninvaded and carved up free, independent, and democratic countries, such \nas Georgia and Ukraine. He has bullied our friends in the European \nUnion. He has intimidated our allies in the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization, NATO. A principal weapon of Putin's has been Russia's \nenergy supplies--specifically, natural gas. Putin has used Russia's \nnatural gas to extort, to threaten, and to coerce our allies and our \npartners. He has repeatedly shut off natural gas supplies to Ukraine \nand has retaliated against countries that have come to Ukraine's aid.\n  So 21 countries--21 countries--import more than 40 percent of their \nnatural gas from Russia. Of these 21 nations, 13 are members of NATO \nand 5 of these NATO members import nearly 100 percent of their gas from \nRussia.\n  I recently returned from Eastern Europe. Our NATO allies and European \npartners are desperate to find alternative sources of natural gas. They \nare seeking to develop their own natural gas resources. But amazingly, \nPutin is funding activists who oppose hydraulic fracturing in Europe.\n  It is clear that Putin wants to keep our NATO allies dependent on \nRussian energy. Our NATO allies have publicly called on Congress to \nhelp them access America's natural gas. We can do that by adopting my \namendment, No. 1582. My amendment would help countries such as Ukraine, \nour NATO allies, and others access America's vast supplies of natural \ngas. Specifically, it would ensure that the Secretary of Energy makes \ntimely decisions on applications to export Liquefied Natural Gas, or \nLNG.\n  Under current law, exports of LNG to countries such as our NATO \nallies are presumed to be in the public interest, unless the Secretary \nfinds otherwise. But over the last several years, the Secretary's \ndecisionmaking process has been, at best, unpredictable. My amendment \nwould fix that. Specifically, my amendment would require the Secretary \nto approve or disapprove LNG export applications within 45 days after \nthe environmental review process is complete.\n  My amendment would ensure that legal challenges to LNG export \nprojects are resolved expeditiously. It would also require exporters to \npublicly disclose the countries to which LNG has been delivered.\n  In January of this year, the energy committee held a hearing on \nlegislation that is identical to my amendment. At that hearing, the \nDepartment of Energy testified that my legislation is ``a solution we \nwill be able to comply with.''\n  I am encouraged by DOD's support for this legislation. I am also \nencouraged by the support of the National Association of Manufacturers \nand others who testified that LNG exports would create thousands of \njobs across America and help reduce our Nation's trade deficit.\n  The United States is the world's largest producer of natural gas. We \nhave more than enough natural gas to meet our own needs and use our gas \nto bring about positive change throughout the world.\n\n[[Page S3922]]\n\n  Do not take my word for it. Listen to what the Obama administration \nhad to say. In February of this year, President Obama's Council of \nEconomic Advisers stated that ``an increase in U.S. exports of natural \ngas . . . would have a number of mostly beneficial effects on . . . \nemployment, U.S. geopolitical security, and the environment.''\n  The President's economic advisers said that LNG exports would create \ntens of thousands of jobs in the United States, jobs that ``would arise \n. . . in natural gas production[,] manufacturing [and] a range of \nsectors, including . . . infrastructure investment, and \ntransportation.''\n  The President's economic advisers also stated that U.S. LNG exports \nwould have ``a positive geopolitical impact for the United States.'' \nSpecifically, they explained that U.S. LNG ``builds liquidity in the \nglobal natural gas market, and reduces European dependence on the \ncurrent primary suppliers, Russia and Iran.''\n  Again, these are not my words. This is from the White House.\n  Mr. President, Congress has a choice: We can watch Putin use natural \ngas as a weapon against our allies and partners or we can take a \nmeaningful step to help our friends.\n  My amendment boosts the security of our NATO allies and friends \naround the world, and it does so through a peaceful means. It doesn't \nspend American tax dollars and all the while will help to grow \nAmerica's economy. It is a commonsense amendment, and I ask all of the \nMembers to support it.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about recent \ndevelopments in Sri Lanka where the new government of President \nMaithrapala Sirisena has taken several important and encouraging steps \nto promote good governance, human rights, and reconciliation since his \nelection on January 8.\n  Among the government's initial accomplishments are the adoption of \nthe 19th Amendment to the Constitution, which curtails the extensive \npowers enjoyed by the executive and vests more power in the Parliament, \nlimits the Presidential term to 5 years instead of 6, allows the \nPresident to hold office only for two terms instead of an unlimited \nnumber of terms, and provides for a Constitutional Council to make \nappointments to independent commissions on the judiciary, police, \npublic service, elections, and audit, instead of the President as was \npreviously the case. In addition, the right to information has been \nincluded as a fundamental right in the Constitution.\n  Sri Lanka's Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera has wisely called \nthe attention of the Parliament to the need to review the individuals \nand entities that were listed under a U.N. regulation pursuant to U.N. \nSecurity Council Resolution 1373, adopted shortly after the 9/11 \nattacks. The regulation was used to ban several Tamil diaspora groups \nfor their alleged links to the LTTE. However, the new government \nreportedly believes that some individuals and organizations may have \nbeen wrongly accused of terrorist links when they were merely \nadvocating in support of their rights. The government intends to review \nthe list in the interest of reconciliation and reaffirming its \ncommitment to freedom of expression.\n  I am also encouraged that the government has revived its relationship \nwith the United Nations, including with the U.N. Human Rights Council, \nand has invited the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit \nSri Lanka. I hope such a visit takes place soon.\n  The Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation \nand guarantees of non-recurrence visited Sri Lanka in March-April 2015, \nand I understand that the Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary \nDisappearances will visit Sri Lanka in August.\n  For years, impunity for serious crimes has been the norm in Sri \nLanka. The government is working to establish what it describes as a \n``domestic mechanism'' to deal with accountability for human rights \nviolations. A purely domestic mechanism, however, is not likely to be \nsufficient. The Sri Lankan people, the United States and other \ngovernments, the United Nations, and international human rights groups \nhave long called for justice for the victims of atrocities committed by \nthe armed forces and the LTTE during the 30-year conflict. It is \nessential that the justice process is not only about truth telling, but \nis a credible, independent mechanism with authority to investigate, \nprosecute, and appropriately punish those responsible for war crimes \nand crimes against humanity, on both sides.\n  It is also important to the development of a credible accountability \nmechanism and to the success of this endeavor that Sri Lankan officials \nconsult with local civil society organizations, including the families \nof the war's victims. They should also invite international bodies, \nsuch as the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, to \ntake part in this process, to provide technical assistance as well as \nsubstantive input and help with prosecutorial work, evidence-gathering, \nand judicial decision-making. A hybrid mechanism, with international \nexperts involved at the prosecutorial and judicial level, will help \nensure that the failings and cynicism associated with past domestic \naccountability mechanisms are not repeated.\n  I am told that the government intends to work with humanitarian \norganizations on the issue of missing persons, including forensics, and \nto resolve the cases of remaining detainees. The United States and \nother international groups could assist this important humanitarian \neffort.\n  Under the government of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Armed \nForces day was ``Victory Day'', a divisive, provocative celebration for \nthe Sinhalese majority. President Sirisena, in his Armed Forces Day \nspeech on May 19, said the policy of the new government will be \n``development and reconciliation'', making clear the government's \nrecognition that development projects alone will not heal the wounds \nand scars of the past. He also affirmed that the reconciliation process \nmust involve truth seeking, justice, eliminating fear and suspicion \namong all communities and building trust among them, as well as the \nrebuilding of infrastructure. He expressed confidence that the Armed \nForces would now dedicate themselves to the government's policy on \nreconciliation.\n  The return of land in the north and east currently occupied by the \nArmed Forces, and the resettlement of Tamils displaced by the war and \nthe provision of basic services, is an urgent necessity. Some land in \nthe east that had been allocated by the previous government for \ninfrastructure projects has been released by President Sirisena for the \nresettlement of the displaced, and a small amount of land in the north \nhas been provided to civilians who were uprooted by the war. But this \nis only a beginning. Sri Lanka is at peace, so it is time for the Armed \nForces to return land, support the resettlement of families, and focus \non external threats rather than domestic policing.\n  Unlike the previous government which vilified its critics and locked \nup after sham trials journalists who exposed corruption, President \nSirisena has taken steps to reaffirm freedom of the press by unblocking \nmedia websites, inviting exiled journalists to return to the country, \nand ensuring freedom of expression for the media to operate without \nfear of reprisal.\n  Under the previous government, Sri Lanka's judicial system was \npoliticized, manipulated, and corrupted. The new government is taking \nsteps to reestablish the independence of the judiciary, which is \nfundamental to any democracy. Also significant was the appointment of \nthe Chief Justice who is from the minority Tamil community immediately \nafter the election of the new government.\n  The government has committed to fight corruption and ensure \naccountability for financial crimes even for the\n\n[[Page S3923]]\n\nmost influential and powerful individuals, to end impunity at any \nlevel. It has established a Stolen Assets Recovery Task Force for this \npurpose. The United States is prepared to assist these efforts and \nthose of civil society to combat corruption.\n  These are very encouraging steps for which we should commend \nPresident Sirisena. They should have been carried out by the previous \ngovernment, but instead former President Rajapaksa and his brothers \nBasil and Gotabhaya, and their close associates, sought to dismantle \nthe institutions of democracy, subvert the rule of law, and enrich \nthemselves. Rather than support reconciliation, they encouraged \ncorruption and exacerbated ethnic, religious, and political divisions.\n  Of course, these are only first steps, and there have been others \nthat raise questions about the government's intentions. For example, MG \nJagath Dias, who was appointed the new Army Chief of Staff, commanded a \nregiment that took part in the final battles of the war that were \nmarked by widespread abuses including summary executions of prisoners \nand in which countless civilians died, reportedly from government \nartillery shelling. If the Sri Lankan government is serious about \naddressing the crimes of the past it will need to take up allegations \nagainst senior officers like General Dias. Failing to address the role \nof senior military commanders, in particular those who still serve, \nwould seriously weaken the government's credibility.\n  Most immediately, the government's challenge is to hold parliamentary \nelections as soon as possible. Once a new Parliament is in place the \nprocesses of reconciliation, reconstruction, reform, and accountability \ncan proceed apace.\n  After the elections, President Sirisena's government will need to \nwork closely with the United Nations on plans to address the legacy of \npast abuses. The U.N. Human Rights Council is expected to take up this \nissue in its September session in Geneva. Thus, the Office of the U.N. \nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights needs to release its report before \nthen, as called for by the U.N. Human Rights Council, with \nrecommendations for Sri Lanka and the international community on how \nbest to achieve accountability in Sri Lanka. The government should wait \nuntil the U.N. report is issued before finalizing its own plans.\n  Secretary of State Kerry's visit to Sri Lanka just 4 months after \nPresident Sirisena's election was not only symbolic of the revival of \nrelations between our countries, but also illustrative of the Sri \nLankan Government's efforts to realign its foreign relations more \nbroadly. Over the last 6 years, the Obama administration has \ndemonstrated leadership within the international community in \naddressing a range of issues in Sri Lanka. The administration's policy \nshould follow the same trajectory and continue to play a leadership \nrole.\n  Likewise, the U.S. Congress has long sought to support democracy, \ndevelopment, human rights, and the rule of law in Sri Lanka. A close \nfriend of mine, the late James W. Spain, one of our most able \ndiplomats, served as our Ambassador in Colombo from 1985 to 1988. He \nwas a devoted friend of Sri Lanka. I look forward to doing what I can \nto assist the Secretary and the Sirisena government, on behalf of all \nthe people of Sri Lanka, in the months ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/09/senate-section/article/S3923-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3923-S3924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         IRAQ WAR'S IMPACT ON CURRENT NATIONAL SECURITY THREATS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have the benefit of looking through the \nlens of history to learn from past mistakes in the hopes of making more \ninformed decisions for the future. No example is more relevant today \nthan the unintended effects of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and their \nbearing on the threats of today. I opposed that war from the beginning, \nand we have paid, and continue to pay, a tremendous price--in American \nlives, in the unfathomable expense of taxpayer dollars, and in the \nescalation of strife in that region, and beyond.\n  There is no doubt that the terrorists of the Islamic State of Iraq \nand the Levant, ISIL, have emerged from Al Qaeda in Iraq, seizing upon \ninstability, weak institutions, ethnic fractions, and general hostility \ntoward Western forces that resulted from the post-9/11 Iraq invasion. \nOur personnel, allies, and interests abroad face significant threats \nfrom this terrorist group, which have arisen out of the ill-conceived \ninvasion of Iraq.\n  We can be proud of the bravery, dedication, and sacrifice of our \nsoldiers and their families. They are not at fault for the complex \nsituation in which we now find ourselves. They served our Nation \ndutifully, and for that we are grateful. Rather, it serves as a \nreminder that policymakers cannot act recklessly--especially when \ntaking military action. As we continue to address the very real threat \nthat is ISIL, it is astounding to me how far in the past the hard \nlessons we learned now appear to be to some commentators and \npolicymakers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a perceptive and well-written analysis \non this subject, written by the distinguished journalist and former \nforeign correspondent Barrie Dunsmore, that was published in the \nRutland Herald and the Montpelier (Barre) Times Argus on May 24, 2015, \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n [From the Rutland Herald and the Montpelier (Barre) Times Argus; May \n                               24, 2015]\n\n                             Short Memories\n\n                          (By Barrie Dunsmore)\n\n       ``I am running because I think the world is falling \n     apart,'' Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said this past \n     week. Senator Graham is not alone among the many aspiring \n     Republican presidential candidates. Not only do they want us \n     to believe the world is falling apart. They also want us to \n     believe it's not their fault.\n       As Robert Costa wrote in the Washington Post, ``One by one, \n     nearly a dozen GOP hopefuls took the stage (in Des Moines \n     Iowa) for a Lincoln dinner, each different in style and \n     stature but all joining a rising Republican chorus that lays \n     blame for the Islamic State terrorist group squarely at the \n     feet of President Barack Obama.'' Senator Lindsey Graham said \n     to cheers, ``If you fought in Iraq, it worked. It's not your \n     fault it's going to hell. It's Obama's fault.''\n       The Islamic State is but one of the Middle East's problems \n     of recent years. The hopes for a more democratic region \n     engendered by the Arab Spring, have been dashed. Egypt is now \n     more of a military dictatorship than it was under President \n     Hosni Mubarak. Without dictator Muammar Gaddafi, Libya is now \n     awash with weapons, without a functioning government and \n     ruled by tribes. Syria is still in the throes of a three year \n     unresolved civil war, with an estimated 150,000, dead. As \n     Iran and Saudi Arabia violently vie for dominance in Lebanon, \n     Syria, Iraq and Yemen, indisputably the Middle East is more \n     unstable than it was seven years ago.\n       Yet just as the world economy was in a deep depression \n     after the market crash of '08, when Obama took office so too \n     was the Middle East in turmoil--mostly because of the 2003 \n     American invasion of Iraq.\n       As they seek to shift the blame of Iraq, which just last \n     year conservative pundit George Will wrote was ``the worst \n     foreign policy decision in U.S. history,'' Republicans are \n     asking us to forget the past. I don't doubt that some already \n     have. In the era of Twitter, YouTube and Instagram, seven \n     years may seem like an eternity. But not everyone will \n     forget.\n       Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush found this out on a recent \n     campaign stop, when Ivy Ziedrich, a Nevada college student \n     confronted him with the charge, ``Your brother created \n     ISIS.'' Bush's response was, ``ISIS didn't exist when my \n     brother was president.''\n       It is accurate that the name Islamic State was not in use \n     during the George W. Bush presidency. But the movement that \n     later became ISIS was a direct result of the American \n     invasion. That group called itself ``al Qaida in Iraq.'' It \n     was led by the fanatic Abu Musab al-Zarkawi, and was \n     responsible for hundreds of bombings, kidnappings and \n     beheadings--yes beheadings--in a reign of terror which made \n     Zarqawi the most wanted man in Iraq. His goal was to rid Iraq \n     of foreign forces, and to provoke sectarian conflict between \n     Iraq's Shiite majority and his own Sunni Muslim sect.\n       Zarqawi was killed in an American bombing raid in 2006. But \n     nine years ago, the Washington Post reported, ``Analysts \n     warned that his death may not stem the tide of the insurgency \n     and violence. . . . Zarqawi set up numerous semi-autonomous \n     terrorist cells across Iraq, many of which could continue \n     after his death.''\n       Indeed they did. And joined by numerous bitter Sunni \n     officers from Saddam Hussein's army, al-Qaida in Iraq \n     eventually morphed into the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria \n     (ISIS.) Its current leader is an Iraqi named Abu Bakr al \n     Baghdadi, who claims to be the caliph (supreme leader) of the \n     new Islamic State.\n       But ISIS is by no means the only bi-product of the American \n     invasion of Iraq. When Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his \n     Sunni dominated regime were overthrown by American military \n     might, there were no happier people than the Shiite mullahs \n     of Iran. Saddam had initiated the bloody eight\n\n[[Page S3924]]\n\n     year Iran-Iraq war. Without Saddam on its border to worry \n     about, Iran was now free to encourage the Iraqi Shiite \n     majority to assume power over their Sunni and Kurdish \n     minorities. Thus a Shiite led Iraq became a major ally of \n     Iran in its power struggle with Sunni Saudi Arabia. And that \n     Sunni-Shiite battle for regional domination is at the root of \n     most of the current sectarian violence in the Middle East.\n       (This reminds me of the credibly sourced story that \n     surfaced years ago. Evidently after meeting with the \n     president on the eve of the Iraq invasion, one of the Iraqi \n     exiles who strongly encouraged American intervention was \n     nevertheless shocked that Mr. Bush did not seem to understand \n     the difference between Sunnis and Shiites.)\n       But let's set aside all this troublesome history. What is \n     it that Republicans want to do--in the future--to resolve the \n     problem of the Islamic State?\n       Most of them apparently feel that in 2016, American voters \n     will want their president to get really tough with ISIS. So \n     far, the rhetoric has been overblown and viable alternatives \n     seem in short supply.\n       Senator Marco Rubio (R-FLA), when speaking to the Freedom \n     Forum of South Carolina, used a line from the movie \n     ``Taken'', in explaining what he would do with the \n     terrorists. ``We will look for you. We will find you. And we \n     will kill you.''\n       Former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania said at a \n     recent meeting in Iowa. ``They want to bring back the 7th \n     century of jihad. So here's my suggestion: We load up our \n     bombers, and we bomb them back to the 7th century.''\n       Senator Graham and most of the other candidates, seem once \n     again to be under the sway of the same neo-conservative, \n     tough-guy thinking that gave us the Iraq War. Presidential \n     wannabes might want to take a closer look at that war--eight \n     years of fighting, at one point with 162,000 U.S. troops on \n     the ground and substantial air and naval support nearby. The \n     cost was at least $2 trillion, nearly 4500 Americans killed \n     and hundreds of thousands seriously wounded. Yet with all \n     that military might and its enormous costs, the United States \n     did not prevail.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/09/senate-section/article/S3924-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF BOY SCOUT TROOP 6 OF BARRINGTON, \n                              RHODE ISLAND\n\n Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, as the Boy Scout Law tells us, \n``A Scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, \nobedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent.'' These values \nare always worth remembering. Even 8 out of 12 is an achievement. We \nall know people who don't get to six on their best day.\n  For 50 years, boys and young men have built these important traits \nunder the direction of Boy Scout Troop 6 from Barrington, RI, part of \nthe Narragansett Council of the Boy Scouts of America. The programs and \ntraditions of Troop 6 help Scouts build moral fiber, engender \nresponsible citizenship, and develop maturity and physical fitness.\n  Over the years, the troop has organized or participated in countless \nactivities that have helped the community at large. Scouts from Troop 6 \nBarrington carry out a community service project every month, including \nworking with the Barrington Land Conservation Trust to clear hiking \ntrails, contributing food and labor to food drives across New England, \nand assisting numerous nonprofit organizations throughout Rhode Island.\n  More than 100 Scouts from Troop 6 have earned the rank of Eagle \nScout, the highest achievement in Scouting. They have distinguished \nthemselves as community leaders, service volunteers, and mentors for \ntheir peers.\n  As Boy Scouts of America president Dr. Robert M. Gates put it last \nmonth in his address to the Boys Scouts National Annual Business \nMeeting, ``Every day, in every community in America, scouting is \nchanging the lives of boys and young men teaching them skills and \nleadership, helping them build character and integrity.'' Thanks to its \nmany dedicated leaders, parents, and volunteers, Troop 6 has provided \nboys in Barrington with valuable tools and lifelong leadership skills \nfor a half century.\n  I congratulate all the Scouts of Boy Scout Troop 6 and their families \non this special anniversary, and I am grateful for their outstanding \ncommitment to their community, to the State of Rhode Island, and to our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a list of Eagle Scouts, Scoutmasters, and \ncommittee chairmen of Troop 6 be printed in the Record.\n  The list follows:\n\n\n    EAGLE SCOUTS FROM TROOP 6, BARRINGTON, RHODE ISLAND (1973-2015)\n\n       James Pazera, Frederick Kennemar, Norman Mahoney, Kenneth \n     Pazera, Kurt Sorenson, Richard Farynyk, Steven M.

Mr. President, I stand before you today in solemn \nremembrance of Lawrence Gould, a founding member of Camp Sunshine, \nwhich is a truly remarkable and transformative sanctuary for children \nwith life-threatening illnesses and their families. The camp has \nbrought respite, support, hope, and joy to thousands of families for \nover three decades and will continue to do so for years to come. The \nState of Maine has lost a man of true integrity; Larry was 84.\n  Larry was an exceptionally intelligent and hard-working man who found \ncountless successes in life. Equipped with a Ph.D. from the \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology at the age of 24, he went on to \nbecome president, chairman, and CEO of M/A-Com, Inc., a Fortune 500 \ncompany. After establishing himself as a prominent and distinguished \nbusinessman, Larry developed Point Sebago Resort, in Casco, ME--\nconsidered the first resort campground in the country.\n  Upon stepping down as chair of M/A-Com, Inc. in 1983, Larry and his \nwife Anna sought to share their successes with others and turned their \ndedication and devotion to charitable endeavors. A year later, Point \nSebago Resort opened its doors to 43 children and their families, and \nthe program was met with resounding enthusiasm from its pilot \nparticipants. Thus Camp Sunshine was created.\n  Over the years, more and more medical centers began referring their \npatients to Camp Sunshine. The camp's extraordinary emotional and \nmedical support played a momentous role in the well-being of the \nchildren who spent their summers on the shores of Lake Sebago. As the \ncamp became\n\n[[Page S3925]]\n\nwidely revered in the medical community, Larry knew he needed to expand \nand find a permanent home for Camp Sunshine. In 2001, the Goulds \ndonated 24 acres of land adjacent to Point Sebago. Camp Sunshine was \nnow open year-round. Since then, the Goulds have continued to \nstrengthen Camp Sunshine's services while ensuring that their families \ncan attend free of charge.\n  Larry's idea for a camp that provides respite and psychosocial \nsupport for sick children was the first of its kind in the United \nStates and is emblematic of his nature as a visionary philanthropist. \nHis passion for improving the lives of those children and families who \nhave stayed at Camp Sunshine is felt by all who knew him. In continuing \nto carry out Larry's mission, I am sure that Camp Sunshine's dedicated \nstaff will also carry on his earnest enthusiasm for helping those \naround him.\n  Through his tireless efforts, Larry affected countless lives. I am \ndeeply saddened by his passing, but I know that the impact of his work \ntranscends life. His firm devotion to the betterment and care of Camp \nSunshine's children will never be forgotten. I, along with all the \npeople of Maine, am thankful for his immeasurable contributions to our \nState and the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/09/senate-section/article/S3925-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXECUTIVE REPORTS OF COMMITTEE\n\n  The following executive reports of nominations were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. ISAKSON for the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n       *LaVerne Horton Council, of New Jersey, to be an Assistant \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs (Information and Technology).\n       *David J.

A bill to reform the provision of health insurance coverage \nby promoting health savings accounts, State-based alternatives to \ncoverage under the Affordable Care Act, and price transparency, in \norder to promote a more market-based health care system, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, the Supreme Court is about to rule on \nKing v. Burwell. This decision is a question of a plain reading of the \nlaw, which is that subsidies shall only be given to those who reside in \nStates which have established State exchanges. That is the plain \nreading of the law. The administration maintains that, no, ``States'' \ndoesn't mean ``States,'' but, rather, it can be an exchange set up \neither by the State or the Federal Government.\n  Presuming the Supreme Court decides that a plain reading of the law \nis correct--that for a resident of a State to receive a subsidy, they \nhave to reside in a State that has established an exchange--there are \n37 States in which those currently receiving subsidies will lose their \nsubsidies. This is important because under ObamaCare we have seen a \ndramatic increase in the cost of health insurance premiums. So many \npeople who formerly would have been able to afford an insurance premium \nno longer can without the subsidy. What this means for that person in a \nState such as Louisiana is there will be someone in the middle of \nchemotherapy who can no longer afford their insurance without a \nsubsidy. The insurance has been made so high because of ObamaCare that \nthat patient is no longer able to afford her insurance and she is at \nrisk of losing her coverage because the administration illegally \nimplemented the law.\n  This is where we are going into the Supreme Court decision. Let me \nkind of now start on a different tack.\n  The President's health care law, ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act, \nhas continued to be singularly unpopular. A recent ABC poll showed that \nonly 39 percent of Americans approved of the law. That is an alltime \nlow--10 percent lower than it has been.\n  One can ask why it would be unpopular and why it would be \nparticularly unpopular now. I think the reason it is unpopular in \ngeneral is that ObamaCare is a coercive Federal Government program, \nthat if you don't bend your will to the Federal Government, the Federal \nGovernment will penalize you. That is not how Americans view their \nrelationship to the Federal Government. We don't expect the government \nto tell us what to do. There might be income taxes, which we pay, and \nthere will be drafts in times of war, such as World War II, but in \ngeneral, aside from those two things, the Federal Government should \njust stay out of our lives. In this case--ObamaCare--the Federal \nGovernment gets right in the middle of that which is most personal, and \nthat is our health care.\n  I think the reason ObamaCare is particularly unpopular now is because \nof the premium increases that have resulted because of ObamaCare. Here \nare\n\n[[Page S3929]]\n\nsome headlines: CNN, ``Obamacare sticker shock: Big rate hikes proposed \nfor 2016''; AP, ``Many health insurers go big with initial 2016 rate \nrequests''; AP again, ``8 Minnesota Health Plans Propose Big Premium \nHikes for 2016''; the New York Times, ``In Vermont, Frustrations Mount \nOver Affordable Care Act''; and the Washington Post, ``Almost half of \nObamacare exchanges face financial struggles in the future.''\n  In my own State, insurers are asking for 20 percent increases, and \nthis is on top of premium increases that have resulted from the \nprevious few years.\n  Indeed, the President likes to speak about how health care costs \nunder ObamaCare have mitigated--health care costs. Actually, that began \nin 2007 before ObamaCare passed. But since ObamaCare passed, it has \nbeen true. Health care costs have not risen as they did in the past. \nHealth insurance costs have gone up dramatically. The remarkable story \nof ObamaCare is that there is now no relationship between health \ninsurance cost and health care cost. The insurance companies, with the \nregulations imposed by ObamaCare, are charging far more for insurance \nthan one would expect because of the health care costs. Of course, the \nPresident chooses to speak of the cost of care, not the cost of \npremiums, but for the average person, it is the cost of premiums which \nis making her so frustrated with this law.\n  That brings us back to King v. Burwell. At this point, I am offering \ntoday, along with several original cosponsors, what we call the Patient \nFreedom Act. We give patients the power which ObamaCare took from them, \nand we give them the power by lowering the cost. We lower the cost by \neliminating the mandates that are part of ObamaCare. We return power \nover insurance to the States, with the rationale that she who governs \nbest governs closest to those who are governed. The insurance \ncommissioner in that State should be able to decide what the person in \ntheir State wishes to have for their policy, not a Washington \nbureaucrat. And we give patients knowledge. We give them price \ntransparency. They should know the cost of something that is ordered \nfor them before they have the procedure performed as opposed to \nlearning afterward. We give them portability, and we give them \nprotection against preexisting conditions.\n  I and others--I think the Presiding Officer as well--have campaigned \nfor several cycles that we were going to repeal and replace ObamaCare. \nIn this situation, the Supreme Court will repeal a portion of \nObamaCare--not all but a portion--in 37 States, and this is the plan \nthat will replace that portion of ObamaCare which is repealed.\n  We like to look at it this way. We begin to plant the seeds. Now, in \nthose 37 States, those 8 million people affected by the Obama \nadministration's illegal implementation of the subsidy law--we make it \nbetter for them. We plant the seeds so that over time other aspects and \neventually the entirety of ObamaCare will be replaced with something \nwhich gives the patient the power as opposed to a Washington \nbureaucrat.\n  Let me lay out what we do. King v. Burwell goes against the \nadministration. The Supreme Court rules that the law has been \nimplemented illegally. States will then have a choice: They can either \nestablish a State exchange if they wish for the status quo of \nObamaCare, the State can do nothing, which means in that State all of \nObamaCare goes away for the private insurance market, or they can \nchoose the Patient Freedom Act, which is the market-based reform that \nwe think gives the patient the power and not the bureaucrat.\n  Now let me compare the two. I mentioned how under the Patient Freedom \nAct costs are lowered by repealing mandates. For example, under \nObamaCare there is an individual mandate with a coercive penalty. The \nPatient Freedom Act does not have one. There is an employer mandate \npenalty. Yes, under ObamaCare the employer is penalized; under the \nPatient Freedom Act, no. There is the Federal essential health benefits \nmandate. Under ObamaCare, a Washington bureaucrat tells somebody that \nwhich they must purchase. In the Patient Freedom Act, we return that to \nthe State insurance commissioner. We do not have these mandates. I can \ngo on down the list, but the reality is that ObamaCare, coercive \nmandates; the Patient Freedom Act, no.\n  The money we make available to the States we take from the tax \ncredits that ObamaCare would give to those in the State--those who are \neligible and signed up--we take the Medicaid funding that would be \navailable in the State for Medicaid expansion, and we combine those two \nfor the total allocation that will go to that State.\n  Now, some would say: Wait a second. The Federal Government should not \nbe in the business of helping people with health insurance. I say the \nFederal Government is deeply in that business already. If you look \nunder public insurance, there is Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, VA, TRICARE, \nand on and on where the Federal Government is providing health care \nbenefits for a substantial portion--over 25 percent--of Americans. \nThese are those Americans who get their insurance through the employer-\nsponsored insurance, where the employer and the employee can contribute \nto their insurance but they get a tax break on the purchase. That tax \nbreak averages about $1,700. We are speaking about that remaining group \nwho purchases their insurance for themselves. We lower their cost by \nequalizing the tax treatment between the two. It is the same sort of \ntax break that those with the employer-sponsored insurance receive. We \nwill now offer that same tax break to these folks and in so doing \nachieve that conservative goal of equalizing the tax treatment of those \npurchasing employer-sponsored insurance as opposed to purchasing on \ntheir own.\n  The funding goes to the patient. I am a doctor. I have been working \nin a public hospital system for 25 years. I learned working as a \nphysician in both the private setting but also principally in the \npublic hospital setting that whoever controls the dollar has the \npower. That makes no sense whatsoever. It is one of the major flaws in \nObamaCare. Since these subsidies are based upon estimated earnings that \nare later reconciled through tax returns, Americans are facing onerous \ntax liabilities and penalties as a consequence.\n\n  Let me explain further how this wage-lock occurs, because \nincreasingly Americans are going to be running into this problem. Let \nme give you an example. Last year, the least expensive premium for a \nsilver plan to cover a 50-year-old individual in Aroostook County, ME, \ncost $6,300 through an Affordable Care Act exchange. But that, \nobviously, is not what most individuals pay. Instead, they receive a \nsubsidy that phases out based on their estimated income. But again, the \nsubsidy completely disappears at a sharp cliff at 400 percent of the \nFederal poverty level.\n  An individual whose estimated income is just less than this cliff, \nsay, one that is earning $46,500, will pay 9.5 percent of his or her \nincome, or $4,370, for insurance and the rest is covered by the Federal \ntax credits. But if it turns out that this individual actually made a \nbit more than 400 percent of the Federal poverty level--let's say the \nindividual made $47,000--then, he or she would be on the hook for the \nentire $6,300 premium. In other words, a 50-year-old who makes just \n$500 more than he or she estimated will have to pay $2,000 more at tax \ntime for health insurance in the exchange.\n  Think about what this means for a self-employed individual whose \nincome fluctuates not only from year to year but from month to month. \nThis is a financial nightmare to try to figure out.\n  This cliff does not just affect individuals who get their coverage \nthrough the ACA. Cliffs appear over and over in the design of the \nsubsidies under ObamaCare, and couples and families will face them at \ndifferent levels of income as their household size changes. What will \nthese bait-and-switch health insurance premiums do to incentives to \nwork harder, to earn more, to accept promotions? If you accept a \npromotion at work and then your income goes over that magic 400 percent \nof poverty threshold, you are going to lose your entire subsidy. You \nmight well decide to turn down that raise at work or that opportunity \nto be promoted to a better job. What kind of system has been designed \nto discourage people from moving ahead in the workplace?\n\n[[Page S3930]]\n\n  In the State of Maine, so far we have learned that at least 1,000 \nMaine families have lost their subsidies completely because they were \nin that situation where their income went over that threshold. Another \n1,000 Mainers are finding out that they are losing part of their \nsubsidy and are going to be on the hook for paying more money.\n  I will say to my colleagues that you are going to start hearing this \nin your States, and it particularly is going to affect people who are \nself-employed and who have to estimate what their income is going to \nbe. Through no fault of their own--unless they are going to turn down \nwork--they may well go over the threshold amount and lose their subsidy \naltogether. Remember, it takes just $1 in additional earnings at the \n400 percent of poverty level to lose your subsidy altogether.\n  Let me give you an example of a Maine couple who contacted my office. \nThey discovered to their horror that when they filed their taxes, they \nhad earned more than the threshold and they owed $13,000 to the IRS for \nthe health insurance they received through the ObamaCare exchange, on \ntop of the $4,000 that they had been told their exchange coverage would \ncost.\n  Imagine finding out that because you worked a little harder, because \nyou earned a bit more money, you now unexpectedly owe an extra $13,000 \nto the IRS because you lost your subsidy. The Patient Freedom Act would \nput an end to the bait-and-switch premiums that are built into the \nObamaCare exchanges.\n  One of the reasons I opposed the Affordable Care Act was that there \nwas nothing affordable about it. I predicted at the time that it would \nlead to fewer choices and higher insurance costs for many middle-income \nAmericans and small businesses.\n  A ruling in favor of the plaintiffs in King v. Burwell would prompt \nCongress to protect those who would lose their subsidies, but it would \nalso provide the opportunity to give States the option to replace the \nAffordable Care Act's poorly crafted mandates with patient-directed \nreforms that contain costs, provide more choices, and still provide \nassistance to those who need it most.\n  The Patient Freedom Act does exactly that. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  Now, if it is a bureaucrat who controls that dollar, then the \nbureaucrat will dictate the type of facility the patient is seen in. If \nthe patient controls the dollar, the hospitals are going to compete for \nher business, and she dictates the type of facility in which she is \nseen. So in the Patient Freedom Act, the money goes directly to the \npatient. It can go through the State. The money can be granted to the \nState on a per-patient enrolled grant type; and in so doing, the State \nwould then distribute--and there are advantages for the State to do the \ndistribution--or, if the State does not want that responsibility, it \ncan be a Federal tax credit that goes into a health savings account \nthat the patient controls. But either way, the patient controls the \ndollar. The patient has the power, not a bureaucrat.\n  Here is a brief example of how it will work: Here is the health \nsavings deposit that goes into a health savings account. There will be \nsome reforms in the bill that allow the patient to either use it as her \ncontribution--as the employee's contribution on a employer-sponsored \nplan. She can directly contract with a provider network. She can \npurchase commercial insurance or, if she does nothing, the State has \nthe option of creating a system, where someone is enrolled unless they \nchoose not to be.\n  Again, I am going to call upon my experience as a physician. Think of \na person who might be schizophrenic, homeless, living beneath a bridge. \nHe is never going to do what ObamaCare mandates, which is to get on the \nInternet and fill out a 16-page form. It is just not going to happen. I \nhave been there, I have done that. I have been in the ER in the middle \nof the night when a patient has come in with some acute medical or \ntrauma condition. Under this system, though, the State could have this \nperson enrolled unless they choose not to be.\n  So with the health savings account, they would have first-dollar \ncoverage for a visit should they decide to go into an outpatient clinic \nfor a foot that was infected. If they have some major issue and they \nare brought to the hospital, the catastrophic policy would then give \nthem the coverage for that hospitalization but also protect the \nhospital, the doctors, and other providers from taking a total loss--\nwhich, by the way, society ends up paying for--because they have no \ncoverage for that hospitalization. So with this system, we can achieve \nhigher enrollments than are achieved under ObamaCare.\n  Last, let me talk about one more way in which we think patients will \nhave the power. One, they will have power portability. Every year, in \nan open enrollment season, if the patient wishes to change plans, she \nmay, without penalty. Secondly, she will be protected against \npreexisting conditions. The only rating that will be required for \npremiums will be for geography and age. A 57-year-old will get a bigger \ncredit than a 20-year-old. But aside from age and, again, geographic--\nbecause it is more expensive to receive care in Manhattan, NY, than \nManhattan, KS--that will be the only differences allowed. Lastly, there \nwill be the power of price transparency.\n  Currently, a woman goes in with her daughter, the doctor orders a CT \nscan, and the patient has no clue what the cost of that CT scan is. \nNow, it can be anywhere from $250 to $2,500 or more. I pick those \nnumbers because the LA Times had an article a couple years ago, they \nfound that the difference in cash price for CT scans was $250 to \n$2,500. The only way someone could know is if they were an \ninvestigative reporter and able to find out, not if you are a mom with \na sick child who needed a CT scan. For me, it is going to be great when \nthe mother can take her smart phone, scan a QR code, and pull up \nsomething which says: CT scan $250 here, $2,500 there. I am going to \nmake my decision based on some combination of cost, quality, and \nconvenience. I will pick based upon my values on where to go. It is not \na Washington bureaucrat, it is a mother who is going to make that \ndecision.\n  Again, continuous coverage protects those with preexisting \nconditions, and we mentioned the price transparency. In this way, \nRepublicans will give States the option to choose. Again, they can stay \nin ObamaCare if they want. They have that option now. They can do \nnothing, and it goes away if the Supreme Court rules that the subsidies \nhave been implemented illegally or they can go with the Patient Freedom \nAct--the Patient Freedom Act--which gives patients the power by \nlowering costs, lowering the cost by eliminating mandates, returning \npower over insurance back to the commissioners who govern closest to \nthose who actually will be using the insurance, and then giving the \npatient the power of portability, protection against preexisting \nconditions, and the power of price transparency.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me begin my remarks this evening by \ncommending my friend and colleague the Senator from Louisiana for \ncoming up with a creative and comprehensive health care bill that I am \npleased to cosponsor.\n  As a physician, Senator Cassidy knows far better than most of us in \nthis body what it is like to deliver health care and has made a real \neffort to come up with a public policy response in anticipation of the \nSupreme Court's decision in King v. Burwell, which is expected to be \nhanded down later this month. So I thank him for his work and his \ncreativity in tackling a very complex issue.\n  As I mentioned, later this month, the Court is expected to rule in \nKing v. Burwell, a case challenging the availability of premium tax \ncredits under the Affordable Care Act in the 37 States that have not \nestablished a State-run health insurance exchange.\n  If the Supreme Court rules in favor of the plaintiffs, as many \nexperts expect it will, 6.4 million Americans who are now receiving \npremium tax credits through the federally run exchanges will lose their \nsubsidies, and, as a result, their health insurance may well become \nunaffordable. This includes almost 61,000 people in my State of Maine.\n  Such a decision will place responsibility on Congress and the \nPresident to work together to protect those individuals. Senator \nCassidy and I believe we can do this by extending the current subsidies \nfor a transition period, as contemplated by the sense-of-Congress\n\n[[Page S3931]]\n\nlanguage included in the Patient Freedom Act that we are introducing \ntoday.\n  But the Supreme Court's decision will also invite us to think anew \nabout how to ensure that all Americans have access to affordable, high-\nquality health care. We can advance this goal by revamping and \nreforming the Affordable Care Act to improve the quality and \naffordability of health care while retaining the insurance market \nreforms that are so important to consumers.\n  Senator Cassidy's Patient Freedom Act is precisely the type of new \nthinking we need. As the title of this bill suggests, the Patient \nFreedom Act is built on the premise that freeing people to take charge \nof their health care is superior to the one-size-fits-all approach of \nObamaCare. A decision for the plaintiffs in King v. Burwell would \nessentially leave States with two options, absent congressional action. \nThey could either set up a State-run exchange to ensure that their \nresidents have access to the Affordable Care Act subsidies or do \nnothing and allow their residents to lose these ObamaCare subsidies. \nUnder Senator Cassidy's bill, however, States with federally run \nexchanges would have a third option. They would have the choice of \nparticipating in the new Patient Freedom Act.\n  Participating in the Patient Freedom Act would allow States to \nstructure their health insurance market without an individual mandate \nor an employer mandate or many of the other expensive mandates under \nObamaCare. In return, States would have to offer their citizens a basic \nhealth insurance plan that would include first-dollar coverage through \na health savings account, basic prescription drug coverage, a high-\ndeductible health plan to protect enrollees against medical bankruptcy, \ncoverage for preexisting conditions--a good provision of the current \nlaw that we would retain--coverage through a parent's plan for children \nup to age 26--another good provision of the law that we would retain--\nand there could be no annual or lifetime limits on insurance claims, \nagain a good provision of the current law that we would retain.\n  Here is how it would work: The Federal Government would provide \nfunding directly into the health savings accounts of individuals \ninsured through the Patient Freedom Act. These funds would be phased \nout for higher income individuals. The aggregate funding for these per-\npatient, per-capita grants would be determined based on the total \namount of funding that the Federal Government would have provided in \nthe form of ObamaCare subsidies in each State, plus any funding each \nState would have received had they chosen to expand their Medicaid \nProgram, even if, like the State of Maine, they had chosen not to do \nso.\n  In addition to Federal funds, individuals and employers could make \ntax-advantaged contributions to these health savings accounts. The bill \neven provides for a partial tax credit for very low-income individuals \nwho do receive employer-based coverage, but it would help these workers \npay for their deductibles and copays.\n  Individuals who are insured under the Patient Freedom Act would \nreceive debit cards tied to their health savings accounts, which they \ncould use to purchase a high-deductible health plan to pay directly for \nmedical expenses or pay premiums for a more generous health insurance \npolicy. In addition, health care providers receiving payment from the \nhealth savings accounts would be required to publish cash prices for \ntheir services, which would add transparency that we desperately need \nto move toward a more patient-directed health care future.\n  The promise of patient-directed health care is one of the advantages \nof this approach, but it has other advantages as well. For example, \nresidents of States that elect this option would no longer face the \nindividual mandate penalty that can cost individuals 2.5 percent of \ntheir income and the typical American family of four an estimated \n$2,100 next year. It would also codify the elimination of the employer \nmandate in these States, freeing these employers to add jobs and let \ntheir full-time employees work 40 hours a week. ObamaCare has been \ncausing some employers to reduce hours for their employees. The result \nhas been smaller paychecks for those workers.\n  Perhaps most important, however, the Patient Freedom Act would do \naway with what the superintendent of insurance in Maine refers to as \n``wage lock.'' That is caused by the fact that the subsidies in the \nObamaCare exchanges phase out completely at 400 percent of the Federal \npoverty level. In other words, there is a cliff there. Now, 400 percent \nof the poverty level is about $47,000 for an individual and $64,000 for \na couple. Taxpayers who earn just $1 more than the threshold lose their \nentire subsidy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN:\n  S. 1534. A bill to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nensure that the medical center of the Department of Veterans Affairs \nlocated in Harlingen, Texas, includes a full-service inpatient health \ncare facility, to redesignate such medical center, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1534\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Treto Garza South Texas \n     Veterans Inpatient Care Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF MEDICAL CENTER OF DEPARTMENT OF \n                   VETERANS AFFAIRS IN HARLINGEN, TEXAS, AND \n                   INCLUSION OF INPATIENT HEALTH CARE FACILITY AT \n                   SUCH MEDICAL CENTER.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The current and future health care needs of veterans \n     residing in South Texas are not being fully met by the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs.\n       (2) According to recent census data, more than 108,000 \n     veterans reside in South Texas.\n       (3) Travel times for veterans from the Valley Coastal Bend \n     area from their homes to the nearest hospital of the \n     Department for acute inpatient health care can exceed six \n     hours.\n       (4) Even with the significant travel times, veterans from \n     South Texas demonstrate a high demand for health care \n     services from the Department.\n       (5) Ongoing overseas deployments of members of the Armed \n     Forces from Texas, including members of the Armed Forces on \n     active duty, members of the Texas National Guard, and members \n     of the other reserve components of the Armed Forces, will \n     continue to increase demand for medical services provided by \n     the Department in South Texas.\n       (6) The Department employs an annual Strategic Capital \n     Investment Planning process to ``enable the VA to continually \n     adapt to changes in demographics, medical and information \n     technology, and health care delivery'', which results in the \n     development of a multi-year investment plan that determines \n     where gaps in services exist or are projected and develops an \n     appropriate solution to meet those gaps.\n       (7) According to the Department, final approval of the \n     Strategic Capital Investment Planning priority list serves as \n     the ``building block'' of the annual budget request for the \n     Department.\n       (8) Arturo ``Treto'' Garza, a veteran who served in the \n     Marine Corps, rose to the rank of Sergeant, and served two \n     tours in the Vietnam War, passed away on October 3, 2012.\n       (9) Treto Garza, who was also a former co-chairman of the \n     Veterans Alliance of the Rio Grande Valley, tirelessly fought \n     to improve health care services for veterans in the Rio \n     Grande Valley, with his efforts successfully leading to the \n     creation of the medical center of the Department located in \n     Harlingen, Texas.\n       (b) Redesignation of Medical Center in Harlingen, Texas.--\n       (1) In general.--The medical center of the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs located in Harlingen, Texas, shall after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act be known and designated as \n     the ``Treto Garza South Texas Department of Veterans Affairs \n     Health Care Center''.\n       (2) References.--Any reference in any law, regulation, map, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     medical center of the Department referred to in paragraph (1) \n     shall be deemed to be a reference to the Treto Garza South \n     Texas Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care Center.\n       (c) Requirement of Full-service Inpatient Facility.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall \n     ensure that the Treto Garza South Texas Department of \n     Veterans Affairs Health Care Center, as designated under \n     subsection (b), includes a full-service inpatient health care \n     facility of the Department and shall modify the existing \n     facility as necessary to meet that requirement.\n       (2) Plan to expand facility capabilities.--The Secretary \n     shall include in the annual Strategic Capital Investment Plan \n     of\n\n[[Page S3932]]\n\n     the Department for fiscal year 2016 a project to expand the \n     capabilities of the Treto Garza South Texas Department of \n     Veterans Affairs Health Care Center, as so designated, by \n     adding the following:\n       (A) Inpatient capability for 50 beds with appropriate \n     administrative, clinical, diagnostic, and ancillary services \n     needed for support.\n       (B) An urgent care center.\n       (C) The capability to provide a full range of services to \n     meet the health care needs of women veterans.\n       (d) Report to Congress.--Not later than 180 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit \n     to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the \n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the House of \n     Representatives a report detailing a plan to implement the \n     requirements in subsection (c), including an estimate of the \n     cost of required actions and the time necessary for the \n     completion of those actions.\n       (e) South Texas Defined.--In this section, the term ``South \n     Texas'' means the following counties in Texas: Aransas, Bee, \n     Brooks, Calhoun, Cameron, DeWitt, Dimmit, Duval, Goliad, \n     Hidalgo, Jackson, Jim Hogg, Jim Wells, Kenedy, Kleberg, \n     Nueces, Refugio, San Patricio, Starr, Victoria, Webb, \n     Willacy, Zapata.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url":

Grant distinguished himself in combat \n     during the Mexican-American War and worked tirelessly to \n     succeed in civilian life;\n       Whereas, as a civilian farmer in Missouri, Ulysses S. \n     Grant--\n       (1) met and married his wife, Julia Dent, for whom Ulysses \n     S. Grant built a home named Hardscrabble;\n       (2) worked alongside slaves and emancipated the only slave \n     that Ulysses S. Grant owned; and\n       (3) continued to own land while Ulysses S. Grant was \n     President;\n       Whereas when the Civil War erupted, Ulysses S. Grant left \n     Galena, Illinois to rejoin the United States Army, gained the \n     colonelcy of the 21st Illinois Volunteer Regiment, and began \n     his meteoric military rise;\n       Whereas during the Civil War, Ulysses S. Grant led troops \n     in numerous victorious battles including--\n       (1) in Tennessee, at Forts Henry and Donelson and at Shiloh \n     and Chattanooga; and\n       (2) in Mississippi, at Vicksburg;\n       Whereas President Abraham Lincoln chose Ulysses S. Grant to \n     be Commanding General during the Civil War, and in that role \n     Ulysses S. Grant revolutionized warfare in Virginia to \n     preserve the Union;\n       Whereas in gratitude, the people of the United States twice \n     elected Ulysses S. Grant President of the United States;\n       Whereas during his Presidency from 1869 to1877, Ulysses S. \n     Grant worked valiantly to help former slaves become full \n     citizens and became the first modern President of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas after leaving the Presidency, Ulysses S.

Grant established a foreign policy that \n     the United States followed into the 20th century and beyond;\n       Whereas Ulysses S. Grant authored his memoirs, the most \n     significant piece of 19th-century nonfiction, while \n     courageously battling cancer, which eventually took his voice \n     and his life but did not silence the noble words that he left \n     as a legacy;\n       Whereas the Ulysses S. Grant Association was founded during \n     the Centennial of the Civil War in 1962 by the leading \n     historians of that era and the Civil War Centennial \n     Commissions of New York, Illinois, and Ohio, 3 States where \n     Ulysses S. Grant lived;\n       Whereas, in the years since it was founded in 1962, the \n     Ulysses S. Grant Association--\n       (1) has produced 32 volumes of ``The Papers of Ulysses S. \n     Grant'', the major source for the study of the life of \n     Ulysses S. Grant and the 19th century in which he lived; and\n       (2) has worked toward the publication of the first \n     scholarly edition of the memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant, which \n     as of May 2015, is nearing completion;\n       Whereas the Ulysses S. Grant Association was first \n     headquartered at the Ohio Historical Society located on the \n     campus of Ohio State University, later moved to Southern \n     Illinois University, and relocated in 2008 to Mississippi \n     State University; and\n       Whereas in 2012, the Ulysses S. Grant Association \n     established the Ulysses S. Grant Presidential Library, the \n     world center for Ulysses S. Grant scholars and tourists: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) proclaims 2022 as the Bicentennial year for the \n     celebration of the birth of Ulysses S.

Res. 197\n\n       Whereas, in 2012, nearly 20 percent of the civilian \n     population in the United States reported having a disability;\n       Whereas, in 2012, 16 percent of veterans, amounting to more \n     than 3,500,000 people, received service-related disability \n     benefits;\n\n[[Page S3933]]\n\n       Whereas, in 2011, the percentage of working-age people in \n     the United States who reported having a work limitation due \n     to a disability was 7 percent, which is a 20-year high;\n       Whereas the Act entitled ``An Act to insure that certain \n     buildings financed with Federal funds are so designed and \n     constructed as to be accessible to the physically \n     handicapped'', approved August 12, 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4151 et \n     seq.) (referred to in this preamble as the ``Architectural \n     Barriers Act of 1968''), was enacted to ensure that certain \n     federally funded facilities are designed and constructed to \n     be accessible to people with disabilities and requires that \n     physically handicapped people have ready access to, and use \n     of, post offices and other Federal facilities;\n       Whereas automatic doors, though not mandated by either the \n     Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 or the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.), provide a \n     greater degree of self-sufficiency and dignity for people \n     with disabilities and the elderly, who may have limited \n     strength to open a manually operated door;\n       Whereas a report commissioned by the Architectural and \n     Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (referred to in this \n     preamble as the ``Access Board''), an independent Federal \n     agency created to ensure access to federally funded \n     facilities for people with disabilities, recommends that all \n     new buildings for use by the public should have at least one \n     automated door at an accessible entrance, except for small \n     buildings where adding such doors may be a financial hardship \n     for the owners of the buildings;\n       Whereas States and municipalities have begun to recognize \n     the importance of automatic doors in improving accessibility;\n       Whereas the laws of the State of Connecticut require \n     automatic doors in certain shopping malls and retail \n     businesses, the laws of the State of Delaware require \n     automatic doors or calling devices for newly constructed \n     places of accommodation, and the laws of the District of \n     Columbia have a similar requirement;\n       Whereas the Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings \n     Service, published by the General Services Administration, \n     requires automation of at least one exterior door for all \n     newly constructed or renovated facilities managed by the \n     General Services Administration, including post offices;\n       Whereas from 2006 to 2011, 71 percent of the complaints \n     received by the Access Board regarding the Architectural \n     Barriers Act of 1968 concerned a post office or other \n     facility of the United States Postal Service;\n       Whereas the United States Postal Service employs \n     approximately 522,000 people, making it the second-largest \n     civilian employer in the United States;\n       Whereas approximately 3,200,000 people visit 1 of the \n     31,857 post offices in the United States each day; and\n       Whereas the United States was founded on principles of \n     equality and freedom, and these principles require that all \n     people, including people with disabilities, are able to \n     engage as equal members of society: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the immense hardships that people with \n     disabilities in the United States must overcome every day;\n       (2) reaffirms its support of the Act entitled ``An Act to \n     insure that certain buildings financed with Federal funds are \n     so designed and constructed as to be accessible to the \n     physically handicapped'', approved August 12, 1968 (42 U.S.C. \n     4151 et seq.), commonly known as the ``Architectural Barriers \n     Act of 1968'', and the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n     1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.), and encourages full \n     compliance with such Acts;\n       (3) recommends that the United States Postal Service and \n     Federal agencies install power-assisted doors at post offices \n     and other federally funded facilities, respectively, to \n     ensure equal access for all people of the United States; and\n       (4) pledges to continue to work to identify and remove the \n     barriers that prevent all people of the United States from \n     having equal access to the services provided by the Federal \n     Government.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/09/senate-section/article/S3933-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3933-S3935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1870.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON IRAN NEGOTIATIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) President Barack Obama and administration officials \n     have routinely spoken about taking a hard line when dealing \n     with Iran on the subject of their nuclear program and related \n     sanctions.\n       (2) On September 25, 2012, in a speech to the United \n     Nations General Assembly, President Obama stated: ``Make no \n     mistake: A nuclear-armed Iran is not a challenge that can be \n     contained. . .the United States will do what we must to \n     prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.''\n       (3) On April 2, 2015, in an address in the Rose Garden, \n     President Obama stated that ``Iran has also agreed to the \n     most robust and intrusive inspections and transparency \n     regime,'' and declared, ``This deal was not based on trust. \n     It's based on unprecedented verification.''\n       (4) On April 2, 2015, in an interview with Andrea Mitchell \n     of NBC, in Lausanne, Switzerland, Secretary of State John \n     Kerry when asked, ``Mr. Secretary, President Obama said if \n     Iran cheats, we will know it. How can you be so sure? They've \n     cheated before''; stated, ``Well, we have extraordinary, \n     extensive verification measures that have not been applied \n     before. We will have state-of-the-art television cameras \n     within centrifuge production facilities. We will have cradle-\n     to-grave tracking of uranium--uranium from the mine to the \n     mill to the yellowcake to gas to the centrifuge to out and \n     where it goes in spent fuel. So we have--that is an amazing \n     amount--and we have a new dispute process which will allow us \n     to be able to finalize access where we need it.''\n       (5) April 8, 2015, on the ``PBS NewsHour,'' Secretary Kerry \n     said that in any final agreement, Iran would also have to \n     resolve outstanding questions with the International Atomic \n     Energy Agency over suspected military dimensions of the \n     nuclear program. ``It will be part of a final agreement,'' he \n     said. ``It has to be.''\n       (6) Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has \n     routinely spoken out openly against the United States and any \n     sanctions against Iran's nuclear program.\n\n[[Page S3940]]\n\n       (7) On April 9, 2015, the Wall Street Journal, in response \n     to the nuclear deal, reported, ``The 75-year-old cleric also \n     said Iran's government and security forces wouldn't permit \n     outside inspections of the country's military sites, which \n     are officially nonnuclear but where United Nations \n     investigators suspect Tehran conducted tests related to \n     atomic weapons development.''\n       (8) On May 20, 2015, in a graduation speech at the Imam \n     Hussein Military University in Tehran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei \n     ruled out allowing international inspectors to interview \n     Iranian nuclear scientists as part of any potential deal on \n     its nuclear program, and reiterated that ``regarding \n     inspections, we have said that we will not let foreigners \n     inspect any military center''.\n       (9) The stated positions of the United States requiring \n     ``robust and intrusive'' inspections of Iran's nuclear sites \n     and any other sites where nuclear activities may be carried \n     out or may have been conducted previously is essential to any \n     effective agreement that would provide relief from sanctions.\n       (10) The public statements of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and \n     other top Iranian leaders suggest they may refuse to grant \n     such inspections as are required to ensure the nuclear \n     agreement is complied with.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Government of Iran's stated opposition to \n     inspections represents decisive questions and suggest a \n     verifiable agreement may be unachievable; and\n       (2) no nuclear agreement with Iran that does not include \n     robust inspections and proper verification of all Iran's \n     nuclear programs and related military installations and \n     access to nuclear supporting scientists should be accepted.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1892.

The legislation created the Tomb of the \n     Unknown Soldier. Since that time, the remains of a single \n     unknown member of the Armed Forces from World War II and from \n     the Korean War have been entombed at the same memorial. (The \n     remains of an unknown Vietnam War veteran were subsequently \n     identified and removed from the Tomb).\n       (B) These additions transformed the Tomb of the Unknown \n     Soldier into a transcendent place of honor and reflection. \n     Now known as the Tomb of the Unknowns, the Tomb represents \n     that one place where every American can go to honor every \n     member of our country who has ever worn the uniform of the \n     Nation. Today at the Tomb, American citizens and citizens \n     from other countries come daily to remember and honor the \n     ideals of sacrifice and service.\n       (C) The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was formally \n     consecrated on November 11, 1921. Now is the time to prepare \n     for the 100th anniversary of the consecration of the Tomb.\n       (2) Purpose.--The purposes of this section is to provide \n     for the conduct of a formal program to commemorate the 100th \n     anniversary of the consecration of the Tomb of the Unknown \n     Soldier, including authorizing private sector efforts to \n     create nation-wide commemorations on the day of the \n     Washington National Commemoration of the Tomb.\n       (b) Commemorative Program Authorized.--The Secretary of \n     Defense may conduct a program to commemorate the 100th \n     anniversary of the consecration of the Tomb of the Unknown \n     Soldier.

The \n     Secretary shall prohibit the solicitation of any voluntary \n     services if the nature or circumstances of such solicitation \n     would compromise the integrity or the appearance of integrity \n     of any program of the Department of Defense or of any \n     individual involved in the program.\n       (2) Reimbursement of incidental expenses.--The Secretary \n     may provide for reimbursement of incidental expenses incurred \n     by a person providing voluntary services under this \n     subsection.

AUDIT READINESS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF \n                   THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution of the United \n     States requires of the agencies of the Federal Government, \n     including the Department of Defense, that ``a regular \n     Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all \n     public Money shall be published from time to time''.\n       (2) Congress passed a series of laws in the 1990s, \n     beginning with the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, to \n     require that all Government agencies and departments obtain \n     opinions on their financial statements.\n       (3) On September 10, 2001, former Secretary of Defense \n     Donald Rumsfeld, stated that ``[a]ccording to some estimates, \n     we cannot track $2,300,000,000 in transactions. We cannot \n     share information from floor to floor in this building \n     because it's stored on dozens of technological systems that \n     are inaccessible or incompatible''.\n       (4) The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2010 codified a statutory requirement that the Department of \n     Defense financial statements be validated as ready for audit \n     not later than September 30, 2017.\n       (5) On April 21, 2015, the Deputy Chief Management Officer \n     of the Department of Defense testified before the Committee \n     on Armed Services of the Senate that ``I have long been \n     skeptical of the ability of the Department to achieve the \n     statutory timeline for producing auditable financial \n     statements''.\n       (6) In September 2010, the Government Accountability Office \n     stated that past expenditures by the Department of Defense of \n     $5,800,000,000 to improve financial information, and billions \n     of dollars more of anticipated expenditures on new \n     information technology systems for that purpose, may not \n     suffice to achieve full audit readiness of the financial \n     statement of the Department.\n       (7) During his confirmation hearing in 2015, Secretary of \n     Defense Ashton Carter submitted testimony stating that ``[i]t \n     is time that DoD finally lives up to its moral and legal \n     obligation to be accountable to those who pay its bills. I \n     intend to do everything we can--including holding people to \n     account--to get this done''.\n       (8) The financial management practices of the Department of \n     Defense have been on the ``High Risk'' list of the Government \n     Accountability Office since 1995. As a result of poor \n     financial management, the Department is unable to ``control \n     costs; ensure basic accountability; anticipate future costs \n     and claims on the budget; measure performance; maintain funds \n     control; and prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse''.\n       (b) Financial Audit Fund.--The Secretary of Defense shall \n     establish a fund to be known as the ``Financial Audit Fund'' \n     (in this section referred to as the ``Fund'') for the purpose \n     of supporting initiatives, programs, and activities that will \n     assist the organizations, components, and elements of the \n     Department of Defense in--\n       (1) improving the audit readiness of the financial \n     statements of such organizations, components, and elements;\n       (2) obtaining unmodified audit opinions of the financial \n     statements of such organizations, components, and elements; \n     and\n       (3) maintaining unmodified audit opinions of the financial \n     statements of such organizations, components, and elements.\n       (c) Elements.--Amounts in the Fund shall include the \n     following:\n       (1) Amounts appropriated to the Fund.\n       (2) Amounts transferred to the Fund under subsection (e).\n       (3) Any other amounts authorized for transfer or deposit \n     into the Fund by law.\n       (d) Availability.--\n       (1) In general.--Amounts in the Fund shall be available for \n     initiatives, programs, and activities described in subsection \n     (b) that are approved by the Secretary to support and \n     maintain the audit readiness of the financial statement of \n     the organizations, components, and elements of the Department \n     of Defense.\n       (2) Transfer.--Amounts in the Fund may be transferred to \n     any other account of the Department in order to fund \n     initiatives, programs, and activities described in paragraph \n     (1). Any amounts transferred from the Fund to an account \n     shall be merged with amounts in the account to which \n     transferred and shall be available subject to the same terms \n     and conditions as amounts in such account, except that \n     amounts so transferred shall remain available until expended. \n     The authority to transfer amounts under this paragraph is in \n     addition to any other authority of the Secretary to transfer \n     amounts by law.\n       (3) Priority.--In approving initiatives, programs, and \n     activities to be funded with amounts in the Fund, the \n     Secretary shall accord a priority to initiatives, programs, \n     and activities that are designed to maintain unmodified audit \n     opinions of financial statement of organizations, components, \n     and elements of the Department that have previously obtained \n     unmodified audit opinions of their financial statements.\n       (e) Failure To Achieve Audit Readiness.--\n       (1) Reduction in amount available.--Subject to paragraph \n     (2), if during any fiscal year after fiscal year 2017 the \n     Secretary determines that an organization, component, or \n     element of the Department has not achieved audit readiness of \n     its financial statements for the calender year ending during \n     such fiscal year--\n       (A) the amount available to such organization, component, \n     or element for the fiscal year in which such determination is \n     made shall be equal to--\n       (i) the amount otherwise authorized to be appropriated for \n     such organization, component, or element for the fiscal year, \n     minus\n       (ii) an amount equal to 0.5 percent of the amount described \n     in clause (i); and\n       (B) the Secretary shall deposit in the Fund pursuant to \n     subsection (b)(2) all amounts unavailable to organizations, \n     components, and elements of the Department in the fiscal year \n     pursuant to determinations made under subparagraph (A).\n       (2) Inapplicability to amounts for military personnel.--Any \n     reduction applicable to an organization, component, or \n     element of the Department under paragraph (1) for a fiscal \n     year shall not apply to amounts, if any, available to such \n     organization, component, or element for the fiscal year for \n     military personnel.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1915.

SENSE OF SENATE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF INTERAGENCY \n                   COOPERATION FOR THE UNITED STATES NORTHERN \n                   COMMAND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Commander of United States Northern Command \n     (USNORTHCOM) testified before the Committee on Armed Services \n     of the Senate that since September 11, 2001, ``resurgent \n     state actors have invested in new capabilities that make \n     North America vulnerable in ways not seen in a generation'' \n     and particularly that the ``unpredictable cascading impacts \n     of a cyberspace attack have the potential to easily outpace \n     those of a natural disaster''.\n       (2) The Joint Cyber Center was established in the United \n     States Northern Command to integrate cybersecurity efforts \n     into headquarters missions by improving situational awareness \n     in the cyber domain, improving the defense of the networks of \n     the Command, and providing cyber consequence response and \n     recovery support to civil authorities.\n       (3) The responsibilities of United States Northern Command \n     for homeland defense (including countering illegal drugs and \n     combating transnational organized crime) and defense support \n     of civil authorities (including domestic disaster relief \n     operations during wildfires, hurricanes, earthquakes, and \n     floods) depend on interagency partnerships and cooperation.\n       (4) During the past fire season, Air Force Reserve and Air \n     National Guard C-130 aircraft equipped with the United States \n     Forest Service Modular Airborne Fire Fighting System made 132 \n     airdrops, releasing nearly 250,000 gallons of fire retardant \n     to combat wildfires.\n       (5) The regional partnership of United States Northern \n     Command with Mexico and the Bahamas in combating the \n     trafficking of illegal drugs and persons and in training law \n     enforcement and disaster relief personnel depends on \n     cooperation with other agencies of the United States \n     Government such as the Department of State, Department of \n     Homeland Security, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n       (6) The Commander of United States Northern Command is also \n     the Commander of the North American Aerospace Defense Command \n     (NORAD), the bi-national command with Canada. For more than \n     57 years, the United States has partnered with our vital ally \n     to the north to provide aerospace warning, aerospace defense, \n     and maritime warning in defense of North America. Since \n     September 11, 2001, North American Aerospace Defense Command \n     fighters have responded to more than 5,000 possible air \n     threats in the United States and flown more than 62,500 \n     sorties in defense of our homeland. Successful execution on \n     the North American Aerospace Defense Command mission relies \n     heavily on timely communication and seamless integration with \n     numerous agencies of the United States Government such as the \n     Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Homeland \n     Security, and Federal law enforcement agencies.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) continued interagency cooperation is vital to the \n     successful discharge of the missions of the United States \n     Northern Command, including homeland defense, cybersecurity, \n     counterterrorism, counterdrug efforts, and defense support of \n     civil authorities; and\n       (2) the United States Northern Command should continue its \n     efforts to integrate cyberspace operations into its \n     contingency plans and training exercises to understand better \n     how cyber-attacks could be mitigated or prevented and how \n     other Federal and\n\n[[Page S3947]]\n\n     State government partners can effectively respond should such \n     attacks occur.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1916.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON NATIONAL SECURITY \n                   IMPLICATIONS OF CLIMATE CHANGE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The 2015 National Security Strategy states that climate \n     change is ``an urgent and growing threat to our national \n     security''.\n       (2) The 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review describes long-term \n     strategies and initiatives for the Department of Defense and \n     states that--\n       (A) ``the pressures caused by climate change will influence \n     resource competition while placing additional burdens on \n     economies, societies, and governance institutions around the \n     world''; and\n       (B) the effects of climate change are ``threat \n     multipliers'' that aggravate stressors abroad that can \n     ``enable terrorist activity and other violence''.\n       (3) The 2014 Department of Defense Climate Change \n     Adaptation Roadmap asserts that climate change will ``be felt \n     across the full range of Department activities, including \n     plans, operations, training, infrastructure, and \n     acquisition'' and that among the potential effects of climate \n     change are--\n       (A) ``instability within and among other nations'';\n       (B) ``decreased training/testing land-carrying capacity to \n     support current testing and training rotation types or \n     levels'';\n       (C) ``increased inundation, erosion, and flooding damage'' \n     to Department of Defense infrastructure; and\n       (D) ``reduced availability of or access to the materials, \n     resources, and industrial infrastructure needed to \n     manufacture the Department's weapon systems and supplies''.\n       (4) The 2014 United States Government Accountability Office \n     report entitled ``Climate Change Adaptation: DOD Can Improve \n     Infrastructure Planning and Processes to Better Account for \n     Potential Impacts'' assessed 15 sites at defense \n     installations in the United States for vulnerability to the \n     effects of climate change. The report found that climate \n     change could affect Department of Defense readiness and \n     fiscal exposure in the following ways:\n       (A) ``According to DOD officials, the combination of \n     thawing permafrost, decreasing sea ice, and rising sea levels \n     on the Alaskan coast has increased coastal erosion at several \n     Air Force radar early warning and communication \n     installations''.\n       (B) ``Impacts on DOD's infrastructure from this erosion \n     have included damaged roads, seawalls, and runways''.\n       (C) ``Officials on a Navy installation told GAO that sea \n     level rise and resulting storm surge are the two largest \n     threats to their waterfront infrastructure''.\n       (D) ``Officials provided examples of impacts from reduced \n     precipitation--such as drought and wildfire risk--and \n     identified potential mission vulnerabilities--such as reduced \n     live-fire training''.\n       (5) The 2014 CNA Corporation released a report entitled \n     ``National Security Risks and the Accelerating Risks of \n     Climate Change''. The report by the Corporation, the Military \n     Advisory Board of which was comprised of 15 generals and \n     admirals retired from the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and \n     the Marine Corps, found that--\n       (A) ``climate change impacts are already accelerating \n     instability in vulnerable areas of the world and are serving \n     as catalysts for conflict''; and\n       (B) ``actions by the United States and the international \n     community have been insufficient to adapt to the challenges \n     associated with projected climate change''.\n       (6) The Military Advisory Board also wrote that ``[w]e are \n     dismayed that discussions of climate change have become so \n     polarizing and have receded from the arena of informed public \n     discourse and debate. Political posturing and budgetary woes \n     cannot be allowed to inhibit discussion and debate over what \n     so many believe to be a salient national security concern for \n     our Nation''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that it \n     is in the national security interests of the United States to \n     assess, plan for, and mitigate the security and strategic \n     implications of climate change.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1949.

SUCH MEDICAL CENTER.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The current and future health care needs of veterans \n     residing in South Texas are not being fully met by the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs.\n       (2) According to recent census data, more than 108,000 \n     veterans reside in South Texas.\n       (3) Travel times for veterans from the Valley Coastal Bend \n     area from their homes to the nearest hospital of the \n     Department for acute inpatient health care can exceed six \n     hours.\n       (4) Even with the significant travel times, veterans from \n     South Texas demonstrate a high demand for health care \n     services from the Department.\n       (5) Ongoing overseas deployments of members of the Armed \n     Forces from Texas, including members of the Armed Forces on \n     active duty, members of the Texas National Guard, and members \n     of the other reserve components of the Armed Forces, will \n     continue to increase demand for medical services provided by \n     the Department in South Texas.\n       (6) The Department employs an annual Strategic Capital \n     Investment Planning process to ``enable the VA to continually \n     adapt to changes in demographics, medical and information \n     technology, and health care delivery'', which results in the \n     development of a multi-year investment plan that determines \n     where gaps in services exist or are projected and develops an \n     appropriate solution to meet those gaps.\n       (7) According to the Department, final approval of the \n     Strategic Capital Investment Planning priority list serves as \n     the ``building block'' of the annual budget request for the \n     Department.\n       (8) Arturo ``Treto'' Garza, a veteran who served in the \n     Marine Corps, rose to the rank of Sergeant, and served two \n     tours in the Vietnam War, passed away on October 3, 2012.\n       (9) Treto Garza, who was also a former co-chairman of the \n     Veterans Alliance of the Rio Grande Valley, tirelessly fought \n     to improve health care services for veterans in the Rio \n     Grande Valley, with his efforts successfully leading to the \n     creation of the medical center of the Department located in \n     Harlingen, Texas.\n       (b) Redesignation of Medical Center in Harlingen, Texas.--\n       (1) In general.--The medical center of the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs located in Harlingen, Texas, shall after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act be known and designated as \n     the ``Treto Garza South Texas Department of Veterans Affairs \n     Health Care Center''.\n       (2) References.--Any reference in any law, regulation, map, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     medical center of the Department referred to in paragraph (1) \n     shall be deemed to be a reference to the Treto Garza South \n     Texas Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care Center.\n       (c) Requirement of Full-service Inpatient Facility.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall \n     ensure that the Treto Garza South Texas Department of \n     Veterans Affairs Health Care Center, as designated under \n     subsection (b), includes a full-service inpatient health care \n     facility of the Department and shall modify the existing \n     facility as necessary to meet that requirement.\n       (2) Plan to expand facility capabilities.--The Secretary \n     shall include in the annual Strategic Capital Investment Plan \n     of the Department for fiscal year 2016 a project to expand \n     the capabilities of the Treto Garza South Texas Department of \n     Veterans Affairs Health Care Center, as so designated, by \n     adding the following:\n       (A) Inpatient capability for 50 beds with appropriate \n     administrative, clinical, diagnostic, and ancillary services \n     needed for support.\n       (B) An urgent care center.\n       (C) The capability to provide a full range of services to \n     meet the health care needs of women veterans.\n       (d) Report to Congress.--Not later than 180 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit \n     to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the \n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the House of \n     Representatives a report detailing a plan to implement the \n     requirements in subsection (c), including an estimate of the \n     cost of required actions and the time necessary for the \n     completion of those actions.\n       (e) South Texas Defined.--In this section, the term ``South \n     Texas'' means the following counties in Texas: Aransas, Bee, \n

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Grassroots Rural and Small \n     Community Water Systems Assistance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996 (Public \n     Law 104-182) authorized technical assistance for small and \n     rural communities to assist those communities in complying \n     with regulations promulgated pursuant to the Safe Drinking \n     Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.);\n       (2) technical assistance and compliance training--\n       (A) ensures that Federal regulations do not overwhelm the \n     resources of small and rural communities; and\n       (B) provides small and rural communities lacking technical \n     resources with the necessary skills to improve and protect \n     water resources;\n       (3) across the United States, more than 90 percent of the \n     community water systems serve a population of less than \n     10,000 individuals;\n       (4) small and rural communities have the greatest \n     difficulty providing safe, affordable public drinking water \n     and wastewater services due to limited economies of scale and \n     lack of technical expertise; and\n       (5) in addition to being the main source of compliance \n     assistance, small and rural water technical assistance has \n     been the main source of emergency response assistance in \n     small and rural communities.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) to assist small and rural communities most effectively, \n     the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency \n     should prioritize the types of technical assistance that are \n     most beneficial to those communities, based on input from \n     those communities; and\n       (2) local support is the key to making Federal assistance \n     initiatives work in small and rural communities to the \n     maximum benefit.\n\n     SEC. 4. FUNDING PRIORITIES.\n\n       Section 1442(e) of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. \n     300j-1(e)) is amended--\n       (1) by designating the first through seventh sentences as \n     paragraphs (1) through (7), respectively;\n       (2) in paragraph (5) (as so designated), by striking ``1997 \n     through 2003'' and inserting ``2015 through 2020''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(8) Nonprofit organizations.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The Administrator may use amounts made \n     available to carry out this section to provide grants or \n     cooperative agreements to nonprofit organizations that \n     provide to small public water systems onsite technical \n     assistance, circuit-rider technical assistance programs, \n     multistate, regional technical assistance programs, onsite \n     and regional training, assistance with implementing source \n     water protection plans, and assistance with implementing \n     monitoring plans, rules, regulations, and water security \n     enhancements.\n       ``(B) Preference.--To ensure that technical assistance \n     funding is used in a manner that is most beneficial to the \n     small and rural communities of a State, the Administrator \n     shall give preference under this paragraph to nonprofit \n     organizations that, as determined by the Administrator, are \n     the most qualified and experienced in providing training and \n     technical assistance to small public water systems and that \n     the small community water systems in that State find to be \n     the most beneficial and effective.\n       ``(C) Limitation.--No grant or cooperative agreement \n     provided or otherwise made available under this section may \n     be used for litigation pursuant to section 1449.''.\n\n  The bill (S. 653) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 653\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
