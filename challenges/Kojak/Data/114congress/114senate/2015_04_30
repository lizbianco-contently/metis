Mr. President, I rise today to welcome to this body a \nfriend and a fellow North Carolinian, Peter Milner. Chaplain Milner \nserves the North Carolina General Assembly as the State's senate \nchaplain.\n  A fellow Demon Deacon and an alumna of Wake Forest, he received his \nundergraduate degree in sociology and religion. While at Wake Forest, \nChaplain Milner was instrumental in the creation of the Wake Forest \nVolunteer Service Corps, which engages hundreds of students, faculty, \nand staff to participate in community-based organizations.\n  After completing his undergraduate work at Wake Forest, he went on to \nearn his master's in secondary social studies education to become a \nhigh school teacher. Called to the ministry after his first year of \nteaching, he attended Duke Divinity School, where he thrived in his \nrole as resident coordinator of Emmaus House in Raleigh, which provides \nsafe, affordable housing for working homeless men recovering from \nsubstance dependency. Chaplain Milner's devotion to and passion for \nhelping the homeless is unwavering and very clear. I saw it for myself \nwhen I first met Peter a few years ago at a homeless center in Raleigh, \nNC.\n  Besides his tireless work on behalf of the homeless, Chaplain Milner \nhas been instrumental in improving the lives of students, medical \npatients, and--a cause very important to North Carolinians, including \nme--our Nation's veterans. Because of his work as an outreach \nspecialist for veterans at StepUp Ministry, Chaplain Milner established \nan important link between veterans in need and the business community. \nHis hard work continues to help struggling veterans achieve stable \nlives through employment counseling and life skills training.\n  The North Carolina General Assembly is blessed to have a man who has \ndevoted his life to causes much larger than himself. But of all that he \nhas accomplished in life so far, he says his greatest accomplishment is \nbeing a husband to his bride of 13 years, Anna, and a father to their \ntwo beautiful children, Silas and Josie, who are all with us today.\n  Chaplain Milner, I thank you for leading our Chamber in prayer today, \nand I welcome you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I thank Chaplain Milner for being here.\n  I want to talk about a friend. He is somebody who blessed our \nlegislature during the time I was speaker of the house.\n  I will not repeat all of the things Peter has done for the community. \nI want to speak specifically about what he has done for the State \nchamber and the general assembly, the part where I was speaker. He was \na calm presence in an otherwise chaotic environment called the \nlegislative body--not unlike the one we have here. He is always \nsomebody you can look to for guidance, support, and for inspiration, \nand for that, I thank him.\n  I will also say--you notice he is a little bit tall. He played \nbasketball at Wake.\n  We have this rivalry with South Carolina. We play basketball every \nyear. We get together and we either travel down to South Carolina or \nthe legislature comes here. I played on that basketball team for 4 \nyears. In each of those 4 years, we were hopeful that Peter would play \nwith us, but for some reason he didn't. Now, the only thing that I see \ndifferently--he is playing this year, since my departure.\n  I hope your decision to play isn't because of my exit, Peter.\n  I thank you for being here and for your contribution to the \ncommunity. I welcome your family, who I believe is in the Chamber \ntoday. I hope you enjoy today.\n\n[[Page S2544]]\n\n  On behalf of all Members who benefit from your guidance and your \nspiritual presence and guidance in the State of North Carolina and the \ngeneral assembly, thank you, and welcome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/30/senate-section/article/S2544-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as some know, I fought a little bit. I was \nin the minor leagues for a couple of years.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, in Nevada, on Saturday night, in Las \nVegas, there is going to be a stunning athletic event, one of the most \nsignificant athletic events, actually, in the last 50 years. It is a \nwonderful occasion for Nevada to host the fight between Manny \nPacquiao--I should say Congressman Pacquiao, who is a member of the \nPhilippine Congress--and Floyd Mayweather. They will be battling for \nthree separate titles. They are fighting for the 147-pound weight \nclass--for all the people who think that is small, that is the class \nthat--we have had some of our great fighters of all time who have \nfought that same weight level.\n  These are two great athletes. The winner of the match will be crowned \nas the greatest pound for pound fighter in the world, and they will go \ndown as two of the finest fighters ever in the history of the world. So \nregardless of who wins, this bout is projected to shatter boxing \nrecords for not only being a significant boxing match--the focus of the \nworld will be on this fight. People all over the world will be watching \nthis fight.\n  They don't really know how many pay-per-view purchases are expected, \nbut I made one last night. I was planning on going to the fight, but, \nas my friend the Presiding Officer knows, things have changed over the \nyears. If we want to get one of those good seats, we have to pay for \nit. I have been willing to do that in the past, but the traffic was a \nlittle too heavy there, so I decided to watch it here with some of my \nfamily. But I am so happy that the pay-per-view purchases are expected \nto exceed 3 million people, and they won't get it any cheaper than I \ndid--$99.95. So it is wonderful that all previous records will be \nbroken as to revenue.\n  The only thing I don't like about it is the fight doesn't start back \nhere until 9 o'clock and usually they don't end until midnight. I wish \nthey would start a little earlier, but, as I have learned with my \nbaseball, they just start them later back here.\n  I am very excited about this unforgettable fight. There is nothing \nlike a championship fight. There is nothing like one that has all this \nattention.\n  After I started practicing law, I started judging fights. I was on \nthe Nevada fight commission, and I judged fights. I judged lots of \nfights. I can remember the first big fight I went to. Oh, it was a big \nfight. I walked in there, and I couldn't imagine there would be that \nmuch attention on anything. Of course, there were thousands of people \nthere. I was excited. I was going to judge one of the preliminary \nfights. It was stunning. You see ringside all of these glamorous, \nimportant people. These fights catch the enthusiasm of sports fans all \nover the world.\n  The eagerness that I have of watching this fight goes far beyond the \nsport of boxing or the spectacle of a marquis matchup. I am thrilled \nfor Nevada. This fight will inject hundreds of millions of dollars into \nthe State's economy. It will benefit Nevadans all--fighters and their \nteams, of course, hotels, restaurants, cab drivers, limousine drivers, \nparking valets, maids will get bigger tips than they usually get. It \nwill be a great time for Nevada.\n  So I have done everything I can within my power here as a Member of \nthe legislature to help in any way that I can. I have interceded on a \ncouple of occasions to help make this fight move forward, and I was \nvery happy to do so.\n  I love this sport. Some of my most prized possessions in my home are \nfight pictures. I have one picture of the great Joe Louis and Max \nSchmeling, and they both signed that picture before they died. I had \nthe good fortune, when Joe Louis spent so much time at Caesars Palace, \nto have met him. I have pictures hanging on my wall of my dear father-\nin-law, who worked with fighters. I have a picture on the wall--they \nare all together--of him with Jack Dempsey, with Primo Carnera, who was \n6 foot 7, a huge man--my father-in-law was about 5 foot 5--Sugar Ray \nRobinson. All these--not all of them, but many great fighters are there \nwith my father-in-law. I love that picture, and it reminds me of my \nminor league experience in boxing.\n  I am very excited about watching this fight.\n  Las Vegas has been the entertainment capital of the world for a long \ntime, and we are happy that, in fact, is the case. But a few short \nyears ago, as the Presiding Officer knows, we were hit very hard. The \ndebacle that took place on Wall Street hurt Nevada more than any other \nplace. We have been recovering. We haven't recovered totally, but we \nhave recovered significantly.\n  The 2008 economic collapse took a heavy toll on Nevada. A quarter of \nNevadans are employed in the tourism and hospitality industry, and when \nthe recession hit, they got hurt, as did all working classes--\nconstruction workers; everybody got hurt--but we fought our way back.\n  Last year, we welcomed to Las Vegas 41 million people--little Las \nVegas, 41 million people. It is not so little, but the Presiding \nOfficer and I remember when it was a little place. But now it is a \ncommunity with a metropolitan area of over 2 million people. Forty-one \nmillion people have come to Las Vegas and produced an economic impact \nof more than $50 billion. We shattered previous records by attracting \n1.4 million more visitors than we did--in 2014. So it is only going to \nget better, and the Pacquiao-Mayweather fight will keep that momentum \ngoing for Nevada.\n  I am not picking a winner. I wish both men the best of luck. But, \nadmittedly, I am a little biased because of my relationship with Manny \nPacquiao.\n  As the Presiding Officer will remember, one of my real campaigners in \none of my difficult races was Manny Pacquiao. He campaigned for me. He \nbroke training to come out of L.A., flew in for a big event I had one \nnight. So you have to remember that kind of stuff. So I have a very \ngood relationship with Manny Pacquiao. Certainly, I don't have a bad \none with Floyd Mayweather, but I know Manny Pacquiao much better than I \nknow Floyd Mayweather. He stood in my corner in the past, and he will \nalways have my support.\n  Regardless, though, of which fighter reigns supreme on that Saturday \nnight--and one of them will. They are alone. Nobody is there with them. \nRegardless of who leaves the arena with that big belt, Nevada's hard-\nworking economy will have won the fight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/30/senate-section/article/S2544-3", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senate will soon resume \nconsideration of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. I expect we \nwill consider several amendments today, and I continue to encourage \nSenators to come to the floor and offer them.\n  The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act is bipartisan legislation that \nwill ensure that Congress and the American people have a chance to \nreview any comprehensive agreement reached with Iran, and it ensures \nthey will be able to do so before congressional sanctions are lifted.\n  Here is why that is critical. First, these sanctions are a big reason \nwhy America was able even to bring Iran to the table in the first \nplace. We shouldn't be giving up that leverage now without the American \npeople, through the Members of Congress they elect, having a chance to \nweigh in. Quite simply, the American people expect us to have an \nopportunity to evaluate this agreement or not.\n  Second, Iran wouldn't just use the funds derived from sanctions \nrelief to rebuild its economy. It is certain to use that money to fund \nproxy forces such as Hezbollah and to prop up the Assad regime. What is \nclear is that Iran is determined to use every tool--to use every tool--\nat its disposal to expand\n\n[[Page S2545]]\n\naggressively its sphere of influence across the greater Middle East.\n  The regime's belligerent behavior in the Strait of Hormuz was just \nanother reminder of that fact. But it reminds us of something else, \ntoo--our need to invest in the naval and seaborne expeditionary \ncapabilities in the Persian Gulf, which will be necessary not just to \nretain dominance at sea but to contain Iran's military and irregular \nforces, as well.\n  Today, though--today--we are focused on one point above all else--\nthat the American people and Congress deserve a say before any \ncongressional sanctions are lifted. At the very least, sanctions should \nnot be lifted before the Iranians fully disclose all aspects of \nresearch and development as it relates to the potential military \ndimensions of their nuclear program. Yet the interim agreement, as it \nhas been explained to Congress, would bestow international recognition \nto Iran's research and development program, along with an international \nblessing for Iran to become a nuclear threshold state poised at the \nedge of developing a nuclear weapon. It is frightening to think what \nIran might be able to achieve covertly in that context.\n  Now, to a lot of Americans this all sounds quite different from what \nthey were led to believe a deal with Iran would actually be about--\npreventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and dismantling Iran's \nenrichment capability. But that apparently has already been given away. \nSo the American people deserve a say through their Members of Congress. \nThe Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act will ensure Congress gets a vote \neither to approve or disapprove of the comprehensive agreement.\n  Just as President Obama's successor will need to modernize our \nmilitary to deal with the challenges posed by Iran's aggression, so \nwill the President's successor want to consider Congress's view of any \ncomprehensive deal. A failed resolution of approval, as the bill before \nus would permit, would send an unmistakable signal about congressional \nopposition to lifting sanctions. Let me say that again. A failed \nresolution of approval, permitted under this bill, would send an \nunmistakable signal about congressional opposition to lifting \nsanctions.\n  So now is the time for Congress to invest in the capabilities \nPresident Obama's successor may need to use to end Iran's nuclear \nweapons program if the Iranians covertly pursue a weapon or violate the \nterms of the ultimate agreement. And now is the time for Congress to \npass the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/30/senate-section/article/S2545-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Now, on a different matter, Mr. President, I was glad \nto see yesterday's announcement of a budget conference agreement. That \nmeans Congress is now one step closer to passing a balanced budget that \nsupports a healthy economy, funds national defense, strengthens \nMedicare, and begins to tackle our debt problems without taking more \nmoney from hard-working Americans.\n  It is a balanced budget that could help lead to more than 1 million \nadditional jobs and boost our economy by nearly half a trillion \ndollars, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. In \nshort, it is a balanced budget that is all about the future. That is \nalso why it provides a tool for the Senate majority to repeal a failed \npolicy of the past--ObamaCare--so we can start over with real patient-\ncentered health reform.\n  This is a good balanced budget every Senator should want to support, \nand I look forward to the Senate taking up the budget agreement next \nweek.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/30/senate-section/article/S2545-2", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 1191, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1191) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to ensure that emergency services volunteers are not \n     taken into account as employees under the shared \n     responsibility requirements contained in the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Corker/Cardin amendment No. 1140, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       Corker/Cardin amendment No. 1179 (to amendment No. 1140), \n     to require submission of all Persian text included in the \n     agreement.\n       Blunt amendment No. 1155 (to amendment No. 1140), to extend \n     the requirement for annual Department of Defense reports on \n     the military power of Iran.\n       Vitter modified amendment No. 1186 (to amendment No. 1179), \n     to require an assessment of inadequacies in the international \n     monitoring and verification system as they relate to a \n     nuclear agreement with Iran.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up my amendment No. 1149 to declare that any \nagreement reached by the President relating to the nuclear program of \nIran is a congressional-executive agreement to be considered under the \nexpedited procedure in both Houses of Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CARDIN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, we have \nbeen proceeding now for about a week. We have had a good debate on \nissues. Many Members are working with Senator Corker and me to clear \ntheir amendments so they are consistent with the overall objective that \nwas supported by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee by a 19-to-0 \nvote, and we are going to continue to work on that process in the \norderly consideration of amendments.\n  For that reason, I must object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Perhaps if the Senator from Maryland will listen to my \nexplanation of what this amendment does, he will withdraw his \nobjection.\n  During our debate on Tuesday, when I offered an amendment to deem the \nagreement between Iran and America--well, actually and the world--a \ntreaty subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, the Senator \nfrom Maryland spoke about one of the objections to the treaty. He said:\n\n       Secondly, I don't know how we are going to explain it to \n     our colleagues in the House of Representatives. The Presiding \n     Officer served in the House. I served in the House. Senator \n     Menendez served in the House. The last time I checked, we \n     imposed these sanctions because the bill passed both the \n     Senate and the House, and now we are saying that the approval \n     process is going to ignore the House of Representatives, \n     solely going to be a matter for the U.S. Senate on a \n     ratification of a treaty? That does not seem like a workable \n     solution.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, I appreciate the fact that the Senator from \nTennessee and the Senator from Maryland did not object to my raising my \nfirst amendment to deem it a treaty. And of course this body then voted \non that, and I appreciate that fact. And I accept the verdict of this \nChamber that they did not want to deem this agreement a treaty--fair \nenough.\n  But I would like to quote, in addition to the Senator from Maryland, \nthe Senator from Tennessee in arguing against deeming this a treaty. \nThe Senator from Tennessee said: ``We think the President has the \nability to negotiate things.''\n  Well, first off all, I agree with that. Article II, section 2 states: \n``He [The President] shall have Power, by and with the Advice and \nConsent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the \nSenators present concur. . . . ''\n  So that actually is the constitutional method for making agreements \nbetween nations--having the President negotiate that. I completely \nagree. We can't have 535 negotiators. But we certainly should have this \nbody involved in those agreements. We should have a role. We should \nhave a robust role. And, of course, I believe it is so important, that \nthis has such an effect and that it risks so much for this Nation, that \nI believe it should be a treaty. But again, fair enough--this body \ndeemed it would not be a treaty. The Senator from Tennessee went on to \nsay:\n\n       We had no idea this President would consider suspending \n     these sanctions ad infinitum, forever--no idea. I think even \n     people on the other side of the aisle were shocked.\n\n\n[[Page S2546]]\n\n\n  We were shocked. Yes, we granted those waivers for national security. \nWe did not believe those waivers would be abused the way they are being \nabused right now.\n  The Senator from Tennessee also went on to say: ``This is one of the \nbiggest geopolitical issues that will potentially happen if an \nagreement is reached in our lifetime here in the Senate.''\n  Once again, I agree with the Senator from Tennessee. This is a huge \ngeopolitical issue. And right now this administration deems that \nagreement on its own authority, an executive agreement, and really, at \nthis point in time, we have no role. There is no involvement. The \nSenator from Tennessee went on to say: ``Look, I have strong agreement \nwith the sentiment of our Senator from Wisconsin.'' Again, he is \nagreeing with the fact that this really should rise to the level of a \ntreaty.\n  He also went on to say: ``Without the bill that is on the floor, the \nAmerican people will never see it.''\n  Think of that. Think of an agreement between Iran, as it is being \ndescribed--and, as I say, nobody really knows yet, but what I believe \nis being described to us--puts Iran on a path for a nuclear weapon. How \nmany years has it been that Presidents from both parties and Members of \nCongress from both parties have stood and said very forcefully that we \nsimply cannot allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon? Now we may be facing \nan agreement between this country, other nations of the world, and Iran \nthat actually puts Iran on a path for a nuclear agreement.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is correct. I hope he is not correct, but \nI think he may be correct that right now this President has no duty to \nbring that agreement to the American people. I do happen to believe \nthat public pressure would be so great that the American people would \nnot tolerate that level of brazenness, that level of arrogance on the \npart of any administration or any President to do a deal, to make an \nagreement of such import that before implementing that agreement the \nPresident of the United States would not bring that agreement to the \nAmerican people and subject it to, in some shape or form, the advice \nand consent of either this Chamber or Congress as a whole.\n  The final quote from the Senator from Tennessee is this. He said:\n\n       Now, look, if I could wave a magic wand or all of a sudden \n     donkeys flew around the Capitol, I would love for us to have \n     the ability to deem this a treaty. I really would.\n\n  Well, if the agreement that President Obama is talking about in its \ncurrent framework is agreed to between this administration and the \nother negotiating partners and Iran, we better all hope that donkeys \nstart flying around the Capitol, because that agreement, as it is being \ndescribed to us, would put Iran on the path to be a nuclear power. That \nwould destabilize not only the region, but it would destabilize the \nworld. It would lead to an enormous amount of nuclear proliferation \nwithin the region. It is a very bad deal. It is very risky for this \nNation. It affects this Nation.\n  Let me just go through the three forms of international agreements. \nThere are no set criteria in terms of what is a treaty, what is a \ncongressional-executive agreement or what is simply an executive \nagreement. There are considerations. There is precedent.\n  I go to the Foreign Affairs Manual at the State Department, and they \nlay out the considerations; what should be considered in determining \nwhat an agreement is--a treaty, a congressional-executive agreement or \njust an executive agreement. The first consideration is the extent to \nwhich the agreement involves commitments or risks affecting the Nation \nas a whole.\n  The third consideration is whether the agreement can be given effect \nwithout the enactment of subsequent legislation by Congress.\n  Well, the fact that we have this bill proves the fact that it needs \nsubsequent legislation by Congress.\n  The fifth consideration is the preference of the Congress as to a \nparticular type of agreement. Well, that is what we are talking about \nhere--the Congress weighing in, in the form of my amendment, to say we \nwant a role, we want a more robust role than is currently offered in \nthis bill.\n\n  The seventh is the proposed duration of the agreement. We are going \nto be living with the impact, the effect, the results, the collateral \ndamage of this agreement between Iran and the other negotiating parties \nfor a very, very, very long time. So based on those considerations, \nbased on the fact that in the State Department's own Foreign Affairs \nManual in determining whether something is a treaty or an executive \nagreement or a congressional executive agreement, there should be \nconsultation with Congress. I consider this amendment consultation with \nCongress.\n  Again, all I am asking in this amendment is to provide a minimal--a \nminimal constitutional threshold, a minimum constitutional role for \nCongress in affirmatively approving a deal between Iran and the rest of \nthe world and America.\n  So all this amendment really does, in effect, is just asks the \nPresident to bring the agreement before the American people, before \nthis Congress, allow us to have input, to affirmatively approve this in \nboth Chambers, both the House and the Senate, with a mere majority vote \nof both Chambers. Because what is currently on the floor in this bill--\nand, again, I have a great deal of respect for the Senator from \nTennessee. I know in his heart he believes this Senate, this Congress, \nshould have a far more robust role and involvement in such a \nconsequential agreement, but I also realize the challenge he has had \ndealing with our friends on the other side of the aisle and how very \nlittle involvement they are willing to agree to for this Senate and for \nthis Congress.\n  If the bill is passed, we need to clarify what that means in terms of \napproval. Probably the best way for me to point that out is I had a \nthird amendment I tried to offer. It was an amendment that was going to \nspecifically describe what this bill does with a vote of disapproval, \nwhat that threshold really means in terms of approval of this very \nconsequential deal. So I offered an amendment: I called it a very low \nthreshold for approval of a congressional-executive agreement. It would \nhave allowed the agreement between Iran and the rest of the world to be \napproved by this body, by this Congress, with a majority vote in the \nHouse and a vote of only 34 Senators in this body.\n  Now, very appropriately, that amendment was ruled out of order. It \nwas ruled unconstitutional by the Parliamentarian, as it should have \nbeen, because that is not approval of a process. That is not the way \nCongress should weigh in, have input, be involved in such a \nconsequential agreement. But that is exactly--in a very convoluted \nprocess of votes of disapproval, that would have to be, first of all, \nvoted on by 60 Senators. Then, of course, if that is vetoed, we would \nhave to override that veto with 67 Senators and two-thirds majority in \nthe House.\n  Again, what this bill does, it will allow a very bad deal--\npotentially very bad deal--between Iran and the rest of the world and \nAmerica to be approved with a majority vote in the House and a vote of \nonly 34 Senators in this Chamber.\n  Again, with that reality, with that clarity of what this bill does, \nthe minimum role, the minimum role that this bill allows, I would urge \nall of my colleagues to support my amendment that provides for what \nshould be the minimum involvement of Congress: a majority vote, an \naffirmative vote of approval in both the House and the Senate to any \ndeal this administration concludes with Iran.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for his \ngreat service on the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  I think he knows there is another amendment offered by another \nSenator, the Senator from Texas, that I think is very similar to this, \nand we are working right now with the other side to try to bring that \nup.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CORKER. Sure.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. The difference between the two, as I understand them, is \nthe amendment of the Senator from Texas would actually have a higher \nthreshold. I think it would rise to a 60-vote threshold. I am not \nasking that. I am actually asking something less than that, to again \nclarify what this\n\n[[Page S2547]]\n\nbill allows in terms of approval by this Chamber.\n  So even though we discussed this earlier, I don't believe I can \ncombine the two because I think it is important to clarify the issue \nwith an amendment that requires what I really do believe--truly \nbelieve--should be the minimum, the minimum role, the minimum \naffirmative approval of disagreement: a mere majority vote in both \nChambers. That is so reasonable. That is the minimum role the American \npeople ought to have in terms of having a say in this.\n  I have never insisted on an amendment in 4 years in the Senate. I \nfeel so deeply about this that I really ask both the Senator from \nMaryland and the Senator from Tennessee, please, just allow a vote on \nthis one amendment.\n  Mr. CORKER. If I could, Mr. President, the Senator is right; he \ndoesn't offer many amendments, nor do I. But the very first amendment \nwe voted on was the amendment of the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  We had a conversation yesterday which I thought led to us considering \ncombining this request with the request from Senator Cruz, and I know \nwe are working on that particular issue. But I understand, and we are \ntrying to process these. I think he knows we are trying to process \nvotes, and the very first one we processed was the one from the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin.\n  I do appreciate his concerns. I think he knows I share his concerns \nabout this agreement. I am trying to get done what is possible. Again, \nif I could wave a wand and cause the national security waivers that \nSenator Johnson, myself, Senator Cardin, and others voted for years ago \nwhen we put the sanctions in place--if I could wave a wand and those \nwould go away, then we would be in a position where we would actually \nneed to have an affirmative vote.\n  But I do appreciate his concerns. I think he knows we are trying to \nwork through amendments down here, and I appreciate his patience as we \ndo so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I join Senator Corker. Senator Johnson is \na very valued member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I enjoy \nworking with him on U.N. issues. The two of us are the Senate \nrepresentatives to the United Nations this year and I know his passion \non these issues, but I just want to underscore a couple points.\n  Right now, as of last night, there were 66 amendments that had been \nfiled to this bill that came out of the committee 19 to 0. The number \nof Republican amendments were 66; the number of Democratic amendments \nwere zero.\n  I point that out because we are trying to maintain the bipartisan \ncooperation we have had through this process so the Senate can speak \nwith a united voice, because that gives us the strongest possible \nmessage as to the congressional role.\n  I must state, this is a delicate balance how we brought this bill \nforward. I don't think I am underestimating the surprise we received \nfrom our colleagues when they heard there was a 19-to-0 vote in our \ncommittee.\n  There are so many Members who are working with us who have filed \namendments--and I thank each one of them--trying to find areas where \nwe, as we worked in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, can find a \ncommon spot to be able to advance those amendments. I am optimistic and \nSenator Corker is optimistic that we are going to be able to deal with \nmany of the issues the Republican Members have brought up and the \namendments they have filed.\n  But in direct response to Senator Johnson, let me point out, the \nsanctions were imposed by the U.S. Congress, by votes of the House and \nthe Senate, and the signature of the President. What is being \nnegotiated between our negotiating partners, the United States, and \nIran, is an agreement--if they are successful, if the deal is struck--\nthat will prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear weapons state and will \nprovide, over time, relief from Iran from the international and U.S. \nsanctions that have been imposed. That is the framework.\n  We know the sanctions brought them to the table. We all understand \nthat, and we are very proud of the role we played, but it is Congress, \nand only Congress, that can permanently change or modify that sanctions \nregime.\n  We are going to have to act. So I just take exception with Senator \nJohnson's view that we are not going to act. We are going to act \nbecause only we can permanently change the regime. But what this bill \ngives us is an orderly way to consider the congressional review of this \nagreement or deal when it is finally reached.\n  I just wish my colleagues would not prejudge this. I have heard so \nmany people say something is going to happen. We don't know what the \nagreement is going to be. We don't even know if they are going to be \nable to come in with an agreement, but I will say this about the Obama \nadministration. When they came out with the framework agreement, there \nwere many Members of this Chamber who said Iran will never live up to \nthe commitments in the framework agreement; that they would break out, \nthey would not pull back, as they are committed to doing, and the \nsanctions regime would not be able to stay in effect. And guess what. A \nyear later they have complied with the framework agreement, and they \nhave in fact--the sanction regime has held tight during this period of \ntime with our negotiating partners.\n  Do I share many of the concerns of my friend from Wisconsin? I do. I \ndo share those concerns. I am concerned as to whether the agreement \nwill, in fact, be strong enough to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear \nweapons state. That is what we are going to look at in our committee, \nif we can pass this bill in the same bipartisan manner in which we did \nin committee--if we can do that, the Senator from Wisconsin, the \nchairman, the ranking member, all of us in the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee are going to get all the documents, we are going to have time \nto review it and be able to answer those questions. The vote we are \nhaving on the floor this week is whether we are going to have that \nopportunity.\n  I know these amendments are well intended. I understand that. I \nunderstand the deep feelings each Member has. But the bottom line, if \nthe amendment my friend is talking about got on the bill, we are not \ngoing to get that review, we are not going to have that orderly \nprocess. That is the fact.\n  So I think the debate on the floor is critically important. We have \nbeen debating this bill for a week. We started last Thursday, 19-to-0 \nvote in committee, not a single Democratic amendment. We think it is \ntime to move this bill forward to the United States House of \nRepresentatives.\n  And, yes, Senator Corker and I are going to accommodate the \nsuggestions that have been made by Members. We are finding a way to do \nthat, and we are going to continue to work that path. But at the end of \nthe day, this is a very serious issue, and I agree completely with \nSenator Graham and the comments he has made. This is an extremely \nimportant issue. It has to rise above our individual desires so, \ncollectively, we can achieve something for the American people. That is \nwhat they want us to do. We have it in our grasps.\n  I applaud the leadership of Senator Corker. He has to work with all \nthe Republican amendments that have been filed. Believe me, there is a \nlot of frustration on the Democratic caucus, also as to why this bill \nis still on the floor and hasn't passed by now. But if we get \neverybody's patience, I am confident Senator Corker and I will be able \nto work together so we can accommodate the reasonable requests of our \nMembers and get this bill moving to the United States House of \nRepresentatives.\n  But let us maintain the balance that the Senator Foreign Relations \nCommittee did, and let us do what the American people want us to do and \nthat is to listen to each other. We have different views. I understand \nthat. But the way we can reach common ground is to listen to each other \nand reach a reasonable compromise that doesn't compromise the \nprinciples of what we are trying to achieve. That is exactly what the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee bill does. I urge my colleagues to \nexercise some restraint. Let's get this bill to the House of \nRepresentatives.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S2548]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I wish to respond to the point frequently \nmade by the supporters of this bill that this is the only way--the only \nway--that this body, the Congress, the Senate and the House, will \nreceive the details of the deal. What the Senator from Maryland is \nsaying is that this President, our Commander in Chief, will be so \nbrazen, so arrogant as to negotiate and conclude an agreement of such \nimport, of such consequence, and he would then keep it secret from the \nAmerican people in this Congress. I hope that is not so. But if that is \ntruly the belief, I would be happy to modify my amendment to require \nthat same disclosure of the information of the details of the \nagreement. I would be happy to do that. I would be happy to work with \nthe other side to do so. But barring that agreement, I am still urging \nmy colleagues and I am urging this body to allow a vote on my \namendment, to clarify what this bill is and what it is not. It is not \nadvice and consent. It is the minimum--the minimum--threshold, the \nminimum involvement, the minimum input on the part of the American \npeople through their elected representatives to pass judgment to \napprove affirmatively such a consequential agreement with a mere \nmajority of votes of both Chambers of Congress. Is that asking so much?\n  It is true that we passed this bill out of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee with a unanimous vote, because we were granted assurances. I \nrealize this is a delicate negotiation. I realize our friends on the \nother side of the aisle simply refuse to have what I consider a minimum \ninvolvement.\n  Again, I appreciate and applaud Senator Corker for doing a bipartisan \nagreement, for reaching that agreement. But our understanding was that \nthis would be a completely open amendment process.\n  The Senator from Maryland points out that there are 66 amendments to \n1. Let's start voting on them. We will vote on the one Democratic \namendment. Let's start voting on ours. Eventually, we will tire. \nEventually, we will have made our points. Eventually, we will convey to \nthe American public what this bill is and what it is not.\n  Again, let me say, for a final time, what this bill provides. If \npassed, sure, we get the information which we should get, regardless, \nbut it sets up a process--a very convoluted process--of votes of \ndisapproval which would require 60 votes in this Chamber to pass. We \nassume it would be vetoed. Then it would require 67 votes in this \nChamber to override the veto and two-thirds of a vote in the House to \noverride that veto.\n  In effect--let me clarify one last time--instead of requiring the \nbare minimum of an affirmative vote of a majority of Members of both \nChambers of Congress, this bill would allow approval of this agreement \nby a simple majority in the House and only 34 Senators providing that \nrubber stamp of approval to a bill that could be incredibly \nconsequential and of which we will live with the consequences--the \nresults--for many, many years to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, again, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin \nand appreciate his service and his support of this bill. I agree with \nhim, and I wish it were different than it is. The fact is that we will \nhave a right to vote whether to approve or disapprove the lifting in \nthe normal way, but that will occur 4 or 5 years down the road. I think \nmost of us want to weigh in now before the sanctions regime totally \ndissipates.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to proceed as in morning business in order to introduce a \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Collins pertaining to the introduction of S. 1141 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Barrasso pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1140 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I send two amendments to the desk, one for \nmy own and one on behalf of Senator Rubio of Florida.\n  Mr. President, I have said time and again----\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, has there been a unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The quorum call has been vitiated.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I have said time and again that a nuclear-\narmed Iran is the greatest threat this country faces. I have said time \nand again that the Senate needs to have votes on the merits of this \nagreement.\n  The President has taken us down a very dangerous path. The President \nhas backtracked on his own words. He said that Iran needed to live up \nto all of its obligations under international law. Yet Iran still has \nnot disclosed the past military dimensions of its nuclear program.\n  The President said, after this negotiating process began in December \nof 2013, that Iran has no need for a fortified underground military \nbunker in Fordow. Yet our negotiators have conceded the existence, with \ncentrifuge cascades, of that underground military bunker.\n  The President has said we have to have fully verifiable, anywhere, \nanytime access to all sites in Iran to ensure they are not cheating on \nany agreement--to include their military sites. Yet the leaders of Iran \ncontinue to say that we won't be able to access their military sites. \nThere will be no intrusive inspections.\n  I and the Senator from Florida, as well as many other Senators, have \nsubmitted multiple amendments to ask for votes on these points. We have \nbeen consistently blocked from bringing up these amendments for a vote.\n  It is fine if you want to vote no. If you think Iran should keep an \nunderground fortified military bunker with centrifuge cascades. It is \nfine if you don't think they should have to disclose the past military \ndimensions of their nuclear program, but we need to vote. We need to \nvote now.\n  It is even fine if you agree with those points and that you think \nthis is a delicate agreement that has to be prevented from being \namended in any way. But we need to vote.\n  If you don't want to vote, you shouldn't have come to the Senate. If \nyou are in the Senate and you don't want to vote, you should leave. As \nthe Senator from Florida said yesterday, be a talk show host, be a \ncolumnist. It is time we have a vote at a simple majority threshold on \nall of these critical points.\n  We are talking about a nuclear Iran, the most dangerous threat to our \nnational security.\n  So the amendment I am offering first would simply take the language \nof the bill that came out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and \nadd those three points. First, that Iran shouldn't keep its nuclear \nfacility before it gets sanctions relief; that Iran can't get sanctions \nrelief until they disclose the past military dimensions of their \nnuclear program. They can't get sanctions relief until they accept a \nfully verifiable inspections regime.\n  We deserve a vote on this.\n\n[[Page S2549]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 1197\n\n              (Purpose: Amendment of a perfecting nature)\n\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 1197 at the \ndesk to the text proposed to be stricken by amendment No. 1140.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Cotton] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1197 to the language proposed to be \n     stricken by amendment No. 1140.\n\n  Mr. COTTON. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1198 to Amendment No. 1197\n\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I also call up for Senator Rubio a second-\ndegree amendment, amendment No. 1198 to amendment No. 1197.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Cotton], for Mr. Rubio, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1198 to amendment No. 1197.\n\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To require a certification that Iran's leaders have \n     publically accepted Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state)\n\n       On page 3, line 20, of the amendment, strike ``purpose.'' \n     and insert the following: ``purpose; and\n       ``(iii) the President determines Iran's leaders have \n     publically accepted Israel's right to exist as a Jewish \n     state.\n\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, again, these amendments would do two very \nsimple things: First, they would require a vote on whether Iran should \nget sanctions relief before it discloses past military dimensions of \nits nuclear program, before it closes its underground fortified bunker \nat Fordow, and before it submits to a fully verifiable, anytime, \nanywhere, no-notice inspections regime. Second, they would require Iran \nto acknowledge Israel's right to exist as a Jewish democratic state \nbefore they get nuclear weapons because they continue to say that \nIsrael would be wiped off the map, and if they get nuclear weapons, \nthey will have the means to do so.\n  It is my intent to insist upon a recorded vote on these amendments at \na simple-majority threshold. The Senate needs to vote. If you disagree \nwith these policies, vote no. If you agree with these policies and you \nthink this will upset a delicate compromise, then vote no and explain \nthat. But we need to vote, and we should start voting.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me point out a couple things. There \nare now 67 amendments, all of which have been filed by Republicans, \nnone by Democrats.\n  This bill passed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee 19 to 0. \nSenator Corker and I have been working with Republicans who have filed \namendments to try to accommodate them, and we have been making \nprogress. We have been trying to schedule additional votes. I thank \nSenator Corker and those who are cooperating with us in a way that we \ncan try to move this bill forward.\n  We are prepared to have votes, but I think some of the tactics that \nare now being deployed are going to make it much more difficult for us \nto be able to proceed in an orderly way. It is every Member's right to \ntake whatever actions they want to take, but I want to tell you that \nfor those of us who want to get this bill to the finish line, it gets a \nlittle frustrating.\n  We will continue to focus on a way forward on this legislation. But I \nwant to make it clear that we have been prepared to find an orderly way \nto proceed with votes and to deal with the issues Members have been \nconcerned about, but at times it becomes difficult with the procedures \nthat are being used.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member and the ranking \nmember's staff. I thank the minority leader's office for working with \nus on what was going to be a series of votes, tough votes. I have a \nsense that the context of this has just changed, and I regret that.\n  I have been working with numbers of Senators on some really \ncontroversial votes that we were willing to make, as we already have. \nAs a matter of fact, the only two votes we have had thus far were \nconsidered poison pill votes. My friend from Maryland was willing to \nhave more poison pill votes--if you want to call them that--tough \nvotes, but I sense the context of this may have just changed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, let's talk about poison pill amendments. I \nwould say these aren't poison pills; these are vitamin pills. They are \ndesigned to strengthen this legislation and to strengthen the U.S. \nnegotiating position.\n  Who could object that Israel has a right to exist as a Jewish state \nand that Iran should not be allowed a nuclear weapon if they won't \nrecognize that right? The President himself said they should close \ntheir underground fortified military bunker before they get sanctions \nrelief. We are simply asking for a vote on what the President himself \nhas said.\n  If the Senator from Maryland wants to talk about procedural tactics, \nlet's be perfectly clear what has happened here. The very first \namendment brought to the floor on this bill was designed to stop any \nother amendments from being offered.\n  For those of you watching, you should know that the only thing that \namendment says is that any final agreement must be submitted in Farsi \nas well as English. That is a noncontroversial proposal which I am sure \nwe could adopt by voice vote and move on in an orderly fashion to any \nother amendments. Yet, they continue to object to unanimous consent to \nbring up any other amendments, designed to stop the Senate from having \nto cast these votes.\n  The amendments we have offered are no more of a procedural tactic \nthan what the Senator from Maryland himself is doing--an amendment that \ncould have been offered in committee, an amendment that could have been \nvoted on easily on Tuesday when it was offered but is being used to \nblock consideration of any other amendment.\n  These are not tough votes. These should be easy votes. Again, if you \nwant to vote no, vote no. If you want to vote no and say it is designed \nto protect a compromise, do that. But we should be voting.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I know the Senator from Arkansas knows I \nhave no issue with taking tough votes, and I would take them all day \nlong.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act\n\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the \namendment that I plan to submit. It is amendment No. 1173. It is my \nintention to work with the managers of the Iran bill to get this \namendment filed and voted on soon. What I wanted to do is to talk about \nthis amendment for a little bit.\n  I want to begin by complimenting Senator Corker, Senator Cardin, and \nothers who have worked hard on the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of \n2015. It is a good start to a critically important issue for all of us \nand for the American people. The amendment that I am proposing and that \nI am offering today will make that bill stronger, will give leverage to \nour negotiators, and will make our country more secure. That is our No. \n1 priority. That is what this amendment will help us do.\n  The simple question this amendment proposes is this. Should the \nUnited States--our government, we, this body--allow sanctions to be \nlifted on a country that our own State Department has designated a \nstate sponsor of terrorism? It is a simple, straightforward question.\n  In my view, the answer is also simple. The answer is no. Sanctions \nshould not be lifted on a state sponsor of terrorism, especially one \nwith a track record like Iran.\n  My amendment requires the President of the United States to declare \nthat Iran is no longer a sponsor of state terrorism before lifting \nsanctions and allowing billions of dollars to flood into that country's \neconomy. It is that simple. We should not allow, facilitate or \nencourage billions of dollars to go to a country that sponsors \nterrorism, because I fear that we have been inured to the issue of \nstate sponsor of terrorism. I would like to focus on what that means a \nlittle bit.\n  Let's first start with the states that are on the list: Yemen, Syria, \nSudan, Iran. These countries are all on the list because governments in \neach state facilitate international terrorism. We are not talking about \nrogue elements within a country that are killing people within their \nown borders. We are talking about governments themselves, the bodies in \ncharge of a country, the bodies making and enforcing a country's laws, \nsupporting acts of international terrorism, including against our own \ncitizens.\n  Why is Iran on the list? Since its founding in 1979, the leaders of \nthe Islamic Republic of Iran and the government have been sponsoring \nterrorism. In fact, our State Department has called Iran the world's \nmost active sponsor of terrorism. Since 1979, Iran has been responsible \nfor taking American hostages, for bombing our and our allies' \nembassies, and for horrible acts of murder across the globe.\n  Here is the key point. It has not stopped. According to the State \nDepartment, Iran continues to support terrorism--Palestinian terrorist \ngroups--and is actively fostering instability throughout the Middle \nEast right now, today. Last month, March 2015, a U.S. Federal judge \nfound Iran complicit in the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole, the deadliest \nattack on a U.S. Navy vessel since 1987.\n  Let's talk about Iran's involvement in Iraq. I am a Marine Corps \nReserve officer. In 2005, I was recalled to Active Duty for a year and \na half, serving as a staff officer to the commanding general of the \nU.S. Central Command, John Abizaid. During that time, I deployed to \nmany parts of the CENTCOM area of responsibility. One of the biggest \nconcerns--perhaps the biggest concern--that we saw in Iraq during that \ntime was the increasing threat to our troops of improvised explosive \ndevices, especially what was referred to as explosively formed \nprojectiles, EFPs, the most deadly and sophisticated IEDs on the \nbattlefield.\n  Almost every time I was in Iraq with General Abizaid, he and his \nstaff were briefed on the details of this threat, showing captured \nweapons systems, the twisted, charred remains of military vehicles that \nhad been hit by EFPs. Those EFPs killed more American troops per attack \nthan any other roadside bombs. They blasted through tanks, humvees or \nanything they hit. They were deadly. They killed and maimed thousands \nof our troops.\n  I still remember the courage and trepidation I saw in the eyes of our \nbrave military members who had to face this threat on a daily basis, \neven some members of this body. To this day, I deeply distrust the \nleadership of the regime that was responsible for these EFPs.\n  Make no mistake, that country was Iran. That much was confirmed by \nour intelligence agencies and the State Department. But Iran has never \ntaken responsibility for these deaths, and it has not said that it will \nstop this kind of terrorism.\n  Let me provide an example. In 2007, CENTCOM and intelligence \nofficials provided very detailed briefings on the fact that these EFPs \nwere coming from Iran. At the same time, Iran's U.N. Ambassador wrote \nan op-ed in the New York Times and said that such charges and evidence \nwere being fabricated by the United States. That was the U.N. \nAmbassador from Iran, Ambassador Zarif. In that op-ed he was telling a \nlie to the American people.\n  Why is that important? He is now the Foreign Minister of Iran. He is \nnow in charge of negotiating this nuclear deal. He is certainly not a \ntrustworthy man.\n  If sanctions are lifted, billions of dollars are going to flow from \ncompanies and banks from around the world to the economy and government \nof Iran. They are going to invest in businesses. They are going to \ninvest in the oil and gas sector. They are going to invest in banks.\n  What will the Iranian leadership likely do with that money? Do we \ntrust them to invest in schools and infrastructure and health clinics \nso they can provide their citizens better lives?\n  Let's use history as our guide. Everything about that country's \nleadership and everything about that country's history tells us that \nthat money--billions--is likely to be used to pump up their terror \nmachine around the world and target American citizens.\n  I know what we have heard from the administration: Do not worry. If \nthere is a violation of this agreement, these sanctions will snap back \ninto place. They will snap back--no problem, piece of cake.\n  After serving on Active Duty for that time I mentioned, I served as a \nU.S. Assistant Secretary of State. I helped lead the effort in the Bush \nAdministration to isolate economically Iran, to go to our allies and \nsay you have to divest out of the Iranian oil and gas sector, the \nIranian financial sector.\n  There was no snap here. This was a slog. It took years to get \ncompanies to divest. Yet now this administration is talking that we \nwill snap back. No problem, we will divest in a couple of days. It is a \nfantasy. The Administration knows it. They should stop using the term \n``snapback'' because it is not accurate. It is not accurate.\n  What is the alternative? The alternative is simple. Before lifting \nsanctions on Iran, Iran needs to take the steps to get off the list of \ncountries that sponsor terrorism around the world. These are not \ninsurmountable steps. These would include having a clear record for 6 \nmonths. That is it, 6 months--not decades, not years--6 months of not \nsponsoring state terrorism.\n  It would also require Iran to renounce terrorism. Simple, don't \nengage in terrorism. Do not try to kill our citizens or the citizens of \nour allies. Do not send your forces around the world to blow things up \nor take hostages. Then we will consider lifting the sanctions. You do \nnot have to be our ally. You do not have to like us. We do not have to \nlike you. You do not have to change even the structure of your \ngovernment. You just should not target our citizens for murder the way \nyou are doing now as one of the biggest--the biggest--state sponsors of \nterrorism in the world.\n  It has been said that such a requirement and an amendment such as \nthis\n\n[[Page S2551]]\n\nwould be a poison pill, meaning that if this amendment is added to the \nCorker-Menendez bill, it will somehow signify the death of the bill. I \nhave thought long and hard about that. Do I want to be a Member of this \nbody who introduces a poison pill? Am I being unreasonable with this \namendment?\n  What I came to is this. It is our job--the most important job we have \nin this body--to do everything we can to keep our citizens safe and to \nenact good policy. Sometimes that means taking difficult positions, and \nsometimes it means taking very reasonable positions, even though the \npolitical process might make it seem as if this were a complicated and \ndifficult issue. This is not complicated. This is not difficult. This \namendment is a simple amendment. It is not difficult.\n  I wish to conclude with the question I began with. Is it good policy \nfor the United States of America to allow or even encourage countries \nand corporations to do business with a state sponsor of terrorism, \nparticularly one that has a history of targeting and killing our \ncitizens? Is that good policy?\n  I believe the vast majority of the American people--Democrat, \nRepublican, any State in the Union--would say no, that is not good \npolicy. I believe that if the question were posed directly to the \nAmerican people, they would not consider this some kind of poison pill. \nThey might even consider this some kind of vitamin pill, one that will \nmake us stronger. It is a supplement to strengthen our negotiators' \nposition.\n  Right now there is confusion. It is in the press. The Iranians are \nsaying we have a deal that lifts sanctions immediately. The President \nhas said no, that is not necessarily clear. We have to be creative on \nhow this is going to happen.\n  This amendment will give the President and Secretary Kerry the \nleverage to solve this critical issue, one that the President and the \nSecretary of State should use and welcome to strengthen our position in \nthe negotiations and not view it as some kind of poison pill.\n  Again, it is a simple amendment. Before sanctions are lifted, the \nPresident and the State Department need to make sure Iran is off the \nlist of states that sponsor terrorism. Iran could take the simple steps \nto make that possible and the world would be a much safer place.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    FDA Tobacco Deeming Regulations\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, a number of my colleagues came to \nthe floor yesterday to speak about the FDA's failure to release the \ntobacco deeming rule and the delays that have occurred with respect to \nthat rule.\n  As difficult as the American people may find it to understand why \nthere are these delays in issuing a rule that protects our citizens \nagainst tobacco use--most particularly our children--we should all \nunderstand that these rules have real-life consequences.\n  Tobacco, in fact, is the leading cause of preventable death. In this \nNation, tobacco use kills more than half a million people every year. \nMost smokers and tobacco users begin as children, many under the age of \n10. Each day, more than 3,200 people younger than 18 years old smoke \ntheir first cigarette, and the consequences are inevitable. Thousands \nof them will die early in life.\n  Cigarettes are the only product in the world that, when used as the \nmanufacturer intends it, kills the customer. If smoking continues at \nthe current rate among U.S. youth, 5.6 million of them are expected to \ndie prematurely from smoking-related illness.\n  Tobacco use is a path to addiction and disease, and it is a public \nhealth epidemic. Yet laws that protect the public, laws that forbid \nmarketing to children, laws that are designed to uphold the public \ntrust have been unimplemented.\n  My fight against Big Tobacco began in the 1990s, when I was attorney \ngeneral of the State of Connecticut. I helped to lead a lawsuit against \ntobacco companies for marketing to children. We succeeded in \nrestricting tobacco companies from selling to and targeting children in \ntheir ads through sporting events, magazines, and point of sale \nmethods. We helped reimburse the States for the enormous amount of \ntaxpayer dollars spent on tobacco-related diseases, and those payments \ncontinue today. They are supposed to be used for prevention and \ncessation activities, but unfortunately and tragically, much of that \nmoney is now used to fill gaps in State budgets.\n  I have continued my fight against the tobacco companies in the \nSenate, alongside dedicated colleagues such as Senator Merkley and \nSenator Durbin, who spoke yesterday, in urging the FDA to seek relief, \nto strive to do its job with the tobacco deeming rule in order to \nprotect children and families from tobacco.\n  The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 gave \nthe FDA significant power and responsibility to achieve this goal. Now \nit is the FDA's responsibility to implement that law to prevent young \npeople from becoming nicotine addicts, damaging their health, risking \ntheir lives, and costing the taxpayers hundreds of millions--in fact, \nbillions--of dollars.\n  Six years have passed since that law was passed. The FDA has yet to \nimplement it, and the reason is that it has yet to issue those \nregulations. It wasn't until last year, April 2014--5 years after the \nmeasure passed--that the FDA took the first step, issuing draft \nregulations known as the deeming rule that would formalize this \nauthority. The rule would allow the FDA to control the regulation and \nsale--in particular, the sale to minors--of e-cigarettes, as well as \ndangerous combustible products, such as hookah, pipe tobacco, and \ncigars.\n  This past Saturday, April 25, was the 1-year anniversary of the \nrelease of the proposed rule. Over the past year, youth use of \nunregulated tobacco products, such as e-cigarettes and the hookah, has \nskyrocketed. E-cigarette use has tripled among 11- to 18-year-olds, \nwhile hookah use has almost doubled.\n  There is clear data, absolutely irrefutable evidence that the rate of \nuse of these products has increased even as some of the use of tobacco \nproducts has diminished, and this chart illustrates that evidence. It \nindicates that use of the regulated products has diminished, while use \nof unregulated products has increased. So laws work. Rules have an \neffect. People can be saved from addiction and disease. And these \nproducts--cigars, pipes, hookahs, e-cigarettes--lead to tobacco use in \ncigarettes and addiction to nicotine. They create the same kind of \npublic health menace that tobacco products do.\n  We know that nicotine addiction is surging through e-cigarette use, \nwhich is a disastrous tribute to the ingenuity of Big Tobacco. In fact, \nmany of the big tobacco companies have bought the e-cigarette companies \nbecause they know they can use the e-cigarettes as a gateway nicotine-\ndelivery device, addicting children so that they will then shift to \ncigarette tobacco.\n  I am joining my colleagues in urging that the FDA act as quickly as \npossible to implement these rules, to finalize the regulations, to get \nthem out of the regulatory apparatus, the morass in which they are now \ntrapped, and make sure that our children and our citizens are protected \nagainst the marketing and other abuses that are involved in the current \nsale of these nicotine-delivery devices marketed to children.\n  I am also proud to be introducing today a new measure, the Tobacco \nTax and Enforcement Reform Act, which is supported by Senators Durbin, \nReed, and Boxer. I am very grateful to them for their leadership not \nonly on this measure but over many years in fighting this battle \nagainst nicotine addiction and tobacco use.\n  Congress has a continuing responsibility to combat cigarette smoking \ndirectly. Right now, there are a number of areas where loopholes and \ngaps exist in the enforcement structure. We need to do more to fight \nillegal tobacco trafficking. We need to eliminate the tax disparities \nbetween different tobacco products. These gaps in our laws and\n\n[[Page S2552]]\n\nlaw enforcement failures create opportunities and incentives for \nviolations of those laws, at great cost to the State with regard to \nillegal trafficking.\n  Similar to the changes outlined in the President's budget proposal, \nthis bill would also increase the Federal tax rate on tobacco products. \nIn fact, these reforms would help the Federal Government and States \ncollect nearly $100 billion at a time when our States are strapped \nfiscally and our Federal Government needs that revenue as well. These \nrevenues would not only reduce tobacco consumption, they would also aid \nthe fiscal well-being of our State and local governments.\n  Most importantly from the standpoint of law enforcement, it would \nforce criminals who engage in illegal trafficking to comply with the \nlaw. It would combat those criminals who profit from the illegal sale \nof these products and trafficking across State lines, who are selling \nillicitly and gaining huge numbers of dollars from that legal \nnoncompliance.\n  Economic research confirms that raising the price of tobacco reduces \nuse among young people, who are particularly sensitive to pricing. They \nare sensitive to price increases because they have less disposable \nincome and know they have fewer dollars to spend. They are more price-\nsensitive. In fact, every 10 percent increase in the real price of \ncigarettes will reduce the prevalence of adult smoking by 5 percent and \nyouth smoking by 7 percent. Adults are price-sensitive, too. Increasing \nthe cost of cigarettes makes people more likely to want to quit and to \npursue tobacco cessation, to break the nicotine habit and seek help \nthrough quit lines, the nicotine patch, and other pharmaceutical \nmeasures.\n  The current tobacco tax code has many loopholes that enable even the \nleast creative manufacturers to exploit them and incentivizes many \nmanufacturers to manipulate products so they can be classified in a \nlower tax category. These tax incentives and loopholes not only sharply \nreduce Federal revenues, but they increase the overall use of tobacco \nand tobacco-related harms. Eliminating these tax disparities, along \nwith the price, is one of the goals of the measure I am introducing \ntoday. By taxing all products at the same level as cigarettes, we can \nmake progress against nicotine addiction and the illnesses and diseases \nassociated with tobacco use.\n  The increase in tax rate on cigarettes by 94 percent per pack and \nsetting the rates for other tobacco products to an equivalent amount \nwould help people who are now addicted and would also help America \nbecause at the end of the day the real cost of cigarettes is not only \nto people who are addicted and who endure the suffering and the pain of \ncancer, lung disease, and heart problems, it is to their families and \nto all taxpayers. All of us--literally, all of us--pay for the diseases \nthat result from tobacco use through our insurance policies and through \nMedicare and Medicaid. We are the ones who bear the financial burden.\n  Due to these current tax inequities, the GAO has projected $615 \nmillion to $1.1 billion in losses to Federal tax revenue right now, and \ntobacco-related health problems cost the country almost $170 billion a \nyear in direct medical costs. We can save money and save lives through \nthis measure. I hope my colleagues will support it.\n  Every day that goes by without FDA regulation harms children. It \nhurts people who become addicted. It hurts all of America. Every day \nthat tax disparities exist, every day that illegal trafficking \ncontinues is a day when America pays in the casualties, human \nsuffering, loss of productivity, and loss of revenue.\n  I hope my colleagues will support these efforts.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Thank you, Madam President.\n\n\n                      Nuclear Agreement With Iran\n\n  I rise today to discuss the negotiations with Iran over its nuclear \nprogram. Many of my colleagues have spoken at length about some of \ntheir concerns, which I share. Today, however, I would like to discuss \nmy concern about the administration's increasing reliance on the idea \nthat sanctions can be snapped back into place in the event that Iran \nviolates an agreement.\n  In its press release on the framework agreed upon earlier this month, \nthe White House stated:\n\n       If at any time Iran fails to fulfill its commitments, these \n     sanctions will snap back into place.\n\n  On April 11, 2015, President Obama stated:\n\n       We are preserving the capacity to snap back sanctions in \n     the event they are breaking any deal. . . . And if . . . we \n     don't have the capacity to snap back sanctions when we see a \n     potential violation, then we're probably not going to get a \n     deal.\n\n  A week later, at a press conference with the Italian Prime Minister, \nPresident Obama played down the question of whether Iran would receive \nimmediate sanctions relief and insisted snapback provisions were more \nimportant. He said:\n\n       Our main concern here is making sure that if Iran doesn't \n     abide by its agreement, that we don't have to jump through a \n     whole bunch of hoops in order to reinstate sanctions. That is \n     our main concern.\n\n  I agree with President Obama's goal. Who wouldn't want harsh measures \nreinstated the moment Iran fails to comply with this agreement? The \nproblem is that reality is far more complicated than the simple phrase \n``snapback'' suggests.\n  In a Washington Post column last week, former CIA Director Michael \nHayden, former Deputy Director General of the IAEA Olli Heinonen, and \nMiddle East expert Dr. Ray Takeyh laid out the long and circuitous path \nthat any action to reinstate sanctions on Iran would have to take. \nTheir conclusion? That it could take an entire year or even longer to \nsimply confirm that Iran has actually violated its obligations and \nnavigate the bureaucratic process necessary to restore the sanctions on \nIran.\n  A recent article in the Wall Street Journal by Henry Kissinger and \nGeorge Shultz made a similar point. In it, they write:\n\n       Restoring the most effective sanctions would require \n     coordinated international action. In countries that had \n     reluctantly joined in previous rounds, the demands of public \n     and commercial opinion will militate against automatic or \n     even prompt ``snap-back.''\n\n  Some may argue that past history is irrelevant and that the \nnegotiations will produce a new process, allowing for a quick \nrestoration of the sanctions regime. Such a process would still be far \nfrom automatic since significant time would be required to confirm \nIran's violation, but recent comments by Russian Deputy Foreign \nMinister Sergey Ryabkov made clear that this idea is not in the cards. \nSpeaking last week on the idea of snapping back sanctions, he stated: \n``This process should not in any way be automatic.'' He went on to say \nthat decisions on this matter should be taken in accordance with the \nprocedures of the U.N. Security Council through voting in the Council \nand through the adoption of the appropriate resolutions. We must also \nbear in mind that sanctions take time to have effect.\n\n  The United States has had sanctions on Iran since 1979. One could \nargue that the heavy sanctions that brought Iran to the negotiating \ntable--they began back in 2010. But even in that case it took years to \ncreate enough economic pressure for Iran to even sit down with \nnegotiators. The idea that we will be able to swiftly reimpose \nsanctions and that those sanctions are going to swiftly cripple the \nIranian economy and that they are going to force Iran to change its \nbehavior--I believe that is simply implausible.\n  The point is the practical reality of this issue is much more \ncomplicated than the talking points suggest. To me, this underscores \nthe importance of getting a good deal with Iran. It demonstrates why a \nbad deal is so much worse than no deal at all. It took many years to \nbuild the global sanctions regime that brought Iran to the negotiating \ntable. The fact is that it can be dismantled much faster than it can be \nrebuilt.\n  We cannot afford to overlook key provisions or pretend that the \nprecise terms of this agreement are of lesser importance. Of all the \ntools we can use to influence Iran, sanctions relief is the most \nimportant. It should only be provided as part of a deal that is clearly \nin American interests. The security of our country, our families, and \nthe possibility of a nuclear Middle East hangs in the balance.\n\n[[Page S2553]]\n\n  There will be no simple snapback if this agreement does not hold. We \nneed to be honest with the American people and not rely on unrealistic \nnotions to justify any deal with them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I come to the floor to speak for a few \nminutes on the bill we are debating to provide some congressional \noversight over a potential--though not yet signed--deal with Iran.\n  I wish to start simply with what we all agree on. We all agree we \nneed to do whatever we can to ensure that Iran never obtains a nuclear \nweapon. I have no doubt that 100 Members of the Senate would agree with \nthat proposition. That is our guiding principle, and it should be our \nNorth Star. We may disagree on the best way to achieve a nuclear \nweapons-free Iran, but we can all agree on our goal.\n  So how do we get there is the question we are debating. I happen to \nbe a member of the camp who believes our best hope of achieving this \ngoal is through diplomacy, through a negotiated settlement that \ndramatically rolls back Iran's nuclear program in a transparent and \nverifiable way. While our negotiations still have a long way to go to \nget to that agreement, we are closer now than we have been in decades.\n  I, and many of my colleagues, strongly believe we should give our \nnegotiators the space to do their jobs and to see if a deal is \nultimately possible.\n  That is really what this bill does. It postpones a congressional vote \non these negotiations, appropriately, until the negotiations are \nfinished. That makes sense, right? There is no use on voting on a deal \nwhen we don't have a deal. And then it sets up time constraints for \nCongress's review of that potential deal, basically, about 30 days. \nThat is a reasonable period of time for us to debate the agreement, \nand, if there is one, there is some certainty over our process to those \nwho are at the negotiating table.\n  The President's critics seem to fall into two often overlapping \ncamps. One strain of argument holds that this framework agreement we \nhave right now is just too weak and that our side should walk away from \nthe table, reimpose sanctions, and hold out for a better deal.\n  The second strain of argument--evidenced, frankly, by many of the \namendments that have been filed to the underlying bill--holds that our \nnegotiations shouldn't be just about Iran's nuclear program, that we \nshould also be negotiating over all of the other bad things Iran does \nand supports.\n  Now, I don't think it is worth getting into a defense of a framework \ntoday since we are months away from a final deal. But to my mind, if \nthe final deal does look demonstrably like the framework, we would be \nfools to reject it. Does it allow Iran to do nuclear research? Yes, it \ndoes. Does it allow them to keep some centrifuges? Yes. But anybody who \nthought we were going to sign a deal that would effectively be an \nunconditional surrender was living in a fantasyland. The framework \naccomplishes our goal of protecting Israel, the region, and the United \nStates from a quick nuclear breakout. The plutonium pathway at Arak is \nended. Their enriched stores basically go down to zero. Fordow and \nNatanz stay open, but they can no longer do substantial enrichment, and \nthey are going to have international scientists and inspectors crawling \nall over their capacity. Inspections, on the entire nuclear supply \nchain, will be at a scale that is totally, completely unprecedented in \nthe history of the nuclear age.\n  It is a good framework. But even if you don't believe this, I just \nthink it belies common sense to think that walking away from the table \nnow would get you a better deal. Yes, we could reinstitute sanctions, \nthe United States could. Perhaps some of our partners would go along, \nbut they would be weaker than before because lots of countries that \nthink this is a good framework wouldn't go along with this. Just look \nat what Russia and China have announced in the past few weeks. They \nbasically have telegraphed that they are looking to do business with \nthe Iranians, notwithstanding what happens at the negotiating table. We \nknow what happens when we apply weak sanctions against Iran, alongside \na policy of isolating. They get stronger.\n  How do we know this? Because in 2002 we had a chance to cap Iran's \ncentrifuges at a few hundred. Instead, after years of relatively weak \nsanctions and international isolation, Iran built 20,000 centrifuges \nand put in place a secret nuclear facility.\n  Now, our most recent round of tough international sanctions--in part \nbecause of the policies of this Congress--worked to get to the table, \nto the negotiating table, but only because there was a credible offer \nof a negotiated solution. We know exactly what happens, what sanctions \nand isolation get us, because we tried it for years. It gets us 20,000 \ncentrifuges, no international inspections, and an increasingly hard-\nline and inward-looking regime.\n  This last point and result is important because the people of Iran \nactually don't think like their Supreme Leader. His grasp on power \nisn't absolute, in large part because Iranians are much more moderate, \nmuch more internationalist, and much more pro-American than their \nleader, generally.\n  Khamenei knows this, and that is why, when Iranian voters elected a \nmoderate, Western-oriented President, the Supreme Leader allowed his \nteam the space to negotiate this framework.\n  Now, no one can be certain, but it is certainly plausible to believe \nthat moderate forces inside Iran are winning and that our policy toward \nIran should consider whether our actions help the moderates or help the \nhard-liners. We don't want another hard-line administration, but we are \ngoing to get one if we walk away from these negotiations now, when \nthousands of Iranians are cheering the opening of relations with the \nWest. If we walk away, moderate voters are going to feel abandoned. \nHard-liners will be proven right. The two groups will be merged. \nPolitics inside Iran will shift inward and extreme again. For all of my \nRepublican colleagues who were so forceful in their criticism of the \nadministration, saying President Obama didn't do enough to support the \nGreen Revolution, you would do far more damage to this cause by ending \nreformers' hopes of rapprochement with the West right now.\n  Now, for the second argument--that we should settle all of our \ngrievances with Iran in one fell swoop right now, that this agreement \nis somehow illegitimate unless Iran renounces Hamas and Hezbollah, \nunless they get right with Israel, unless they end their other \nnonnuclear weapons programs, unless they release political prisoners, \nand so on and so on.\n  First, there is not a single person here who agrees with Iran's \nsupport for terrorism or its inflammatory rhetoric toward Israel. No \none is pleased with the Iranian regime's record on human rights or its \nfunding of Hezbollah.\n  But let's agree that an Iran that pursues these policies and has a \nnuclear weapon is a far worse outcome, one that should be avoided at \nall costs. The truth is that adding these issues into the nuclear \nagreement would mean no deal is possible.\n  In America, we are strong enough to be able to walk and chew gum at \nthe same time. We can negotiate with an enemy or adversary on one issue \nand reserve the right to fight another day or simultaneously on other \nissues. For evidence of this, I would ask my Republican friends to \nsimply look to their great, romanticized hero, President Ronald Reagan. \nWhen he was negotiating a nuclear weapons deal with the Soviet Union, \nhe did not simultaneously try to address the USSR's support for proxies \nin Central America or the Middle East or their provocative naval \nactivities in the Pacific Ocean, he knew that by taking one issue off \nthe table it would make America and the world safer, even if it didn't \naddress all of our grievances at once. He knew if he did put everything \non the table all at once, then there would be no progress.\n  Just as a little kid can't eat a hot dog all in one bite no matter \nhow hard he tries, we all have to make progress\n\n[[Page S2554]]\n\none bite at a time. That is often how life and, in fact, negotiations \ntend to work.\n  So I hope my colleagues will oppose these well-meaning amendments \nthat are being offered. They have laudable goals, but in the real world \nthey are simply unrealistic within the confines of these negotiations, \nand they will have the effect of killing the deal entirely.\n  On a broader scale, I hope when this debate is done, we can also ask \nourselves some bigger questions. Diplomacy is power. It is not \nweakness. Talking to your enemies has been part of our national \nsecurity toolbox for as long as we have existed as a nation.\n  This country is tired. It is weary of war for good reason. Ten years \nof conflict in Iraq didn't make us any safer, and a lot of people--\nheroes--died in the process.\n  But when we spend all of this time--the majority of this Congress--\nengaged in detailed oversight over the President's diplomatic endeavors \nand absolutely no time engaged in detailed oversight over a war in Iraq \nand Syria that is still, months and months later, unauthorized and \nextraconstitutional, then we send a bad message to America and to the \nrest of the world. We seem to have a developing double standard when it \ncomes to oversight. We are all over the President when he talks to our \nadversaries, but we stand down when he fights them--lots of oversight \nover peace, very little over war.\n  That is not where the American people are. They want their President \nto take extraordinary steps to avoid war. They don't want us to get \ndragged back into a ground war in the Middle East.\n  I am supporting this bill today because I will be first in line to \nreassert Congress's power to set foreign policy right alongside the \nPresident, but I don't support Congress sending a message that \ndiplomacy is somehow more worthy of rigorous oversight than military \naction.\n  I don't think this is where the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee is coming from, but there are certainly some Members of his \ncaucus who view power solely through a military lens. That is dangerous \nbecause, as we saw in Iraq, large-scale military operations kill a lot \nof terrorists, they kill a lot of bad guys, but they often create two \nfor every one they kill.\n  In the end, it is nonkinetic intervention that solves extremism, \nbuilding inclusive governments, lifting people out of destitution and \npoverty, countering radical propaganda, and showing an America that \nbacks up all of its talk about American civil liberties with action.\n  I am so thankful to Chairman Corker for taking the time to work on \nthis bill with Senator Cardin, Senator Menendez, and others to make it \nsomething we can truly rally around today. That takes guts to show \npatience, to give ground, and to talk to people whom you don't agree \nwith.\n  It is actually diplomacy that wins the day here more often than not. \nIt is our guiding value as a body, as an institution. It is what makes \nthis place work when it works, and we are best when we recognize that \nthe value of diplomacy and the results we get from it do not expire at \nthe edges of this Chamber.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we are finally seeing the Senate do what \nwe were elected to do, and that is the people's work. I am glad to see \nthere have been some reports in the press saying the 114th Congress and \nthe new majority are actually following through and keeping our \npromises by passing important legislation that helps make the American \npeople's lives just a little bit better.\n  One of the actions we have taken is the House and the Senate have now \nmet in a conference committee to agree on a budget. This is, \nunfortunately, an unusual event in recent history. It was 2009 when the \nlast budget was passed by the U.S. Congress. That is a little \nembarrassing. It is actually very embarrassing. It is a scandal, \nreally. But now we are finally getting back on track. I am glad to \nreport, as the Presiding Officer knows, that this is a budget that \nbalances in roughly 9 years. I wish it were sooner, but that is what it \nis. There are no tax increases. It also meets our obligation to keep \nthe country safe and the American people secure by plussing up some of \nthe defense accounts, which I believe is important. All of our \ncolleagues on our side of the aisle believe this should be our No. 1 \npriority. There are some things that only the Federal Government can \ndo, and national security is at the very top of that list.\n  So we will have a vote--perhaps as early as next Tuesday--on the \nbudget conference report.\n\n\n                 United States-Japan Alliance and Trade\n\n  Mr. President, yesterday, we had a joint meeting of Congress, and we \nheard from the leader of one of America's greatest allies, Prime \nMinister Shinzo Abe of Japan. I had a chance to meet the Prime Minister \nbriefly before his comments, and I told him: Mr. Prime Minister, I \nactually graduated from high school in Japan. My dad was in the U.S. \nAir Force and was stationed at Tachikawa Air Force Base, and that is \nwhere I attended my senior year in high school.\n  It was an honor for all of us to listen to the Prime Minister. As \nwere many of my colleagues, I was very encouraged to hear about his \nunwavering support for the U.S.-Japan alliance. This is one of the most \nimportant alliances the United States has in the world.\n  The Prime Minister spent a good amount of time talking about our \nshared values. He noted our mutual and unflinching commitment to \ndemocracy and freedom and our common goal of peace and prosperity.\n  One of the issues I was particularly glad to hear the Prime Minister \nspeak about was the shared values of freedom and democracy and why the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership is so important not just to the United \nStates, not just to Japan, but to all, I believe, 12 different \ncountries that are negotiating this important trade agreement.\n  I couldn't agree more about the importance of trade. Texas is the No. \n1 exporting State in the Nation, and that is one of the reasons we are \ndoing relatively well compared to the rest of the country economically. \nI know the Presiding Officer comes from an oil-producing and gas-\nproducing State that is booming as well. But one of the reasons my \nState is doing so well is because we figured out that the more people \nwe can sell goods and services to that we grow or we raise or we make, \nthe more jobs we have at home, the better our economy is, and the \nbetter our people are.\n  The Trans-Pacific Partnership fits right into that formulation \nbecause the United States occupies roughly 5 percent of the planet and \nwe represent about 20 percent of the purchasing power of the planet. So \nthat should tell us that 80 percent of the purchasing power lies \noutside and beyond our shores, and why in the world wouldn't we want to \ntrade with those other countries and sell goods and services to \nconsumers in Japan and all around the world, including the region of \nAsia on which the Pacific partnership is particularly focused?\n  The Prime Minister eloquently articulated that the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership promotes the spread of our values by reducing economic \nbarriers. It has been observed by smarter people than I that countries \nthat actually trade together are much less likely to go to war against \neach other. That just seems to be the way it works. And the more people \nwe can improve our economic ties to around the world--it improves not \nonly prosperity, it also improves the peace.\n  Prime Minister Abe understands how important this agreement is not \nonly for the 12 nations that make up the TPP but for the entire global \neconomy. This is at least in part because the 12 Asia-Pacific countries \ninvolved in the partnership make up 40 percent of the world economy. \nThankfully, the Prime Minister assured us that he will continue to work \nwith the United States to ensure the success of these negotiations.\n  In a short time--perhaps maybe next week or the week after--we will \nhave\n\n[[Page S2555]]\n\nan opportunity to take up trade promotion authority. This is \ncongressionally conferred authority to the executive branch to engage \nin negotiations and sets the parameters for those negotiations--very \nclear congressional direction for the President's negotiators, \nincluding Ambassador Froman, in negotiating this Trans-Pacific \nPartnership. Once the negotiations are concluded, then it will have to \nlie in public for up to 60 days, I believe the timeframe is, so the \nAmerican people can read it, to be completely transparent, and I think \nthat is a very important part of the process.\n  I would be remiss, as I suggested earlier, if I did not point out the \nimportant role of trade not only to the United States but also to my \nState of Texas. About $1.5 trillion of GDP is attributable to the State \nof Texas. If we were an independent nation--which we once were for 9 \nyears; from independence to the time we were annexed to the United \nStates in 1845--if we were still an independent nation, we would \nrepresent the 12th largest economy in the world. It would put us ahead \nof even robust economies such as those in Mexico and South Korea. It is \nprimarily because of the role of exports.\n  Energy is an incredibly important part of our economy, but it is not \nall of our economy. If we could do what the Presiding Officer and \nothers have advocated, which is to accelerate the export of liquefied \nnatural gas and perhaps reconsider the ban on exporting crude under \nsome appropriate circumstances, I think we could do even better.\n  According to a report released earlier this month by the Department \nof Commerce and the U.S. Trade Representative, Texas was far and away \nthe leader of goods exported in 2014, with $289 billion of goods \nexported--$289 billion. So, not to brag--well, Texans have been known \nto brag a little bit--but just to state the facts--let me put it that \nway. The State of California--the State with the second most goods \nexported by value--exported a sizable $174 billion worth. Now, that is \na lot, $174 billion for California, but it is still $115 billion less \nthan the No. 1 State of Texas. The same report revealed that Texas also \nboasts some 41,000 companies--many small- and medium-sized businesses--\nthat export goods globally.\n  For years, this impressive amount of trade has helped our economy \ncontinue to grow, while providing jobs for Texans across the State. In \nfact, more than 1 million jobs in Texas are supported by global \nexports. So why wouldn't we want to do more and create more jobs and \nmore prosperity and more opportunity?\n  I agree with Prime Minister Abe that the Trans-Pacific Partnership \ndeal is vitally important to the United States, particularly at a time, \nas we learned--I guess it was yesterday, maybe the day before--that the \ngross domestic product of the United States had grown by an anemic .2 \npercent in the last quarter, essentially saying our economy has \nflatlined. That is dangerous, and it is also painful for the families \nof people who are out of work or who are looking for work or those who \nhave simply dropped out of the workforce. We need to do better by \ngrowing our economy and creating those jobs so people can find work and \nprovide for their families.\n  The Trans-Pacific Partnership would help Texas businesses. It would \nalso help our farmers and ranchers, both big and small. Obviously, the \nagricultural exports and particularly the beef and poultry and pork \nexports to a country such as Japan would be very important.\n  As the President said the other day, if we don't enter into this \nTrans-Pacific Partnership deal where we will be setting the rules, \nalong with these 12 countries--if we don't do this, what will happen is \nthat China will, in essence, be setting the rules for Asia. That is a \ncircumstance we should not sit by and let happen.\n  Increasing trade in the region will also provide a way forward for \n21st-century industries that have made a home in Texas, including \nelectronics and machinery. We are not as well known for electronics \nmanufacturing and machinery as we are for the energy business or \nfarming and ranching and agriculture. But, importantly, as Prime \nMinister Abe mentioned yesterday, the TPP goes far beyond just economic \nbenefits; it also provides the United States an opportunity for greater \ninfluence in the region and in the process promotes not only \nprosperity, as I said earlier, but also stability and security.\n  Just last week, the Dallas Morning News made this point well by \nsaying that TPP is ``not just about exports and imports; it's also \nabout enhancing America's role among Pacific nations and standing \nstrong against an assertive China.'' President Obama made that point as \nwell, and I happen to think in this case he is absolutely right.\n  Texas and our entire country stands to gain a lot from this pending \ntrade deal. I am happy to see the President is promoting this among \nsome members of his own party, who are a little bit divided on this \nissue. I think it is fair to say that on this side of the aisle we are \na little more unified on this issue. This is not, though, an objective \nwe are going to be able to get done unless the President steps up and \ndelivers votes from that side of the aisle from members of his own \npolitical party, and I hope he will roll up his sleeves and he will \ndive right in and engage and produce those votes. We can't produce \nthose votes on that side of the aisle; only the President, the leader \nof his party, can do that.\n  So I am happy to see that this Chamber, this U.S. Senate, has \ncontinued in a spirit of bipartisanship by passing trade promotion \nauthority out of the Senate Finance Committee, and I hope we will take \nit up here as a body very soon.\n  In conclusion, this legislation will open up American goods and \nservices to American markets, which is good for our economy, good for \njobs, and good for better wages for hard-working Americans, including \nTexas families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nIran Nuclear Agreement Review Act that is before the Senate today. I \nthank Senator Corker and Senator Cardin for their incredible work \nbringing people together on the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill as written. We \nmust move forward to pass this legislation as quickly as possible to \nensure that Congress has a role in reviewing any proposed nuclear \nagreement with Iran.\n  This is a critically important bill at a critically important time. \nPreventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is one of the most \nimportant objectives of our national security policy, and I strongly \nsupported the sanctions every step of the way that brought Iran to the \nnegotiating table.\n  I have also supported the diplomatic efforts to address the threat \nposed by Iran's nuclear program. The framework that was reached in \nSwitzerland earlier this month is a positive step forward, but I think \nwe all know that this process is far from complete.\n  There are so many unanswered questions on the military dimensions of \nIran's nuclear program, on how its uranium stockpile would be handled, \nunder what circumstances any sanctions relief would be provided, and \nthe timing of that relief.\n  It is clear that there are still differences between Iran and the \nrest of the international community on these issues. I believe it is \nimportant that negotiations continue to pursue a final agreement by \nJune 30 that comprehensively addresses the threat posed by Iran's \nnuclear program. Again, one of the most important objectives of the \nU.S. national security policy is to prevent Iran from obtaining a \nnuclear weapon.\n  The bipartisan legislation before us today will set up a process for \nCongress to review any final nuclear agreement with Iran. It ensures \nthat Congress, which through its actions brought Iran to the table, \nwill have access to all the final details of the agreement. It \npreserves our right to have a final say in the potential lifting of the \nsanctions that we led on. That is how we were involved in compelling \nIran to negotiate in terms of these sanctions.\n\n[[Page S2556]]\n\n  Senators Corker and Cardin worked so hard to strike a careful balance \nbetween the Executive's prerogative to pursue the negotiations and \nCongress's role in reviewing any nuclear agreement. Their negotiations \nwere a success, as I said. The bill passed the Foreign Relations \nCommittee unanimously, 19 to 0, 2 weeks ago. That is a committee with a \nnumber of Senators with a broad range of views on every issue, \nincluding foreign relations and including these negotiations.\n  The President, who had long threatened to veto any such bill, has \nagreed to sign it. This is a significant victory for the Senate and \nalso for congressional oversight of foreign policy, something many of \nus have been pushing for.\n  Any nuclear agreement with Iran will have significant long-term \nimplications for the United States, for Israel, and for our allies in \nthe region. So it is critical that Congress have the opportunity to \nreview it.\n  This bill ensures that we have that opportunity. That is why it is so \nimportant that we act now to pass this legislation without delay and \nwithout amendments that undercut the bipartisan agreement on this bill.\n  Right now, I understand there are negotiations over a number of \namendments that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to \noffer. I think we know that a number of these amendments appear to be \nwritten in a way that would undermine the bipartisan support for the \nbill or would somehow make this bill much more difficult in terms of \nhaving a process.\n  All this bill is, from my mind, is a process to review. Instead of \nhaving a haphazard process, this actually gives Congress something for \nwhich we have been asking for a long time. It has given us that ability \nto review this agreement and have a vote on it. I don't know how many \ntimes I have heard my colleagues from the other side of the aisle talk \nabout it--and my colleagues on this side of the aisle. We finally have \na bipartisan way to do it. So I think we need to be very careful when \nmoving forward and look at some of these amendments.\n  I certainly share my colleagues' deep mistrust and skepticism of the \nIranian regime. I am appalled by the continuing human rights abuses, \nthe unjustified detention of American citizens--everyone, from the \nWashington Post reporter to a former marine to a Christian pastor. I \nabhor the vicious threats we are hearing against Israel and against \nIsraeli leaders, the track record supporting anti-Semitism and the \nHolocaust denial. I am deeply concerned about the destabilizing actions \nin the region, including Iran's efforts to obtain more advanced \nmissiles, and the support for militant forces and terrorists.\n  I think we all know the issues that are going on here. It is \nincredibly important that we work to address these issues, but there \nmust be a recognition of the fact that what we are talking about here \nis a nuclear agreement. I think every Senator is going to want to look \nat that agreement and say: Does this make things safer or not? What \neffect does this have on Israel? Is it safer to have Iran have nuclear \ncapabilities when they have shown the propensity to do all of these \nother things that I have just mentioned? I think many of us come down \non the side that we want to see this agreement but we are pleased these \nnegotiations are going on. We are particularly thankful that Senator \nCorker and Senator Cardin were able to come to an agreement on a \nprocess and to get that agreement through a highly diverse committee in \nterms of their political views and to get that agreement through on a \n19-to-0 vote.\n  Also, I might add that we don't want to revive the threat of a \nPresidential veto here. I know many of these amendments sound appealing \nto many of us but not if they are going to be used as a way to bring \ndown this process, the review agreement, and that is essentially what \nwould happen.\n  We do not want to be damaging our own ability to ensure that \nsanctions relief will only come from a strong agreement that prevents \nIran from obtaining nuclear weapons. I would think that outcome would \ncertainly be fine with the Iranians, if that is what happens. As our \nRepublican colleague from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, pointed out \nrecently, ``Anybody who offers an amendment that will break this \nagreement apart . . . the beneficiary will be the Iranians.''\n  So let's not give the Iranians a victory. Let's pass this bill on a \nstrong bipartisan vote, and let's do it now so it is clear that \nCongress stands united and we want the ability to review this \nagreement. Our foreign policy is more effective when we speak with one \nvoice. It may be simplistic to say that politics should stop at the \nwater's edge, but when it comes to Iran, the fact is, we have been \nunified. The past three votes in favor of major sanctions legislation \nin 2010, 2011, and 2012 have been unanimous--99 to 0, 100 to 0, and 94 \nto 0 respectively. And now the Iranians are at the table negotiating a \nnuclear agreement. That is because we stood together across party \nlines.\n  We have stood together and been strong and unified as a country. The \ntime has come to show we are serious again--serious about ensuring that \na final agreement is strong and enforceable and, most importantly, \nblocks Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. We may not agree on \neverything, but we must certainly agree on something that so many of us \nhave been talking about--a role for the Congress, a role for the Senate \nin having a say over this agreement. That is all this bill is about. \nPassing this bill will show our commitment to our country's security \nand the security of our allies and our partners. It transcends partisan \npolitics, and that is something that, when it comes to foreign \nrelations and when it comes to dealing with a country such as Iran, \nmust stop at the water's edge.\n  I thank our colleagues, Senator Corker and Senator Cardin, for \nworking so hard to negotiate this agreement--simply a process of \nreview--so that we can finally have a say, and I ask my colleagues to \nsupport this.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, sometimes when I travel, people ask me \nwhat I do, and I tell them I am a retired Navy captain. And then they \nsay: Well, what do you do now? And I tell them I am a recovering \nGovernor. Then they say: Well, now that you are recovering, what do you \ndo? I tell them I am a servant.\n  Once, one guy said to me on an airplane: What do you mean you are a \nservant?\n  I said: I serve the people of Delaware.\n  He said: Are you like a butler?\n  And I said: No, not really, but I do serve.\n  But I still think like a retired recovering Governor. I am proud to \nbe able to serve here. I loved being in the Navy. But at heart, I still \nthink and act a good deal like a retired Governor. Those others who \nserve here in this body who have served as the chief executive of their \nState sometimes feel the same way about how they approach their job. I \nlove doing that. I feel really lucky to have that choice. I feel very \nlucky to be here to serve Delaware, the First State, in this capacity.\n  One of the key takeaways from my time as the chief executive of my \nState was that when we had to negotiate deals, whether with our \nneighboring States or with the Federal Government or actually with \nfolks who were thinking of starting a business in Delaware or growing a \nbusiness in Delaware, we had to do so with one unified voice in order \nto be effective.\n  Now, we were trying to bring AstraZeneca, one of the largest \npharmaceutical companies in the world, and convince them to put their \nNorth American headquarters in Delaware. We didn't have the whole \nlegislature to negotiate that deal. My cabinet and I were involved in \nthat negotiation, and we got a signoff from the legislature, at least \nindirectly. We just couldn't have competing messages coming from all \nthe various elected officials, State senators, State representatives, \nand so forth. The reason is that this would have undermined in some \ncases very sensitive negotiations and hindered our ability to work \nthrough some already tough issues. While I would consult\n\n[[Page S2557]]\n\nwith Delaware's other State and local officials, as appropriate--and I \nvalued their insight and their opinions, even when I didn't necessarily \nagree with all of them any more than they agreed with me--at the end of \nthe day, as chief executive of our State, I had to be the final \ndecisionmaker in a lot of cases in negotiating or advocating on behalf \nof Delaware.\n  Now, as a U.S. Senator, I take really a very similar approach to \nnegotiating on many issues, including matters of foreign policy. I \nsupport the idea that when the United States conducts diplomacy with \nforeign governments, the United States should speak to that government \nwith a unified voice.\n  Our system is set up so that we do not have 535 Members of Congress \nserving as negotiators and diplomats--and for good reason. That is the \ncase with trade deals--the kind of deal we are trying to negotiate \ntoday with 11 other countries that come from this hemisphere all the \nway over to Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Japan, and Vietnam. But \nif we fail to speak with a unified voice in most of those negotiations, \nincluding the one I just mentioned, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, then \nforging international agreements with other countries is going to be \nreally tough and in some cases just about impossible.\n  When it comes to the negotiations with Iran over its nuclear \nprogram--the negotiations that involve not just Iran, not just us, but \nthe five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and \nGermany as well--I have been a strong proponent of giving the President \nand his negotiating team the flexibility they need to achieve the best \ndeal for our Nation.\n  I know many of our colleagues have strong views on the need for \nCongress to play a direct role in the negotiations and to make sure \ntheir voices are heard in this process. I understand that position, and \nI respect that position as well.\n  There are also some in the Senate who believe that the best deal with \nIran is, frankly, no deal at all, and they are trying to maximize their \nability to kill the nuclear deal with Iran before it is ever finalized.\n  Another key lesson I learned as Governor--and I am constantly \nreminded of it in the Senate--is that forging compromise is no easy \ntask. Bridging the divide of competing interests is never easy, \nespecially on issues as important as negotiations over nuclear weapons \nand Iran. But that is what my colleagues--our colleagues--in the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee recently did.\n  Specifically, Senators Corker of Tennessee and Cardin of Maryland, \none a Republican and one a Democrat, worked to forge a compromise that \nidentifies an appropriate role for Congress in these nuclear talks. \nThis compromise will enable the President to maintain his prerogative \nas our Nation's Chief Executive and Commander in Chief to negotiate on \nbehalf of the United States, while also ensuring that Congress is able \nto weigh in on the final product of those negotiations should they come \nto fruition. In my mind, that is a reasonable compromise that we should \nall support regardless of our opinion on the prospect of the President \nreaching an acceptable deal with Iran.\n  Let me explain why. First of all, Senator Corker and Senator Cardin's \ncompromise satisfies one of my key goals of not undermining our \nnegotiating team before any final deal can be reached with the \nIranians.\n  Second, for those who insist that Congress be given a chance to weigh \nin on a final nuclear deal with Iran, this bill that we are debating \ntoday and will probably debate a little more next week will empower \nMembers of Congress to cast a vote for or against any final deal before \nit is implemented.\n  Finally, for those Members who think that no deal is the best deal, \nthis bill gives those Members the opportunity to make their case to our \nrespective colleagues at an appropriate time.\n  Now, Senators Corker and Cardin should be commended for their \ntireless work to strike a compromise that should satisfy many of our \ncolleagues--not all, but many. I know they worked with the White House \nto craft a bill that does not cut the legs out from underneath our \nnegotiators as they work to finalize a deal with Iran, and I want to \nthank them for preserving the administration's ability to negotiate and \nthe Congress's ability to weigh in on the final deal.\n  As we cast our votes on amendments and final passage of this bill, I \nwould encourage us to consider the delicate nature of the compromise \nthat Senators Corker and Cardin have struck.\n  Too often in Washington we focus on what divides us rather than what \nunites us. That is unfortunate and sometimes counterproductive for our \ncountry--not just on this issue but on a host of important policy \nmatters. Compromise should not be a rare occurrence in our Nation's \nCapital. Rather, it should be one of our guiding principles.\n  We should seize this opportunity, colleagues, to advance a compromise \nthat meets the needs of many of our colleagues, the President, and our \nNation. I urge our colleagues to join me in supporting Senator Corker \nand Senator Cardin's legislation.\n  Some of my colleagues have heard me say before, whenever I meet \npeople who have been married for a long time, I love to ask those who \nhave been married 50, 60, 70 years: What is the secret for being \nmarried 50, 60 or 70 years? I get a lot of different answers, as you \nmight imagine. Some of them are very funny, and some are quite \npoignant.\n  Some of my favorites include a couple married over 50 years. I asked \nthem not long ago: What is the secret to being married 50 years?\n  The wife said of her husband: He could be right or he could be happy, \nbut he cannot be both.\n  More recently, with a couple who has been married over 60 years, I \nasked the husband and wife: What is the secret to being married over 60 \nyears? And each of them gave a different answer. The wife said \npatience, and her husband of 60 years said a good sense of humor. That \nis pretty good advice as well.\n  I have asked this question hundreds of times over the years, but the \nbest advice I have ever heard in asking that question is years ago from \nthe answers of a couple who had been married 65 years or so.\n  I said: What is the secret of being married 65 years?\n  They both said almost at the same time: The two C's.\n  The two C's. I had never heard that one before.\n  I said: What are the two C's?\n  One of them said: Communicate.\n  That is good.\n  The other one said: Compromise.\n  Those are two pretty good C's.\n  Since then, I have invoked their words any number of times, including \non this floor and here in Washington, DC, and in my own State of \nDelaware.\n  Over the years, I have added a third C to it. The third C is \ncollaborate--collaborate. If you think about it, those two C's or those \nthree C's--communicate, compromise, and collaborate--are not just the \nsecret for a vibrant and long marriage between two people; they are \nalso the secret to a vibrant democracy.\n  As one of the Members of this body, I wish to again express my thanks \nto Senators Corker and Cardin for communicating, for compromising, and \nfor collaborating in a way that could bring about a better future for \nmy kids, your kids, our grandchildren, and hopefully for the people of \nIran and hopefully for the people of Israel and a lot of other nations \nthat have a real interest in this issue--as we say in Delaware, a dog \nin this fight.\n  As I close, I thank you for this opportunity to speak today. I hope \nwhen we vote next week we will reward the efforts of those Senators \nwith the two C's--Cardin and Corker--and further embrace the three \nC's--communicating, compromising, and collaborating--embrace their \nefforts with an ``aye'' vote.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    FDA Tobacco Deeming Regulations\n\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, technology can be transformative. The \nblack rotary phones have given way to iPhones. Sunlight and wind have \nbecome electricity. Camera tripods have\n\n[[Page S2558]]\n\nbegotten selfie sticks. There are certain things, however, that do not \nneed to be reimagined, repurposed or redesigned. There are items that \nserve no societal benefit whatsoever.\n  Example No. 1, the cigarette. Yet new cigarettes have exploded into \nthe marketplace, known as everything from e-cigs to advanced nicotine \ndelivery systems, to vaporizers. Similar to many emerging technologies, \nthese products are designed to appeal to young people, are more \naccessible to young people, and are explicitly marketed to young \npeople, and because of this, we are being forced to write another dark \nchapter in the history books.\n  After more than four decades of research, there are several \nincontrovertible facts. Nicotine is addictive. It affects brain \ndevelopment, and in combination with tobacco, it is responsible for \nclaiming millions of lives. These facts are true and were true decades \nago, at the same time that Big Tobacco willfully, consistently, \npublicly, and falsely denied them.\n  Today, e-cigarette sales in the United States alone top $1 billion. \nThe use of e-cigarettes among middle and high school students tripled \nfrom 2013 to 2014, accounting for upward of 13 percent of high school \nstudents. New data reports that nearly 2.5 million American young \npeople currently use e-cigarettes.\n  This data is not at all surprising when we consider the way these \nnicotine delivery products are targeted at young people and how these \nproducts are available in a myriad of flavors from cotton candy to \nvanilla cupcakes, to Coca-Cola. Strawberry-flavored vape liquid can \ncontain just as much nicotine, and sometimes more, as a traditional \ncigarette.\n  We know from years of research that flavors attract young people, and \nthe younger a person is when they start tobacco use, the more difficult \nit will be for them to quit. That is why Congress explicitly banned the \nuse of cigarettes with flavors like cherry and bubble gum because of \ntheir appeal to young people.\n  Over the past decade, we have made great strides educating children \nand teens about the dangers of smoking. We cannot allow e-cigarettes to \nsnuff out the progress we have made preventing nicotine addiction and \nits deadly consequences.\n  E-cigarette use is growing as fast as the students who are using \nthem, and we need to put in place the rules to ensure that we stop it. \nFirst, we need to ban the marketing of e-cigarettes to young people in \nthe United States. Second, we need to ban the use of flavorings. The \nuse of fruit- and candy-based flavors is clearly meant to attract \nchildren. Cherry Crush e-cigarettes pose the same addiction risk as the \nminty Kools of the 1970s. Third, we should ban online sales of e-\ncigarettes. The FDA should prevent online sales of these devices to \nkeep the product out of the hands of children. Finally, last week \nmarked 1 year since the FDA proposed long-overdue regulations to govern \ne-cigarettes. This is the first step to making sure children and teens \ncan be protected from the harms of these devices. But 1 year later, \nthese rules still have not been finalized. Until they are, new \ncigarettes will continue to target young people with appealing \nmarketing, advertising, and product flavoring. Every day the FDA fails \nto act is another day young Americans can fall prey to harmful products \npushed by the tobacco industry.\n  Last year, at a commerce committee hearing, I asked several e-\ncigarette company leaders to commit to ceasing the sale of these types \nof flavored products, and a few of them agreed, but the vast majority \nhave not and will not stop this marketing campaign.\n  Today's electronic cigarettes are no better than the Joe Camels of \nthe past because e-cigarettes, children, and teens do not mix. Young \npeople are getting addicted to nicotine and putting their health and \ntheir futures at grave risk. It is time for the FDA to step in and stop \nthe sale of these candy-flavored poisons, especially to the children of \nthe United States.\n  My father started smoking two packs of Camels when he was 13 years of \nage. It was the cool thing to do. My father died from lung cancer. The \ntobacco industry denied that there was any linkage between tobacco and \nsmoking and cancer and death. My father died from it. He started \nsmoking at age 13 because it was the cool thing to do. Once you are \naddicted at the age of 13, 14 or 15 and smoking two packs of Joe Camels \na day, it is hard to stop.\n  Here is something else we know: If a young person doesn't start to \nsmoke until they are 19, they are highly unlikely to start at all \nbecause they have reached beyond the point where it is attractive to \nthem from a peer pressure perspective. So what do these companies have \nto do? These companies have to find a way to market to young people by \ngiving them flavored e-cigarettes and making it appealing to them \nbecause they have to get them when they are 13, 14, 15, and 16 years \nold. That is the marketing plan.\n  It has always been the marketing plan since my father started smoking \nwhen he was 13. He would say to me: Eddie, you have no idea how hard it \nis to stop. You have no idea how much I need to smoke and how much I \nneed the nicotine. You could see it. He started when he was a kid, and \nthat is the way it begins because people don't start smoking when they \nare 20 years of age. We all know that. Everyone listening to me knows \nthat, and that is why this marketing campaign is so invidious. That is \nwhy what they are doing plays right into what we have known for a \ncentury is the business plan of the tobacco industry.\n  I urge the FDA to act. I urge the Members of this body to rise up to \nensure that we do not have another generation that suffers the same \nfate as the previous generations have, in fact, had to live with, which \nis this addiction that was given to them at a very young age.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the opportunity to speak this \nafternoon, and I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I echo the voices of my friends and \ncolleagues, the Senators from Oregon, Massachusetts, Ohio, and Rhode \nIsland in calling on the FDA to act with all possible speed to issue \nfinal rules on regulating e-cigarettes. I want to thank especially my \nfriend from Oregon, Senator Merkley, and my friend from California, \nSenator Boxer, who have been real leaders on this issue.\n  The Federal Government has an imperative to protect the public from \ndangerous products with commonsense restrictions. E-cigarettes are no \nexception. Their use among middle schoolers and high schoolers has \nskyrocketed--tripled among high schoolers according to a recent \nNational Youth Tobacco Survey--and their risks are numerous.\n  E-cigarettes contain liquid nicotine, an addictive chemical which can \nimpede brain development when consumed at a young age.\n  And these liquid nicotine containers are often sold without child \nprotection caps in many parts of the country--and there have been far \ntoo many tragedies already of young children accidentally ingesting \nliquid nicotine. In Fort Plain, in upstate New York, a toddler of 18 \nmonths lost his life in such an accident--a terrible tragedy for two \nyoung parents. It is what propelled my home State to pass a requirement \nthat all these liquid nicotine bottles be sold with child protection \ncaps.\n  But, as my colleagues pointed out, the companies that sell these e-\ncigarettes are largely unregulated at the Federal level. In terms of \nFederal policy, e-cigarette companies are not even barred from selling \nto minors under the age of 18. So they market to children--on TV and on \nbillboards and with child-friendly labels and flavors. According to a \n2014 study, e-cigarette marketing exposure to children from 12 to 17 \nyears old increased by 256 percent between 2011 and 2013. The FDA needs \nto be the adult in the room and put an end to these cynical marketing \nploys. The FDA, including the new commissioner, seem ready and eager to \nuse the Tobacco Deeming Rule to regulate e-cigarettes under the Family \nSmoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. We strongly support their \nposture, but we need them to strengthen and finalize these rules. It is \ntime for the FDA to put our children first and promulgate these rules.\n  Just yesterday, 31 prominent national organizations including, \nCampaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, Trust for America's Health, the \nAmerican Lung Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, sent \na letter to the President asking the FDA to finalize\n\n[[Page S2559]]\n\nthese regulations. Cigarette use has drastically declined in the last \ndecade and we have made great strides in educating children about their \nharmful effects. E-cigarettes, with their misleading and trendy \nmarketing, are threatening to set back that progress. Now it is time to \nsnuff out the tactics that try to put kids on the path to smoking.\n  Mr. MARKEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse).

GORDON J. CHRISTENSEN\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is an honor today to pay tribute to a \nrenowned educator and a highly regarded prosthodontist, Dr. Gordon J. \nChristensen. Dr. Christensen has had a meaningful impact on dentistry \nacross the Nation, and he continues to influence the field today \nthrough his wide-reaching publications.\n  Appropriately, the board of directors of the CR Foundation will be \nhonoring Dr. Christensen for his contributions to the field at its \nupcoming 40th Anniversary Celebration on May 8, 2015.\n  Born on November 10, 1936, Gordon Christensen completed predental \nstudies at Utah State University in 1956 and received a DDS degree at \nthe University of Southern California in 1960. He completed a master's \ndegree in restorative dentistry at the University of Washington in 1963 \nand earned a PhD in higher education and psychology at the University \nof Denver in 1972. Dr. Christensen has also received honorary doctorate \ndegrees from Utah State University and Utah Valley University.\n  In 1976, Dr. Christensen and his wife, Dr. Rella Christensen--a well-\nrespected dental consultant--started Clinical Research Associates, now \nknown as the CR Foundation. He is presently serving as CR's chief \nexecutive officer and is a member of the board of directors. Dr. \nChristensen and his wife volunteer full-time for CR to conduct research \nin all areas of dentistry.\n  The Christensens publish the findings of their research in the Gordon \nJ. Christensen Clinicians Report, a publication of the CR Foundation. \nThe Clinicians Report is translated in 7 languages and distributed to \nmore than 100,000 dentists across 92 countries. The Christensens have \ndeveloped an expansive readership, and their groundbreaking research \nhas positively impacted the dental health of hundreds of thousands of \npatients worldwide. Dental professionals who subscribe to Clinicians \nReport are unreserved in their praise of Dr. Christensen. I would like \nto share some of the appreciation Dr. Christensen recently received \nfrom three dental professionals. Richard K. Dimsdale, DDS, wrote: \n``Dentistry would never have made the advances it has over many years \nwithout the help, guidance, & research you have contributed!'' Ted \nCross, DDS, wrote: ``The Gordon J. Christensen Clinicians Report has \nnot only saved me tens of thousands of dollars of purchasing mistakes, \nbut has also immeasurably improved the care my staff and I offer our \npatients.'' And Bob Dolan, DDS, wrote: ``I recently retired after 54 \nyears of practice. I believe I have been in contact with Gordon for 20 \nor 30 or more years and have really appreciated the great-unbiased \ninformation. Thank you Gordon (and your dear wife) for all you have \ndone for me and for dentistry these many years.''\n  Dr. Christensen also founded and directs Practical Clinical Courses, \nPCC, in Utah, an international continuing education organization \nproviding courses and videos for dental professionals. In connection \nwith PCC, he has presented over 45,000 hours of continuing education \nthroughout the world.\n  As a frequent contributor to professional journals, Dr. Christensen \nholds editorial positions with 10 dental publications. He is also the \nrecipient of many fellowships, masterships, and diplomas from various \ndental specialties and organizations worldwide.\n  Early in his career, Dr. Christensen helped initiate the University \nof Kentucky and the University of Colorado Dental Schools. He also \ntaught dentistry courses at the University of Washington.\n  For the Christensens, dentistry seems to run in the family. Both of \nDr. Christensen's sons work in the field: William is a prosthodontist \nand Michael is a general dentist. The Christensen's lovely daughter, \nCarlene, is making her own contributions as a teacher.\n  After more than 55 years in private practice, Dr. Christensen remains \nactive in treating patients. He continues to influence dentistry across \nthe world through his continuing education lectures and the Clinicians \nReport. He is truly one of dentistry's great leaders, and it is with \ngreat respect, gratitude, admiration, and affection that I pay tribute \nto Dr. Gordon J. Christensen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/30/senate-section/article/S2559-3", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RECOGNIZING THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NEVADA APPEAL\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 150th \nanniversary of the Nevada Appeal newspaper.\n  May 16, 2015, marks 150 years since E.F. McElwain, J. Barrett, \nMarshall Robinson, and editor Henry Rust Mighels published the first \nissue of the Carson Daily Appeal in Nevada's State capital, Carson \nCity. Nevada had recently joined the Union, and the Daily Appeal soon \nbegan reporting on the important issues facing the newly established \nState.\n  For 150 years, the paper has demonstrated its resilience and \nwithstood a number of name changes and owners. One notable owner was \nHenry Mighels' widow, Nellie Verrill Mighels, who inherited the \npublication following Henry's death in 1879. Covering local politics \nand a popular boxing match, Nellie earned her place among the Appeal's \njournalists. Though her ownership of the paper was short-lived, she \npropelled the paper forward during her tenure.\n  Today, the Appeal remains the longest continually running newspaper \nin Nevada and is among the oldest businesses in Carson City. Decades of \ncommitted staff and dedicated local readers have kept this important \npublication and piece of Nevada history alive. I applaud the Nevada \nAppeal on its 150 years of quality journalism and wish the paper much \ncontinued success for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/30/senate-section/article/S2559-4", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2559-S2560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          REMEMBERING REX CARR\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to pay my respects to a man who \nchampioned the underdogs of Metro East, IL. Rex Carr passed away on \nMonday at the age of 88. For over one-half century, people who were out \nof luck or injured could call on Rex Carr to be their champion. He did \nit with a style and grace that made him a legend in the community.\n  Rex grew up in my hometown of East St. Louis. He was the second \nyoungest of five boys. His mother was a teacher and father was a \nfirefighter with the Illinois Central Railroad. His family could not \nafford much and often had to move when they could not pay the rent. \nWhen Rex graduated from East St. Louis High School, he joined the Navy \nand served in the Pacific Theater during World War II.\n  Rex would go on to attend college and law school at the University of \nIllinois. During summers, he worked filling freight cars with ice and \nhitched a ride back and forth between home and the University of \nIllinois.\n  In 1949, Rex finished law school and started practicing in East St. \nLouis. He was so poor that his first office was in the chambers of a \nfriendly judge, where he could only work when the judge was busy in \ncourt. He earned $500 his first year of practice. But he would keep an \noffice in East St. Louis for the rest of his life.\n  In Harper Lee's To Kill a Mocking Bird, Atticus Finch defined \ncourage, ``When you know you're licked before you begin but you begin \nanyway and you see it through no matter what.\n\n[[Page S2560]]\n\nYou rarely win, but sometimes you do.'' Rex did not win all his cases, \nbut he won quite a few and always tried to see things to their end. Rex \nhad that courage that Atticus Finch described.\n  During the 1960s and 1970s, Rex earned a reputation as a civil rights \nand labor attorney. He fiercely fought for equal rights for African \nAmericans and represented teachers in East St. Louis.\n  By the end of the 1970s, Rex's practice had turned toward personal \ninjury, and he became a legend. He won national acclaim as the best-\nprepared lawyer in Metro East and even made it into the Guinness Book \nof Records for three categories: the longest civil jury trial; the \nlargest personal injury verdict at the time; and the largest libel \nverdict.\n  The longest trial also was one of his proudest moments of his career. \nA tanker car carrying wood preservative with a dioxin contaminant \nspilled in Sturgeon, MO, injuring many of the town's residents. He \nrepresented 65 of them. All but one of the parties settled with the \nresidents. Chemical giant Monsanto, manufacturer of the dioxin, \nrefused, and Rex took them to court.\n  Rex fought for three and a half years in the case. There were 182 \nwitnesses, 6,000 separate exhibits, and over 100,000 pages in \ntranscript. Rex's skill was on full display. He cross-examined a \nwitness for 6 months and then another witness for 5 months. The jury \nawarded the plaintiffs $16 million. An appeals court would disappoint \nhim and the residents by reducing the award to $1 million.\n  Rex went on to win many cases and mentor many young lawyers in Metro \nEast. His career was about holding corporations responsible and \nensuring his clients' rights. Rex's cross-examinations were the stuff \nof folklore. At 88 years old, he was still working out of his Missouri \nAvenue office in East St. Louis. It's where he was from, and he wanted \npeople to be able to come to him for help.\n  Rex was a giant in Metro East. My thoughts and prayers go out to his \nfour sons, Rex G. Carr of Vermont, Bruce Carr of Valparaiso, IN, Eric \nReeve of Mack's Creek, MO, and Glenn Carr of Columbia, IL; a daughter, \nKathryn Marie Wheeler of Los Angeles, CA; 16 grandchildren; and 20 \ngreat-grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/30/senate-section/article/S2560-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     THE RUNAWAY AND HOMELESS YOUTH AND TRAFFICKING PREVENTION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Last week, the Senate considered a very important \namendment to S. 178, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. \nSenator Collins and I offered amendment No. 290, the Runaway and \nHomeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act, which was cosponsored by \nSenators Ayotte, Murkowski, Baldwin, Heitkamp, Shaheen, Bennet, Murphy, \nMerkley, Schatz, Klobuchar, and Booker.\n  As we crafted this legislation, Senator Collins and I listened to the \nstories of survivors of human trafficking and the service providers who \nhelp them rebuild their lives. So many of these stories began with a \nhomeless or runaway teen, scared and alone, and in need of a safe place \nto sleep. These young people were completely vulnerable, and \ntraffickers preyed upon their desperation. Survivors and service \nproviders underscored the importance of preventing human trafficking \nfrom happening in the first place by reauthorizing the critical \nprograms funded by the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act.\n  With their feedback in mind, we crafted S. 262, the Runaway and \nHomeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act. We made important \nupdates to ensure that homeless youth service providers are \nspecifically trained to recognize victims of trafficking, address their \nunique traumas, and refer them to appropriate and caring services.\n  Our bill will improve services for these vulnerable children in \nseveral ways. We lengthen the time that youth can stay in shelters from \n21 days to 30 days, so they are better able to find stable housing. \nKids who are forced out of shelters and back onto the streets before \nthey are ready are more likely to become victims of exploitation. Our \nbill prioritizes suicide prevention services and family reunification \nefforts and expands aftercare services. Providers know that such \nmeasures save children's lives and help them build a more stable future \nwith families and trusted adults. Under our bill, service providers \nwill collect data on the demographics of youth who are served by their \nshelters to help understand their needs and refine their services. It \nencourages grantees to examine the connection between youth who are \nvictims of trafficking and any previous involvement in the foster care \nsystem or juvenile justice system in order to address the causes of \nyouth homelessness. It further requires staff training on how to help \nyouth apply for Federal student loans to help make college possible for \nyouth so they can build a more stable future.\n  The Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act also \nincludes a crucial nondiscrimination provision that would prevent \ndiscrimination against youth based on their race, color, religion, \nnational origin, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation or \ndisability. We offered this important legislation as amendment No. 290 \nto the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act.\n  We were very disappointed that it received only 56 votes and failed \nto garner the 60 votes necessary for passage, but we are encouraged \nthat it received a strong bipartisan vote from a majority of the \nSenate. I want to thank the 54 other Senators who voted for this \nlegislation: Senators Ayotte, Baldwin, Bennet, Blumenthal, Booker, \nBoxer, Brown, Cantwell, Capito, Cardin, Carper, Casey, Coons, Donnelly, \nDurbin, Feinstein, Franken, Gillibrand, Heinrich, Heitkamp, Heller, \nHirono, Kaine, King, Kirk, Klobuchar, Manchin, Markey, McCaskill, \nMenendez, Merkley, Mikulski, Murkowski, Murphy, Murray, Nelson, Paul, \nPeters, Portman, Reed, Reid, Sanders, Schatz, Schumer, Shaheen, \nStabenow, Sullivan, Tester, Toomey, Udall, Warner, Warren, Whitehouse, \nand Wyden. We appreciate their support and their dedication to working \nto prevent vulnerable youth from becoming victims of human trafficking.\n  I especially applaud Senators Collins, Heitkamp, Ayotte, and \nMurkowski for their help fighting to get a vote on this amendment. \nTheir leadership on this issue is exceptional, and the Senate is better \nfor having them as Members.\n  I also want to thank the tireless advocates who have worked so hard \nto help us improve the bill and urge support for the effort: Darla \nBardine, with National Network for Youth; Jennifer Pike and David \nStacy, with Human Rights Campaign; Cyndi Lauper and Gregory Lewis, with \nthe True Colors Fund; Bridget Petruczok and Laura Durso, with the \nCenter for American Progress; Melysa Sperber, with the Alliance to End \nSlavery and Trafficking; Holly Austin Smith, Jayne Bigelsen, and Kevin \nRyan, with Covenant House; Calvin Smith and Kreig Pinkham, with the \nVermont Coalition of Runaway and Homeless Youth Programs; Erin \nAlbright, with Give Way to Freedom; Griselda Vega, with Safe Horizon; \nSusan Burton, with the United Methodist Church; and the many others who \nprovided us with their feedback as we drafted this important \nlegislation. They are the true experts in this field and their insights \nand contributions were invaluable.\n  This is not the end for the Runaway and Homeless Youth and \nTrafficking Prevention Act. As I have said time and again, we must \nprotect the most vulnerable among us, and we must do everything we can \nto prevent the heinous crime of human trafficking from occurring. It is \nvital that we update and reauthorize the Runaway and Homeless Youth \nAct. We will continue to fight to see the passage of the Runaway and \nHomeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/30/senate-section/article/S2560-2", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2560-S2561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THANKING AMERICAN DIPLOMATS\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to take a moment to honor \nthe American diplomats who serve our country. Specifically, I want to \nthank the American diplomats who have been on the front lines working \nfor America throughout the Iran nuclear P5+1 negotiations. They address \nso many vital issues on a daily basis, some of which we hear about in \nthe news but many of which never reach the headlines.\n  The Corker-Cardin bill is now on the floor, addressing the role of \nCongress in a final deal with Iran. I hope there will\n\n[[Page S2561]]\n\nbe deliberative, thorough debate around this important issue. I want to \nput aside the partisan bellowing and grandstanding, some of which has \nregrettably stooped to impugn our diplomats, and rather take a moment \nto recognize our diplomats for their efforts to find peaceful solutions \nto the Iranian nuclear menace that threatens the world.\n  For 2 years, America's diplomats have labored quietly, with no \naspiration for personal accolade, to represent our Nation's best \nintersts and build the foundation for a possible P5+1 agreement with \nIran. The United States has had little contact with Iran since 1979, \nbut their shrewdness and duplicity at the negotiating table is well \nknown. It has been a huge task with no certainty of outcome. There have \nbeen innumerable hurdles. There have been many setbacks, and there will \nbe more. But our diplomats have stayed steady, focused on the task at \nhand.\n  Diplomacy is about understanding strategic motivations, applying fact \nand science to argument, and maintaining an unwavering commitment to \nAmerican values and interests throughout complex talks with an \nuntrustworthy and difficult foe. America's diplomats have done so with \nfocus and integrity.\n  During the negotiations, American diplomats have also been supported \nand informed by a tremendous cadre of American experts: scientists, \nintelligence professionals, civilian experts, members of the military \nand academics. This process has been a collective effort that has drawn \non the country's best and brightest.\n  There was once a time when politics ended at the water's edge, but in \nrecent years we have seen the erosion of that principle and, instead, a \nrise in the practice of subsuming the interests of the country to \ntactical political objectives. The leadership of our diplomats is \ncritical and needed now more than ever, and I want them to know--we \nvalue and appreciate you. Regardless of what you might think of the \ntalks in the first place, the dedication of America's diplomats has \nmade us all proud. For that, I thank them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/30/senate-section/article/S2561-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MEAGHAN McCARTHY\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a devoted \npublic servant and tireless friend of the people of Washington State as \nshe moves on from the staff of the United States Senate. Meaghan \nMcCarthy has dedicated nearly 13 years in service to the Appropriations \nCommittee and is widely recognized for her expertise in housing policy. \nI know that back in Washington State, here in the Senate, and across \nthe country--Ms. McCarthy's important work has helped so many people \nfind affordable housing and get back on their feet. I know so many will \nmiss her compassionate advocacy on behalf of those facing housing \nchallenges, from veterans requiring supportive housing, to working-\nclass families that need a helping hand to remain in safe and \naffordable homes, and so many more.\n  A Massachusetts native and graduate of Notre Dame and Johns Hopkins \nUniversity, Ms. McCarthy began her career in public policy as an \nadvocate for children, working at the Children's Defense Fund. She then \njoined the Appropriations Committee as professional staff, where she \ndeveloped a keen understanding of complex Federal housing policy. As a \ntop staff member on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, \nHousing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies, Ms. McCarthy has \noverseen and helped fund key affordable housing supports that make sure \nmillions of people across the country have access to high-quality \naffordable housing. From tenant vouchers provided through the section 8 \nprogram to homeless assistance grants, supportive HUD-VASH vouchers for \nour veterans, and public housing funds, Ms. McCarthy has worked hand-\nin-hand with housing officials in my State to make sure Washington \nState families receive the resources they need.\n  It is so clear to me that Washington State has benefited from Ms. \nMcCarthy's hard work, vast knowledge, and compassion for people and \nfamilies fighting to make ends meet. During my time as the \nsubcommittee's chair, I was always thankful that she was working on my \nState's behalf. Many of our housing advocates and authorities have \nreached out to my office to express their appreciation for her work. \nThey have called her a ``critical bridge between Washington state's \ncommunities and our nation's big-picture, broad-stroke policy and \nbudget machinery,'' someone who translated real-world neighborhood \nneeds into action in a complex Federal bureaucracy.\n  Ms. McCarthy's work has had real and measurable impacts in Washington \nState communities. Stephen Norman, the executive director of the King \nCounty Housing Authority, was kind enough to share an anecdote wherein \nMs. McCarthy pioneered a program to fund community facilities adjacent \nto public housing, which he called ``a cross-cutting initiative that \nrecognized the importance of education success for low income children \nand the opportunities created by partnering schools and Housing \nAuthorities.'' When HUD's draft rules effectively excluded suburban \ncommunities, which require a network of smaller facilities, Ms. \nMcCarthy did what she does best: she went to work to solve the problem \nand change the rules. And change them she did. Now, King County has a \nnetwork of 14 youth facilities, serving some of the poorest families in \nthe region and helping children to reach their potential and to realize \ntheir dreams.\n  Today I join with others throughout the country, the State of \nWashington, and this body in thanking Ms. McCarthy for her years of \nservice. I congratulate her on all of her accomplishments and wish her \nthe best of luck in her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/30/senate-section/article/S2561-2", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2561-S2562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WORLD PRESS FREEDOM DAY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I commemorate World Press Freedom \nDay 2015 on May 3, 2015--a day reserved to celebrate the value of \nfreedom of press and the critical role it serves in creating a more \nfree and open society. In its highest forms, the press does not simply \ninform, but brings attention to atrocities around the world, provides \nchecks on authoritarian governments, and catalyzes better governance.\n  The United States has recognized the great value of freedom of the \npress from its inception and in its Declaration of Universal Rights, \nthe United Nations acknowledged the profound role of this fundamental \nright. On May 3, 1991, in the Windhoek Declaration, the U.N. \nrecommitted itself to this important cause with a call to arms to \nprotect the right of the press ``to hold opinions without interference \nand to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media \nand regardless of frontiers.''\n  A pluralistic and free press is essential to the development and \nmaintenance of democracy as well as economic development. According to \nFreedom House's 2014 Freedom of the Press Index, only 14 percent of the \nworld's citizens live in countries that enjoy a free press. In every \nother corner of the world, freedom of the press is threatened by \ngovernments that want to restrict freedom of expression and association \nby harassing and intimidating journalists. According to Reporters \nWithout Borders, 69 journalists and 19 citizen journalists were killed \nin 2014 in connection with their collection and dissemination of news \nand information, and the Committee to Protect Journalists, found that \nin that same year the 3 deadliest countries for journalists on \nassignment were Syria, Ukraine, and Iraq. Today we honor all \njournalists who have been imprisoned or killed while seeking to tell a \nstory that deserves to be told and needs to be heard.\n  The weekend of April 25 marked the 1-year anniversary of the arrest \nof three independent journalists and six bloggers in Ethiopia known as \nthe ``Zone 9 bloggers.'' The reporters, who published articles \ncriticizing the government, have been charged under Ethiopia's Anti-\nTerrorism Proclamation, seemingly in connection with their writings. \nThey remain in jail to this day, their trial once again postponed until \nafter the Ethiopian elections. Unfortunately, this sort of imprisonment \nis not an isolated incident in Ethiopia. According to Human Rights \nWatch, Ethiopia has the second largest number of journalists in exile \nand the largest number of imprisoned journalists and bloggers in all of \nsub-Saharan Africa.\n  I and a number of my colleagues wrote Secretary Kerry in March about \nour ongoing concern with efforts by the\n\n[[Page S2562]]\n\nEthiopian government to restrict freedom of speech and association in \nEthiopia. In recent months numerous media publications have closed amid \nwidespread harassment, and the Ethiopian government continues to \ncontrol most television and radio broadcasting content. Today, I again \nurge the Ethiopian government to respect freedom of expression and \nfreedom of the press--especially in advance of the May 24 elections. \nAnti-terrorism laws must not be used for political gain or to stifle \nthe expression of dissenting political views.\n  The continued imprisonment of Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, \nwho remains in Iran on alleged espionage charges, is another example of \nthe immense duress that journalists around the world endure. Mr. \nRezaian, an esteemed and respected professional journalist, has been \nimprisoned in Tehran since July 22. As the United States and Iran \ncontinue to negotiate a nuclear agreement, it is important that we not \nforget about Jason Rezaian, an Iranian-American who deserves to be \nfree.\n  And, finally, the world will never forget the brutal and barbaric \nmurder of American reporter James Foley by the Islamic State this past \nsummer. His death reminds us that it is not only oppressive governments \nthat threaten journalists, but terrorist organizations as well. Foley's \nlife's work chronicling the war torn countries of Afghanistan and Syria \nspeaks to a deep commitment to the truth, a desire to tell the story of \nthe world's most vulnerable and the right to freedom of the press even \nin the gravest of circumstances. This is what freedom of the press is \nall about.\n  As witnesses to the good that free press provides to society and the \nthreat that it faces, we have a responsibility to stand against \ninjustice, to tell the stories of these brave journalists and others in \nthe hopes of securing their freedom and preventing future tragedies \nfrom occurring. As George Mason said in 1776, ``The freedom of the \npress is one of the greatest bulwarks of liberty, and can never be \nrestrained but by despotic governments.'' On World Press Freedom Day \n2015, the United States and governments around the world must recommit \nthemselves to protecting press freedom in order to enable democracy to \nflourish and good governance to prevail.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/30/senate-section/article/S2562-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          NATIONAL OUTDOOR LEADERSHIP SCHOOL 50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, this year we commemorate the 50th \nanniversary of NOLS, the National Outdoor Leadership School. What \nstarted in Wyoming has now grown to 14 locations worldwide on six \ncontinents. NOLS locations stretch from the fjords of Norway and the \nIndian Himalayas to the Yukon and east Africa.\n  In the last 50 years there have been over 250,000 graduates ranging \nin ages from 14 to over 70 years old. They come from all walks of life, \nfrom all 50 States, and numerous countries around the world. They come \nto learn mountaineering, kayaking, horse packing, sailing, backcountry \nskiing, caving, and wilderness medicine skills, just to name a few.\n  As a doctor, I appreciate the importance NOLS places on outdoor \nmedicine. The Wyss Wilderness Medicine Campus was designed and located \nto create an optimal learning environment for students of wilderness \nmedicine. At the campus, classroom experience extends to the outdoors \nwith real-life simulations in wild and realistic terrain.\n  I find it very appropriate NOLS has its beginning in Wyoming. Like \nWyoming, NOLS supports a diverse economic portfolio that benefits from \nenergy, agriculture, hunting and fishing, tourism, and outdoor \nrecreation and education. Wyoming and NOLS both work towards a balanced \napproach to natural resource management that provides opportunities for \na diversified energy portfolio while caring for Wyoming's world-class \nwildlife and wild places.\n  One need not look any further than Lander, WY, for an example of \nbalanced natural resource management. Lander is home to NOLS and \ngateway to the Wind River Range. At times, Lander has been a steel town \nand a supply hub during the gold boom. Today, Lander continues to be \nrich with energy and agricultural production.\n  Wyoming and NOLS have shared strong leaders who work to find \npragmatic and inclusive solutions to land management challenges. John \nGans is one of those leaders. John has successfully carried on the \ntradition established by Paul Petzoldt, the founder of NOLS. After 20 \nyears at the helm, he is the longest serving executive director of \nNOLS. Under John Gans' leadership, NOLS has been recognized nine times \nas one of the best places to work for. In 2012, he was recognized as a \nWhite House Champion of Change for his commitment to youth, wilderness \nand leadership.\n  While NOLS' international programs have grown immensely during his \ntime, John values the connections that exist between the town of \nLander, NOLS staff, and graduates. Phil Nicholas, Marc Randolph, and \nTori McClure are just a few examples of many graduates who have gone on \nto become successful businesspeople, educators, and leaders in the \ncommunity and the Nation. Phil Nicholas is the current Wyoming Senate \npresident and a former NOLS instructor. Tori McClure was the first \nwoman to row solo across the Atlantic Ocean and the first woman to ski \nto the South Pole. Marc Randolph is a Cofounder of Netflix.\n  One of the things that make NOLS alumni so successful is they have \nlearned how to make decisions and face adversity. NOLS students suffer \nthrough extreme heat and cold and all types of weather conditions. NOLS \nstudents make decisions with consequences, and they apply these lessons \nto their lives. They come home with a new perspective on the world \naround them and their role within it.\n  In this day and age of selfies and instant gratification, we need \nmore people--and especially the youth--to realize they may not be the \ncenter of the universe. A perspective of hard work, sacrifice, and an \nappreciation and respect for nature needs to be taught and needs to be \nlearned. In previous generations, this perspective was provided on \nfamily farms and ranches across the country. Gratefully, thanks to all \nthe hard work and dedication of the NOLS staff, NOLS courses continue \nto provide this perspective to future leaders. I am confident in the \nfuture leadership of our communities and Nation because I know \ntomorrow's leaders are receiving NOLS instruction and experience today.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the \nNational Outdoor Leadership School on their 50th anniversary. We are \nlooking forward to another 50 years of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/30/senate-section/article/S2562-2", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2562-S2563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNIZING FUTURE MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I wish to honor 423 high school seniors \nin 8 Northeast Ohio counties for their decision to enlist in the U.S. \nArmed Forces. Of these 423 seniors from 120 high schools in 105 towns \nand cities, 97 will enter the Army, 127 will enter the Marine Corps, 42 \nwill enter the Navy, 24 will enter the Air Force, 3 will enter the \nCoast Guard, 123 will enter our Ohio Army National Guard, and 7 will \nenter the Ohio Air National Guard. In the presence of their parents/\nguardians, high school counselors, military leaders, and city and \nbusiness leaders, all 423 will be recognized on May 6, 2015, by Our \nCommunity Salutes of Northeast Ohio.\n  In a few short weeks, these young men and women will join with many \nof their classmates in celebration of their high school graduation. At \na time when many of their peers are looking forward to pursuing \nvocational training or college degrees, or are uncertain about their \nfuture, these young men and women instead have chosen to dedicate \nthemselves to military service in defense of our rights, our freedoms, \nand our country. They should know that they have the full support of \nthis Senate Chamber and the American people, who are with them in \nwhatever challenges may lie ahead.\n  These 423 young men and women are the cornerstone of our liberties. \nIt is thanks to their dedication and the dedication of an untold number \nof patriots just like them that we are able to meet here today, in the \nSenate, and openly debate the best solutions to the many diverse \nproblems that confront\n\n[[Page S2563]]\n\nour country. It is thanks to their sacrifices that the United States of \nAmerica remains a beacon of hope and freedom in a dangerous world. We \nare grateful to them, and we are grateful to their parents and their \ncommunities for instilling in them not only the mental and physical \nabilities our Armed Forces require, but also the character, the values, \nand the discipline that lead someone to put service to our Nation over \nself.\n  I would like to personally thank these 423 graduating seniors for \nvolunteering to risk their lives in defense of our Nation. We owe them, \nalong with all those who serve our country, a deep debt of gratitude.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the names of \nthe 423 high school seniors.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                         UNITED STATES ARMY--97\n\n       Abrams--Cleveland;

Mr. President, today, I wish to congratulate COL \nJoanne Farris on her recent selection as the first female brigade \ncommander in the\n\n[[Page S2564]]\n\nhistory of the Nevada National Guard. Colonel Farris assumed command of \nthe 991st Multi-Functional Brigade, overseeing more than 700 soldiers, \nincluding the Nevada Army Guard's aviation assets. It gives me great \npleasure to recognize her achievement in this historic moment.\n  Colonel Farris joined the Guard over 25 years ago as a private first \nclass and was later commissioned from the University of Nevada, Reno \nROTC Program in 1991. She then continued her studies and earned her \nmaster's from Clayton College in 2004, the same year she graduated from \nthe Commander and General Staff College. She is currently working \ntowards completion of her second year of War College and is scheduled \nto graduate this summer.\n  Colonel Farris formerly commanded the 1-69th Press Camp Headquarters, \nwhich deployed to Bosnia in 1999. She also served as command \ninformation officer for the State of Nevada, 1-421st Regional Training \nInstitute executive officer, Joint Force Headquarters commander, and as \nthe Nevada Guard State family program director. In 2011, she deployed \nto Afghanistan with the 401st Army Field Support Brigade.\n  I extend my deepest gratitude to Colonel Farris for her courageous \ncontributions to the United States of America. Her unwavering \ndedication to her career is commendable, and she stands as a role model \nto future generations of heroes. Colonel Farris' service to her country \nand her bravery earn her a place among the outstanding men and women \nwho have valiantly defended our Nation.\n  As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I recognize \nthat Congress has a responsibility not only to honor these brave \nindividuals who serve our Nation but also to ensure they are cared for \nwhen they return home. Equally as important, it is crucial that female \nservicemembers and veterans have access to their specific health care \nneeds. There are countless distinguished women who have made sacrifices \nbeyond measure and deserve nothing but the best treatment. I remain \ncommitted to upholding this promise for our veterans and servicemembers \nin Nevada and throughout the Nation and will continue to fight until \nthis becomes a reality.\n  During her tenure, Colonel Farris has demonstrated professionalism, \ncommitment to excellence, and dedication to the highest standards of \nthe Nevada Guard. I am both humbled and honored by her service and am \nproud to call her a fellow Nevadan. Today, I ask my colleagues to join \nme in recognizing Colonel Joanne Farris for all of her accomplishments \nand wish her well in all of her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/30/senate-section/article/S2564-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JODY SHERVANICK\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today, I wish to recognize Jody \nShervanick for her tireless efforts in supporting Nevada's veterans, \nactive military members, and their families. Ms. Shervanick volunteers \n7 days a week to give back to the brave men and women who defend our \nfreedom and their families. She has contributed greatly to the Las \nVegas military community and to the greater good of the Silver State.\n  Having grown up as a military child, Ms. Shervanick understands the \ntrials of a military family. She stands as a shining example of someone \nwho has devoted her life to the betterment of others, selflessly \nserving to bring happiness to our Nation's heroes each day. It is \nimportant to thank not only the men and women serving this great \nNation, but also their families who make so many sacrifices. Her \nservice to these families is invaluable.\n  Ms. Shervanick helps with care for veterans and military members with \nmental illness, such as post-traumatic stress, and aids in times of \nuncertainty for military families, providing food, financial aid, and \nchildcare. She hosts special events for families stationed at Creech \nand Nellis Air Force Bases. Ms. Shervanick coordinates the ``World's \nLargest Baby Shower,'' for wives of active military or female members \nstationed at Creech and Nellis Air Force Bases, puts on multiple \nChristmas parties for the children at Nellis Air Force Base, spearheads \nan annual Easter party for the children at Nellis Air Force Base, and \nwill be putting on a ``Mom''ster and Son Halloween bash in October. I \nhave had the opportunity to attend one of Ms. Shervanick's Operation \nShowers of Appreciation Military Baby Showers in Las Vegas, and I know \nfirsthand the positive impact her efforts have on military families. \nShe works with volunteers to make pillow slips for deployed military \nmembers with pictures of their children. Her commitment to these \nfamilies is without limit. She is truly a role model to all Nevadans.\n  Ms. Shervanick's hard work has not gone without notice. She received \n``Citizen of the Month'' from Mayor Carolyn Goodman of the city of Las \nVegas in December 2014, a plaque recognizing her service from Governor \nBrian Sandoval, and has been recognized by News 3 KSNV, 8 News Now \nKLAS, and FOX 5 KVVU for her service to veterans and military families. \nI extend my deepest gratitude to Ms. Shervanick for her noble \ncontributions to the Las Vegas military community. Her service to \nNevada places her among the outstanding men and women of the State and \nher accolades are well deserved.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in recognizing \nMs. Shervanick and her work with active military members, veterans, and \ntheir families. Her efforts are both honorable and necessary. I wish \nher the best of luck in all of her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/30/senate-section/article/S2564-2", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING LOUISIANA'S LEMONADE DAY\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, Saturday, May 2, 2015, marks the \nfifth annual Louisiana Lemonade Day during which thousands of children \nacross the Pelican State will start their own small business--a \nlemonade stand. This free, statewide program is dedicated to teaching \nchildren how to start, own, and operate their own business, and in the \nlast 5 years, Lemonade Day has provided more than 50,000 children \nacross Louisiana with the opportunity to become entrepreneurs.\n  On Lemonade Day, thousands of children will open their own lemonade \nstands and learn the crucial lessons of salesmanship, competition, and \nmarketing. They will be introduced to crucial business skills, like \nsupply and demand, critical thinking and problem solving, and civic \nresponsibility. Lemonade Day encourages young entrepreneurs to save \none-third of their profits, share one-third of their profits, and spend \none-third of their profits. They are even urged to open a youth savings \naccount. These simple, yet important lessons will shape future \ngenerations of business leaders, and hopefully, instill some good \nmoney-managing practices that will help them later in life.\n  The secret to America's success lies within the innovation and \ncreativity of American entrepreneurs. Urging our Nation's youth to \ndevelop their big ideas is critical for securing the future of our \ncountry's economic stability. On its fifth anniversary, I would like to \nrecognize Louisiana's Lemonade Day and the role it plays in fostering \nentrepreneurial spirits in the lives of our Nation's youths.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/30/senate-section/article/S2564-3", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/30/senate-section/article/S2564-4", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/30/senate-section/article/S2564-5", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2564-S2565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    REPORT TO THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS SUPPORTING THE UNDERLYING \n OBJECTIVES OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE MILITARY COMPENSATION AND \n    RETIREMENT MODERNIZATION COMMISSION (THE ``COMMISSION'')--PM 15\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States which was referred to the \nCommittee on Armed Services:\n\n\n[[Page S2565]]\n\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  My Administration fully supports the underlying objectives of the \nrecommendations that the Military Compensation and Retirement \nModernization Commission (the ``Commission'') offered in January. These \nrecommendations represent an important step forward in protecting the \nlong-term viability of the All-Volunteer Force, improving quality-of-\nlife for service members and their families, and ensuring the fiscal \nsustainability of the military compensation and retirement systems.\n  As I directed in my letter of March 30, my team has worked with the \nCommission to further analyze the recommendations and identify areas of \nagreement. At this time I am prepared to support specific proposals for \n10 of the Commission's 15 recommendations, either as proposed or with \nmodifications that have been discussed among the Department of Defense, \nother agencies, and the Commission. These include the following:\n  Survivor Benefit Plan\n  Financial Education\n  Medical Personnel Readiness\n  Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs \nCollaboration\n  Child Care\n  Service Member Education\n  Transition Assistance\n  Nutritional Financial Assistance\n  Dependent Space-Available Travel\n  Report on Military Connected Dependents\n  In some instances, the Department of Defense is already taking \nactions to implement these recommendations, and I will direct the \nDepartment to develop plans to complete this implementation. In those \nareas where legislation is required, I expect the Secretary of Defense \nto transmit to the Congress on my behalf the relevant legislative \nproposals, which I recommend be enacted without delay.\n  With respect to the remaining recommendations, given their complexity \nand our solemn responsibility to ensure that any changes further the \nobjectives above, we will continue working with the Commission to \nunderstand how the following proposals would affect the All-Volunteer \nForce:\n  Blended Retirement System\n  Reserve Component Duty Statuses\n  Exceptional Family Member's Support\n  Commissary and Exchange Consolidation\n  I believe there is merit in all of these recommendations and that \nthey deserve careful consideration and study. I will ensure that the \nCongress is kept apprised of this ongoing work.\n  Finally, I agree with the Commission that we need to continue to \nimprove the military health care system. The health care reforms \nproposed in my Fiscal Year 2016 Budget are a good first step and offer \nservice members, retirees, and their families more control and choice \nover their health care decisions. This remains a critical issue, and my \nAdministration will work with the Commission and interested Members of \nCongress in the coming months to develop additional reform proposals \nfor consideration as part of my Fiscal Year 2017 Budget.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, April 30, 2015.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/30/senate-section/article/S2565-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:27 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 651.

 By Mr. BARRASSO (for himself, Mr. Donnelly, Mr. Inhofe, Ms. \n        Heitkamp, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Manchin, Mr. Sullivan, Mr. Rounds, \n        Mr. Blunt, Mr. McConnell, Mrs. Capito, Mrs. Fischer, and Mr. \n        Hoeven):\n  S. 1140. A bill to require the Secretary of the Army and the \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to propose a \nregulation revising the definition of the term ``waters of the United \nStates'', and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, last week, I spoke on the floor about a \nnew report by the Bipartisan Policy Center. This report talked about \nthe great progress we have made so far in this Congress, as far as \ngetting things done in a bipartisan way. I believe that is good news. \nRepublicans in the Senate are committed to continuing our progress and \nto holding more votes on areas of bipartisan agreement. So I want to \nspeak about something Senators on both sides of the aisle agree we can \ndo to protect America's navigable waters.\n  Our rivers, lakes and other waterways are among America's most \ntreasured resources. In my home State of Wyoming, we have some of the \nmost beautiful rivers in the world: the Snake River, the Wind River, \ndozens of others.\n  The people of Wyoming are devoted to keeping these waterways safe and \npristine for our children and our grandchildren. They understand there \nis a right way and a wrong way to do that. It is possible to have \nreasonable regulations to help preserve our waterways, while at the \nsame time allowing it to be used as natural resources.\n  We have done it for years under the Clean Water Act. That is the \nright way to do it. The wrong way to do it is for Washington \nbureaucrats--bureaucrats--unelectable, unaccountable, to write harsh \nand inflexible rules that could block any use of water or even use of \nland in much of the country. The Environmental Protection Agency and \nthe Army Corps of Engineers have proposed a new rule, a new rule that \nwould expand the Clean Water Act in what I believe is a dangerous new \ndirection.\n  The rule is an attempt to change the definition of what the law calls \nwaters of the United States. Under the rule, this term could include \nditches, it would include dry areas where water only flows for a short \ntime after it rains. Federal regulations have never before listed \nditches and other manmade features as waters of the United States.\n  What the administration is proposing now simply makes no sense. Under \nthis new rule, the new rule they are proposing, isolated ponds could be \nregulated as waters of the United States. This is the kind of pond that \nmight form in a low-lying piece of land with no connection to a river \nor a stream. It could be in someone's back yard.\n  An isolated pond is not navigable water. That is not what the law was \ndesigned to protect. This is bipartisan, and there is bipartisan \nagreement that Washington bureaucrats have no business, none at all, \nregulating an isolated pond as a water of the United States. Under this \nnewly proposed rule, agriculture water management systems could be \nregulated as waters of the United States.\n  We are talking about irrigation ditches. An irrigation ditch is not \nnavigable water. These are manmade ditches that people dig to move \nwater from one place to another to grow crops. This kind of agriculture \nwater is not what the law was designed to protect. There is bipartisan \nagreement that Washington bureaucrats have no business regulating an \nirrigation ditch as waters of the United States.\n  Under this outrageously broad new rule, Washington bureaucrats would \nnow have a say in how farmers and ranchers and families use their own \nproperty. It would allow the Environmental Protection Agency to \nregulate private property just based on things such as whether it is \nused by animals or birds or even insects. It could regulate any water \nthat moves over land or infiltrates into the ground.\n  Well, this is an ominously far-reaching definition. It is the wrong \nway--the wrong way--to protect America 's precious water resources. \nThis rule is not designed to protect the traditional waters of the \nUnited States, it is designed to expand the power of Washington \nbureaucrats.\n  Now, there is a better way to protect America's water, and there is \nbipartisan support for it in this body. Today, I have introduced the \nFederal Water Quality Protection Act, along with Senators Donnelly, \nInhofe, Heitkamp, Roberts, Manchin, Sullivan, Rounds,\n\n[[Page S2571]]\n\nBlunt, McConnell, Capito, and Fischer. That is bipartisan. It is a \nbipartisan agreement that says we need a different approach.\n  This bill says yes to clean water and no to extreme bureaucracy. It \nwill give the Environmental Protection Agency the direction it needs, \nthe direction to write a strong and reasonable rule that truly protects \nAmerica's waterways, one that keeps Washington's hands off things such \nas irrigation ditches, isolated ponds, and groundwater, one that does \nnot allow the determination to be based on plants and insects, one that \nprotects streams that could carry dangerous pollutants to navigable \nwaters or wetlands that protect those waters from pollutants.\n  It would make sure Washington bureaucrats comply, comply with other \nlaws and Executive orders that, well, they have been avoiding. They \nwould have to do an economic analysis and conduct reviews to protect \nsmall businesses, to protect ranchers, to protect farmers. They would \nhave to consult with the States. They have to make sure, by consulting \nwith the States, that we have the approach that works best everywhere, \nnot just the approach Washington likes best.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency says our concerns are overblown. \nThe administration says there is a lot of misunderstanding about what \ntheir regulation covers. It says the Agency has no intention of \nregulating things like I have just described. The key word there is \n``intention.'' This bill would help to make sure the rules are crystal \nclear.\n  It gives certainty and clarity to farmers, to ranchers, and to small \nbusiness owners and their families. People would be able to use their \nproperty without fear of Washington bureaucrats knocking on their door. \nWe would also be able to enjoy the beautiful rivers and the lakes that \nshould be preserved and protected. This bipartisan bill does nothing to \nblock legitimate protection of the true waters of the United States. It \nsimply restores Washington's attention to the traditional waters that \nwere always the focus before.\n  That is what this law should protect. This bill is one easy thing we \ncan do to protect Americans from runaway bureaucracy. The Senate has \nbeen very productive so far this year. We are going to keep going. We \nare going to go with more ideas that have bipartisan support. The \nFederal Water Quality Protection Act is one of them. I want to thank \nsome of the many cosponsors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Casey):\n  S. 1141. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax incentives for small businesses; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Small Business \nTax Certainty and Growth Act of 2015. I am very pleased to be joined by \nmy friend and colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Casey, in \nintroducing this bipartisan bill.\n  I know it will come as no surprise to the Presiding Officer that \nsmall businesses are our Nation's job creators. Firms with fewer than \n500 employees generate about 50 percent of our Nation's GDP, account \nfor more than 99 percent of employers, and employ nearly half of all \nworkers. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, small businesses \ngenerated 63 percent of the net new jobs that were created between 1993 \nand 2013.\n  Even the smallest firms have a notable effect on our economy. The \nSmall Business Administration's data indicates that businesses with \nfewer than 20 employees accounted for 18 percent of all private sector \njobs in 2013. Our bill allows small businesses to plan for capital \ninvestments that are vital to expansion and job creation. It eases \ncomplex accounting rules for the smallest businesses and it reduces the \ntax burden on newly formed ventures.\n  Recent studies by the National Federation of Independent Business, \nNFIB, indicate that taxes are the No. 1 concern of small business \nowners and that constant change in the Tax Code is among their chief \nconcerns, and that is certainly the case in the State of Maine. When I \ntalk with employers across the State, they constantly tell me the \nuncertainty in our Tax Code and in the regulations that are coming out \nof Washington make it very difficult for them to plan, to hire new \nworkers, and to know what is going to be coming their way.\n  A key feature of our bill is that it provides the certainty that \nsmall businesses need to create and implement long-term capital \ninvestment plans that are vital to their growth. I will give an \nexample. Section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code allows small \nbusinesses to deduct the costs of acquired assets more rapidly. The \namount of the maximum allowable deduction has changed three times in \nthe past 8 years. Making matters worse, it is usually not addressed \nuntil it is part of a huge package of extenders passed at the end of \nthe year, making this tax benefit unpredictable from year to year and, \ntherefore, difficult for small businesses to take full advantage of in \ntheir long-range planning. They essentially have to gamble that the tax \nincentive is going to be extended and that it is going to be made \nretroactive to the 1st of the year.\n  Just recently, I spoke with Patrick Schrader from Arundel Machine, a \nsmall business in Maine. He told me that the uncertainty surrounding \nsection 179 has hindered his ability to make sound business decisions. \nThe high-tech equipment that he needs requires months of lead time. For \na small business like Patrick's, it is very risky to increase spending \nto expand and create new jobs when the deductibility of the machinery \nthat helps to make those jobs possible remains unknown until late \nDecember. For business planning, this is information that is vital to \nhave at the beginning of the year, not at the end of the year. This \nuncertainty has a direct impact on hiring decisions and the ability to \ntake advantage of business opportunities.\n  Our bill permanently sets the maximum allowable deduction under \nsection 179 at $500,000, indexed for inflation, and it is also \nstructured in such a way that it is really targeted to our smaller \nbusinesses.\n  Our bill will also permanently extend the ability of restaurants, \nretailers, and certain businesses that lease their space to depreciate \nthe costs of property improvements over 15 years rather than over 39 \nyears. Think about that. What restaurant is going to be able to wait 39 \nyears before doing upgrades and improvements? What we are trying to do \nis to better match the depreciation schedule with the need to update a \nrestaurant or a retail space.\n  The Small Business Tax Certainty and Growth Act also allows more \ncompanies to use the cash method of accounting by permanently doubling \nthe threshold at which the more complex accrual method is required from \n$5 million in gross receipts to $10 million. This includes an expansion \nin the ability of small businesses to use simplified methods of \naccounting for inventories.\n  Our legislation also eases the tax burden on a new startup business \nby permanently doubling the deduction for those initial expenses from \n$5,000 to $10,000, and for a very small business, that is really \nimportant. Similar to section 179, this benefit is limited to small \nbusinesses and the deduction phases out for total expenses exceeding \n$60,000.\n  Our legislation extends for 1 year a provision that provides benefits \nto businesses of all sizes, the so-called bonus depreciation.\n  Let me make clear that I continue to believe Congress should \nundertake comprehensive tax reform, with three major goals. It should \nresult in a Tax Code that is more progrowth, that is fairer, and that \nis simpler. I urge the Senate to undertake such a reform, but in the \nmeantime, the provisions of our bill would make a real difference in \nthe ability of our Nation's small businesses to keep and create jobs.\n  I will give another real-life example of what the small business \nexpensing provisions can mean. I am proud to say Maine is known for its \ndelicious craft beers. Dan Kleban founded Maine Beer Company with his \nbrother in 2009. In 6 short years, the company has added 21 good-paying \njobs with generous health and retirement benefits. They plan to hire at \nleast three more workers shortly. Dan noted that his company's business \ndecisions were directly affected by section 179 expensing.\n\n  Here is why. This provision allowed them to expand by reinvesting \ntheir capital in new equipment to produce more beer and hire more \nMainers.\n\n[[Page S2572]]\n\nThose are both good outcomes. In the last 3 years, they have taken the \nmaximum deduction allowed under section 179 to acquire the equipment \nthey needed to expand their business. This year, they hope to use the \nprovision to finance the cost of a solar project that will offset \nnearly 50 percent of their energy consumption.\n  If their business had been forced to spread these deductions over \nmany years, its owners would not have been able to grow the business as \nthey have done nor create those good jobs. This economic benefit is \nmultiplied when we consider the effect of the investment by Maine Beer \nCompany and Maine's many other craft brewers on the equipment \nmanufacturers, the transportation companies needed to haul the new \nequipment to their breweries, the increased inventory in their \nbreweries, and the suppliers of the materials needed to brew the \nadditional beer. So it has a ripple effect that benefits many other \nbusinesses and allows them to create more jobs as well.\n  In February, NFIB released new research that backs up this claim with \nhard numbers. They found that simply extending section 179 permanently \nat the 2014 level could increase employment by as much as 197,000 jobs \nduring the 10-year window following implementation. U.S. real output \ncould also increase by as much as $18.6 billion over the same period.\n  In light of the positive effects this bill would have on small \nbusinesses, on job creation, and on our economy, I urge my colleagues \nto join us in supporting the Small Business Tax Certainty and Growth \nAct. I would note that the bill has been endorsed by NFIB, the leading \nvoice for small business.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of endorsement \nfrom the NFIB be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            National Federation of\n\n\n                                         Independent Business,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 29, 2015.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: on behalf of the National Federation \n     of Independent Business (NFIB), the nation's leading small \n     business advocacy organization, I write in support of your \n     Small Business Tax Certainty and Growth Act, which would \n     provide certainty and permanency with regard to several \n     important tax provisions for small businesses.\n       The most important source of financing for small business \n     is their earnings, i.e. cash flow. In fact, cash flow is \n     ranked 13th out of 75 potential business problems in NFIB's \n     Small Business and Priorities. This is why NFIB is \n     particularly pleased to see the inclusion of reformed Section \n     179 expensing and expanded eligibility for cash accounting in \n     your legislation.\n       Expensing provides small businesses with an immediate \n     source of capital recovery and improved cash flow. \n     Unfortunately, small business expensing levels have only been \n     increased on a temporary basis, and at the beginning of this \n     year the limit reverted back to $25,000, which is highly \n     inadequate for the needs of small businesses. Unless Congress \n     acts, this lower expensing limit will mean that only 30 \n     percent of NFIB members will receive the full benefit of \n     small business expensing in 2015. A 2015 NFIB Research \n     Foundation study shows that a permanent expansion of the \n     expensing deduction allowance limit to $500,000 could \n     increase employment by as much as 197,000 jobs. NFIB supports \n     permanently increasing expensing limits to $500,000 as well \n     as permitting taxpayers to expense the cost of some \n     improvements to real property. We appreciate you \n     accomplishing these goals in your legislation while also \n     permanently indexing this provision to inflation.\n       Furthermore, small businesses would benefit from the \n     greater ability to use cash accounting for tax purposes. This \n     simplified accounting process would alleviate some of the \n     complexity of the tax code, which currently makes it very \n     difficult for small business owners to plan future \n     investments, hire new workers and grow their businesses. \n     Expanded cash accounting would help business owners manage \n     cash flow while better reflecting their ability to pay taxes.\n       Thank you for introducing this important legislation. We \n     look forward to working with you to provide tax relief for \n     small businesses in the 114th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Amanda Austin,\n                                    Vice President, Public Policy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. \n        Boxer, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Markey, Mr. Casey, Mr. Murphy, Ms. \n        Stabenow, Mr. Brown, Mr. Peters, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. \n        Shaheen, Mr. Reid, Mr. Schatz, Mr. Heinrich, Mr. Wyden, Mr. \n        Booker, Mr. Merkley, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Reed, Mr. Franken, Mrs. \n        Gillibrand, Mr. Cardin, Ms. Cantwell, Ms. Warren, Mr. Udall, \n        Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Kaine, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Whitehouse, and Ms. \n        Klobuchar):\n  S. 1150. A bill to provide for increases in the Federal minimum wage; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Vermont is among only 22 States in the \nNation with a minimum wage higher than that of the Federal minimum \nwage. The Green Mountain State has long recognized the importance of \npaying workers a fair and livable wage, and it is past time for \nCongress to catch up with the daily struggles of working American \nfamilies.\n  That is why today I am proud to join as a cosponsor of Senator \nMurray's Raise the Wage Act, to increase the Federal minimum wage to \n$12 by 2020. The Raise the Wage Act will help more 38 million Americans \nand thousands of Vermonters who yearn for financial security, for the \nsound footing to build their lives, and the lives of their children.\n  The Federal minimum wage has not kept up with inflation. In fact, it \nhas lost more than 30 percent of its value since 1968. Over that same \ntime, productivity has doubled, and low-wage workers today bring more \nexperience and education to the workforce. American workers are being \nasked to work more for less. It is past time to adjust this disparity.\n  In Vermont, 64,000 workers would see their wages improve if we raised \nthe minimum wage to $12. That is roughly $141 million in added income \nfor families in Vermont--families who could spend these earnings at the \nstore down the street, multiplying the economic impact to resonate \nthrough our local economies and downtown businesses.\n  Today, nearly two-thirds of Americans who earn the minimum wage or \nless are women; the Raise the Wage Act will improve the hard-earned \nwages of more than 21 million American women.\n  No one who works hard in a full-time job should live in poverty in \nour land, and raising the minimum wage should not be a question; it is \ncommonsense, it is fair, and it is right. It is the right step to take \nto help ensure that workers can earn wages that support their families.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself and Mr. Cruz):\n  S. 1153. A bill to provide legal certainty to property owners along \nthe Red River in Texas, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1153\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Business bankruptcies have increased sharply in recent \n     years and remain at high levels. These bankruptcies include \n     several of the largest business bankruptcy filings in \n     history. As the use of bankruptcy has expanded, job \n     preservation and retirement security are placed at greater \n     risk.\n       (2) Laws enacted to improve recoveries for employees and \n     retirees and limit their losses in bankruptcy cases have not \n     kept pace with the increasing and broader use of bankruptcy \n     by businesses in all sectors of the economy. However, while \n     protections for employees and retirees in bankruptcy cases \n     have eroded, management compensation plans devised for those \n     in charge of troubled businesses have become more prevalent \n     and are escaping adequate scrutiny.\n       (3) Changes in the law regarding these matters are urgently \n     needed as bankruptcy is used to address increasingly more \n     complex and diverse conditions affecting troubled businesses \n     and industries.\n\n        TITLE I--IMPROVING RECOVERIES FOR EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES\n\n     SEC. 101. INCREASED WAGE PRIORITY.\n\n       Section 507(a) of title 11, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (4)--\n       (A) by striking ``$10,000'' and inserting ``$20,000'';\n       (B) by striking ``within 180 days''; and\n       (C) by striking ``or the date of the cessation of the \n     debtor's business, whichever occurs first,'';\n       (2) in paragraph (5)(A), by striking--\n       (A) ``within 180 days''; and\n       (B) ``or the date of the cessation of the debtor's \n     business, whichever occurs first''; and\n       (3) in paragraph (5), by striking subparagraph (B) and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(B) for each such plan, to the extent of the number of \n     employees covered by each such plan, multiplied by \n     $20,000.''.\n\n     SEC. 102. CLAIM FOR STOCK VALUE LOSSES IN DEFINED \n                   CONTRIBUTION PLANS.\n\n       Section 101(5) of title 11, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (2) in subparagraph (B), by striking the period at the end \n     and inserting ``; or''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(C) right or interest in equity securities of the debtor, \n     or an affiliate of the debtor, held in a defined contribution \n     plan (within the meaning of section 3(34) of the Employee \n     Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1002(34))) \n     for the benefit of an individual who is not an insider, a \n     senior executive officer, or any of the 20 next most highly \n     compensated employees of the debtor (if 1 or more are not \n     insiders), if such securities were attributable to either \n     employer contributions by the debtor or an affiliate of the \n     debtor, or elective deferrals (within the meaning of section \n     402(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986), and any \n     earnings thereon, if an employer or plan sponsor who has \n     commenced a case under this title has committed fraud with \n     respect to such plan or has otherwise breached a duty to the \n     participant that has proximately caused the loss of value.''.\n\n     SEC. 103. PRIORITY FOR SEVERANCE PAY.\n\n       Section 503(b) of title 11, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (8)(B), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (2) in paragraph (9), by striking the period and inserting \n     a semicolon; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(10) severance pay owed to employees of the debtor (other \n     than to an insider, other senior management, or a consultant \n     retained to provide services to the debtor), under a plan, \n     program, or policy generally applicable to employees of the \n     debtor (but not under an individual contract of employment), \n     or owed\n\n[[Page S2574]]\n\n     pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, for layoff or \n     termination on or after the date of the filing of the \n     petition, which pay shall be deemed earned in full upon such \n     layoff or termination of employment; and''.\n\n     SEC. 104. FINANCIAL RETURNS FOR EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES.\n\n       Section 1129(a) of title 11, United States Code is \n     amended--\n       (1) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(17) The plan provides for recovery of damages payable \n     for the rejection of a collective bargaining agreement, or \n     for other financial returns as negotiated by the debtor and \n     the authorized representative under section 1113 (to the \n     extent that such returns are paid under, rather than outside \n     of, a plan).''; and\n       (2) by striking paragraph (13) and inserting the following:\n       ``(13) With respect to retiree benefits, as that term is \n     defined in section 1114(a), the plan--\n       ``(A) provides for the continuation after its effective \n     date of payment of all retiree benefits at the level \n     established pursuant to subsection (e)(1)(B) or (g) of \n     section 1114 at any time before the date of confirmation of \n     the plan, for the duration of the period for which the debtor \n     has obligated itself to provide such benefits, or if no \n     modifications are made before confirmation of the plan, the \n     continuation of all such retiree benefits maintained or \n     established in whole or in part by the debtor before the date \n     of the filing of the petition; and\n       ``(B) provides for recovery of claims arising from the \n     modification of retiree benefits or for other financial \n     returns, as negotiated by the debtor and the authorized \n     representative (to the extent that such returns are paid \n     under, rather than outside of, a plan).''.\n\n     SEC. 105. PRIORITY FOR WARN ACT DAMAGES.\n\n       Section 503(b)(1)(A)(ii) of title 11, United States Code is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(ii) wages and benefits awarded pursuant to a judicial \n     proceeding or a proceeding of the National Labor Relations \n     Board as back pay or damages attributable to any period of \n     time occurring after the date of commencement of the case \n     under this title, as a result of a violation of Federal or \n     State law by the debtor, without regard to the time of the \n     occurrence of unlawful conduct on which the award is based or \n     to whether any services were rendered on or after the \n     commencement of the case, including an award by a court under \n     section 2901 of title 29, United States Code, of up to 60 \n     days' pay and benefits following a layoff that occurred or \n     commenced at a time when such award period includes a period \n     on or after the commencement of the case, if the court \n     determines that payment of wages and benefits by reason of \n     the operation of this clause will not substantially increase \n     the probability of layoff or termination of current employees \n     or of nonpayment of domestic support obligations during the \n     case under this title;''.\n\n           TITLE II--REDUCING EMPLOYEES' AND RETIREES' LOSSES\n\n     SEC. 201. REJECTION OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS.\n\n       Section 1113 of title 11, United States Code, is amended by \n     striking subsections (a) through (f) and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(a) The debtor in possession, or the trustee if one has \n     been appointed under this chapter, other than a trustee in a \n     case covered by subchapter IV of this chapter and by title I \n     of the Railway Labor Act, may reject a collective bargaining \n     agreement only in accordance with this section. In this \n     section, a reference to the trustee includes the debtor in \n     possession.\n       ``(b) No provision of this title shall be construed to \n     permit the trustee to unilaterally terminate or alter any \n     provision of a collective bargaining agreement before \n     complying with this section. The trustee shall timely pay all \n     monetary obligations arising under the terms of the \n     collective bargaining agreement. Any such payment required to \n     be made before a plan confirmed under section 1129 is \n     effective has the status of an allowed administrative expense \n     under section 503.\n       ``(c)(1) If the trustee seeks modification of a collective \n     bargaining agreement, the trustee shall provide notice to the \n     labor organization representing the employees covered by the \n     agreement that modifications are being proposed under this \n     section, and shall promptly provide an initial proposal for \n     modifications to the agreement. Thereafter, the trustee shall \n     confer in good faith with the labor organization, at \n     reasonable times and for a reasonable period in light of the \n     complexity of the case, in attempting to reach mutually \n     acceptable modifications of such agreement.\n       ``(2) The initial proposal and subsequent proposals by the \n     trustee for modification of a collective bargaining agreement \n     shall be based upon a business plan for the reorganization of \n     the debtor, and shall reflect the most complete and reliable \n     information available.

A bill to ensure the privacy and security of sensitive \npersonal information, to prevent and mitigate identity theft, to \nprovide notice of security breaches involving sensitive personal \ninformation, and to enhance law enforcement assistance and other \nprotections against security breaches, fraudulent access, and misuse of \npersonal information; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Consumer \nPrivacy Protection Act of 2015. This comprehensive legislation will \nhelp ensure that the corporations Americans entrust with their most \npersonal information are taking steps to keep it secure. Data breaches \ncontinue to plague American businesses and compromise the privacy of \nmillions of consumers. At the same time, the amount of information we \nshare with corporations who are the target of these breaches is \ngrowing. Corporations collect and store our social security numbers, \nour bank account information, and our email addresses. They collect \ninformation about our private health and medical conditions. They know \nwhat routes we take to and from work and where we drop our kids off at \nschool. They can replicate our fingerprints. We even trust them with \nprivate photographs that we store in the cloud.\n  Corporations benefit financially from our personal information, and \nthey should be obligated to take steps to keep it safe. Too often, \nhowever, private information falls into the hands of those who would do \nus harm and we are not even told. Last year, in what is commonly \nreferred to as the ``Year of the Data Breach,'' breaches at \ncorporations, including Home Depot, Neiman Marcus, and Sony Pictures, \nas well as many others, demonstrated how vulnerable our corporations \nare to hackers and cyber criminals. In some cases these breaches \nexposed credit card data, social security numbers, or bank account \ninformation that left millions at risk of financial fraud or identity \ntheft, and in other cases they exposed personal and private information \nto the public that led to embarrassment and reputational harm.\n  The Consumer Privacy Protection Act I am introducing today seeks to \nprotect the vast amount of information that we now share with \ncorporations each and every day, and it builds and expands on data \nsecurity legislation that I have introduced every Congress since 2005. \nIn today's modern world, data security is no longer just about \nprotecting our identities and our bank accounts; it is about protecting \nour privacy. Americans want to know when someone has had unauthorized \naccess to their emails, to their bank accounts, and to their private \nfamily pictures, but they do not just want to be notified of yet \nanother data breach. Americans want to know that the corporations who \nare profiting from their information are actually doing something to \nprevent the next data breach. Consumers should not have to settle for \nmere notice of data breaches. American consumers deserve protection. \nThis legislation would accomplish that.\n  The Consumer Privacy Protection Act requires that corporations meet \ncertain privacy and data security standards to keep information they \nstore about their customers safe, and requires that corporations notify \nthe customer in the event of a breach. This legislation protects broad \ncategories of data, including, social security numbers and other \ngovernment-issued identification numbers; financial account \ninformation, including credit card numbers and bank accounts; online \nusernames and passwords, including email names and passwords; unique \nbiometric data, including fingerprints; information about a person's \nphysical and mental health; information about geolocation; and access \nto private digital photographs and videos.\n  I understand that not every breach can be prevented. Cyber criminals \nare determined and constantly looking for new ways to pierce the most \nsophisticated security systems. But just as we expect a bank to put a \nlock on the front door and an alarm on the vault to protect its \ncustomers' money, we expect corporations to take reasonable measures to \nprotect the personal information they collect from us. Unfortunately, \nmany of the corporations that profit from the very information that we \nentrust them to protect, have woefully inadequate measures to secure \nthis information. For others, security is simply not a priority. \nAmerican consumers deserve better.\n  This legislation creates civil penalties for corporations that fail \nto meet the required privacy and data security standards established in \nthe bill or fail to notify customers when a breach occurs. The \nDepartment of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and the State \nAttorneys General each have a role in enforcement. This legislation \nalso requires corporations to inform Federal law enforcement, such as \nthe Secret Service and the FBI, of all large data breaches, as well as \nbreaches that could impact the federal government. Such notification is \nnecessary to help law enforcement bring these cyber criminals to \njustice and identify patterns that help protect against future attacks.\n  Many Americans understandably assume Federal law already protects \nthis sensitive information--common sense tells us that it should. \nUnfortunately, the reality is that it does not. States provide a \npatchwork of protection, and while some laws are strong, others are \nnot. For example, 47 States and the District of Columbia require some \nform of data breach notification, but only 12 States have passed data \nsecurity requirements designed to prevent data breaches. My home state \nof Vermont has a strong data breach notification law that has been in \neffect since 2007.\n  In crafting Federal law, we must be careful not to override the \nstrong State laws that took years to accomplish with weaker Federal \nprotections, but we also need to ensure that all Americans, regardless \nof where they live, have their privacy protected. To this end, the \nConsumer Privacy Protection Act preempts State law relating to data \nsecurity and data breach notification only to the extent that the \nprotections under those laws are weaker than those provided for in this \nbill. We must ensure that consumers do not lose privacy protections \nthey currently enjoy. Since this bill is modeled after those States \nwith the strongest consumer protections, however, I believe it will \nimprove protections for consumers in nearly every State.\n  I am joined today by Senators Franken, Warren, Blumenthal, Wyden, and \nMarkey in introducing this legislation. These Senators have long shared \nmy commitment to protecting consumer privacy. This legislation also has \nthe support of leading consumer privacy advocates, including: Center \nfor Democracy and Technology, Consumers Union, National Consumers \nLeague, New America's Open Technology Institute, Consumer Federation of \nAmerica, and Privacy Rights Clearinghouse.\n  Millions of Americans who have had their personal information \ncompromised or stolen as a result of a data\n\n[[Page S2578]]\n\nbreach consider this issue to be of critical importance and a priority \nfor the Senate. Protecting privacy rights should be important to all of \nus, regardless of party or ideology. I hope that all Senators will \nsupport this measure to better protect Americans' privacy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 1169. A bill to reauthorize and improve the Juvenile Justice and \nDelinquency Prevention Act of 1974, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Juvenile \nJustice and Delinquency Prevention Reauthorization Act of 2015. Senator \nWhitehouse is joining me in this effort.\n  This measure would improve our Nation's response to juvenile \noffenders in the criminal justice system.\n  For the last 40 or so years, the Federal Government, through the \nJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, or JJDPA, has provided \nguidelines and resources to help States serve troubled adolescents.\n  This 1974 law provides juvenile justice dollars to States and sets \nfour core requirements for States that choose to accept these Federal \nfunds. The law also created the Office of Juvenile Justice and \nDelinquency Prevention at the Justice Department.\n  A centerpiece of the current statute is its standards for the \ntreatment of at-risk youth who come into contact with our criminal \njustice system. But these standards have not been updated since 2002, \nand the law's authorization has expired.\n  Since Congress last extended the law more than a dozen years ago, \nevidence has emerged that some of the JJDPA's provisions need to be \nimproved or strengthened to reflect the latest research on adolescent \ndevelopment.\n  As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I have made this law's \nrenewal a priority. The bill I am introducing would extend the statute \nfor 5 years and update its provisions to reflect the latest research on \nwhat works with troubled adolescents.\n  The bill also would continue Congress's commitment to help State and \nlocal jurisdictions improve their juvenile justice systems through a \nprogram of formula grants. At the same time, the bill would improve the \noversight and accountability of this grant program in several key ways.\n  Such accountability measures are vitally needed to ensure the grant \nprogram's integrity.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee heard testimony from whistleblowers \nlast week that the Justice Department is failing to hold participating \nStates accountable for meeting the JJDPA's four core requirements.\n  After I wrote several letters concerning these whistleblower \nallegations, the Justice Department admitted to having a flawed \ncompliance monitoring policy in place since 1997. This policy allowed \nStates to receive JJDPA formula grants in violation of the law's \nfunding requirements.\n  Witnesses at last week's Senate Judiciary hearing recounted \nviolations of law, mismanagement, and waste of limited juvenile justice \ngrant funds, in addition to retaliation against whistleblowers.\n  This is an injustice not only to the taxpayers but also to the youth \nwho face inadequate juvenile justice systems. It is also an injustice \nto the children who end up in the justice system as a result of poor \nexperience in the foster care system.\n  Shortcomings in the juvenile justice system will not be solved \novernight. But I look forward to taking the lead on legislation in the \n114th Congress that will make measurable improvements.\n  In closing, numerous organizations have worked with us on the \ndevelopment of this bill, and I thank them for their contributions. I \nalso thank Senator Whitehouse for his cosponsorship of the legislation, \nand I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting its passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 1170. A bill to amend title 39, United States Code, to extend the \nauthority of the United States Postal Service to issue a semipostal to \nraise funds for breast cancer research, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto reauthorize the Breast Cancer Research Stamp for 4 more years.\n  Without Congressional action, this important and effective way of \nraising additional funds for critical research will expire at the end \nof this year. These stamps are sold for a little more than the cost of \nfirst class postage, so customers can choose to donate in a simple and \neasy way.\n  Since 1998, more than 986 million breast cancer research stamps have \nbeen sold, raising over $80.4 million for breast cancer research. The \nfunds have gone to support breast cancer research at both the National \nInstitutes of Health, NIH, and the Department of Defense.\n  For example, the National Institutes of Health has used proceeds from \nthe Breast Cancer Research Stamp to fund the Maternal Pregnancy Factors \nand Breast Cancer Risk Study. This study was designed to identify \npossible connections between various conditions during pregnancy and \nbreast cancer risk. After comparing information from women who \ndelivered babies and were later diagnosed with breast cancer to women \nwho delivered babies and were not diagnosed with breast cancer, \nresearchers found that factors like preeclampsia or carrying twins may \nincrease cancer risk. Knowing these risk factors helps both doctors and \npatients be vigilant about early screening.\n  Thanks to breakthroughs in cancer research, more and more breast \ncancer patients are becoming survivors. Nearly all patients with breast \ncancer caught in the early stages now survive. That is incredible, and \na testament to how important this research has been.\n  Though despite our great successes, the need for continued research \nand improved screening and treatments remains high.\n  Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in \nthe U.S. and the second leading cause of cancer deaths. One in eight \nwomen will be diagnosed, and more than 40,000 die from the disease each \nyear.\n  Though male breast cancer is less common, an estimated 2,350 men will \nbe diagnosed with breast cancer this year.\n  The Breast Cancer Research Stamp provides a simple, convenient way \nfor Americans to contribute toward this vitally important research. It \nalso provides a symbol of hope for those affected by this disease.\n  I thank Senator Enzi for joining me to support this bipartisan \nlegislation and urge my colleagues to join us and ensure the stamp \ncontinues for another 4 years.\n  This bill is supported by organizations including: the American \nAssociation of Cancer Research, AACR, American Cancer Society Cancer \nAction Network, ACS CAN, American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, \nACOG, American College of Surgeons, Are You Defense Advocacy, Breast \nCancer Fund, Breast Cancer Research Foundation, Center for Women Policy \nStudies, Susan G. Komen, and the Tigerlily Foundation.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/30/senate-section/article/S2578-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2578-S2579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 156--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE WITH RESPECT \n TO CHILDHOOD STROKE AND RECOGNIZING MAY 2015 AS ``NATIONAL PEDIATRIC \n                        STROKE AWARENESS MONTH''\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL (for himself, Ms. Ayotte, and Mr. Murphy) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S.

Res. 158\n\n       Whereas May 5, or ``Cinco de Mayo'' in Spanish, is \n     celebrated each year as a date of importance by Mexican and \n     Mexican-American communities;\n       Whereas the Cinco de Mayo holiday commemorates May 5, 1862, \n     the date on which Mexicans defeated the French at the Battle \n     of Puebla, one of the many battles that the Mexican people \n     won in their long and brave fight for independence, freedom, \n     and democracy;\n       Whereas the victory of Mexico over France at Puebla \n     represented a historic triumph for the Mexican government \n     during the Franco-Mexican war of 1861-1867 and bolstered the \n     resistance movement;\n       Whereas the success of Mexico at the Battle of Puebla \n     reinvigorated the spirits of the Mexican people and provided \n     a renewed sense of unity and strength;\n       Whereas the French army, which had not experienced defeat \n     against any of the finest troops of Europe in more than half \n     a century, sustained a disastrous loss at the hands of an \n     outnumbered and ill-equipped, but highly spirited and \n     courageous, Mexican army;\n       Whereas the courageous spirit that Mexican General Ignacio \n     Zaragoza and his men displayed during that historic battle \n     can never be forgotten;\n       Whereas, in a larger sense, Cinco de Mayo symbolizes the \n     right of a free people to self-determination, just as Benito \n     Juarez, the president of Mexico during the Battle of Puebla, \n     once said, ``El respeto al derecho ajeno es la paz'', meaning \n     ``respect for the rights of others is peace'';\n       Whereas the sacrifice of Mexican fighters was instrumental \n     in keeping Mexico from falling under European domination \n     while, in the United States, the Union Army battled \n     Confederate forces in the Civil War;\n       Whereas Cinco de Mayo serves as a reminder that the \n     foundation of the United States was built by people from many \n     countries and diverse cultures who were willing to fight and \n     die for freedom;\n       Whereas Cinco de Mayo also serves as a reminder of the \n     close ties between the people of Mexico and the people of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas Cinco de Mayo encourages the celebration of a \n     legacy of strong leaders and a sense of vibrancy in \n     communities; and\n       Whereas Cinco de Mayo serves as a reminder to provide more \n     opportunity for future generations: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the historic struggle of the people of \n     Mexico for independence and freedom, which Cinco de Mayo \n     commemorates; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     Cinco de Mayo with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n[[Page S2580]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/30/senate-section/article/S2580-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 159--DESIGNATING APRIL 2015, AS ``NATIONAL 9-1-1 \n                           EDUCATION MONTH''\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR (for herself and Mr. Burr) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

113 Stat. 1286);\n       Whereas section 102 of the ENHANCE 911 Act of 2004 (47 \n     U.S.C. 942 note) declared an enhanced 9-1-1 system to be ``a \n     high national priority'' and part of ``our Nation's homeland \n     security and public safety'';\n       Whereas it is important that policy makers at all levels of \n     government understand the importance of 9-1-1, how the 9-1-1 \n     system works, and the steps that are needed to modernize the \n     9-1-1 system;\n       Whereas the 9-1-1 system is the connection between the eyes \n     and ears of the public and the emergency response system in \n     the United States and is often the first place emergencies of \n     all magnitudes are reported, making 9-1-1 a significant \n     homeland security asset;\n       Whereas more than 6,000 9-1-1 public safety answering \n     points serve more than 3,000 counties and parishes throughout \n     the United States;\n       Whereas telecommunicators at public safety answering points \n     answer more than 200,000,000 9-1-1 calls each year in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas a growing number of 9-1-1 calls are made using \n     wireless and Internet Protocol-based communications services;\n       Whereas a growing segment of the population of the United \n     States, including individuals who are deaf, hard of hearing, \n     or deaf-blind, or have speech disabilities, is increasingly \n     communicating with nontraditional text, video, and instant \n     messaging communications services and expects those services \n     to be able to connect directly to 9-1-1;\n       Whereas the growth and variety of means of communication, \n     including mobile and Internet Protocol-based systems, impose \n     challenges for accessing 9-1-1 and implementing an enhanced \n     9-1-1 system and require increased education and awareness \n     about the capabilities of different means of communication;\n       Whereas numerous other ``N-1-1'' and 800 number services \n     exist for nonemergency situations, including 2-1-1, 3-1-1, 5-\n     1-1, 7-1-1, 8-1-1, poison control centers, and mental health \n     hotlines, and the public needs to be educated on when to use \n     those services in addition to or instead of 9-1-1;\n       Whereas international visitors and immigrants make up an \n     increasing percentage of the population of the United States \n     each year, and visitors and immigrants may have limited \n     knowledge of the emergency calling system in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas people of all ages use 9-1-1 and it is critical to \n     educate people on the proper use of 9-1-1;\n       Whereas senior citizens are highly likely to need to access \n     9-1-1 and many senior citizens are learning to use new \n     technology;\n       Whereas thousands of 9-1-1 calls are made every year by \n     children properly trained in the use of 9-1-1, which saves \n     lives and underscores the critical importance of training \n     children early in life about 9-1-1;\n       Whereas the 9-1-1 system is often misused, including by the \n     placement of prank and nonemergency calls;\n       Whereas misuse of the 9-1-1 system results in costly and \n     inefficient use of 9-1-1 and emergency response resources and \n     needs to be reduced;\n       Whereas parents, teachers, and all other caregivers need to \n     play an active role in 9-1-1 education for children, but can \n     do so only after first being educated themselves;\n       Whereas there are many avenues for 9-1-1 public education, \n     including safety fairs, school presentations, libraries, \n     churches, businesses, public safety answering point tours or \n     open houses, civic organizations, and senior citizen centers;\n       Whereas children, parents, teachers, and the National \n     Parent Teacher Association make vital contributions to the \n     education of children about the importance of 9-1-1 through \n     targeted outreach efforts to public and private school \n     systems;\n       Whereas the United States should strive to host at least 1 \n     educational event regarding the proper use of 9-1-1 in every \n     school in the country every year;\n       Whereas programs to promote proper use of 9-1-1 during \n     National 9-1-1 Education Month could include--\n       (1) public awareness events, including conferences, media \n     outreach, and training activities for parents, teachers, \n     school administrators, other caregivers, and businesses;\n       (2) educational events in schools and other appropriate \n     venues; and\n       (3) production and distribution of information about the 9-\n     1-1 system designed to educate people of all ages on the \n     importance and proper use of 9-1-1; and\n       Whereas the people of the United States deserve the best \n     education regarding the use of 9-1-1: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 2015 as ``National 9-1-1 Education \n     Month''; and\n       (2) urges governmental officials, parents, teachers, school \n     administrators, caregivers, businesses, nonprofit \n     organizations, and the people of the United States to observe \n     the month with appropriate ceremonies, training events, and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/30/senate-section/article/S2580-2", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2580-S2581]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 160--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT PUBLIC \nSERVANTS SHOULD BE COMMENDED FOR THEIR DEDICATION AND CONTINUED SERVICE \n      TO THE UNITED STATES DURING PUBLIC SERVICE RECOGNITION WEEK\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP (for herself, Mr. Lankford, Mr. Carper, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \nTester, Mr. Coons, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Brown, Mr. Cardin, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. \nBooker, Mr. Schatz, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Peters) submitted \nthe following resolution;

which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 161\n\n       Whereas according to the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation (referred to in this preamble as the ``FDIC''), \n     at least 27.7 percent of households in the United States, or \n     nearly 34,400,000 households with approximately 67,600,000 \n     adults, are unbanked or underbanked and therefore have not \n     had the opportunity to access savings, lending, and other \n     basic financial services;\n       Whereas according to the FDIC, approximately 30 percent of \n     banks reported in 2011 that consumers lacked understanding of \n     the financial products and services banks offered;\n       Whereas according to the 2014 Consumer Financial Literacy \n     Survey Final Report of the National Foundation for Credit \n     Counseling--\n       (1) approximately 41 percent of adults in the United States \n     gave themselves a grade of C, D, or F on their knowledge of \n     personal finance, and 73 percent of adults acknowledged that \n     they could benefit from additional advice and answers to \n     everyday financial questions from a professional;\n       (2) 24 percent of adults in the United States, or \n     approximately 56,300,000 individuals, admitted to not paying \n     their bills on time;\n       (3) only 39 percent of adults in the United States reported \n     keeping close track of their spending, a percentage that has \n     held steady since 2007; and\n       (4) 16 percent of adults in the United States, or over \n     37,500,000 individuals, said not having enough ``rainy day'' \n     savings for an emergency is their greatest financial concern, \n     while the same percentage said that their greatest financial \n     concern is not having enough money set aside for retirement;\n\n       Whereas the 2014 Retirement Confidence Survey conducted by \n     the Employee Benefit Research Institute found that only 18 \n     percent of workers were ``very confident'' about having \n     enough money for a comfortable retirement, which is a sharp \n     decline in worker confidence from the 27 percent of workers \n     who were ``very confident'' in 2007, while approximately 56 \n     percent of workers say they or their spouses have not \n     calculated the amount of money they need to save for \n     retirement;\n       Whereas according to a 2015 ``Flow of Funds'' report by the \n     Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, outstanding \n     household debt in the United States was $13,500,000,000,000 \n     at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014;\n       Whereas according to the 2014 Survey of the States: \n     Economic and Personal Finance Education in Our Nation's \n     Schools, a biennial report by the Council for Economic \n     Education--\n       (1) only 24 States require students to take an economics \n     course as a high school graduation requirement;

Res. 165\n\n       Whereas April 25th of each year is recognized \n     internationally as World Malaria Day;\n       Whereas malaria is a leading cause of death and disease in \n     many developing countries, despite being preventable and \n     treatable;\n\n[[Page S2583]]\n\n       Whereas fighting malaria is in the national interest of the \n     United States, as reducing the risk of malaria protects \n     members of the Armed Forces of the United States and other \n     people of the United States serving overseas in malaria-\n     endemic regions, and reducing malaria deaths helps to lower \n     risks of instability in less developed countries;\n       Whereas support for efforts to fight malaria is in the \n     diplomatic and moral interest of the United States, as that \n     support generates goodwill toward the United States and \n     highlights the values of the people of the United States \n     through the work of governmental, nongovernmental, and faith-\n     based organizations of the United States;\n       Whereas efforts to fight malaria are in the long-term \n     economic interest of the United States because those efforts \n     help developing countries--\n       (1) identify at-risk populations;\n       (2) provide a framework for critical emergency disease \n     treatment;\n       (3) provide better health services;\n       (4) increase local governance needed to address substandard \n     and counterfeit medicines that exacerbate malaria resistance;\n       (5) produce healthier and more productive workforces;\n       (6) advance economic development; and\n       (7) promote stronger trading partners;\n       Whereas malaria transmission occurred in 97 countries and \n     territories in 2014, and an estimated 3,200,000,000 people \n     are at risk for malaria, the majority of whom are in sub-\n     Saharan Africa, which accounts for 90 percent of malaria \n     deaths in the world;\n       Whereas young children and pregnant women are particularly \n     vulnerable to and disproportionately affected by malaria;\n       Whereas malaria greatly affects the health of children, as \n     children under the age of 5 account for an estimated 78 \n     percent of malaria deaths each year;\n       Whereas malaria poses great risks to maternal and neonatal \n     health, causing complications during delivery, anemia, and \n     low birth weights, and estimates indicate that malaria \n     infection causes approximately 400,000 cases of severe \n     maternal anemia and between 75,000 and 200,000 infant deaths \n     annually in sub-Saharan Africa;\n       Whereas heightened national, regional, and international \n     efforts to prevent and treat malaria during recent years have \n     made significant progress and helped save hundreds of \n     thousands of lives;\n       Whereas the World Malaria Report 2014 by the World Health \n     Organization states that in 2013, approximately 49 percent of \n     households in sub-Saharan Africa owned at least one \n     insecticide-treated mosquito net, and household surveys \n     indicated that 90 percent of people used an insecticide-\n     treated mosquito net if one was available in the household;\n       Whereas, in 2013, approximately 123,000,000 people were \n     protected by indoor residual spraying;\n       Whereas the World Malaria Report 2014 further states that \n     between 2000 and 2013--\n       (1) malaria mortality rates decreased by 47 percent around \n     the world;\n       (2) in the African Region of the World Health Organization, \n     malaria mortality rates decreased by 54 percent; and\n       (3) an estimated 4,300,000 malaria deaths were averted \n     globally, primarily as a result of increased interventions;\n       Whereas the World Malaria Report 2014 further states that \n     out of 97 countries with ongoing transmission of malaria in \n     2014--\n       (1) 10 countries are classified as being in the pre-\n     elimination phase;\n       (2) 9 countries are classified as being in the elimination \n     phase; and\n       (3) 7 countries are classified as being in the prevention \n     of malaria reintroduction phase of malaria control;\n       Whereas continued national, regional, and international \n     investment in efforts to eliminate malaria, including \n     prevention and treatment efforts, the development of a \n     vaccine to immunize children from the malaria parasite, and \n     advancements in insecticides, are critical in order to \n     continue to reduce malaria deaths, prevent backsliding in \n     areas where progress has been made, and equip the United \n     States and the global community with the tools necessary to \n     fight malaria and other global health threats;\n       Whereas the United States Government has played a leading \n     role in the recent progress made toward reducing the global \n     burden of malaria, particularly through the President's \n     Malaria Initiative (referred to in this preamble as the \n     ``PMI'') and the contribution of the United States to the \n     Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria;\n       Whereas, in May 2011, an independent, external evaluation, \n     prepared by Boston University, examining 6 objectives of the \n     PMI, found the PMI to be a successful, well-led program that \n     has ``earned and deserves the task of sustaining and \n     expanding the United States Government's response to global \n     malaria control efforts'';\n       Whereas the United States Government is pursuing a \n     comprehensive approach to ending malaria deaths through the \n     PMI, which is led by the United States Agency for \n     International Development and implemented with assistance \n     from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the \n     Department of State, the Department of Health and Human \n     Services, the National Institutes of Health, the Department \n     of Defense, and private sector entities;\n       Whereas the PMI focuses on helping partner countries \n     achieve major improvements in overall health outcomes through \n     improved access to, and quality of, healthcare services in \n     locations with limited resources; and\n       Whereas the PMI, recognizing the burden of malaria on many \n     partner countries, has set a target by 2020 of reducing \n     malaria mortality by \\1/3\\ from 2015 levels in PMI-supported \n     countries, achieving a greater than 80 percent reduction from \n     original 2000 baseline levels set by the PMI, reducing \n     malaria morbidity in PMI-supported countries by 40 percent \n     from 2015 levels, and assisting at least 5 PMI-supported \n     countries to meet the criteria of the World Health \n     Organization for national or sub-national pre-elimination: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of World Malaria Day;\n       (2) recognizes the importance of reducing malaria \n     prevalence and deaths to improve overall child and maternal \n     health, especially in sub-Saharan Africa;\n       (3) commends the recent progress made toward reducing \n     global malaria morbidity, mortality, and prevalence, \n     particularly through the efforts of the President's Malaria \n     Initiative and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, \n     and Malaria;\n       (4) welcomes ongoing public-private partnerships to \n     research and develop more effective and affordable tools for \n     malaria diagnosis, treatment, and vaccination;\n       (5) recognizes the goals, priorities, and authorities to \n     combat malaria set forth in the Tom Lantos and Henry J.
