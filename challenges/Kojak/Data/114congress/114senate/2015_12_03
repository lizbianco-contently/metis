Mr. President, I hope all Members of Congress--Democrats \nand Republicans, Members of the House and Senate--take a long, hard \nlook this morning, maybe in the mirror, and ask themselves: Where do I \nstand?\n  Yet again our country is faced with another sickening act of gun \nviolence. Yesterday's shooting rampage took the lives of 14 people and \nwounded at least 17 more, a number of those grievously injured. That \nwasn't the only shooting yesterday; a gunman in Georgia killed a woman \nand injured three others.\n  So where do we stand? We have an epidemic of gun violence in America, \nand it is nothing less than sickening.\n  Fort Hood, 13 dead; Tucson, 6 dead; Carson City, 4 dead; Aurora, 12 \ndead; Newtown, 20 little children, 6 educators; the Navy Yard in \nWashington, DC, 12 dead; Las Vegas, 3 dead, two of whom were police \nofficers. And I have heard this talk: Oh, it is so unusual, a husband \nand wife. These three people killed in Las Vegas were killed by a \nhusband-and-wife team. In Charleston, nine dead; Moneta, VA, two dead--\non live television, he came to kill two people. At Umpqua Community \nCollege, nine dead; Colorado Springs, three dead.\n  That tragic list is nowhere close to being comprehensive. The one in \nGeorgia yesterday--one dead, two wounded. It hardly made the press. But \nthe ones I just mentioned are a few that we picked up earlier this \nmorning in my office.\n  It would be very difficult to list all the mass killings that have \ntaken place in recent years. Why? Because we are 337 days into 2015 and \nwe have had at least 355 mass shootings--355 mass shootings in 337 \ndays. We are averaging more than one a day.\n  Two months ago I came to the floor very sad. I was here mourning the \nmurder of innocent community college students attending class in \nRoseburg, OR. I said then that each time our Nation endures one of \nthese mass killings, we go through the same routine. First we are \nshocked. Then we ask questions about the killers, their motives, and \nhow they got their hands on those guns. Then we wonder, what could we \nhave done to prevent this terrible thing from happening?\n  As I said, the disturbing part is that we don't do anything. We don't \ndo anything. We, as the legislative body of this country, do nothing. \nSo I have a question for every Member of this body: How can we live \nwith ourselves for failing to do the things that we know will reduce \ngun violence? Will it get rid of all of it? Of course not. But will it \nreduce it? Yes. We are complicit through our inaction, and if we \ncontinue to fail to act, we will be complicit today and every day into \nthe future. We will keep ending up right where we are, mourning \ninnocent victims in San Bernardino, CA, or Charleston or Newtown. When \nvictims turn to us for leadership and help, we will have nothing to \nshow but empty hands and a few empty gestures. It is despicable.\n  For far too long we have done nothing, even as the gun violence \nshakes our Nation to its core. We must do something. We can start by \npassing improved background check legislation. Is it asking too much \nthat if someone is crazy or a criminal, they shouldn't be able to walk \ninto any gun shop and buy a gun? Of course not. But that is the law in \nAmerica.\n  I know the thought of upsetting the National Rifle Association scares \neverybody--oh, especially my Republican colleagues. Do you know what \nscares the American people? Gun violence. These mass shootings at \nholiday parties frighten the American people. Is it unreasonable that \nthey are frightened?\n\n[[Page S8324]]\n\nOf course not. People are afraid to go to a movie theater or to a \nconcert.\n  The bill before the Senate today is to get rid of ObamaCare, and \neverybody knows it is just a gesture in futility. They have tried it 60 \ntimes or 48 times--I don't know; we lost track--in the House, and every \ntime, the same answer: No. In the Senate, we have done it 14, 15 \ntimes--always the same answer. Einstein said the definition of \n``insanity'' is when someone does the same thing over and over again \nknowing they are going to get the same result. So we are wasting our \ntime today. Everyone knows the result.\n  But we have the opportunity to cast a vote here today--or we will \nshortly--because we are focused on doing something. People on this side \nof the aisle are focused on doing something to stop this gun violence, \nand we are going to force amendments to that end today--not many but a \nfew. We will try to do something, anything.\n  Are we going to vote on expanded background checks? Shouldn't we do \nthat at least? We are going to vote to prevent criminals convicted of \nharassing women's health clinics from buying a gun, owning a gun.\n  Senators will have to decide where they stand on these amendments. Do \nthey stand with babies who were killed in Connecticut, families who \nwant to do nothing more than go about their day without the daily \nthreat of shootings? My friends in Nevada, two police officers in \nuniform sitting down to have a lunch break, and two people walk in \nbehind them and shoot them in the back of the head and kill them. They \nwent over to Walmart and killed another person.\n  People are afraid.\n  There was a time in my legislative career that I tried to work with \nthe National Rifle Association, but the NRA today is a far cry from the \nsportsmen's organization I once supported. The NRA once called \nmandatory background checks ``reasonable.'' That is what they said; I \nam not making this up. But now its leadership and organization have \ntransformed into a quasi-militant wing of the Republican Party. They \nare being pushed more and more into the camp of guns for everybody \nanytime they want them, and they are being pushed by the--they have a \ncompetitor now: Gun Owners of America.\n  Those who choose to do the NRA's bidding will be held accountable by \nour constituents. Their vote against these sensible measures will be a \nstain for all of the American people to see.\n  Something has to be done. We must take a stand. The American people \nare desperately looking for help--some help, any help. It will never be \npossible to prevent every shooting. We know that. But we have a \nresponsibility to try. There are certain things we can do. If someone \nis mentally deranged and a criminal, should they be able to walk in and \nbuy a gun anyplace? Of course not. We have a responsibility as \nlawmakers to enact commonsense reforms that have been proven to stop \nattacks and save lives. I hope Republicans will find the courage to \njoin with us and pass meaningful legislation to prevent further gun \nviolence.\n  I apologize for speaking before the Republican leader, but I was told \nhe was going to be late.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/senate-section/article/S8324-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, middle-class Americans continue to call \non Washington to build a bridge away from ObamaCare. They want better \ncare. They want real health reform. For too long, Democrats did \neverything to prevent Congress from passing the type of legislation \nnecessary to help these Americans who are hurting.\n  Well, today, Mr. President, that ends. Today, a middle class that has \nsuffered enough from a partisan law will see the Senate vote to build a \nbridge past ObamaCare and toward better care.\n  The Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act we are \ndebating deserves the support of every Member of this body because here \nis what we know. ObamaCare is a direct attack on the middle class. It \nis riddled with higher costs and broken promises. It is defined by \nfailure. It is punctuated with hopelessness. And the scale of its many \nbroken promises is matched only by the scale of its defenders' rigid \nand unfeeling responses to it.\n  Let us consider just a few right now. Americans were promised they \ncould keep their health plans if they liked them. It was a promise \nDemocrats made to sell ObamaCare and it is a promise they broke. \nAmericans could only keep their plans if the President liked them, not \nif they liked them. Americans could only keep their plans if the \nPresident liked them.\n  Millions saw the coverage they liked ripped away as a result of a \ncallous and partisan law.\n  Democrats' response to their broken promise? They tried to dismiss \nstories about folks losing insurance by saying they had lousy plans \nanyway and that they should be grateful the government was taking them \naway. The American people took a different view.\n  Here is a note I received from a constituent in Caldwell County when \nher family lost their plan. Here is what she said:\n\n       I was lied to by the President and Congress when we were \n     told the ``Affordable'' Care Act would not require us to \n     switch from our current insurance provider. My husband and I \n     work hard, pay a lot of taxes and ask for little from our \n     government. Is it asking too much for government to stay out \n     of my health insurance?\n\n  Americans were promised that ObamaCare would lower costs and even \nbring down premiums by $2,500 per family. It is a promise Democrats \nmade to sell ObamaCare, and it is a promise they broke.\n  Just last night, we learned from the government's own actuaries that \nObamaCare is leading to higher health care costs. We also know that \npremiums continue to shoot up by double digits in many areas, including \nKentucky.\n  Democrats' response to their broken promise? President Obama said \nAmericans who already had health insurance ``may not know that they've \ngot a better deal now [under ObamaCare] than they did, but they do.'' \nObviously, the President thinks he knows more about our health \ninsurance than we do. Of course, the American people took a different \nview.\n  One Kentuckian wrote me after being forced into an ObamaCare plan she \ncalled ``subpar'' with a nearly $5,000 deductible. ``I cried myself to \nsleep,'' she said. ``I work hard for every penny I earn,'' and this \n``is unacceptable.''\n  Americans were promised ObamaCare would create millions of jobs. It \nis a promise Democrats made to sell ObamaCare, and it is a promise they \nbroke. ObamaCare is leading to fewer jobs, not more of them. In \nKentucky, our Democratic Governor once declared it an ``undisputed \nfact'' that ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion had added 12,000 jobs to \nKentucky's economy. But as Kentuckians now know, he was undisputedly \nwrong. Not only did those jobs fail to materialize, but health care \njobs have actually declined in Kentucky since the passage of ObamaCare.\n  Democrats' response to their broken promise? I think this headline \nabout the comments of a senior Democrat captures it perfectly: \n``ObamaCare allows workers to `escape' their jobs''--to escape their \njobs. Well, the American people took a different view.\n  A constituent from Somerset wrote to tell me that ObamaCare's \nmandates were causing her to lose up to 11 hours--up to 11 hours--per \nweek at work, which meant about $440 less in her pocket every month. \n``ObamaCare,'' she said, ``[is] causing us to lose hours [and] lose \nwages, yet expecting us to spend more.''\n  Now, Americans were promised ObamaCare wouldn't touch Medicare. \nAmericans were promised that taxes\n\n[[Page S8325]]\n\nwouldn't increase. Americans were promised shopping for ObamaCare would \nbe as simple as shopping for a TV on Amazon. Three more promises, three \nmore betrayals, and on and on and on it has gone for more than 5 long \nyears.\n  Democrats need to understand it is time to face up to the pain and \nthe failure their law has caused. They can keep trying to talk past the \nmiddle class. They can keep trying to deny reality. But they have to \nrealize that no one is buying the spin but them.\n  Americans are living with the consequences of this broken law and its \nbroken promises every single day. Its negative effects are often felt \nin the most personal and visceral ways, and Americans are tired of \nbeing condescended to. They want change, and they want a bridge to \nbetter care, not ObamaCare, and this bill offers it.\n  I think Democrats have a particular responsibility to the millions \ntheir law has hurt already to help pass the law we have before us. I \nthink the President has a particular responsibility to the millions his \nlaw has hurt already to then sign it. That is the best way to build a \nbridge to a fresh start--to a better, healthier, and stronger \nbeginning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/senate-section/article/S8325-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE NEW SENATE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Now, Mr. President, on another matter, every day this \nweek I have mentioned some of the significant accomplishments of a \nSenate under new management--a Senate that has put its focus back on \nthe American people.\n  After years of inaction, this Senate took bipartisan action to help \nthe victims of modern day slavery. Many said the Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act would never pass the Senate, but we proved them wrong. \nWe proved it could actually pass by a wide bipartisan margin. In a new \nand more open Senate, Senator Cornyn was able to work with Democratic \npartners to ensure it ultimately did.\n  After years of inaction, the Senate took bipartisan action to protect \nthe privacy of Americans. Many said the Cybersecurity Information \nSharing Act would never pass the Senate, but we proved them wrong. We \nproved it could actually pass by a wide bipartisan margin. In a new and \nmore open Senate, Senator Burr, a Republican, and Senator Feinstein, a \nDemocrat, were able to ensure that it ultimately did.\n  After years of inaction, the Senate took bipartisan action to lift \nchildren up with better educational opportunities. Many said the Every \nChild Achieves Act would never pass the Senate, but we proved them \nwrong. We proved it could actually pass by a wide bipartisan margin. In \na new and more open Senate, Senator Alexander, a Republican, and \nSenator Murray, a Democrat, were able to ensure that it ultimately did.\n  And after years of inaction, the Senate took bipartisan action to \nmeaningfully improve our roads and infrastructure over the coming \nyears. Many said that the long-term Highway and Transportation Funding \nAct would never pass the Senate, but we proved them wrong. We proved it \ncould actually pass by a wide bipartisan margin. In a new and more open \nSenate, Senator Inhofe, a Republican, and Senator Boxer, a Democrat, \nwere able to ensure that it ultimately did.\n  Today, we are on the verge of passing that bill again. We are on the \nverge of passing it into law. The revised legislation we will consider \nprovides 5 full years of highway funding. It would be the longest term \nbill to pass Congress in almost two decades, and it would provide long-\nterm certainty in a fiscally responsible way. In other words, this bill \nwill finally provide State and local governments with the kind of \ncertainty they need to focus on longer term road and bridge projects. \nThis is a significant departure from years--years--of short-term \nextensions.\n  There is a lot more to say about what the new Congress has been able \nto achieve on behalf of the American people. I look forward to \ncontinuing to share these successes here on the floor.\n  Tuesday's announcement on the highway bill is just the latest \nreminder of what is possible in a new and more open Senate. It builds \nthe basis for more wins into the future. And most importantly, it is an \nachievement for the American people--an achievement that only a new \nCongress has been able to deliver.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wonder what my Republican friends do when \nthey are not here in Washington, DC. Do they bother to talk to their \nconstituents? Do they sit down and meet them at townhall meetings or \nacross a fence in someone's backyard? I have a hard time believing my \nRepublican friends are spending much time listening to constituents' \nconcerns. I already talked about guns today.\n  It seems to me what we are doing is counter to the needs of \nconstituents. This absurd--absurd--attempt to repeal the Affordable \nCare Act through reconciliation is a perfect example. Every day the \nRepublican leader comes to the floor and rails against ObamaCare, yet \nmore than 10 percent of his constituents are benefiting from the \nAffordable Care Act--500,000 people. I can't believe those people in \nKentucky are telling the Republican leader to take away their health \ncare.\n  Now, he is not alone in pushing the repeal that would expressly hurt \npeople back home. He and the junior Senator from Wyoming both oppose \nthe Affordable Care Act and the law's expansion of Medicaid, but their \nown Republican Governor--the Governor of Wyoming--is using ObamaCare to \nexpand health coverage for the people of Wyoming.\n  Wyoming Governor Matt Mead is proposing a Medicaid expansion that \nwill help 17,000 people. Now, 17,000 people in the sparsely populated \nState of Wyoming is a lot of people. Governor Mead wrote this to the \nState legislature:\n\n       This economic boost would stabilize services and inject tax \n     dollars paid by Wyoming citizens back into Wyoming \n     communities. The numbers are compelling.\n\n  But apparently those facts are not compelling enough for the Senators \nfrom Wyoming, who are both voting for repeal.\n  The Republican Senator from North Dakota has also been a critic of \nthe Affordable Care Act. Once again, his opposition does not jibe with \nwhat North Dakota's Governor is saying. North Dakota Governor Dennis \nDaugaard is fighting in the State legislature to expand Medicaid access \nto residents. He is a Republican and served for 10 years as John \nHoeven's Lieutenant Governor, but Senator Hoeven will vote for repeal.\n  The junior Senator from Montana is opposed to Medicaid expansion. \nEarlier in the month he seemed supportive of Montana's expansion of \nMedicaid saying:\n\n       I respect the decision of our Legislature and our governor \n     on Medicaid expansion. I'm one who respects their rights and \n     voices.\n\n  But today, I am told, he will perform a breathtaking about-face and \nvote to do away with Montana's health care.\n  There is a longer list. Republicans from Ohio, West Virginia, and the \nState of Nevada have all embraced Medicaid expansion.\n  In Nevada, Governor Brian Sandoval is considered by many to be a star \nin the Republican Party. But notwithstanding his party's anti-ObamaCare\n\n[[Page S8326]]\n\nideology, he displayed courage by expanding health coverage for tens of \nthousands of Nevadans.\n  I hope my friend and fellow Senator from Nevada will follow our \nGovernor's example and stand for our constituents' health care. Too few \nRepublicans will. If ObamaCare is so awful, why are Republicans from \nKentucky, Wyoming, North Dakota, and New Hampshire so eager to use it? \nIt is simple: The Affordable Care Act expands coverage and cuts costs. \nIt is good for the States. That is why Arizona expanded Medicaid. It is \ninsuring hundreds of thousands of Arizonans, as we talk now.\n  I was disappointed with my friend. We served together, we came to the \nHouse together, we came to the Senate together, and he is the senior \nSenator from Arizona. He made it clear that he will vote for repeal, in \nspite of all the people benefiting from ObamaCare back home. This is \nwhat John McCain said: ``Obviously the Governor and Legislature in my \nstate decided that they wanted that program and so it is going to \ntrouble me in the vote.'' The senior Senator from Arizona acknowledged \nthat he is casting a vote in direct opposition to the needs of the \npeople of Arizona.\n  So if Republicans aren't listening to their constituents or State \nleaders, to whom are they listening? As always, the answer is \ncorporations. Billion-dollar companies have no trouble getting \ncongressional Republicans to do their bidding. Even as they try to \nsnatch health coverage from 17 million Americans, Republicans are \nthrowing money at corporations. That is what they plan to do with the \nmoney saved by repealing the Affordable Care Act. They will hand it \nover to corporations in the form of tax breaks.\n  I have news for my own Republican friends: These multibillion-dollar \ncompanies don't need your help. They are doing just fine on their own. \nThe American middle class needs help, but this Republican Congress is \ndoing nothing to aid working families. Why are we here if we are not \nhere to help people back home?\n  When Republican Presidential candidate John Kasich--somebody whom I \ncame to the House with in 1982--was asked earlier this year why he \nchose to expand Medicaid in the State of Ohio, he gave this remarkable \nanswer:\n\n       When you die and get to the meeting with St. Peter, he's \n     probably not going to ask you much about what you did about \n     keeping government small. But he is going to ask you what you \n     did for the poor. You better have a good answer.\n\n  That is from John Kasich. He is right. This is an opportunity to help \nunfortunate Americans who lack quality health insurance. I only wish \nGovernor Kasich could convince the junior Senator from Ohio of that \nsimple truth.\n  I say to my Republican friends: Do the right thing; stop this \nnonsense about repeal of ObamaCare. Everyone knows this repeal of the \nAffordable Care Act is going nowhere. Instead of wasting everyone's \ntime and instead of ignoring the wishes of the people back home, let's \nwork together to improve health care coverage. There are a lot of \nthings we can do by working together to improve health care coverage \nfor Americans. Let's move beyond repeal and start making the Affordable \nCare Act work even better for the American people.\n  Would the Chair announce the business of the Senate today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/senate-section/article/S8326-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds).

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Criminal Justice Reform\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this morning I will be joining--at the \nPresident's invitation--a bipartisan group of Congressmen and Senators \nto discuss the need for criminal justice reform in the country. I am \nactually very glad the President has shown such an interest in this \ntopic, one we have been working on in the Congress for a number of \nyears.\n  I have said it before and I will say it again, I don't agree with the \nPresident on a lot of things, perhaps most things, but I am glad to \nknow he is making this issue a priority. I think it is one of those \nrare, magical moments where you see things coming together on a \nbipartisan basis across the political spectrum, where we can actually \nmake some real progress that will benefit the American people and make \nour criminal justice system fairer and more effective.\n  Of course, in the Senate, a diverse bipartisan group has shared this \nconcern for a very long time. While I appreciate the President's vocal \nsupport and for convening the group to discuss it this morning, I want \nto make it clear that this legislation has been years in the making. \nActually, the impetus for the part I contributed to the bill emanated \nfrom a 2007 experiment in Texas in prison reform. That legislation has \nmanifested itself in the Senate and is now called the Sentencing Reform \nand Corrections Act of 2015. It is a result of a lot of hard work and \nsome compromise, which is the only way things actually get done around \nhere in order to build a bipartisan consensus, and it brings targeted \nand much needed reforms to the Federal justice system.\n  I am very glad to be able to join with the junior Senator from Rhode \nIsland, somebody, again, who is probably at the opposite end of the \npolitical spectrum from me in terms of ideology, but we have found \ncommon ground on this important prison reform component.\n  Most prisoners will eventually be released into society, which is \nsomething we have forgotten. Unfortunately, our prisons have too often \nbecome warehouses for human beings, and we have forgotten the reality \nthat many of them will be released back into society. Yet we have done \nvery little to help prepare them to successfully reenter society rather \nthan get into that turnstile that sometimes characterizes our criminal \njustice system and many end up right back in prison again. We can't \nsave everybody, but I believe we can offer an opportunity for some who \nwant to save themselves to improve themselves and be better prepared to \nreenter society as productive individuals.\n  As I said, this reform was based on an experiment in Texas starting \nback in 2007. People perhaps think of Texas as being tough on crime, \nand indeed we are, but we finally realized we also have to be smart on \ncrime. Prisons cost money. Every time somebody reoffends and ends up \nback in the prison system, we have to pay the salaries of prosecutors, \npublic defenders, judges, and others, and that is expensive. If we can \nfind a way to be fiscally more responsible and actually be more \neffective when it comes to the results, we ought\n\n[[Page S8327]]\n\nto grab that opportunity. I happen to think it represents the way we \nought to legislate here in Washington, DC, that is based on successful \nexperiments in the States.\n  It is no coincidence that Louis Brandeis once called the States the \nlaboratories of democracy, but it represents the opposite of what we \nhave seen here in Washington, DC, when, for example, in ObamaCare the \nPresident decides we are going to take over one-sixth of the U.S. \neconomy and we are going to mandate from Washington a one-size-fits-all \napproach for 320 million or so Americans. It just doesn't work, as we \nhave documented time and time again on the floor.\n  I am optimistic we have found an area where we can work with the \nPresident and move this legislation forward. I ask that the President \nroll up his sleeves and work with us, along with the Democrats and both \nHouses of Congress, so we can make this criminal justice reform a \nreality.\n  Mr. President, I mentioned ObamaCare. That is my second topic for \ntoday.\n  This afternoon we will keep a promise we made to the American people \nthat we will vote to repeal ObamaCare. ObamaCare--were this legislation \nsigned into law--could not sustain this mortal wound that is going to \nbe inflicted this afternoon. Are we doing this for partisan reasons? I \nwould say, no, absolutely not. What we are doing is listening to our \nconstituents who told us that they have had one bad experience after \nanother with ObamaCare. They have been forced by the Federal Government \nto buy coverage that they don't want, don't need, and can't afford. So \nwe proposed to send a bill to the President that would repeal ObamaCare \nand then replace it with affordable coverage that people actually want. \nWe made it clear to the American people that if they gave us the \nprivilege of leading in the Congress, we would keep this promise, and \nwe will fulfill that promise in the Senate today.\n  I remember voting at 7 a.m. on Christmas Eve in 2009, when 60 \nDemocrats voted to jam ObamaCare down the throats of the American \npeople. They made promise after promise. The President himself said: If \nyou like what you have, you can keep it. That proved not to be true. \nThe President said a family of four would see an average reduction in \ntheir premium cost by $2,500, and that wasn't true.\n  So as somebody who has spent a little bit of time in law enforcement \nas a former attorney general in my State, I would call this a deceptive \ntrade practice. This is defrauding the American people, selling them a \nproduct based on a set of promises that ends up not being true.\n  I believe it is time to repeal this bad law and to replace it with \nsomething that people want and that they can afford.\n  My State has been hit hard, as all States have been, including the \nState of the Presiding Officer, by the effects of ObamaCare. Almost \nevery day we read news accounts of escalating health care costs, \nincluding premiums and fewer choices and options and less access for \nour constituents.\n  Just recently, the Houston Chronicle reported that next year the \nHouston-area patients won't have access to any plans on the ObamaCare \nexchange that cover costs at MD Anderson, the premier cancer-treating \nfacility in America. If we can't buy insurance to cover catastrophic \nevents like cancer at the hospital of our choice, what good is it?\n  As a matter of fact, I remember our former colleague, Senator Tom \nCoburn from Oklahoma, who has used up most of his nine lives, but he \nhas experienced cancer at least three times, to my recollection, and he \nactually was seeking treatment at MD Anderson. He said that as a result \nof ObamaCare, he could no longer get coverage from the insurance policy \nhe had because MD Anderson wasn't an acceptable provider under the \nObamaCare policy.\n  So today I will provide a very quick snapshot of the thousands of \nletters I have received, and I am sure they are typical of the letters \nwe have all received from our constituents about the problems they have \nencountered with ObamaCare.\n  One of my constituents recently wrote to me to tell me her story, and \nit is similar to the narrative I have heard from many others. Her \ninsurance plan was canceled last fall because it didn't meet the \nmandates of ObamaCare. As a result, she had to switch to a more \nexpensive policy, one with a higher monthly payment and an $11,000 \ndeductible. What good is it to have an insurance policy with an $11,000 \ndeductible? How many Americans can self-insure and pay that bill so \nthat they can take advantage of what limited coverage they actually \nhave under such a policy?\n  She went on to say that she was notified that her plan would once \nagain be terminated for the next year, and her monthly costs would go \nup again as a result. To top it off, she would end up losing her \nprimary care provider. In other words, the doctor she preferred would \nno longer be available to her under this new policy that she would be \nforced to buy at a higher price.\n  She is like a lot of folks around the country--full of questions and \nfrustrations and seemingly nowhere to turn to find any relief for her \nspouse, for her children, or for their small business.\n  This particular constituent implored me and Congress to do something \nabout it. She said: ``Senator Cornyn, this has caused turmoil \nthroughout Texas . . . we are terrorized in our own country by the so-\ncalled benefit of the Affordable Care Act.'' Those are her words, not \nmine. She said her family was terrorized by ObamaCare.\n  The strong message she conveyed is not all that different from what I \nhave heard from other people. Another constituent raised a similar \nissue. He is now, for the third time in as many years, searching for \nyet another health insurance plan after his was canceled. He went on to \nhighlight another theme that is impossible to miss when I talk to folks \nback home about this topic. He said:\n\n       I seem to remember the President saying something about \n     liking your insurance and being able to keep it? For myself \n     and my family it's been just the opposite. We loved our \n     insurance prior to the passage of the act and have since been \n     forced to purchase much more expensive insurance with much \n     higher deductibles.\n\n  Well, he is right. And in just a few hours we are going to have a \nchance to vote on the Johnson amendment to this legislation we are \nconsidering, which is an ``If you like it, you can keep it'' amendment, \nto keep that guarantee. We will see how our friends on the other side \nof the aisle vote, who forced this flawed legislation down the throats \nof the American people, based on this experience.\n  Just like many other Texans, the people I have talked about back home \nhave seen their premiums and their deductibles skyrocket to \nunaffordable levels. Along with this anemic economy and flat wages, \npeople have found themselves with less and less money in their pockets \nand found themselves with a decreased and diminished standard of \nliving, which has caused a lot of frustration.\n  This particular constituent ended his letter to me by asking the \nMembers of Congress to ``do anything within your power to reverse this \nterrible healthcare trend. . . . I need relief,'' he said.\n  We have reached a pretty scary time in our Nation's history when we \nhave Americans writing and calling their elected representatives saying \nthey need relief from their own government. The threat is not outside; \npeople are being threatened by their own government and the overreach \nthey see and the negative impact it has on their quality of life and \ntheir standard of living.\n  So we have a duty now--we have a mandate, I believe--to repeal this \nterrible law and to make it a relic of the past, and we are going to do \nour duty. We are going to keep our promise to the American people \ntoday.\n  There was an outcry from my constituents back home on another topic \nthat gripped our attention--the horrific videos released showing \nPlanned Parenthood executives callously discussing the harvesting of \norgans from unborn children. We seem to have forgotten those terrible \nvideos and what they have depicted.\n  This bill will also do something to defund Planned Parenthood and \nredirect those funds to the many community health centers that exist in \nTexas and across the country that day in and day out diligently provide \nhealth care to people in my State and around the country. There will be \nno less money directed toward public health care; it\n\n[[Page S8328]]\n\nwill be redirected away from Planned Parenthood and to the community \nhealth centers.\n  By the way, there are a whole lot more community health centers, so \nthere will actually be improved access for most Americans at community \nhealth centers.\n  By repealing ObamaCare, we are doing more than just delivering on a \npromise; we are providing a way forward for millions of Americans \naround this country who have been hurt--not helped but hurt--by \nObamaCare. We will do our best to help them find some relief, as one of \nmy constituents whom I just quoted implored.\n  We look forward to passing this legislation to scrap ObamaCare and to \nbring this country one step closer to making it history.\n  Again, this isn't just about repealing ObamaCare; this is about \nreplacing it with coverage that people want and that suits their \npersonal needs at a price they can afford. One would have thought that \nhealth care reform would be about making health care more affordable, \nbut, in fact, ObamaCare was just the opposite. It made it more \nexpensive and less affordable, as we have seen and as I have tried to \npoint out in my remarks.\n  I don't see any other Senator seeking recognition, so I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Tragedy in San Bernardino\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, when I woke up this morning, I had hoped \nthat yesterday's tragedy in San Bernardino was just an unimaginable \nnightmare. Then, as I usually do in the morning, I went through the \nclips from my State and I read the headlines:\n  ``Bloodbath in San Bernardino.''\n  ``14 slain at California office party.''\n  ``Carnage in California.''\n  ``Shooting Rampage Sows Terror in California.''\n  ``At Least 14 Dead in Mass Shooting.''\n  ``Deadly rampage at holiday party.''\n  ``A Day of Horror.''\n  ``Horror Hits Home.''\n  `` `Horrific'.'' Just one word.\n  ``Masked Mass Murder.''\n  These are papers all over my State and a couple of national \nheadlines.\n  My heart is broken after this rampage that led to the tragic loss of \nlife, so many injuries, so much trauma and pain for the people of San \nBernardino.\n  I thank the medical personnel who are working as we speak to save \nlives and all the brave, courageous law enforcement officers who rushed \nto the scene and later stopped these killers.\n  We know the victims in this attack were county employees at the San \nBernardino Department of Public Health. I began my career as a county \nsupervisor, and I oversaw in Marin County the Department of Public \nHealth. I know how dedicated those county employees are. They are right \nthere. They are right there in the communities. And the facility was \ndedicated to helping disabled people. So for this to happen at a \nholiday party where these employees were gathering in friendship--it is \na stunning shock.\n  While details about the motive behind this despicable attack are \nstill unknown, here is what we do know: Because these killers used \nmilitary-style weapons, 14 people died and 17 people were wounded in a \nmatter of minutes.\n  The purpose of these guns, these military-style guns, is to kill a \nlot of people very fast. The scene looked like a war zone, and there is \na reason for that--again, because these weapons are designed for the \nmilitary. They are designed for the police.\n  I have to be honest with my colleagues: I have never heard one \npersuasive argument about why anyone else would need to have this type \nof weapon. These weapons of war just don't belong on our streets and in \nour communities. My colleague Senator Feinstein for years has been \npushing sensible legislation that would keep these military-style \nweapons off our streets. We need to stand with her. We need to stand \nwith her across party lines and pass it.\n  It is so discouraging that we can't even pass legislation here that \nwould keep suspected terrorists who are on the no-fly list from legally \nbuying a weapon--any kind of a weapon.\n  It isn't enough for us to keep lamenting these tragedies; we need to \ntake action now, before something else like this happens again in the \nPresiding Officer's State, in my State. When we take an oath of office, \nwe swear that we will protect and defend the American people. I just \ndon't think we are protecting them when we allow these types of weapons \nto get into the wrong hands.\n  This year we are averaging more than one mass shooting every single \nday--multiple people killed by guns, innocent people, every day. This \nis America. This doesn't happen in other industrialized nations. \nThirty-one people die every day from gun violence. After 10 years of \nthe Vietnam war, we lost nearly 60,000 Americans, and people were in \ndespair. We lose more than that in gun violence in less than 2 years in \nthis great Nation. If there were anything else that caused the death of \n30,000 Americans a year, every single Senator would be in their chair \nand we would be demanding action and we would be crossing over party \nlines to stop it because that, my friends, is an epidemic.\n\n  People deserve to feel safe in their communities. I don't understand \nit. They deserve to feel safe when they go to a holiday party at work. \nThey deserve to be safe sitting in these galleries. They deserve to be \nsafe going to a movie theater. They deserve to be safe in their school \nwhen they are 6 years old or 16 or 26. They deserve to be safe in their \nworkplace, at a shopping mall, at a restaurant, and at a health care \nclinic.\n  This is our job, to keep our people safe. We know the threats that \nface us abroad, and we have threats at home. So we need to do both. We \nneed to protect our people abroad from threats abroad and from threats \nat home. The very best way to honor the victims of gun violence is to \ntake sensible steps that are supported by the American people, such as \nuniversal background checks, safety features on guns, keeping assault \nweapons in the hands of our military and our police, and keeping guns \nout of the hands of people who are unbalanced, unstable, criminals. \nThen we can prevent these tragedies.\n  Will we prevent every tragedy? No. I know my friends will say: Well, \nsomeone can have a knife. Yes. It is a lot easier to get away from a \nknife than an automatic weapon that mows you down before you can even \nlook up and figure out what is happening.\n  I am crying out today for support for sensible gun laws, and \nregardless of motive--regardless of motive--we need to make sure that \nmilitary weapons belong in the hands of the military and the police. It \nis pretty straightforward. Our people are not safe. I don't care what \nState you look at, I don't care what city you look at, I don't care \nwhat county you look at.\n  San Bernardino is a beautiful place. I don't live far from there. I \nhave an office about 15 minutes or less from there. People deserve to \nfeel safe in our communities. So I send my love, my prayers, my \nsolidarity to the community, to the families, to the first responders, \nand to everyone there. Yes, we are going to pull together, as all these \ncommunities do, but we need to prevent these things from happening \nbecause if we don't, we are liable.\n  I believe we are liable. We know what is killing people every day. It \nis gun violence, and we know it. I am not a lawyer, but I have a lot of \nfamily members who are lawyers--my son is, my father was, my husband \nis--and I think once you know something is happening and you can do \nsomething about it and you don't do something about it, you are \nliable--maybe not in a legal sense, but in a moral sense.\n  So I hope we can come together around this. Every time the press \ncomes in and asks me, tragedy after tragedy after tragedy: Will \nsomething happen now? After Sandy Hook, I said: Absolutely. We are \ngoing to come together. We did not. We did not.\n  I want to close with this. In California we have tough gun laws. I \ndon't know how these weapons got where they were. We will find out. \nPeople say: Well, we have these gun laws. Look at this; we have had a \n56 percent reduction of gun violence since 1993 in my great State \nbecause we have taken action. But this is one Nation under God.\n\n[[Page S8329]]\n\nIf somebody comes from a nearby State, from the North, from the East, \nand they have a gun--that is why it is so important for us to work \ntogether to have sensible national laws and universal background \nchecks. Almost 90 percent of the people support it. The majority of NRA \nmembers support it. What is wrong with us that we can't do that? What \nare we afraid of?\n  These military assault-style weapons kill so fast--and so many \npeople. We should make sure they are in the hands of the military and \nthe police.\n  My heart is heavy and will remain so. This is supposed to be a great \nday for a lot of us who worked so long and hard on the highway bill. \nThis was a moment we were waiting for, and that is what life's about. \nYou know, there are these moments that you savor, and there are moments \nthat you wish to God you never had to talk about or experience. That is \nthe kind of day it is for this particular Senator, and I know Senator \nFeinstein feels the same way.\n  I thank you very much, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an amendment I \nfiled to the reconciliation bill, amendment No. 2887, to strengthen \nPell grants.\n  This amendment provides middle-class families with the kind of stable \nfunding source that they can rely on when it comes to paying for \ncollege. Pell grants have historically been the key investment in \nhelping low-income students pay for college. Most of my colleagues \nwould agree that a good education is one of the surest paths to the \nmiddle class.\n  In 1980, the maximum Federal Pell grant covered about 77 percent of \nin-state, 4-year college tuition. Now Pell grants account for only one-\nthird of those costs. Rising college costs prevent many low-income \nstudents, no matter how hard they work, from being able to go to \ncollege and thus from reaching the middle class.\n  If the Senate can accomplish one thing that invests in our Nation's \nfuture, it should be to enact policies that help to stabilize and \nexpand the middle class. We all know there is a growing income \ndisparity in our country that is whittling down our middle class and \nmaking it harder and harder for people to get ahead in the first place. \nKey to the path forward for many is college affordability. Pell grants \nare a critical part of college affordability.\n  Almost half of all college students in the United States receive Pell \ngrants to help fund their education, including 23,000 students in my \nhome State of Hawaii. Unfortunately, Pell grants--the largest Federal \nstudent aid program--which are primarily funded by discretionary, not \nmandatory, funding appropriations, do not provide the kind of stable \nfunding source that families can rely upon. Each year Congress in its \ndiscretion determines how much funding goes to Pell grants. This should \nchange. Federal financial aid should be a resource that students and \ntheir families can count on, that they can plan around.\n  To that end, the amendment I filed would do two things. First, it \nwould convert the Pell Grant Program from the discretionary side of the \nbudget to the mandatory side of the budget for 5 years. That way, \neligible families won't have to worry each year about congressional \nappropriations, at least for 5 years, and they can plan their financing \nfor an entire 4-year degree. Second, my amendment would index Pell \ngrants annually for inflation. That means that as college costs rise, \nso, too, will they allow Federal aid to low-income students.\n  Students and their families should have confidence that if they \ncommit to earning an education, Federal support will be there for their \nhard work. My amendment would give them that stability.\n  This amendment is paid for by closing tax loopholes for corporate \nexecutives and hedge fund managers and by instituting the Buffett rule, \nto ensure that Americans who earn over $1 million per year pay their \nfair share of taxes--tax fairness from those who earn more in a year \nthan many college graduates may earn in their lifetimes.\n  To give a hand-up to the next generation of strivers is more than \nreasonable to me. Access to educational opportunity is not a handout. \nGraduates will still have to work hard to get good jobs, start \nbusinesses, and succeed, and when they succeed, our country succeeds.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to stabilize and \nstrengthen the middle class and to invest in our next generation of \nleaders.\n  The amendment to the underlying bill would improve it, but the \nunderlying bill is deeply flawed. The underlying bill before us would \ntake away health care access for millions of women, seniors, and low-\nincome working people by gutting the Affordable Care Act, defunding \nPlanned Parenthood, and undermining investment and prevention and \nresearch. The resultant harm to our people is a poison pill that we \ncannot impose on American families. This Republican bill, which does \nlittle for the middle class and working people, will be vetoed by the \nPresident. The Republicans know this, and yet they are bound and \ndetermined to pass this harmful legislation as soon and as fast as \npossible.\n  I ask my colleagues to stop, pause, and get our country back on track \nby supporting and strengthening the middle class, by giving a hand-up \nto the people who represent our country's future, and by not yanking \nthe rug out from under the millions of Americans who rely on health \ncare.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, a few months ago I asked my Republican \ncolleagues if they had fallen down, hit their heads, and thought they \nwoke up in the 1950s. Today I am back to check on my Republican \ncolleagues because it appears they are suffering from a serious case of \nmemory loss.\n  Before I call the doctors at Mass General, I have to say this really \nisn't a joke. I truly, honestly cannot come up with a better reason why \nmy Republican colleagues have forced us back to the Senate floor once \nagain to talk about another reckless scheme to defund Planned \nParenthood. What is with you guys?\n  Remember this summer? Republicans launched a deliberate, orchestrated \nplan to defund women's health care centers. Let me just clarify. This \nwas not a plan to defund abortions because for nearly 40 years the \nFederal Government has prohibited Federal funding for abortion. Nope. \nThe plan was to defund Planned Parenthood health care centers that \nnearly 2.7 million people use every year, health care centers that one \nin five women across America has used for cancer screenings, pregnancy \nand STD tests, birth control, and other basic medical care.\n  To a lot of women and to a lot of men, the effort to defund Planned \nParenthood health care centers was an overt attack on women's access to \nneeded and legal health care. When the Republicans forced the Senate to \nvote on a bill to defund Planned Parenthood, it failed--and rightly so. \nThat should have been the end of it, but Republican extremists just \nwon't quit. In fact, they are doubling down.\n  Today Senate Republicans will use a special maneuver to hold another \nvote to defund Planned Parenthood, this time needing only 50 votes to \npass instead of the usual 60. Even if they pass this reconciliation \nbill, President Obama has said he will veto it, but some Republican \nextremists vow to press on, using the most extreme tactics possible, \ntaking the government hostage. They want to attach a rider to the \ngovernment funding bill and threaten to shut down the government 10 \ndays from now unless the Democrats agree to defund Planned Parenthood. \nDoes that sound familiar? Well, that is because it is the very same \ntactic used in 2013 when Republicans shut down the government over the \nAffordable Care Act and flushed $24 billion down the drain--the very \nsame tactic that former Speaker John Boehner admitted was a \n``predictable disaster.''\n  Republicans may like playing politics with Planned Parenthood, but \nthis isn't a game for the millions of women who depend on Planned \nParenthood for basic medical care every year and who have nowhere else \nto go. Threatening to shut down the government is certainly not a game. \nIt is not a game for cancer patients who could be turned away from \nclinical trials at NIH. It is not a game for small businesses that \ndepend on our national parks being open for tourist visits. It is not a \ngame for seniors who need their Medicare paperwork processed or for the \nveterans\n\n[[Page S8330]]\n\nwhose benefits could be at risk, and it is not a game for the hundreds \nof thousands of Federal employees across this country--from park \nrangers to scientists to cafeteria workers and janitors at government \nbuildings--who could be sent home 2 weeks before Christmas with no \npaycheck coming in.\n\n  This radical assault on women's health care and reproductive rights \nhas gone on long enough. So in case my Republican colleagues are \nsuffering from short-term memory loss, let me spell this out again loud \nand clear. We will not allow you to turn back the clock on women's \nhealth and women's rights. If you try to sneak provisions into the \ngovernment funding bill to defund Planned Parenthood, we will fight you \nevery step of the way, and we will win. That is not a threat; that is a \npromise.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I rise this morning in opposition to \nthe reconciliation bill that we are considering today. There are a \nnumber of reasons I have concerns, but one of the most important has to \ndo with its repeal of the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act, \nwhile it is not perfect, is working. More Americans than ever before \nhave access to health care.\n  In New Hampshire, almost 45,000 people have received health insurance \nthrough the exchange. Most of those people did not have health care \ncoverage before the Affordable Care Act, and the majority of these \npeople are getting insurance premium support to make it more \naffordable.\n  In New Hampshire, another 44,000 people are getting coverage through \nMedicaid expansion. The Governor and the State legislature worked long \nand hard to come to a bipartisan agreement--a Democratic Governor and a \nRepublican legislature--on how to expand Medicaid in a way that works \nfor New Hampshire. The reconciliation bill that we are considering \ntoday would turn back the clock on all of that work. It would repeal \nMedicaid expansion, and it would eliminate coverage for so many of the \npeople who need it the most.\n  In short, this bill would wreak havoc on the lives of families and \nindividuals, people such as Deborah from Conway, NH. She and her \nhusband own a small business. They work hard, and they live within \ntheir means. But for 17 years, they have been without health insurance, \nand they have had to forego health care services because of costs.\n  As a result of Medicaid expansion, Deborah was recently able to go to \nthe doctor for her first physical in 18 years. Imagine that; it was her \nfirst physical in 18 years. During that exam, she discovered that she \nhas high blood pressure and that she is at risk for cancer. Thanks to \nthe Affordable Care Act, she is able to take the preventive measures. \nShe expects to live a long, healthy life and is probably going to save \nmoney because she has received this preventive care. We cannot turn our \nbacks on people such as Deborah and her family.\n  Finally, the reconciliation bill would defund Planned Parenthood, \nwhich would deny access to 12,000 women in New Hampshire access to \nhealth care providers they trust and to services they need. For many of \nthose women, Planned Parenthood is the easiest, most affordable, and \nbest way for them, and--in many cases--the only way for them to get the \ncare they need. I proudly stand with the millions of women who rely on \nPlanned Parenthood, and I will continue to oppose any attempt to defund \nsuch an important component of our health care system.\n  While I remain gravely concerned about the underlying bill, I am \npleased to join Senators Wyden and Murray today in offering an \namendment to address an issue that is vitally important to New \nHampshire, to northern New England, and to much of the country, and \nthat is this epidemic of heroin and opioid abuse.\n  In New Hampshire and across this country, drug abuse has reached \nepidemic proportions. Each day 120 Americans die of drug overdoses. \nThat is two deaths every hour.\n  In New Hampshire we are losing a person a day due to drug overdoses. \nDrug overdose deaths have exceeded car crashes as the No. 1 cause of \nfatalities in the United States. We just had a report come out that \nshows that for the first time in years, the lifespan of White Americans \nis going down. It is going down for one reason that was cited, and that \nis because of drug overdoses. Mental health illness and drug abuse is a \nnational public health emergency, and it is time for us to act.\n  What the amendment we are offering will do is to take important steps \nto provide critical resources for the prevention, intervention, and \ntreatment of mental illness and substance abuse disorders. The \namendment will ensure that any health insurance plan purchased on the \nexchange is held to mental health parity and addiction equity \nstandards, and it will make it easy for consumers to know what benefits \nare covered and the insurance plan's denial records.\n  Importantly, the amendment makes it easier for patients to receive \nmedication-assisted treatment drugs--drugs such as methadone, \nnaltrexone and naloxone, commonly known as Narcan, and it prohibits \nlifetime limits on those drugs.\n  Our amendment also strengthens Medicaid coverage of services to \nprevent and treat mental illness and substance abuse disorders. Again, \nnot only do we have this epidemic, but we don't have enough treatment \nbeds, we don't have enough treatment facilities, and we don't have \nenough providers to assist and support those people who are trying to \nget clean. For years, Medicaid has been prohibited from reimbursing \nmedically necessary care to patients in residential or treatment \nfacilities with more than 16 beds.\n  Historically, this has been a barrier for patients who need these \ntreatments for drug abuse and who have limited access to that \ntreatment. Our amendment would enable more people to receive these \nservices by allowing reimbursement for these facilities in States that \nhave expanded Medicaid, such as New Hampshire. The amendment will also \nprovide additional Medicaid Federal funding to help States provide \ncommunity treatment programs and health homes for those in need of \nhelp.\n  Finally, this amendment provides over $15 billion of needed funding \nto States and municipalities to help address the public health \nemergency in those States and communities that are the frontlines of \nthis crisis.\n  Through the substance abuse prevention and treatment block grants and \nthe community mental health service block grants, this service is \ntargeted to those most at risk for substance abuse and mental illness, \ngiving the States flexibility to develop and fund programs that work \nbest for them. This prevention, intervention, and treatment of \nsubstance abuse and mental health disorders have the potential to make \nthe difference in millions of lives.\n  The amendment is fully paid for by closing tax loopholes. With the \ntools provided in this amendment, we can change the lives of those \nstruggling with mental illness and substance abuse disorders, and we \ncan turn the tide of this national public health epidemic.\n  I thank you all, and I hope that as we consider this reconciliation \nbill, we will have the opportunity to vote on this amendment and that \nthere would be support to address the critical crisis we are facing \nbecause of heroin and opioid abuse.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I am going to take a few minutes to \ntalk about the reconciliation bill that we are discussing and debating \non the Senate floor this week, particularly the focus on repealing the \nAffordable Care Act, or what is called ObamaCare. There are many, many \naspects of the bill that we are debating--the individual mandate, the \nCadillac tax, the employer mandate. These will all be gone. \nEssentially, we will start the process of what I believe the vast \nmajority of Americans want, which is real, affordable health care, not \nwhat we currently have.\n  I was recently home in Anchorage, AK. A lot of us get a sense of what \nour\n\n[[Page S8331]]\n\nconstituents are feeling by going about doing our basic chores and \nrunning errands when we are back home. Two weeks ago, in the course of \n2 hours of getting gas, at a grocery store, and at Lowe's, I had three \ndifferent Alaskans come up to me and plead to do something about \nObamaCare, how it was wiping out their home income and their small \nbusiness--three in 2 hours.\n  Similarly, I was in Fairbanks a few days ago and heard from another \nsmall business owner. They made the same plea that many small business \nowners I have heard from in Alaska have talked about. They have had \nhealth insurance for their employees for years where they have taken \ncare of them. Yet the increases in the costs of these plans are such \nthat their companies will not be able to operate. They have this huge \ndilemma: to continue to cover their employees whom they care a lot \nabout--some of whom have been working for decades--or to dump them into \nthe marketplace, because that is the only way the company can survive.\n  That is the dilemma that this bill is putting people into. Hardly a \nday passes where I don't hear from constituents about the problems they \nare having. Let me give you a couple of examples.\n  A family in Eagle River, AK, will pay $1,200 a month in premiums with \na $10,000 deductible under the new Affordable Care Act. A couple in \nAnchorage will be paying $3,131 a month in premiums--almost $38,000 a \nyear.\n  Here is an excerpt from a constituent letter:\n\n       The renewal paperwork that I just received estimated our \n     new payment to be just over $1,000/month--doubling our \n     monthly expense. . . . What is a young family to do?\n\n  Here is another constituent: ``There is nothing `affordable' about \nthe Affordable Health Care Act.''\n  Another constituent said:\n\n       Insurance rates are killing my small business. . . . We \n     have tried to keep our employees and their families covered \n     but don't see how we can continue to [be in business].\n\n  Here is another constituent of mine: ``Please, please help us!!'' \nThey are begging for help.\n  Teachers, construction workers, small business owners, self-\nsufficient Alaskans--so many of them--are asking for help because of \nwhat this Federal Government did to them.\n  The numbers don't lie. In Alaska and throughout the country, workers \nand families are suffering. Small businesses are being squeezed. Job \ncreation is being stymied. Nearly every single promise made by the \nPresident of the United States and the supporters of this bill in the \nCongress has been broken.\n  Let me remind my colleagues what some of those promises were. Here is \none from the President: ``If you like your health care plan, you'll be \nable to keep your health care plan.''\n  Here is another one from the President: ``If you like your doctor, \nyou can keep your doctor.''\n  The law, he told the American people, ``means more choice, more \ncompetition, lower costs for millions of Americans.''\n  He told the American public that premiums would be reduced on average \nfor Americans for their health care plans by $2,500. But again, the \nnumbers we see don't lie. Costs are soaring all over our country. For \nexample, a bronze plan under ObamaCare, the least expensive insurance \navailable on the exchange, costs on average--this is a national \naverage--$420 a month, with an average deductible of $5,653 for an \nindividual and close to $11,600 for a family.\n  Remember former Speaker of the House and ObamaCare promoter Nancy \nPelosi with her line about how important it was to pass ObamaCare so we \ncould all figure out what was in it. She promised that ObamaCare would \ncreate ``4 million jobs--400,000 jobs almost immediately.'' That was \nthe former Speaker.\n  Let's see what the Congressional Budget Office says about that \npromise. Recently, the CBO projected that ObamaCare will result in 2 \nmillion fewer jobs in 2017 and 2.5 million fewer jobs in America by \n2024. Obviously, that promise didn't come true. Promise after promise \nwas unfulfilled. It is no wonder the American people have such a low \nopinion of the Federal Government and the Congress.\n  What is of the laudable goal of health insurance for the uninsured? \nIt is a very laudable goal, and there is no doubt about it--affordable \nhealth insurance for the uninsured. ObamaCare is barely moving the \nneedle. Today there are 35 million people who don't have health \ninsurance. According to the CBO, 10 years from now there is still going \nto be approximately 27 million people who don't have coverage under \nthis system.\n  Let me get a little more specific in terms of my State. Probably no \nother State in the country has been more negatively damaged by \nObamaCare than Alaska. Five insurance companies originally offered \ncoverage in our exchanges in Alaska, offering a glimmer of hope of what \nis really needed in the health care market, which is competition. Today \nonly two are left to provide individual insurance on the health care \nexchange. Both will be increasing premiums by approximately 40 percent \nthis year. In Anchorage, for the lowest level plan--a bronze plan--\npremiums are going to go up 46 percent.\n  There you go--major metropolitan areas in the United States. Look at \nthe far left. That is Anchorage, AK, and at 46 percent in 1 year, it \nwill make it one of the most expensive and the biggest increase in \nterms of metropolitan areas in the United States.\n  Let me give you another example. A 40-year-old nonsmoker--\nindividual--who doesn't receive subsidies will pay anywhere from $579 \nto $678 a month in premiums for a bronze plan with a deductible of \neither $5,250 for the more expensive premium or $6,850 for the less \nexpensive premium.\n  Remember, ObamaCare requires Alaskans and Americans to purchase these \nplans. Remember what it did for the first time in U.S. history. The \nCongress of the United States told the American people: You must buy a \nproduct; you have to or you will be penalized.\n  That brings me to the penalties. Because of the prohibitive costs, \nsome in Alaska and many across the country have chosen to go without \ncoverage and pay the yearly fine under ObamaCare. But that fine is also \nvery expensive. Alaskans and Americans are asking: What is the point? \nWhat is the point of having health insurance that has been forced on \nthem by their Federal Government and that they can't afford? Others are \nforegoing seeing their doctors altogether.\n  A recent Gallup poll found that in 2014 one in three Americans says \nthey have put off getting medical treatment they or their family \nmembers need because with these numbers it is too expensive. They are \nnot going to the doctor. Again, what is the point? You have health \ninsurance, but you can't go see your doctor because it is too \nexpensive. That number, by the way--one in three--is among the highest \nnumber in the Gallup poll's 14-year history of posing this question.\n  As the costs rise, the numbers will continue to rise. Not \nsurprisingly, given all of these numbers, given that number, a recent \npoll found that despite 6 years of being under ObamaCare, where our \ncitizens of the United States were supposed to finally be comfortable \nwith it, to understand it, to have it working, still 52 percent of \nAmericans have an unfavorable view of it--only 44 percent, favorable.\n  For Alaskans, this is only going to get worse. The so-called Cadillac \ntax--one of the numerous taxes embedded in ObamaCare--is going to kick \nin for 2018. It will be devastating for individual Alaskans, for union \nmembers, and for small businesses across Alaska. It has been estimated \nthat as many as 90 percent of Alaska businesses will be faced with the \nincreased Cadillac tax. That is a tax of an additional 40 percent on \nthese benefits. Many small businesses in Alaska will not be able to \nafford this. An employer with 20 employees, under the Cadillac tax will \npay an estimated $28,000 a year more in taxes--just for the Cadillac \ntax on a small business. That can be the difference between make or \nbreak for that business.\n  Who is going to get hurt by this? Small businesses, but more \nimportantly, their employees, their workers will. Those extra costs are \ngoing to trickle down to the workers, likely in the form of reduced \nbenefits and reduced wages and more problems with their health \ninsurance plan.\n  As I mentioned, it is not just small businesses. Hard-working \nAlaskans covered under union plans will also very likely be hit by the \nCadillac tax, requiring them to pay much more, and\n\n[[Page S8332]]\n\nso will State and local government employer plans.\n  For all of these reasons, one of my campaign promises was to vote to \nrepeal ObamaCare. I certainly plan to do it today when we take up this \nreconciliation measure. I certainly hope it is going to pass.\n  When this legislation gets to the President's desk, what will happen \nthen? Well, he is likely going to veto it again. I hope he looks at \nthese numbers and recognizes what a mistake this bill was and agrees \nwith us to work together to replace it, but he is likely going to veto \nit, and in doing so will likely mislead Americans again by claiming \nthat ObamaCare is working. It is not working.\n  Let me give you another example of how it is not working. \nUnitedHealth, one of the Nation's biggest insurance companies, recently \nannounced that because of its huge losses, it may pull out of ObamaCare \naltogether. If United pulls out, then others are likely to follow.\n  Premera Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alaska, one of the only health \ninsurers left in Alaska offering coverage on the exchange, said that it \ncan't continue to sustain losses under the exchange.\n  As bad laws often do, ObamaCare contains the seed of its own \ndestruction. But for the sake of millions of Americans and thousands of \nAlaskans who have been sold a false bill of goods, we can't simply wait \nto see it self-destruct. This was not the health care that was promised \nto Americans, and we can't let it get worse. We need to act, and that \nis why I am joining with my colleagues today to repeal this law. We \nneed to look at replacing it with one that includes provisions that are \nmissing, such as tort reform. We need a system that encourages \npurchasing insurance across State lines, encourages patient-centered \ncare, and allows the kind of doctor-patient relationship that has been \nthe hallmark of American care for many years.\n  Contrary to what some on the other side of the aisle have claimed, \nthere have been many alternatives proposed to ObamaCare. The plan in \nthe Senate has been introduced by Senators Hatch and Burr and \nCongressman Fred Upton on the House side. Their legislation includes \nmany of these important reforms. It will allow people to actually get \ninvolved in their own health care and not watch this train wreck in \nterms of health care becoming unaffordable for Americans throughout all \nof the different States.\n  When selling the law to the public, President Obama talked about the \nfierce urgency of now. That is exactly what I am hearing from my \nconstituents when they write: Please, please help us. What is a young \nfamily to do? The fierce urgency of now is now.\n  Finally, I wish to comment on a number of my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle who have been lamenting that this reconciliation vote \nwe are going to take today is going to be along party lines. They have \nbeen lamenting that this might be some kind of partisan vote.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, this is a bit rich and a bit ironic. \nIt is very important to remember that 6 years ago, almost to the day, \nthis legislation passed in the Senate and the House by a party-line \nvote--a partisan vote--so to hear their concerns now rings a little \nhollow. That was not a wise move back then.\n  One important lesson of U.S. history is that most, if not all, major \npieces of legislation in the Congress on important social issues have \nbeen passed with bipartisan majorities, which helps to make legislation \nsustainable. That happens when the American people back that kind of \nlegislation.\n  The American people have never backed this legislation, but democracy \nhas an interesting way of working--not always quickly, but eventually. \nThis law is not popular. It was never supported by the American people, \nand they are noticing. As a matter of fact, of the 60 U.S. Senators who \nvoted for this law 6 years ago, 30 are no longer in this Chamber. That \nis democracy working.\n  We are going to take that vote again today. I am hoping some of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle will join us in repealing a \nlaw that doesn't work and is dramatically harming Americans so we can \nmove on to a health care plan that helps us, helps families, and \nprevents constituents from writing to their Members of the Senate and \nbegging for help, which is what is going on right now because of this \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise to speak about some of the matters \nwe are working on today with regard to votes that will take place later \non.\n  We now are in a period in our economic history where we have had a \nsignificant recovery, but we still have a ways to go and still have \nfamilies across the country who are living with some economic \nuncertainty. We can take steps today and certainly over the next couple \nof days and, we hope, in 2016 to ease some of that uncertainty or to \ncreate more economic certainty for our families, especially middle-\nclass families.\n  One of the most important steps we can take to address some of the \nchallenges our families face is to boost middle-class incomes. The most \nsignificant challenge we have as a nation right now, I believe over the \nlong term, is what will happen to incomes--especially what will happen \nto middle-class incomes--over time.\n  I have an amendment today that will address part of the solution or \npart of the strategy to raising incomes. One of those ideas is an \nexpansion of the child and dependent care tax credit, which is a tax \ncredit that helps families afford childcare, and so I will speak about \nthat for a couple of minutes today. The other issue we are going to \ndeal with is the so-called dual-earner tax credit, which helps families \nwho have young children where both parents work outside the home.\n  I don't think it is a news bulletin to anyone here or across the \ncountry that the cost of childcare has skyrocketed, especially in \nrecent years. A recent study by the Pew Foundation found that average \nweekly childcare expenses rose 70 percent between 1985 and 2013. So the \ncost every week that a family is paying for childcare is up basically \n70 percent in 30 years or 25 to 30 years.\n  That is one of the many costs that have gone up in the lives of \nmiddle-class families. Their childcare costs have gone way up, the cost \nof higher education has gone way up in that time period, the cost of \nhealth care, the cost of energy, and the cost of food. It seems as \nthough for a middle-class family, every cost or every number we would \nhope would be going down or leveling off is going up. As a result, \nchildcare is increasingly becoming literally unaffordable for middle-\nclass families.\n  That is a reality in a context where we know that the cost is going \nup at a time when all the evidence shows that quality childcare can \nhave a substantially positive impact on a child's life. One of the \nreasons quality childcare matters so much to a child is because they \nhave opportunities to learn. One thing I have said over and over again \nis that if our children learn more now--meaning when they are in those \nearly years--when they are in childcare settings, they are going to \nearn more later. That direct linkage, which all the evidence shows--all \nthe data shows, all the studies show--the linkage between learning and \nearning is substantial. One of the best ways to make sure kids learn \nmore now and earn more later when they are in the workforce is to make \nsure they have quality childcare.\n  To give one example, in Pennsylvania the average cost for full-time \ndaycare for an infant is $10,640. For a 4-year-old, it is $8,072. Those \nnumbers sound almost like approaching college tuition maybe at some \npublic universities. Double-figure, thousand-dollar numbers for \nchildcare is almost hard to comprehend--$10,640 for an infant and \n$8,072 for a 4-year-old. So what does that mean for, for example, \nmarried couples in Pennsylvania? It means that about 12 percent of \ntheir annual income is dedicated to childcare. How\n\n[[Page S8333]]\n\nabout for a single-parent family? For a single mother, those numbers \ntranslate into 44 percent of her income. Forty-four percent of that \nsingle mom's income is going to childcare. And she has to have it \nbecause she has to work. This isn't something extra, something nice to \ndo; she has to have that childcare. She has to be able to pay for it. \nAnd in a State such as Pennsylvania, which I think is fairly typical of \nthe country when it comes to these costs, if that single mother is \nhaving to pay 44 percent of her income on childcare, that makes it very \nhard for her to makes ends meet, if not impossible.\n  That is why the Tax Code has long recognized the need to provide \nfamilies with tax relief to offset childcare expenses through the child \nand dependent care tax credit. However, the way this tax credit is \ncurrently structured, it means that few families can benefit from it.\n  Here is what we should do. We should make the full credit available \nto most working families. More than 85 percent of taxpayers in \nPennsylvania, for example, with children would receive the full benefit \nif our amendment passes. We should increase the maximum amount of the \ncredit for children under 5 from $1,500 to $3,000, thereby reducing the \ncost of childcare by 35 percent. That would be one of the positive \nbenefits of passing the amendment. Third, we should ensure that lower \nincome families are better able to benefit from the credit by making it \nfully refundable. We have not done that. We should do that. That is \nwhat families would benefit from. Finally, we should retain the value \nover time by indexing the benefits in income thresholds to inflation.\n  That is what we do on the child and dependent care tax credit--a \nsubstantially positive advancement for families trying to pay for \nchildcare as the cost of everything in their life is going up, for \nmiddle-class families especially.\n  Second, we have the so-called dual-earner tax credit. We want to \nexpand those tax credits for working parents with young children. The \namendment includes a provision which would provide up to a $700 tax \ncredit on secondary earners' income for parents with children who are \nunder the age of 12.\n  We know that as our workforce changes, we must develop policy that \nensures that our Tax Code rewards work and expands opportunity for \nworking middle-class families. That should be the goal of everyone \nhere. I think on a lot of days it is, but sometimes the Senate doesn't \nfocus on those priorities. Make the Tax Code reward work and expand \nopportunity. If we enact these policies we will guarantee that these \nmiddle-class families see their incomes go up and we can do it in a \nfiscally responsible way that pays for these tax cuts by closing the \nmost egregious tax loopholes.\n\n  The amendment will say that companies can no longer evade U.S. taxes \nthrough so-called corporate inversions, which is when a large company \nbuys another company overseas and then claims their headquarters are \nabroad. The inversion strategy that some companies have employed has \nbeen an abuse of the Tax Code and frankly an insult to working \nAmericans.\n  We also ask, as a way to pay for these changes, that the very wealthy \nwho have received lots of relief over the last decade--the kind of tax \nrelief we have not seen in my judgment in human history, not just U.S. \nhistory--those folks at the very top have gotten a very good deal for \nthe last couple of decades, especially the last decade or so, and this \nSenator thinks a lot of those folks would like to help their country \nand would like to help us pay for these commonsense tax relief \nprovisions for middle-class families, especially as it relates to \npaying for the costs of childcare.\n  How do we do that? We can enact as part of one of the pay-fors the \nso-called Buffett rule, named after Warren Buffett--a pretty wealthy \nguy--but he has supported a measure that would ensure that a secretary \nor teacher doesn't have a higher tax rate than someone making millions \nof dollars a year or literally billions a year.\n  Finally, we would ensure that those who run very large corporations \naren't able to use loopholes to avoid paying taxes. So these basic, \ncommonsense steps would make sure our Tax Code works for the middle \nclass and not just those at the very top. In particular, the way the \nSenate can focus on middle-class incomes is to put in place policies \nthat help families pay for some of the biggest expenses they face, such \nas childcare.\n  Finally, Madam President, I will move to the issue of Medicaid. I \nknow my colleague Senator Brown is on the floor and has worked so hard \non this issue over many years. I want to talk about a matter we are \nworking on together, and I appreciate his leadership on Medicaid.\n  The effort we are undertaking would bolster the work we have done \nover the last 5 years to expand access to Medicaid. When Medicaid was \nexpanded on the Affordable Care Act, the so-called Federal medical \nassistance percentage, FMAP, basically is when the Federal Government \ncontributes to help States cover the cost of Medicaid. That was set at \n100 percent for 2016. Beginning in 2017 the Federal Government's \ncontribution would decrease until it gets to 90 percent in 2020. The \namendment that Senator Brown, I, and others will put forth will keep \nthe Federal contribution at 100 percent until 2020, instead of letting \nit drop to 90 percent at 2020.\n  Pennsylvania has expanded into the Medicaid Program. We are happy \nabout that, but in doing that what Pennsylvania did is they ensured \nthat all individuals with incomes up to 133 percent of poverty were \ncovered. Other States have not done this. This has created a so-called \ncoverage gap that is impacting over 3 million people around the \ncountry.\n  One of the reasons States point to in refusing to expand Medicaid is \nthey cannot afford to pay the costs they will incur, beginning in 2017, \nwhen the Federal share goes to 90 percent. The States at that point \nwill have to pay more, and some are using that or citing that as a \nreason they will not expand Medicaid. This amendment would remove that \nconcern that has been asserted by Governors and others around the \ncountry. States would be free to expand Medicaid without having to \nworry about how they pay the bill.\n  Wrapping up, let's remember what Medicaid means. Medicaid isn't some \nfar-off program that doesn't affect a lot of Americans. It directly \naffects tens of millions of Americans and tens of millions more \nindirectly. For example, Medicaid pays for almost half of all the \nbirths in the country. Half of all the babies born in the country are \npaid for by Medicaid. Every Senator in both parties should remember \nthat. So this isn't some program that you don't have to worry about, \nthat can be cut and slashed without consequence. Half of the babies \nborn in our country are paid for by Medicaid.\n  How about older citizens? Skilled nursing home payments--that is a \nshorthand way of saying nursing homes--60 percent of those payments are \ncovered by Medicaid, and 65 percent of almost 23 million publicly paid \nresident days of care in the State of Pennsylvania are paid for by \nMedicaid, compared to 13 percent by Medicare. So Medicaid has a huge \nimpact on long-term care for families across the country.\n  By the way, Medicaid is not just for low-income families. A lot of \nmiddle-income families benefit directly from the payments made by \nMedicaid for long-term care. So if you care about older citizens in \nyour own family getting nursing home placement, if you care about 45 \npercent of all the babies born in the country, you better care about \nMedicaid, and you better care about efforts, in a sensible way, to \nexpand Medicaid across the country, which would be better for all of \nus, especially the children, older citizens, and Americans who have \ndisabilities who are all affected by Medicaid.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I understood that the Senator from \nOhio was seeking consent to speak after me.\n  I would like to take a few minutes this morning to speak about how \nthe Affordable Care Act is harming the people of the State of Alaska. \nThis Senator has come to the floor a lot to talk about the fact that we \nin the State of Alaska have the highest insurance premiums. Well, \nagain, we have the highest insurance premiums in the country. Believe \nme, I am hearing from\n\n[[Page S8334]]\n\nfolks back home all the time about the burden that these costs place on \nthem.\n  Our State's largest newspaper has been reporting, as we have seen \nthese premium increases coming out over these past several months--they \nhave been detailing the incredible rise of premiums throughout the \nState. The average monthly premium for a single 40-year-old in the \nState of Alaska is now over $700 a month--$700 a month for the average \nsingle 40-year-old--more than double the national average. People are \npaying thousands of dollars each month to insure their families. The \ninsurance premium costs have gone up somewhere between 25 percent to 40 \npercent each year. How do you budget for that?\n  A family of three in Ketchikan--I got the information from them--are \ngoing to be paying almost $2,000 a month next year for one of the \ncheapest bronze plans available. This is a family of three paying for \none of the cheapest plans, and they are going to be paying $2,000 a \nmonth. This plan comes with a $10,500 deductible. Heck of a deal. In \nspite of paying almost $24,000 on insurance, nearly all the medical \nbills will still be paid out of pocket for this family. They will not \nsee any benefit until they have spent just about $35,000. Contrast the \n$2,000 per month for health insurance with their mortgage payment. \nTheir monthly mortgage payment is $1,250. Does this seem right to \nanyone? It should not cost more to provide health care coverage for \nyour family than to own your home.\n  We have a married couple in Wasilla who were paying $850 a month \nprior to the ACA, but that plan wasn't acceptable under the new \nregulations. The promise that you can keep the plan if you like it--\nwell, that didn't hold. They had to find other insurance. Next year \nthis married couple is going to be paying over $2,300 per month. That \nmeans they are going to be paying over $17,000 more per year for the \nsame coverage. This is a 268-percent increase in just one calendar \nyear. This is not right. This is unconscionable. It is not that this \nmarried couple has somehow increased their income by an additional \n$17,000 last year. No, this is just the cost to cover their insurance.\n  A self-employed man down in Homer whose insurance covers him, his \nwife, and his son has seen his costs increase from $325 per month 2 \nyears ago to $1,325 a month since the ACA was passed. That is an \nadditional $1,000 per month that these folks are now paying for the \ncheapest bronze plan available with a $12,000 deductible. This is not \nsome Cadillac plan. This is the cheapest plan available. This is a \n$12,000 deductible. This is what these folks at home are paying.\n  The ACA repeal bill that we are currently debating addresses the \nproblem by reducing the penalty for not buying insurance to zero. \nAlaskans could choose to buy insurance or simply save the thousands of \ndollars they would be paying each month that could be spent on medical \nbills as needed but would be available for the families to use as they \nsee fit.\n  On top of the outrageous costs that we are seeing that come with the \nindividual mandate, the Cadillac tax that I just mentioned hits \nAlaskans harder than anywhere else in the country. Premera is the \nlargest insurer in our State and they tell me that about 62 percent of \ntheir customers in Alaska will be forced to pay these tax penalties \nunder the Cadillac tax in 2018, the first year of the tax. The average \ncost will be $420. That would be the tax on the plan that they would be \npaying that first year. It is not as if these plans are grand. The \nproblem is with the high cost of health care within our State. The tax \npenalizes Alaskans because our health care is more expensive in a rural \nState with a low population.\n  This tax is going to hit the State, the boroughs, and our school \ndistricts. It will take away money from public education and other \nservices that the State provides. I am hearing from school districts. \nInstead of saying they are concerned about testing or some of the other \nissues we are dealing with in education, they are saying their No. 1 \nconcern is the implementation of the Cadillac tax. It is the single \ngreatest threat to quality public education. That is how Robert Boyle, \nthe superintendent of the Ketchikan Gateway Borough School District \ndescribes the ACA, as the single greatest threat to quality public \neducation. Bob's district faces a tax penalty of over $500,000 due to \nthe Cadillac tax coming up in 2018, the first year of the tax, and the \npenalties only increase from there. The Ketchikan Gateway Borough \nSchool District is looking at a half-million-dollar tax coming due in \n2018. They are not getting more money to run their school district. \nThis is money out the door that isn't improving the education of a \nsingle child in that district.\n  We are facing a financial crisis in the State. The State cut the \neducation budget this year, and they are looking hard at cutting it \nagain next year. We are a State that relies on oil revenues, and you \nsee what is going on with the price of oil. That is an impact to us. We \nare feeling it--desperately feeling it. School districts cannot afford \nthe imposition of hundreds of thousands of dollars of new taxes on top \nof a budget reduction. The money, as you and I know, would be far \nbetter spent paying teachers what they deserve. School districts are \nnow looking to possibly reduce benefits for teachers in order to avoid \npaying the new tax. With low pay and no benefits, how are our schools \ngoing to get ahead? How can we expect to attract and retain quality \nteachers? The answer is pretty real--we just can't do it. Without \nquality teachers who suffers? It is going to be the kids.\n  The bill we are debating solves the problem for 6 years by delaying \nthe Cadillac tax for 6 years until 2024. That gives us time to find a \nway to address it permanently and in a responsible way. This Senator \nadvocates eliminating the Cadillac tax altogether.\n  The problems with the ACA don't end with hundreds of thousands of \ndollars in new taxes on schools or charging individuals outrageous \npremiums. It also impacts our small businesses. I heard from so many \nbusiness owners around the State who want to expand but are saying they \njust can't do it. They can't do it. They cannot afford to both expand \ntheir business and then hit the 50-employee threshold at which they are \nrequired to provide the insurance. So, at best, these businesses are \nkind of treading water right now. The ACA requires every business owned \nby an individual to be grouped together when counting employees.\n\n  I have heard from a fellow in my State from Fairbanks. He owns \nseveral businesses there. It is a mix of businesses. One is a plumbing \ndistribution company, but he also has a whole handful of little coffee \nshops. There is quite a difference between plumbing distribution and \ncoffee shops.\n  For tax purposes, Mr. Vivlamore's businesses are all treated as \nseparate entities, and for legal purposes, they are all treated as \nseparate entities. That makes sense. But for some reason, for purposes \nof health insurance, they are all lumped into one bucket. He has his \nemployees from the coffee shop, and he has employees from the plumbing \ndistribution business, so he is going to be required to provide health \ninsurance when the mandate kicks in because he employs more than 50 \npeople across all of his companies together, even though he doesn't \nhave 50 employees in every one of his very different businesses. He has \ntalked to me about what he is going to do about the prospect of \npossibly downsizing because the cost of doing business under the ACA \nfor him is just too high.\n  This issue is also resolved in the bill by reducing to zero the \npenalty for noncompliance with the employer mandate. Employers will \nonce again be free to offer workers more hours, hire more staff, or \nexpand operations without facing a large tax penalty for not offering \ninsurance or an equally significant cost increase when they are forced \nto provide insurance.\n  I have been on the floor before, and I have asked the question \nbefore, but it is worth repeating: For whom is the Affordable Care Act \nactually affordable? It is certainly not affordable for the average, \nhard-working Alaskan who is being forced to shell out thousands of \ndollars for their premiums each month. It is not affordable for the \nschool districts and other State entities that will pay huge taxes. It \nisn't affordable for the kids whose educations will potentially suffer.\n  This law is not affordable for us in Alaska. That is why I support \nthe bill that repeals the ACA and wipes out these harmful impacts. We \ncannot stand by and see these premiums shoot through the roof 30 \npercent or more each year, see our businesses artificially constrained, \nand see the quality\n\n[[Page S8335]]\n\nof public education decline. It just doesn't work.\n  I appreciate the time this morning and look forward to the \nopportunity this afternoon to weigh in on some of these very \nsignificant issues that have great and considerable impact on the \npeople of Alaska.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I thank Senator Murkowski for the consent \nrequest.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 12 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n             Omnibus Appropriations Bill and Policy Riders\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, many in Washington and on Wall Street \nseem to have collective amnesia. They seem to have forgotten, amazingly \nenough, about the destructive, devastating impact of the financial \ncrisis even though it took place well less than a decade ago.\n  For millions of Americans, that crisis is unforgettable; millions \nhaven't recovered. My wife and I live in the city of Cleveland in ZIP \nCode 44105. That ZIP Code in the first half of 2007 had more \nforeclosures than any ZIP Code in the United States of America. That \nwas in large part because of Wall Street greed and a number of \ncompanies that engaged in predatory lending.\n  In September of 2008, Lehman Brothers collapsed--the largest \nbankruptcy in U.S. history--following a decade of unfair lending, Wall \nStreet recklessness, lax supervision, and co-optation in too many cases \nby regulators and Members of Congress.\n  I recently interviewed former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke \non C-SPAN about his new book. The book title he was originally writing \nwhen he joined the Federal Reserve over a decade ago was going to be \ncalled ``The Age of Delusion: How Politicians and Central Bankers \nCreated the Great Depression.'' This was about the Great Depression. I \nasked him what he would call a similar book or what a historian 20 \nyears from now might call a similar book about the great recession, \nfrom which we have emerged over the last decade. He said it would be \ncalled ``Asleep at the Switch'' or ``Too Complacent.''\n  That complacency took a devastating toll on American families. That \nwas the complacency of Congress, of the Bush administration, of \nregulators, of far too many people at OCC and the Fed who were \ncaptured, if you will--cognitive capture, regulatory capture, too close \nto the banking industry, too close to Wall Street, believing too much \nin the myths that were woven by Alan Greenspan and that crowd more than \na decade ago.\n  The meltdown triggered a crisis that left America's economy \nhemorrhaging more than 750,000 jobs a month. Think back to January of \n2009, when President Obama took the oath of office. We lost 750,000 \njobs that month when Bush left office and Obama took office. The \nhemorrhaging, of course, didn't stop immediately, although over the \nlast 5\\1/2\\ years, almost 6 years, we have seen job growth every single \nmonth.\n  By the time we hit bottom, we had lost 9 million jobs, the \nunemployment rate soared to 10 percent, and 5 million Americans lost \ntheir homes. The crisis--the worst since the Great Depression--took a \nshattering financial and psychological toll on a generation of \nAmericans. Thirteen trillion dollars in household wealth was wiped \nout--again because of complacency and co-optation of the Federal \nReserve under Alan Greenspan, of this U.S. Congress, and of the Bush \nadministration.\n  Congress responded by passing Dodd-Frank. We put in place new rules \nto bring stability to markets, to ensure strong consumer investor \nprotections, and to crack down on the reckless and irresponsible \nbehavior of Wall Street. Again, to repeat: Since 2010, we have seen 68 \nmonths, 69 months, and 70 consecutive months of job growth--I believe \nthe longest in modern economic history.\n  One of Wall Street reform's most important achievements was the \ncreation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It has an \naccountable director to serve as a counterbalance to the Wall Street \nlobby, and it has an independent funding stream. It was created to \nensure that never again would consumers be an afterthought in our \nNation's financial system.\n  Because of Wall Street reform, banks are required to fund themselves \nusing more of their shareholders' money and to hold more cash or assets \nthat can be sold easily--we call that liquidity--when they run into \ntrouble, to undergo strength tests, and to strengthen risk management. \nThat is why this banking system is more stable and safer than it was \nduring the Bush years.\n\n  The law also created the Financial Stability Oversight Council to \nfill gaps in the regulatory framework and establish a forum for \nagencies to identify risks to preempt, precipitate, and preempt the \nidentifiable risks that could contribute to the next financial crisis.\n  An overwhelming majority of Americans support regulation of Wall \nStreet. They know that Wall Street did serious damage to our country. \nBut in May the Senate banking committee reported out a sweeping \nfinancial deregulation package along party lines. I tried to negotiate \nwith Senator Shelby during the spring. They broke down once it became \nclear that the effort wasn't about negotiating; it was really about \nrolling back the most important parts of Wall Street reform.\n  Senate Republicans are now working to move this controversial bill--\nthis repeal, this rollback, this slicing of Wall Street, of Dodd-\nFrank--to roll back these reforms through the appropriations process. \nThis move, unprecedented in its scale, shows the Republicans will try \nto ram their agenda through Congress any way possible.\n  Last year, Republicans slipped a repeal of section 716 of Wall Street \nreform into the end-of-year funding bill. They have tried the same \nstealth strategy to undermine Wall Street reform, only this time it \ngoes far beyond one provision. Under the guise of so-called regulatory \nrelief for community banks and credit unions, Republicans are trying to \nundermine consumer protections, sensible regulations for larger bank \nholding oversight companies, and the Financial Stability Oversight \nCouncil. These are a lot of words, perhaps, but what we know is they \nagain want to do Wall Street's bidding--not on the floor of the Senate. \nWe are not debating these issues on the floor; they want to do back-\nroom deals to take care of their Wall Street friends. That is what all \nof this is about. That is why we introduced our alternative proposal \nlast year.\n  Now the good news is this: Republicans and Democrats agreed with our \napproach in the House of moving noncontroversial bipartisan provisions. \nI wish to give a couple of examples.\n  Under the Surface Transportation Conference Report, which we will be \nvoting on later today, we included changes in the bank exam cycle for \nsmall banks--a major help for community banks. It was sponsored by \nSenator Toomey and Senator Donnelly, a Republican and a Democrat. It \nstreamlines privacy notices. It is something I had worked on last \nsession as a sponsor. This session Senator Moran and Senator Heitkamp \nintroduced it. It allows privately insured credit unions to become \nmembers of the Federal Home Loan Bank system, something I have worked \non for some time. We have put these in the Transportation bill. We have \ndone what we should do for community banks--not everything we should \ndo, but we have done much of the agenda for the community banks and the \nsmall credit unions.\n  Our goal is to do this right, to debate these issues on the floor, \nand to help those institutions under $10 billion. They didn't cause the \nfinancial crisis; we know that--nor did banks the size of Huntington, \n$55 billion; of Fifth Third Bank, $130 billion. KeyCorp was $90 billion \nand is about to do an acquisition that will make them a little larger.\n  As the ranking member of Senate banking, I have heard time and again \nthe calls for legislation to undermine the new financial rules. Let's \nhelp these community banks, but let's not do the bidding of Wall \nStreet. In this bill, we are helping those community banks be more \nefficient, be able to cut some of their administrative costs, and still \nprotect consumers.\n  What people want to do in the back room on the omnibus bill is jam \nall kinds of issues through the Senate that, frankly, are weakening \nDodd-Frank. It will challenge and undermine the financial stability of \nour system.\n\n[[Page S8336]]\n\n  It is pretty clear to me that far too many Members of this body have \nforgotten the lessons and forgotten what happened in 2007 to our \ncountry and to people in our great country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                              Gun Control\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, the tragic murders that occurred in \nCalifornia yesterday are unthinkable and by all standards horrific. My \nthoughts and prayers today go out to all of the victims, their \nfamilies, and the entire community. Today I would also like to take a \nmoment to thank the brave first responders there who selflessly and \nhonorably risked their own lives in order to protect the lives of \nothers.\n  Following the tragic events of yesterday, President Obama \nunsurprisingly called to limit the Second Amendment rights of the \nAmerican people through stricter gun control. I believe this is yet \nanother example of the President using tragic events to push his \npolitical agenda.\n  Infringing on the rights of law-abiding citizens to keep and bear \narms is not the answer to curbing violent crime in America. Restrictive \ngun control measures only prevent law-abiding citizens from protecting \nthemselves because criminal criminals, by definition, refuse to follow \nthe law.\n  In addition to President Obama's misguided calls for gun control, he \nrecently issued an Executive order to remove unarmed military surplus \nvehicles that were obtained through the section 1033 program from local \nlaw enforcement. These vehicles have been valuable to local law \nenforcement officials in my home State of Alabama, specifically in \nCalhoun County. They were also used by the local law enforcement people \nseeking to protect those in harm's way yesterday in California.\n  I have called on the President to reverse the dangerous decision he \nmade in which he abuses the authority of his office, I believe, by \nmaking unilateral decisions through executive fiat. During this time of \nincreased uncertainty at home and abroad, I believe the American people \nare looking to us for certainty that we will do everything in our power \nto keep them safe.\n  Unfortunately, I believe President Obama has once again chosen to \nattack and weaken law enforcement and law-abiding citizens instead of \nfocusing on fighting against criminals and radical Islamic terrorists.\n  Let me be clear here today. The President's calls to increase gun \ncontrol and remove equipment from law enforcement used to keep us safe \nonly undermines the safety and security of the American people. We \nsimply cannot and must not continue to let this administration infringe \nupon our constitutional rights and put law-abiding Americans in harm's \nway. I hope we will continue to fight for our constitutional rights \nhere.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                              Nominations\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, shortly I will be asking consent to \nadvance certain nominations of the President for confirmation by the \nSenate. I do that in my capacity as the ranking Democrat on the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee. There are seven that I will bring up \ntoday, but there are many more waiting for action. Seven represents \nsome of these nominees. There are others waiting for action.\n  What these seven all have in common--all seven--is that they are well \nqualified for the position, they have gone through the process in the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee--the committee of jurisdiction--they \nhave had hearings, there have been questions asked, the vetting has \nbeen done, and they have cleared the committee by unanimous vote. There \nis no reason to withhold their confirmation when looking at their \nqualifications for the positions they have been nominated for.\n  In some cases, these nominees have been waiting as long as 6 months \nfor confirmation on the floor of the Senate. In each of these \ninstances, we are talking about confirming individuals to positions \nthat have importance for our national security and that will be \ndirectly involved in protecting our country. Recent events only \nunderscore the importance to have confirmed executive nominees to \nhandle the challenges that are brought before our country.\n\n\n         Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar No. 375\n\n  Let me start by first mentioning Tom Shannon. Tom Shannon has been \nnominated to be Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs and is \nthe Department's fourth ranking official, responsible for the \nmanagement of six regional bureaus of the Department as well as the \nBureau of International Organization Affairs. This is a tremendously \nimportant leadership position on key national security issues.\n  Among the many issues with which the Under Secretary will contend, we \nhave the implementation of the Iran nuclear deal. This is the person \nwho is responsible within the State Department as its top management, \nand I think every Member of the Senate wants to see this implementation \ndone in a way that prevents Iran from becoming a nuclear weapons state. \nThis individual also will be monitoring the civil wars raging in Syria, \nLibya and Yemen, which we know have a major impact on the voids created \nthat allow ISIL to be able to gain footholds. The growing turmoil in \nVenezuela, the conflict in eastern Ukraine, and the need to ensure the \nfull implementation of the Minsk agreement, as it relates to Ukraine, \nare all on the plate of the person who holds this position.\n  Tom Shannon has been nominated and has gone through the process. He \nhas received the full support of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee. He is a seasoned diplomat. We are fortunate that Ambassador \nTom Shannon, a career member of our diplomatic corps who is held in \nuniversal respect and esteem by his colleagues, has been nominated to \nthis position. Few diplomats have served our Nation under both \nRepublican and Democratic administrations with as much integrity and \nability.\n  In his current role as Counselor of the Department, he provides the \nSecretary with his insight and advice on a wide range of issues. He has \npreviously served as Ambassador to Brazil, as Assistant Secretary of \nState, as Senior Director for Western Hemisphere Affairs at the \nNational Security Council, and in challenging posts in Venezuela and \nSouth Africa, among others. He has also served as Acting Secretary for \nPolitical Affairs. So he already has the experience and the job \ntraining in order to accomplish this.\n  So as I said, there has been no objection raised as far as his \nqualifications and the need to confirm this appointment.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider the following nomination: Calendar No. \n375; that the Senate proceed to vote without intervening action or \ndebate on the nomination; that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider \nbe considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, reserving the right to object, in the \nhours that have followed the tragic shooting in San Bernardino, when \nall our prayers are with the families of those who were murdered and \nthose who were injured, more and more of us are becoming concerned that \nthis reflects a manifestation of radical Islamic terrorism here in \nAmerica. The facts are still not entirely clear, but in the wake of the \nParis attack, it is appearing more and more likely that is what this \nwas.\n  In the wake of these horrific attacks by radical Islamic terrorists, \nit has become abundantly clear that President Obama's Iranian nuclear \ndeal----\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator's comments come off Republican time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I didn't hear.\n  Mr. CARDIN. This is your time, not our time.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Sure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the time consumed by the \nSenator from Texas will come off the Republican time.\n  Mr. CRUZ. In light of these terrorist attacks, President Obama's \nIranian nuclear deal looks worse and worse and worse.\n  The idea that the United States of America would be sending over $100 \nbillion to the Ayatollah Khamenei--the\n\n[[Page S8337]]\n\nleading financier of terrorism in the world--is profoundly foolhardy. \nAt the time that deal was being negotiated, I sent a letter to \nSecretary Kerry informing Secretary Kerry that under no circumstances \nshould the Obama administration attempt to go to the United Nations and \ncircumvent Congress with this foolhardy and catastrophic deal. In that \nletter to Secretary Kerry I said explicitly: Under no circumstances \nshould the executive branch take such action before the congressional \nreview process is complete. Thus, I ask that you provide written \nassurances that you will take all necessary steps to block any U.N. \nSecurity Council resolution approving the JCPOA until the statutory \ntime line for congressional review has run its course. Until you \nprovide such assurances, I intend to block all nominees for the \nDepartment of State and hold any legislation that reauthorizes funds \nfor the Department of State.\n  This was fair warning, given ahead of time, that the State Department \nshould not try to circumvent the Congress, should not try to undermine \nU.S. sovereignty, and should not go to the United Nations to try to \napprove a deal--particularly a deal that profoundly endangers the \nnational security of this country. The Obama administration ignored my \nwarnings and went to the United Nations anyway.\n  I would note that under the terms of the Congressional Review Act, \nthe congressional review period has not yet run. The Congressional \nReview Act says that time does not begin to run until the President \nsubmits the entire deal to Congress. That statute defines the entire \ndeal to include any and all side agreements. We know of at least two \nside agreements governing inspections that have not yet been given to \nthis body. So, accordingly, the congressional review period has not yet \nbegun, much less ceased.\n  When I told Secretary Kerry that if the State Department circumvented \nCongress and went to the United Nations, I would block State Department \nnominees, that was not an empty threat. Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I certainly understand the right of the \nSenator to object. I would just hope that this could be resolved. It is \nnot about the State Department being put at a disadvantage by not \nhaving these confirmed positions; it is the American people. These are \nsecurity positions for which we have to have representatives, and not \nonly of the State Department. As I go through these nominations, we \nwill be talking about the Legal Adviser at the Department of State, and \nwe will be talking about ambassadors.\n\n\n         Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar No. 204\n\n  Next, Madam President, let me mention Brian Egan to be State \nDepartment Legal Adviser. The Legal Adviser is the principal adviser to \nthe Department of State on all legal matters, domestic and \ninternational, arising in the context of the work of the Secretary of \nState and the Department as a whole. The Legal Adviser also advises the \nPresident and the National Security Council, as well as other Federal \nagencies, on all legal matters involving the conduct of foreign \nrelations.\n  I think we are all familiar with the challenges we have that are \nraised every day in the Senate--issues raised about whether this is \nlegally acceptable or not. We really should have a confirmed Legal \nAdviser to the State Department in order to respond to the concerns not \nonly of the Congress but of the American people and our international \npartners.\n  Like Ambassador Shannon, Mr. Eagan has also served in both Republican \nand Democratic administrations. He entered public service in 2005 as a \ncivil servant in the Office of Legal Adviser of the State Department, \nwhich was headed at the time by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. He \nhas worked in the private sector. He has served as Assistant General \nCounsel for Enforcement and Intelligence at the Treasury Department. He \nhas served on the National Security Council staff.\n  His is a nonpartisan, fairminded individual who clearly has the \nskills and ability to advise our policymakers well and lead the Office \nof Legal Adviser.\n  He has been waiting since June for floor action. This is not a matter \nthat just recently came to the floor of the Senate. He has been waiting \nsince June. It has now been 6 months.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider the following nomination: Calendar No. \n204; that the Senate proceed to vote without intervening action or \ndebate on the nomination; that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider \nbe considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, reserving the right to object, the single \ngreatest national security threat facing the United States today is the \nthreat of a nuclear Iran. The President's catastrophic Iran deal only \nincreases the likelihood the Ayatollah Khamenei will possess nuclear \nweapons.\n  There are some in this body who suggest we should trust Iran. Well, I \ndo trust Iran. When the Ayatollah Khamenei, with a cheering crowd, \nburns Israeli flags and American flags and promises ``Death to \nAmerica,'' I trust the Ayatollah means what he is saying. Therefore, we \nshould not be giving him over $100 billion and facilitating his getting \nnuclear weapons. Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n     Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar Nos. 332 and 333\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I next would like to address the \nnomination of David Robinson to the position of Assistant Secretary of \nState for Conflict and Stabilization Operations.\n  The Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations has an important \nrole to play in helping the Department of State to address the \nmultiplying violent conflicts around the world and the rise of violent \nextremist groups. I don't have to tell this body how many challenges we \nhave globally in conflicts dealing with extremists. This is the key \nperson to deal with this issue. Ambassador Robinson clearly has the \nbackground and skills to excel in the position for which he has been \nnominated. He is a career diplomat. This is a career diplomat. This is \na person who at an early age went into service for our country--at \ngreat risk, as we know. With over 30 years of experience, he currently \nserves as the Principal Deputy High Representative in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, where he oversees the implementation of the peace \nagreement that ended the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He has served \nboth Democratic and Republican administrations far and wide under \ndangerous and demanding circumstances. He was the Assistant Chief of \nMission at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan. Ambassador Robinson \nhas served as the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Populations, \nRefugees, and Migration, and as U.S. Ambassador to Guyana from 2006 to \n2008, and as Deputy Chief of Mission in Guyana and Paraguay.\n  This is a highly qualified individual, a career diplomat who has \nshown his commitment and dedication to serving our country. The \nposition he has been nominated for is a critically important position \nat this time in our history.\n  Therefore, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations: \nCalendar Nos. 332 and 333; that the Senate proceed to vote without \nintervening action or debate on the nominations; that if confirmed, the \nmotions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I have not \nplaced a hold on this nomination, because my hold has been limited to \npolitical nominees, not to career foreign service officers serving as \nambassadors. That being said, Mr. Grassley, the senior Senator from \nIowa, has filed a formal notice of intent to object to this nomination, \nand, therefore, on behalf of the senior Senator from Iowa, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n    Unanimous Consent Requests--Executive Calendar Nos. 148 and 263\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, Azita Raji has been nominated for \nAmbassador to Sweden and Samuel Heins\n\n[[Page S8338]]\n\nas Ambassador to Norway. Having representatives on the ground in \nScandinavian countries is urgently needed. Both Sweden and Norway are \nkey strategic allies and members of the Arctic Council. Russia's recent \nmilitary activities in the Arctic and its disputed territorial claims \nin vast stretches of waters make the presence of a strong American \nvoice in Sweden and Norway essential.\n  Moreover, nearly 300 Swedish citizens have left to fight in Syria or \nIraq, making it the second largest country of origin per capita for \nforeign fighters in Europe. Put simply, we need representation in \nStockholm and Oslo to protect the U.S. strategic interests abroad.\n  I particularly want to note the close ties and deep friendship the \nUnited States and Norway have, symbolized by the 32-foot Christmas tree \nat Union Station that is annually gifted to the American people by \nNorway, their gratitude for U.S. assistance during and after World War \nII.\n  Norway is a founding member of NATO alliance and has been more than \ndiligent in attending to its obligations. It has contributed personnel \nto NATO's operations in Afghanistan, Libya, and the Balkans. Its former \nPrime Minister currently serves as the 13th Secretary General of NATO. \nJust this year, Norway assumed leadership responsibilities for NATO's \nair-policing mission over the Baltic States and is participating in a \nlarge-scale NATO anti-submarine exercise.\n  I am also pleased to note that these nominees for these critical \npositions have incredible backgrounds. Neither were controversial \nduring the consideration by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \nAzita Raji is an accomplished businesswoman with impressive \ninternational credentials. She was the vice president of J.P. Morgan \nSecurities in New York, Tokyo, and Japan. She speaks five languages and \nhas published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n  Samuel Heins is not only a highly respected lawyer in his home State \nof Minnesota, but with over 40 years of legal experience he is also a \ndistinguished human rights advocate. He founded Minnesota Advocates for \nHuman Rights. He was a private citizen member of the 2011 U.S. mission \nto the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva and has won human \nrights awards.\n  Samuel Heins has been waiting for 200 days. This is not a recent \nmatter. Azita Raji has been waiting almost a year for confirmation. \nThese are people who are ready to serve our country, critical allies.\n  Mr. President, therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination: \nCalendar No. 148; that the Senate proceed to vote without intervening \naction or debate on the nomination; that if confirmed, the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.\n  This is the Azita Raji nomination\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. When \nSecretary Kerry chose to ignore my request that the State Department \nnot submit this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal to the United \nNations, Secretary Kerry did so with open eyes. He did so knowing the \nconsequences because I had spelled them out explicitly; that the \npolitical nominees he would want to put forward at the Department of \nState would not proceed if Secretary Kerry chose to undermine the \nauthority of the Congress of the United States, to undermine the \nsovereignty of this country, and to instead treat the United Nations as \nthe relevant decisionmaking body. He did so nonetheless.\n  As a consequence, the Obama administration is proceeding forward \nunder this Iranian nuclear deal as if it is binding law. The Obama \nadministration is proceeding ultra vires. They are proceeding contrary \nto law under the explicit terms of the Congressional Review Act. The \nperiod of time for congressional review has not begun to commence \nbecause the Obama administration has not submitted the entire deal to \nthe U.S. Congress. They have not submitted the side deals. As a \nconsequence, under explicit U.S. law, it is contrary to the law for the \nObama administration to lift sanctions on Iran.\n  I wish to note to any bank at home or abroad that is in possession of \nIranian assets, any bank that chooses to release those assets to the \nAyatollah Khamenei or to other Iranian interests will be acting \ndirectly contrary to Federal statutory law. Even though President Obama \nand Secretary Kerry are choosing to disregard the law, that does not \nexonerate the private banks from potential civil liability in the \nbillions or even criminal liability. The stakes are too high. I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  As we wrestle with the ravages of radical Islamic terrorism, the idea \nthat the President of the United States is trying to send over $100 \nbillion to the Ayatollah Khameini--a theocratic zealot who promises \ndeath to America--makes no sense at all. It means that if and when \nthose billions of dollars are used to fund jihadists who murder \nAmericans, the blood of those murders will be on this administration's \nhands. If you give billions of dollars to jihadists who have pledged to \ncommit murder, you cannot wash your hands of responsibility for their \ndoing exactly what they have told you they would do. Accordingly, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Let me remind our colleagues we are talking about the \nAmbassador to Sweden.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider the following nomination: Calendar No. \n263; that the Senate proceed to vote without intervening action or \ndebate on the nomination; that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider \nbe considered made and laid upon the table.\n  This is the Samuel Heins nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n         Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar No. 127\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to address the nomination of \nCassandra Butts to the post to be Ambassador to the Bahamas. Cassandra \nButts is currently a senior advisor to the CEO of the Millennium \nChallenge Corporation in Washington, DC. She is a leading attorney and \nformer Deputy White House Counsel. She is known for her expertise in \nboth domestic and foreign policy, particularly in economic development \nand migration policy, due to her work on the board of the National \nImmigration Forum.\n  I am confident she will apply these essential skills to the task of \nfurthering the bilateral relationships between the Government of the \nBahamas, a key U.S. Caribbean partner.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination: \nCalendar No. 127; that the Senate proceed to vote without intervening \naction or debate on the nomination; that if confirmed, the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. Today the \nsingle greatest national security threat facing America is the threat \nof a nuclear Iran. President Obama's catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal \ndramatically increases the likelihood that the Ayatollah Khamenei will \npossess nuclear weapons and will use those nuclear weapons to commit \nhorrific acts of terror. Moreover, Secretary Kerry's decision to go to \nthe United Nations and circumvent the Congress of the United States, \ndisregard the authority of the people of the United States was \nunacceptable and was profoundly damaging to this country. Accordingly, \nI object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, the nominees I went through unanimous \nconsent requests--all are important to our national security. We are \ntalking about Ambassadors. We are talking about career people whom we \ndepend upon for advice, for handling conflict areas. It is in our \nnational security interests to get these nominees confirmed. They have \nbeen held up for as long as a year in some cases.\n\n[[Page S8339]]\n\n  I understand the right of individual Senators. I urge my colleagues, \nwe have a responsibility to act on these nominations. I urge my \ncolleagues to work with us. I applaud Senator Corker. He has moved \nthese nominations through the committee. For these reasons, I urge my \ncolleagues to work with us so we can get these individuals serving our \ncountry. They are public servants and they deserve our consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                               H.R. 1599\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I want to note that right at this moment \nthere are Senators of this esteemed body who are doing something that \nis not so esteemed. They are working to put into some of the must-pass \nlegislation that we will be considering today and in the days to come \nsomething known as the DARK Act. The DARK Act is the Deny Americans the \nRight to Know Act. It takes away the ability of States to make sure the \ncitizens of their State have the knowledge they would like to have \nabout the food they eat.\n  We have seen in the toxics discussion in the Senate how important it \nis to individual States to have the ability to identify for their \ncitizens what is in the everyday household products they have: their \nspoons, their plates, their bedding, and so forth--but it is much more \nimportant. It is an order of magnitude more important to citizens to \nhave the right at the State level to decide how to inform individuals \nabout what is in the food they eat.\n  This proposal to put the DARK Act--taking away the rights of the \nStates, taking away the rights of citizens to use their democracy to be \nable to know what is in the food they eat--is being proposed to be put \ninto a bill in the dark of night. The DARK Act should never go into \nlegislation in this Senate. It should never be considered airdropped \nin, in the dark of night, into must-pass legislation. It should be \ndebated openly in committee, thoroughly vetted, thoroughly considered, \nbecause that certainly is the type of consideration merited by an issue \nso fundamental to citizens as knowledge about the food they eat and the \nfood their children eat.\n  Let us not, as a Senate, commit such a disgraceful act as taking away \nthe State right and the individual desire to have knowledge about the \nfundamental food that we consume. Let us not have that airdropped in \nthe dark of night. That would be a huge mistake.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it has now been over 5 years since \nPresident Obama signed into law this so-called Affordable Care Act, a \nsweeping health care overhaul that had passed this Chamber without a \nsingle Republican vote. While legislation as important as this should \nhave been held to the highest standard and included broad bipartisan \nsupport, President Obama and then the 60-vote congressional Democrats \nrelied on fuzzy math and false promises to jam through this enormous, \nunwieldy health care measure that the American people overwhelmingly \noppose. Such unilateral action has become President Obama's signature \ndomestic policy legacy, but today all that bullying and brinkmanship \ncomes to a screeching halt.\n  The legislation we will vote on today takes a critical step forward \nin lifting the burden that ObamaCare has placed on hard-working \ncitizens across the country who have been saddled by rising premiums, \nincreased health care costs, and reduced access to doctors and \nhospitals. It continues our long fight to repeal this harmful law and \nbuild a bridge to health care solutions that work.\n  Since ObamaCare's enactment, Americans have been left wondering what \nhappened to all the promises: the promise to remove obstacles to \nobtaining coverage, the President's promise to reduce yearly premiums \nby up to $2,500 for a typical family, his promise to maintain existing \nproviders. Remember, if you like your doctor you can keep him, his \npromise to prevent any form of new tax increases, and a promise to \nincrease competition and provide greater choice.\n  Despite all of the President's assurances, ObamaCare has been full of \nempty promises that have made our Nation's health care problems worse. \nOne of the reasons I voted against ObamaCare was because despite being \nportrayed as affordable, there were numerous predictions that Americans \nacross the country would be faced with increased health care costs. \nGuess what. Such predictions have become reality. Just as recently as \nthis past summer, the President promised that under ObamaCare health \ninsurance premium increases would be ``modest.'' This is despite the \nfact that the State insurance regulators and actuaries were predicting \nthe exact opposite outcome.\n  Let's take a look at how modest these cost increases will be for my \nhome State of Arizona. Data released last month by the Department of \nHealth and Human Services shows that Americans enrolled in the Federal \nmarketplace will see an average premium increase of at least 7.5 \npercent with the second lowest so-called silver plans known as \nbenchmark plans.\n  In Arizona, 24 exchange plans will see double-digit rate hikes in \n2016. In Phoenix, premium increases are projected to top 19 percent. \nThe highest average premium increase in my home State is projected to \nreach a whopping 78 percent.\n  My constituents in Arizona call and write me daily, begging and \npleading that something be done to alleviate the financial hardship of \nObamaCare.\n  Thomas from Flagstaff wrote to me and said his monthly premiums \njumped from $200 to $600 a month. Jim, a resident of Arizona for over \n25 years, will soon pay an additional $160 per week. It goes on and on \nand on. Stories such as these are unacceptable.\n  While the President and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \ncontinue to describe ObamaCare as a success, families, patients, \ndoctors, and small businesses across America continue to suffer from \nthe disastrous effects of the President's failed health care law.\n  Today I am proud to once again stand with my Republican colleagues as \nwe continue the fight to repeal and replace ObamaCare. From the start, \nI opposed this sweeping scope of the health care law and proudly \nproposed the first Republican amendment to ObamaCare in 2009 which \nwould have prevented the President from slashing Medicare by half a \ntrillion dollars. Since then, I have continued my efforts by sponsoring \nnumerous other pieces of legislation that would lift the burden that \nhas been placed on individuals and small businesses alike.\n  Most recently, I introduced the Obamacare Opt-Out Act with Senator \nBarrasso in this Congress, which would give Americans the freedom to \nopt-out of the individual mandate for health insurance coverage \nrequired by ObamaCare. It is critical that we eliminate this costly \nmandate which is estimated to cost Americans who decide not to enroll \nin ObamaCare roughly $695 per adult and $347 per child in 2016 and even \nmore in the years ahead.\n  This legislation we will vote on today takes an even bigger step \nforward in freeing Americans from the harmful effects of this law. It \nprovides relief to individuals and employers alike by eliminating \ncostly penalties for those who fail to comply with ObamaCare's mandate. \nIt repeals draconian tax increases--such as the medical device tax and \nthe Cadillac tax--that have made health care more expensive and driven \ninnovative companies to move critical operations and research and \ndevelopment overseas. It ensures that Americans will not experience any \ndisruption in their health care coverage by delaying the implementation \ndate by 2 years. Most importantly, it gets the government out of the \nway and puts patients in charge of their health care decisions and \nneeds.\n  The fact is, we can repeal and replace ObamaCare with health care \npolicies that work. For years I have underscored commonsense policy \nalternatives, such as providing Americans with a direct, refundable tax \ncredit to help them pay for private health care, expanding the benefits \nof health savings accounts, passing medical liability reform, or ``tort \nreform,'' and extending the freedom to purchase health care across \nState lines. These are proposals that would provide immediate relief to \nAmericans and my fellow Arizonans who have been left to choose between \nbuying groceries or paying for health insurance under ObamaCare.\n\n[[Page S8340]]\n\n  Perhaps the greatest flaw in President Obama's health care law is \nthat it has severely limited consumers' access to quality care. Today, \nlimited access is now commonplace, costs are increasing, and government \nbureaucrats remain at the center of an individual's health care \ndecisions.\n  It is clear that any serious attempt to improve our health care \nsystem must begin with full repeal and replacement of ObamaCare--a \nmission I remain fully committed to fighting on behalf of the people of \nArizona.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this critically important bill \ntoday. It will build a bridge from the President's broken promises to a \nbetter health care system for hard-working families in Arizona and \nacross the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that during the vote \nseries related to H.R. 3762, there be 2 minutes equally divided between \neach vote and that the first votes in the series be in relation to the \nMurray amendment No. 2876 and the Johnson amendment No. 2875, with a \n60-vote affirmative threshold required for adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, we are on the verge of a series of \nvotes, and we are also just a few days away from the third anniversary \nof the hideous and horrific shootings at Sandy Hook.\n  Once again, the unspeakable has happened in America. The mass murders \nin San Bernardino reminds us of the inaction by this body. Congress has \nbecome complicit by its inaction in this mass slaughter which continues \nin America. Yet, listening to the debate on the floor, one would think \nit is business as usual.\n  We are debating whether to repeal the Affordable Care Act again. How \nmany times have we voted on that issue? How many times have we voted to \ndefund Planned Parenthood? Yet what we see on the floor of the Senate \nand throughout Congress is a shrug of the shoulders. It can't be done \nor won't be done.\n  Now is the time for action. We are past the point of platitudes and \nprayers. We need them. San Bernardino deserves them. But prayers, \nthoughts, and hearts need to be matched by action. The time for action \nis now. We need to pass sensible, commonsense measures that will make \nAmerica safer and better.\n  There is no single solution or panacea to stop gun violence, but \ninaction is not an option. A shrug of the shoulders is not acceptable. \nThat is not what we were elected to do. We were elected to act and \nprovide solutions. Strong laws, such as what we have in Connecticut, \nare a good start, but State laws will not prevent guns from crossing \nborders from States without strong laws. The States with the strongest \nlaws are at the mercy of States with the weakest protection because \nborders are porous.\n  The question in America today is, What will it take--30,000 deaths a \nyear, a mass shooting every day? A mass shooting is four or more \nindividuals shot. What will it take for this body to act?\n  We are not going away. We are not giving up. We are not abandoning \nthis fight. We are on the right side of history, and we will prevail. \nToday will be an opportunity to show which side we are on.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these sensible, commonsense \namendments which will at least take a step--by no means a complete or \neven a fully adequate step--in the right direction.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, this week we have been debating the future \nof ObamaCare, which still remains unworkable, unaffordable, and more \nunpopular than ever. For millions of Americans, the law today \nrepresents nothing more than broken promises, higher costs, and fewer \nchoices. Recent polling shows that most Americans still oppose this \nunprecedented expansion of government intrusion into health care \ndecisions for hard-working families and small businesses.\n  That is why Leader McConnell promised that we would send a bill to \nthe President's desk repealing ObamaCare using budget reconciliation, \nand that is exactly what we are doing. There is a special provision \nunder the budget that allows us to send a bill to the desk with a \nmajority of votes in the House and a majority of votes in the Senate. \nThe majority of votes in the House has occurred, and now we are \ndebating changes to that bill.\n  The amendment's repeal of ObamaCare allowed under the rules of \nreconciliation--including its taxes, regulations and mandates--sets the \nstage for real health care reforms that strengthen the doctor-patient \nrelationship, expands choices, lowers health care cost, and improves \naccess to quality, affordable, innovative health care for each and \nevery American.\n  As I noted at the start of this debate, ObamaCare will crush American \nhouseholds with more than $1 trillion in new taxes over the next 10 \nyears. This means ObamaCare will cost taxpayers more than $116 billion \nevery year and result in smaller paychecks for families while holding \nback small businesses from expanding and hiring new workers. For \nhardworking taxpayers, ObamaCare has meant more government, more \nbureaucracy, and more rules and regulations, along with soaring health \ncare costs and less access to care.\n  By the time we are done, the Senate-passed ObamaCare repeal will \neliminate more than $1 trillion in tax increases placed on the American \npeople, while saving more than $500 billion in spending. Lifting the \nburdens and higher costs the President's law has placed on all \nAmericans will help the Nation move forward from ObamaCare's broken \npromises to a better health care system for hardworking families across \nthe country.\n  ObamaCare contained more than $1 trillion in tax hikes from over 20 \ndifferent tax increases. These tax increases included a new excise tax \non employer-sponsored insurance plans, the so-called ``Cadillac tax,'' \ntaxes on insurance providers, prescription drugs, medical devices, a \nnew tax on investment income, and additional taxes and other \nrestrictions on Health Savings Accounts, among others. Eliminating \nthese taxes can help boost economic growth.\n  The Senate bill repeals $1 trillion in tax increases included in \nObamaCare: Cadillac tax, which would force companies to shift costs to \nemployees or to reduce the value of the health care benefits they \nprovide; medical device tax, which would harm healthcare innovation, \nstifle job creation, and increase the difficulty of delivering high \nquality patient care; health insurance tax, which would increase health \ninsurance premiums; individual and employer mandates, which forced \npeople to purchase a government defined level of health insurance; \nprescription drugs taxes, which would make critical medication more \nexpensive; and health savings accounts tax, which would essentially \nmake over-the-counter medicines more expensive by making them \nineligible as qualified medical expenses.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, repealing \nObamaCare would raise economic output, mainly by boosting the supply of \nlabor. The resulting increase in public and private sector growth, GDP \nis projected to average .7 percent over the 2021 through 2025 period. \nAlone, those effects would reduce Federal overspending by $216 billion \nover the 2016 to 2025 period according to the CBO and Joint Committee \non Taxation, JCT, estimate.\n  ObamaCare included over $800 billion in Medicare cuts. Instead of \nusing those savings to strengthen and secure Medicare, the President, \nalong with Congressional Democrats, took those funds and used them to \ncreate new entitlement programs. This bill ends the raid on Medicare to \npay for ObamaCare and puts those funds back into Medicare, where they \nbelong.\n  State exchanges were almost exclusively financed through $5.4 billion \nin grant money from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, \nCMS. While costing billions of taxpayer dollars from hardworking \nfamilies, most State exchanges have dramatically underperformed or \nfailed. Some exchanges have received hundreds of millions of dollars in \nFederal grants, yet\n\n[[Page S8341]]\n\nare or were unable to accomplish their stated goal. In fact, recent \nnews reports highlight more than $474 million of taxpayer funds were \nspent on failed exchanges for Massachusetts, Oregon, Nevada, and \nMaryland. Our measure ends this waste of taxpayer dollars.\n  Medicaid spending currently consumes nearly a quarter of every State \ndollar, passing education as the largest state budgetary commitment. \nThis expansion under ObamaCare includes an unsustainable and costly \nguarantee of 90 to 100 percent Federal funds that will likely be \nshifted back to the States as the Federal Government begins looking for \nways to cut spending and addressing its almost $19 trillion national \ndebt. Most importantly, the bill provides for a transition to a more \nsustainable State partnership.\n  As I noted earlier, our Nation has made great strides in improving \nthe quality of life for all Americans, but these transformative changes \nwere always forged in the spirit of bipartisan compromise and \ncooperation. We still need health care reform, but it has to be done \nthe right way. The bill the Senate will approve can help build a bridge \nfrom these broken promises to better care for each and every American.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                               farm bill\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the 2014 farm bill \nand attempts to change it by Members of this Congress. The farm bill \nprocess was a long, hard, and frustrating exercise. Nobody got \neverything they wanted, but in the end we got a new bill for farmers \nacross the country.\n  I believe our country needs good farm policy, which means an \nadequate, yet limited safety net for farmers.\n  Our farmers face real, uncontrollable risks every year. The farm bill \nprovides farmers with a number of programs that help mitigate those \nrisks. That is why I was very concerned when I learned the budget deal \nwas cutting $3 billion from the Federal crop insurance program.\n  That cut would have forced the Risk Management Agency at the \nDepartment of Agriculture to renegotiate the Standard Reinsurance \nAgreement next year and save $300 million per year. These cuts were \nalmost universally opposed by rural America. Lenders, commodity groups, \ninput suppliers, and many others opposed the cuts to the crop insurance \nprogram.\n  Beyond being bad policy, I opposed the crop insurance cuts because--\nlike many of my colleagues on both the House and Senate Agriculture \ncommittees--I do not support reopening the 2014 farm bill. I am very \nglad the highway bill is going to reverse these cuts to the crop \ninsurance program.\n  I also want to speak to the importance of not reopening the farm bill \nin the omnibus.\n  Section 739 of the House Agriculture Appropriations bill reauthorized \ncommodity certificates. For those who don't remember what commodity \ncertificates are, they are a way around payment limits. The language in \nthe House bill specifically directs the USDA to administer commodity \ncertificates as they were in 2008 when they were not subject to any \npayment limits at all.\n  I want to be very clear so there is no misunderstanding by those in \nthis body or the agriculture lobby. Section 739 of the House \nAgriculture Appropriations bill brings back commodity certificates, \nwhich reopens the 2014 Farm Bill. If the agriculture community wants to \nbe taken seriously, we should heed our own advice and not reopen the \nFarm Bill by reauthorizing commodity certificates.\n  I am opposing cuts to the crop insurance program today because that \nwould reopen the farm bill. I hope tomorrow I don't have to oppose \ncommodity certificates in the Omnibus because a few people want to \nreinstate unlimited farm subsidies.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2876\n\n  There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote \nin relation to amendment No. 2876, offered by the Senator from \nWashington, Mrs. Murray.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am well aware that there are serious \ndisagreements between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to \nwomen's health, but I would hope that despite our disagreements, they \nwould at least allow us to vote on the important amendment I have \noffered to strike the harmful language defunding Planned Parenthood in \nthis legislation and replace it with a new fund to support women's \nhealth care and clinic safety for staff and patients. Unfortunately, \napparently my Republican colleagues are going to choose instead to just \nsimply push this amendment aside and everything with it that we are \ndoing for women and families.\n  Well, Planned Parenthood doctors and staff are not going to be pushed \naside, even by the terrible violence we have seen all too often at \nwomen's health clinics. They are keeping their doors open. And the \nwomen and families who rely on these centers for their care and who \nbelieve women should be able to make their own choices aren't letting \nthe political attacks we have seen today get in their way. They are \nstanding up for what they believe.\n  While Republicans may want to avoid taking this tough vote, Democrats \nare going to keep making it very clear exactly where we stand: with \nPlanned Parenthood and with women across the country.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the tabling amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment.\n  Senator Murray proposes to establish a new women's health care and \nclinic safety and security fund to ensure that, among other goals, all \nwomen and men have access to health care services without threat of \nviolence. No one disagrees with the goal of making sure all Americans \nhave access to health care without fearing threats or violence. We \ncertainly don't condone any of the violence anywhere in the United \nStates.\n  The best way to ensure that women and men have affordable health care \nis to pass this repeal bill and repeal ObamaCare. For every American, \nObamaCare has meant more government, more bureaucracy, and more rules \nand regulations, along with soaring health care costs and less access \nto care.\n  The most effective solution to improving the quality of and access to \nwomen's health care is to lower the cost and provide access to health \ncare, not to create another fund with another new tax. ObamaCare \nalready contains more than $1 trillion in new taxes, funding new and \nduplicative programs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield back any time, although evidently there is none.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the Murray amendment No. 2876 and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 2875, offered by \nthe Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Johnson.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, on June 15, 2009, President Obama went to \nthe American Medical Association to sell his health care plan to the \ndoctors and to the American people. President Obama addressed the \ndoctors, and he said:\n\n       I know that there are millions of Americans who are content \n     with their health care coverage--they like their plan and, \n     most importantly, they value their relationship with their \n     doctor. They trust you. And that means no matter how we \n     reform health care, we will keep this promise to the American \n     people: If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep \n     your doctor, period. If you like your health care plan, you \n     will be able to keep your health care plan, period. No one \n     will take that away, no matter what.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, we all know, unfortunately, that promise has been \nbroken. So many people who supported the bill made that similar \npromise. But PolitiFact called it something else; they called it 2013's \n``Lie of the Year.''\n  My amendment would restore that promise. My amendment would keep that \npromise to the American people.\n  I urge my colleagues, particularly those who made that promise--you \nhave the opportunity to restore and convert that lie into a promise.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the amendment that has \njust been described. Our colleague from Wisconsin is seeking to bring \nback the so-called grandfathered health plans that existed between 2010 \nand the end of 2013. My view is that this is something of a health care \nFrankenstein. All the plans that were grandfathered on December 31, \n2013, and disappeared on that date would somehow be magically brought \nback to life by the Senator from Wisconsin. That is not the way the \nprivate health insurance market works in America. Many of the plans \nthat were in existence on December 31, 2013, don't exist anymore. In \nthe private market, which I support, plans change continually. Plans \nchanged in 2014 and they changed again at the beginning of 2015.\n  It seems to me that what this amendment does is it distorts the \nprivate marketplace. I urge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2875.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 56, nays 44, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 312 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--56\n\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Bennet\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Burr\n     Capito\n     Cassidy\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Cotton\n     Crapo\n     Cruz\n     Daines\n     Donnelly\n     Enzi\n     Ernst\n     Fischer\n     Flake\n     Gardner\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Heller\n     Hoeven\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johnson\n     Kirk\n     Lankford\n     Lee\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moran\n     Murkowski\n     Paul\n     Perdue\n     Portman\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rounds\n     Rubio\n     Sasse\n     Scott\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Sullivan\n     Thune\n     Tillis\n     Toomey\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--44\n\n     Baldwin\n     Blumenthal\n     Booker\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Coons\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Heinrich\n     Heitkamp\n     Hirono\n     Kaine\n     King\n     Klobuchar\n     Leahy\n     Manchin\n     Markey\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murphy\n     Murray\n     Nelson\n     Peters\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Sanders\n     Schatz\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall\n     Warner\n     Warren\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven).

I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe despensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of December 2, 2015, under \n``Text of Amendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes of debate on the \namendment.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the Brown-Casey-Wyden-Stabenow-Hirono \namendment would permanently extend the Medicaid expansion matching rate \nat 100 percent. It would help strengthen Medicaid for 71 million \nAmericans who rely on this program for quality, affordable health \ninsurance.\n  Because of the ACA, more Americans can access comprehensive \naffordable care. Because of the Affordable Care Act, people in my \nState--600,000 Ohioans--now have Medicaid and affordable health \ninsurance, in addition to other provisions of ACA. The best way to \nsupport States that have expanded Medicaid is by making the enhanced \nFMAP permanent.\n  Mr. President, that means States will now bear none of the cost of \nMedicaid expansion. We would pay for this amendment by closing \ncorporate tax loopholes. It would provide States with fiscal security \nand free up State Medicaid budgets, as I have heard Senator Alexander \ntalk about so often. It would free up State Medicaid budgets for higher \neducation and other kinds of State expenditures.\n  I encourage my colleagues to do the right thing and provide health \ncare and to do smart budgeting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment. I refuse to ask more American taxpayers, who have sacrificed \nso much already, to satiate the boundless Washington appetite for \nspending. Spending on Medicaid has experienced a 137 percent increase \nfrom $200 billion in 2000 to $476 billion in 2014, and many expect \nthose figures to increase.\n  We all want individuals to have access to high quality health \ninsurance. However, a 2011 study found that 31 percent of doctors are \nunwilling to accept new Medicaid patients. How can Americans access \nquality health care if doctors will not treat them?\n  Most importantly, adding more people to Medicaid will lead to a loss \nof jobs. A 2013 study concluded that for every 21 million adults who \njoined Medicaid, the economy will employ 511,000 to 2.2 million fewer \npeople. The Obama recovery is a jobless recovery, and I refuse to \nexacerbate the unemployment. Instead of adding more and more people to \nthe rolls of a failing Medicaid program----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n[[Page S8343]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the pending amendment No. 2883 offered by \nthe Senator from Ohio would cause the underlying legislation to exceed \nthe authorizing committee's 302(a) allocation of new budget authority \nor outlays. Therefore, I raise a point of order against this amendment \npursuant to section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Strike section 101.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, this amendment, which I offer with my \ncolleagues Senator Murkowski and Senator Kirk, would strike the \nprovisions that would eliminate Federal funding, including Medicaid \nreimbursements, for Planned Parenthood. Otherwise, the likely result \nwould be the closure of several hundred clinics across the country, \ndepriving millions of women of the health care provider of their \nchoice.\n  I want to make clear that our amendment does not include any new \nspending, it does not increase taxes, and it retains the current Hyde \namendment language, which prohibits the use of Federal funds for \nabortions except in cases of rape, incest or where the life of the \nmother is at risk.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, Senator Collins, who is my friend and \ncolleague from Maine, would strike a provision in this bill defunding \nPlanned Parenthood and would continue directing Federal funds to that \norganization.\n  Earlier this year, I joined Senator Ernst, Senator Paul, and other \ncolleagues, and we introduced legislation that prohibits taxpayer \ndollars from funding Planned Parenthood and reasserts Congress's \nsupport for directing those funds to current providers of women's \nhealth care.\n  We absolutely should support health care choices for women. But \nPlanned Parenthood is the single largest provider of abortions in the \ncountry. Directing increased taxpayer dollars to community health \ncenters provides quality health care options to women without \nsupporting the largest provider of abortions in the country.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about an amendment that \ndeals with a fundamental issue for working families, and that is the \ncost childcare. By way of example, the weekly cost of childcare in \nPennsylvania, roughly over the last 30 years, has gone up by 70 \npercent. In a State like ours that can mean over $10,600 per infant per \nfamily. We want to make sure this credit is fully available to working \nfamilies. We want to increase the maximum amount to $3,000. Finally, we \nwant to make sure it is fully refundable.\n\n  This amendment is paid for by offsets.\n  I thank Senator Baldwin for the great work she did with us on this \namendment.\n\n[[Page S8344]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Murray and Reed of Rhode Island \nbe added as cosponsors of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment.\n  Senators Casey and Baldwin have proposed an amendment to further \nshift the tax burden onto high-income taxpayers. It would pay for new \ntax credits with the Buffett tax through taxing foreign inversion \ncorporations as domestic and by expanding limitations on executive \ncompensation deductibility.\n  This legislation is not the place to add one-sided cuts that have not \nbeen included in regular order negotiations going on between Congress \nand the administration and in the Finance Committee.\n  Further, passing this reconciliation legislation will repeal a dozen \nnew taxes used to offset the cost of ObamaCare.\n  Comprehensive tax reform is needed to examine our system of credits \nand deductions to create a pro-growth tax policy across income \nspectrums, but not in this bill.\n  Washington already takes over $3 trillion per year from the American \npublic, which is more than enough to fund necessary government \nfunctions. Increasing the tax burden on the most successful Americans \ndiscourages the work and jobs and investment necessary to grow \nAmerica's economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. President, the pending amendment No. 2893 offered by Senator \nCasey would cause the underlying legislation to exceed the authorizing \ncommittees's 302(a) allocation of new budget authority or outlays. \nTherefore, I raise a point of order against this amendment pursuant to \nsection 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive all applicable \nsections of that act for purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my amendment postpones the implementation \nof the Cadillac tax for the next 10 years. I think that is a good start \non the legislation we have in front of us today. In fact, I think it is \na great start, but I think we ought to take the next step. The next \nstep is to repeal it altogether, and that is exactly what this \namendment does. It is the only bipartisan piece of legislation that \ndoes just that.\n  To that end, I thank the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Heinrich, for \nhis help and support in moving this legislation forward to where we are \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, there is no opposition to this legislation.

The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2892 to Amendment No. 2874\n\n  (Purpose: To improve mental health and substance use prevention and \n                               treatment)\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2892.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mrs. Shaheen] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2892 to amendment No. 2874.\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, we are facing a public health emergency \nin New Hampshire and States across the country. Heroin and opioid abuse \nare at epidemic levels. This is important because it affects every \nState that is represented on the Senate floor. Each day, 120 Americans \ndie of drug overdose; that is 2 deaths every hour. In New Hampshire we \nare losing one person every day from drug overdose. Drug overdose \ndeaths have exceeded car crashes as the No. 1 cause of fatalities in \nthis country.\n  This amendment recognizes that this is a public health emergency and \nthat we need to provide additional resources to address it.\n  It does three things. First, it ensures that all health plans bought \non the exchange cover mental health and addiction-related benefits. \nSecond, it eliminates the Medicaid coverage exclusion that currently \nprohibits reimbursement for critically important inpatient facilities \nthat treat mental illness. That is the 16-bed limit on those inpatient \ntreatment facilities. Finally, it provides much needed funding to help \nStates, municipalities, and their implementing partners prevent and \ntreat mental illness and substance use disorders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. This is a public health emergency. This amendment is \nfully paid for. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment. I share my colleague's concern with the current state of \nmental health and substance abuse policies in the United States. Our \nhealth care system in many ways has failed to treat those who need care \nmost desperately. However, as deeply as I believe we must strengthen \nmental health, I believe we have to do it right.\n  Consideration of mental health legislation should be thoughtful and \nshould examine the real barriers to appropriate treatment. Simply \nthrowing more money at the problem has proven time and again to be \nineffective. That is why I am proud of the work being done by the \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. Chairman Alexander, \nRanking Member Murray, and 26 other Senators, including me, support the \nMental Health Awareness and Improvement Act. That bill takes important \nsteps to increase mental health awareness, prevention, and education; \nencourages the sharing of relevant mental health information; and \nassesses the barriers to integrating mental and behavioral health into \nprimary care. It is a good step and should be done through the \ncommittee process.\n  I thank Senator Shaheen for offering this amendment and support the \nintent, but it has to be done right. And this increases taxes.\n  Mr. President, the pending amendment No. 2892 offered by Senator \nShaheen would cause the underlying legislation to exceed the \nauthorizing committee's 302(a) allocation of new budget authority or \noutlays. Therefore, I raise a point of order against this amendment \npursuant to section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974, I move to waive all applicable sections of that act for \npurposes of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 47, nays 52, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 317 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--47\n\n     Ayotte\n     Baldwin\n     Bennet\n     Blumenthal\n     Booker\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Collins\n     Coons\n     Donnelly\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Heinrich\n     Heitkamp\n     Hirono\n     Kaine\n     King\n     Klobuchar\n     Leahy\n     Manchin\n     Markey\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murphy\n     Murray\n     Nelson\n     Peters\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Sanders\n     Schatz\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall\n     Warren\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--52\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Burr\n     Capito\n     Cassidy\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Cotton\n     Crapo\n     Cruz\n     Daines\n     Enzi\n     Ernst\n     Fischer\n     Flake\n     Gardner\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Heller\n     Hoeven\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johnson\n     Kirk\n     Lankford\n     Lee\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moran\n     Murkowski\n     Paul\n     Perdue\n     Portman\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rounds\n     Rubio\n     Sasse\n     Scott\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Sullivan\n     Thune\n     Tillis\n     Toomey\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Warner\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2912.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2912 to amendment No. 2874.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this is an alternative to the Feinstein \namendment we will be voting on next. Under the Feinstein amendment, the \ngovernment without due process can take away from you valuable \nconstitutional rights. They happen to be Second Amendment rights \nwithout notice and the opportunity to be heard. If you believe that the \nFederal Government is omniscient and all competent, vote for the \nFeinstein amendment, but I wish to point out that even our former \ncolleague Teddy Kennedy was on this terror watch list at one point. \nDespite numerous efforts to try to get off of it, he never could--as \nwell as our friend Catherine Stevens, former Ted Stevens' spouse.\n  My amendment would provide that due process, notice, and an \nopportunity to be heard, and provide new tools and increased \nauthorities to prevent terrorism and prevent violence by blocking the \ntransfer of firearms following that notice and opportunity to be heard, \nwhich would also give the judicial authority an opportunity to grant an \nemergency terrorism order which would actually detain the person who is \nidentified and proven to be a terrorist.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment, to give law \nenforcement the ability to take terrorists off the streets and prevent \nthem from obtaining firearms while preserving important constitutional \nrights of law-abiding Americans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have great respect for the senior Senator \nfrom Texas, a former member of the Texas Supreme Court. How he could\n\n[[Page S8346]]\n\nmake an argument like this is beyond my ability to comprehend.\n  This Republican amendment ties the hands of law enforcement. This \namendment doesn't keep terrorists from getting guns. It simply delays \ntheir efforts for up to 72 hours. This amendment means that all a \nlawyer needs to do is gum up the works for a short time and an FBI \nterrorist suspect can walk away with a firearm--a legal firearm. That \nwould be relatively easy to do. There are a lot of lawyers in this \nChamber. Courts can't do virtually anything in 72 hours. How long does \nit take to shoot up a school, a mall, someone's home? Fifteen minutes? \nFive minutes? You could be on the terrorist watch list, go buy a gun, \nand let the time go by.\n  This is outrageous that people would try to run from this amendment. \nIf you are on a terrorist watch list, you shouldn't be able to buy a \ngun. This would allow a terrorist to not only buy a gun but keep it for \nup to 72 hours.\n  The second aspect of this amendment is equally alarming. It takes \nmoney away from law enforcement. Here again, we are voting on something \nagain and again. We already voted down this Vitter amendment, sanctuary \ncities bill, last month, which strips all local law enforcement from \nvital Federal community policing grants.\n  I am using a little bit of my leader time right now.\n  This strips local law enforcement from vital Federal community \npolicing grants, targeted public safety and to build community trust. \nIt cuts community development block grants, and the purpose of this is \nto ensure affordable housing and provide services to the most \nvulnerable in our communities.\n  Very quickly, this amendment takes the FBI out of the equation when \nit comes to keeping guns away from terrorists, and it takes away from \nlocal law enforcement agencies, threatening public safety. Is it any \nwonder that this is an anti-law enforcement amendment?\n  The legislation is opposed by the Fraternal Order of Police, Major \nCities Chiefs Association, United States Conference of Mayors, and many \nothers. This is a dangerous amendment. First of all, to use Senator \nKennedy, let him be on the watch list. He is not going to go buy a gun \nand hurt anybody. These ridiculous assertions are just that--\nridiculous. We are trying to say if you are on a watch list as being a \nterrorist, you shouldn't be able to buy a gun. It is as simple as that. \nMy friend the Senator from California will lay this out. She has been \nthe leader on guns in this Chamber for two decades.\n  Mr. CORNYN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No time for debate remains.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 10 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, to accept the argument of the Democratic \nleader, you would have to believe that the Federal Government is always \nright and is all-knowing and can deprive you of valuable constitutional \nrights without giving notice and an opportunity to be heard in front of \nan impartial tribunal--a judge. That is what the Democratic leader is \nsuggesting. I think it is wrong and it is un-American. It violates the \nvery core constitutional protections afforded to all Americans.\n  I urge Senators to vote for my alternative to the Feinstein amendment \nand against the Feinstein amendment, which would deprive people of \ntheir due process rights under the Constitution.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is nothing unconstitutional about \nkeeping a terrorist from buying a gun. That is what this is all about. \nDo we want people on a terrorist watch list to go buy a gun? The answer \nis no. That is what this amendment is all about. The Senator from \nCalifornia will explain it.\n  I raise a point of order against this ridiculous amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974 and the waiver provisions of the applicable budget resolutions, \nI move to waive all applicable sections of that act and applicable \nbudget resolutions for purposes of amendment No. 2912, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2910.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2910 to amendment No. 2874.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on an amendment which \nis identical to a bill I have introduced with Republican Congressman \nPeter King. This amendment was proposed by the Bush administration's \nDepartment of Justice in 2007. It would allow the Attorney General to \nprevent a person from buying a gun or explosive if, one, the recipient \nis a known or suspected terrorist; and, two, the Attorney General has a \nreasonable belief that the recipient would use the firearm in \nconnection with a terrorist act.\n  The bill has very broad law enforcement support, including the Major \nCities Chiefs Association and the International Association of Chiefs \nof Police. New York Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, who was also \nchief of the Los Angeles Police Department, recently said on Meet the \nPress:\n\n       If Congress really wants to do something instead of just \n     talking about something, help us out with that Terrorist \n     Watch List, those thousands of people that can purchase \n     firearms in this country. I'm more worried about them than I \n     am about Syrian refugees, to be quite frank with you.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S8347]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, if you believe the Federal Government \nshould be able to deprive an American citizen of one of their core \nconstitutional rights without notice and an opportunity to be heard, \nthen you should vote for the Senator's amendment. This is not the way \nwe are supposed to do things in this country. If you think that the \nFederal Government never makes a mistake and that presumptively the \ndecisions the Federal Government makes about putting you on a list \nbecause of some suspicions, then you should vote for the Senator's \namendment. But we all know better than that. I have used the example of \nTeddy Kennedy, Captain Stevens, and others who were placed on these \nlists.\n  At the very least we ought to provide those individuals with an \nopportunity to be notified, and they should have a right to be heard by \nan impartial judicial tribunal to make those decisions.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Senator's amendment.\n  I have one other reason. The whole purpose of this amendment is to \ndestroy the privileged status of this reconciliation bill. If this bill \npasses, it will destroy our ability to pass this reconciliation bill \nwith 51 votes.\n  Again, I urge all of my colleagues to vote against it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the pending amendment No. 2910, offered by \nSenator Feinstein, contains matter that is not within the jurisdiction \nof the Finance Committee or the HELP Committee, and it is extraneous to \nH.R. 3762, a reconciliation bill. Therefore, I raise a point of order \nagainst the amendment pursuant to section 313(b)(1)(C) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive all applicable \nsections of that act for the purposes of the pending amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, after we finish the Grassley amendment and \nthe Manchin amendment, I ask unanimous consent that the next amendments \nin order be the following: Bennet No. 2907 and Paul No. 2899.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2914 to Amendment No. 2874\n\n(Purpose: To address gun violence, improve the availability of records \n   to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, address \nmental illness in the criminal justice system, and end straw purchases \n      and trafficking of illegal firearms, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2914.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2914 to amendment No. 2874.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Manchin-Toomey amendment that is going to be up \nnext, I am told, won't prevent the next shooting or reduce crime or fix \nour mental health system. We need to also be worried about protecting \nthe Second Amendment.\n  My amendment addresses the Obama administration's reduction in gun \nprosecutions by providing money to expand Project Exile and funding for \nprosecuting felons and fugitives who fail background checks, targeted \nto the highest crime jurisdictions. It criminalizes straw purchasing \nand gun trafficking, provides more resources for Secure Our Schools \ngrants, and increases funding for mental health initiatives. It \nincentivizes States to provide mental health records to the background \ncheck database, clarifies what records should be submitted to the NCIS \nsystem, and it provides that military members can buy firearms in their \nState of residence or where they are stationed, so that what happened \nin Chattanooga doesn't happen again. Finally, this amendment also \nreduces funding to those municipalities that continue to defy the law \nwith regard to the enforcement of immigration offenses, otherwise known \nas sanctuary cities.\n  I ask for adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the victims of gun violence and their \nfamilies deserve more than a moment of silence; they deserve a moment \nof sanity.\n  We have coming before us a proposal by a Republican Senator and a \nDemocratic Senator, Senator Toomey and Senator Manchin, a proposal to \nclose the loopholes so that people who are convicted felons and people \nwho are mentally unstable cannot buy firearms. Unfortunately, in the \n100-page amendment being offered by the Senator from Iowa, exactly the \nopposite occurs. The loopholes are opened. When it comes to background \nchecks, unfortunately, this doesn't do anything.\n  It does do one thing: It reduces the amount of money available to \npolice departments and COP grants all across the United States if the \nSenator disagrees with their immigration policy. That is why the \nFraternal Order of Police opposes it.\n  Let's have a moment of sanity. Let's please vote no on the Grassley \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment \nviolates section 313(b)(1)(C) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise again today to offer this \nimportant piece of legislation with my good friend Pat Toomey. It is a \nbipartisan piece of legislation. It makes all the sense in the world. \nMost of America supports the background checks that we are talking \nabout.\n  As a law-abiding gun owner, I can assure you that basically I have \nbeen taught not to sell my gun to a stranger, not to sell my gun to a \ncriminal, and not to sell my gun to someone who is severely mentally \nill. That is how we were trained, and that is how most American law-\nabiding gun owners are trained. All this bill does is not infringe upon \nthe rights of a personal transaction.\n  The only thing this piece of legislation does is to close a loophole \nin commercial transactions such as gun shows and Internet sales. I \ndon't know if that person is a criminal. I don't know if that person is \nseverely mentally ill. I just don't know that person. I was taught not \nto sell to that person or to give to that person unless I knew him.\n  This is the most commonsense idea supported by an overwhelming \nmajority of Americans and an overwhelming majority of law-abiding gun \nowners in America.\n  I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in this \nbipartisan legislation to please support this. It is basically \nsomething that is long, long overdue, and these tragedies continue to \nhappen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, this amendment will help improve access to \ncare for veterans all across the country and fill a huge unmet need. It \nprovides funding to hire more doctors, nurses, social workers, and \nmental health professionals to serve our veterans. It will also help \nimprove VA medical facilities by supporting upgrades and minor \nconstruction improvements.\n  In Colorado, our VA system has been plagued by long waiting times and \na lack of access. Across the State, we have shortages of physicians, \nnurses, and mental health professionals, particularly in rural areas \nsuch as Alamosa and the San Luis Valley. We also know all too well in \nColorado that much more accountability is needed within the VA, and we \nwill continue to work to improve a bureaucracy that has plagued access \nto quality care.\n  The 400,000 veterans in Colorado and across the Nation deserve the \nbest care we can offer. They deserve what they have been promised. This \namendment is fully paid for, and I urge my colleagues to vote yes on \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment. I commend my colleague from Colorado for working to advance \nthe needs of veterans. However, Senator Bennet proposes a $20-billion \nincrease in spending paid for by a tax increase.\n  I believe the problem with Washington's finances is that our \ngovernment spends too much and lives outside its means. I am \ncontinually working to put our country's finances on a sustainable path \nso that more Americans can keep more of their hard-earned money. What \nwe don't need are higher taxes, and we do need bills that go through \nthe proper committees.\n  Congress has continually rejected this one-sided tax policy. \nComprehensive tax reform is needed to examine our system of credits. \nWashington already takes $3 trillion per year from the American public, \nwhich is more than enough to fund necessary government functions, \nprovided we get through the regular process. So I urge my colleagues to \noppose this.\n  Mr. President, the pending amendment No. 2907 would cause the \nunderlying legislation to exceed the authorizing committee's 302(a) \nallocation of new budget authority or outlays. Therefore, I raise a \npoint of order against this amendment pursuant to section 302(f) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, first, through the Chair, I say thank you \nto my colleague from Wyoming for his kind words about our efforts with \nrespect to veterans.\n  Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I \nmove to waive all applicable provisions of that act for purposes of the \npending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is 2 minutes evenly divided.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, we spend hundreds of billions of dollars \ndefending our country, and yet we cannot truly defend our country \nunless we defend our border. My bill would place pause on issuing visas \nto countries that are at high risk for exporting terrorists to us. My \nbill would also say to visa waiver countries that in order to come and \nvisit, you would have to go through global entry, which would require a \nbackground check.\n  I urge Senators who truly do want to defend our country and have \nincreased border security to vote for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I hate to say this to my good friend from \nKentucky, but this is a bumper sticker kind of amendment. It says it \nwould keep us secure, but it would even stop tourists from visiting \nthis country for at least 30 days.\n  Let's say you have a relative who is dying in this country, you will \nhave to call them up and say: Don't die for at least 30 days so I can \ncome over and say goodbye to you. It stops some of our closest allies \nin the Middle East. Jordan is probably our closest ally, and this \nlegislation would stop us from issuing visas there.\n  It doesn't make us safer. It kills our tourist industry, it damages \nour economy, but most importantly it makes it look to the rest of the \nworld like we are cowering in our shoes. I don't want to do that.\n  Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment \nviolates section 313(b)(1)(C) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of the applicable budget \nresolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections of that act and \napplicable budget resolutions for purposes of amendment No. 2899, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am not going to ask for a record vote on \nthis amendment, and I hope that will help others try to move the \nprocess along.\n  This amendment is very similar to the next amendment, the Coats \namendment, in that it is a clear indication that the Democrats \nunderstand that we want to extend the medical expense deduction of 7.5 \npercent threshold to seniors, which expires at the end of 2016. The \ndifference is that we don't believe it should be paid for on the backs \nof our seniors, and that is why this amendment would have it paid for \nby a minimum tax of 30 percent on those who earn over $1 million \ndollars, the so-called Buffett rule.\n  The Coats amendment that is coming up next is on the backs of seniors \nby denying the indexing of the $85,000 threshold for seniors to pay the \nadditional Medicare premiums. I will have a chance to talk about that \nin a moment, but this amendment allows us to extend the medical expense \ndeduction of 7.5 percent threshold but does it without attacking our \nseniors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Maryland \nfor being willing to take a voice vote, knowing that would be in the \nminority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, similarly, as Mr. Cardin has said, what \nthis does is to continue something that was put into the Affordable \nCare Act, a rise between 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income before \nyou can begin deducting to 10 percent of adjusted gross income before \nyou can deduct. For seniors, an exemption was provided so that seniors \ncould stay at the 7.5 percent level. This expires next year. My \namendment essentially extends this for 7 years. It is to the benefit of \nseniors to do this. For those seniors who find excessive medical \nexpenses facing them, this is something that was supported, obviously, \nby everyone across the aisle in the Affordable Care Act, and I am \nextending this for an additional 7 years with this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support for low-income and middle-income \nseniors the excessive medical cost by adopting the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I would urge my colleagues to vote against \nthis amendment because of how it is paid for. Seniors who have $85,000 \nof income have to pay a higher Part B premium today. We have indexed \nthat because, as I think Members on both sides of the aisle agree, we \nbelieve that brackets should have that type of index so that our \nseniors are protected from inflationary growth.\n  The problem with the Coats amendment is that he removes that index \nthrough 2025. This is an attack on our seniors. There is no way that we \nshould be paying for this worthwhile extender. I don't disagree with \nthe extender, but I do take exception with paying for it on the backs \nof our seniors, and I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, if I could just respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2888.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We intend to enforce the 10 minutes, so it would \nbe a good idea for everybody to stay close to the Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the direction we are \ngoing, but I would hope that we would have, really, 10-minute votes. \nOne way to enforce that is to have people miss a couple of these votes, \nOK? Because people come strolling in thinking they are going to be \nprotected, so I would hope it would be 10-minute votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next \namendment be Paul amendment No. 2915 and that it be subject to a 60-\nvote affirmative threshold for adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2915 To Amendment No. 2874\n\n    (Purpose: To restore Second Amendment rights in the District of \n                               Columbia)\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2915.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Paul] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2915 to amendment No. 2874.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes equally divided on the \namendment.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, last week the District of Columbia police \nchief said that if you see an active shooter, take them down. The \nproblem is it is very difficult to own a gun in DC, and it is nearly \nimpossible to have a gun with you if you were to see an active shooter.\n  So my amendment would create a District of Columbia concealed carry \npermit program. It would also allow national reciprocity for concealed \ncarry. It would also allow Active-Duty Forces to carry concealed carry-\non Department of Defense properties.\n  I ask the Senate and those Senators who believe in self-defense to \nvote for this amendment.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am rather shocked at this amendment by \nmy friend--and he is my friend. If I stood here and said: I don't like \nthe laws in Lexington, KY, and I think that Big Brother ought to decide \nwe should repeal their laws because I don't like it--that is \nridiculous. The fact is, I am shocked that a Libertarian would stand \nhere and offer this.\n  I thought that Libertarians believe in freedom of localities over Big \nGovernment. So why would you wipe out duly enacted local laws? DC has \nits own unique needs. We know how many diplomats come here. We know the \nrest. It is quite different. We are a definite target, but the fact is, \nI urge my colleagues to stand and be counted here on behalf of local \ncontrol.\n  I started off as a county supervisor. I didn't want other entities \ntelling me what to do. I think we ought to vote no on this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to Paul \namendment No. 2915.\n  Mr. PAUL. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, over the last several years our country \nhas taken some important steps forward when it comes to health care. \nMore than 16 million people have gained the peace of mind and security \nthat comes with having health care coverage. Tens of millions of people \nwith preexisting conditions no longer have to worry about insurance \ncompanies turning them away. Young adults in our country are able to \nstay covered under their parents' insurance as they start out in life. \nAnd there is so much more. But, as I have said many times, the work did \nnot end when the Affordable Care Act passed--far from it. I am ready to \ncontinue working with anyone who has good ideas about how to continue \nmaking health care more affordable, expand coverage, and improve \nquality of care.\n  Unfortunately, with this latest tired political effort to dismantle \ncritical health care reforms, my Republican colleagues are once again \nmaking it clear that they want to take our health care system back to \nthe bad old days. This is a major substitute amendment that my \nRepublican colleagues just offered. It is yet another effort to pander \nto the extreme political base rather than working with us to strengthen \nhealth care for our families.\n  Even the Parliamentarian agreed with us today that repealing these \nimportant premium stabilization programs does not have a sufficient \nbudget impact and is subject to the Byrd rule.\n  So I am raising a point of order today to strike section 105(b) from \nthe amendment, which repeals the risk corridor program. It is a vital \nprogram to make sure premiums are affordable and stable for our working \nfamilies. Repealing it would result in increased premiums, more \nuninsured, and less competition in the market.\n  This amendment represents a step forward for our health care system, \nnot backward. I hope Republicans will drop the politics and join us in \nsupporting it.\n  Mr. President, I raise a point of order that section 105(b) of the \npending amendment violates section 313(b)(1)(D) of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, ``premium stabilization'' is a fancy term \nfor bailout. What this basically seeks to strike out is a provision \nthat takes out the money for a bailout fund, for taxpayer money that \nwould be used to bail out insurance companies that participate in \nObamaCare. Why should the American taxpayer have to bail out private \ninsurance companies that are losing money on ObamaCare?\n  Last year, because we passed this provision, we saved the American \ntaxpayers $2.5 billion. But now, because these companies have lobbyists \nwho come up here and lobby to get their money, we are supposed to leave \nin this fund to bail out private insurance companies. This is \noutrageous.\n  If you want to be involved in the exchanges--and of course I want us \nto repeal the whole lot, but if you want to be involved in these \nexchanges and you lose money, the American taxpayer should not have to \nbail you out to the tune of over $2 billion, and that is what they are \nasking for.\n  Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974 and the waiver provisions of applicable budget resolutions, \nI move to waive all applicable sections of that act and applicable \nbudget resolutions for purposes of amendment No. 2916, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask the clerk to report amendment No. \n2917.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2917 to amendment No. 2916.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To strike the reinstatement of the tax on employee health \n              insurance premiums and health plan benefits)\n\n       In section 209, strike subsection (c).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. There is no shortage of contradictions today from my \nRepublican friends. The first amendment was called, ``If you like what \nyou have, you can keep it.'' A couple of hours later, the same \nRepublicans came back and voted to strip the health care for 22 million \nAmericans.\n  In one of the few bipartisan moments today, 90 Senators voted to \nremove the provision that would restart the Cadillac tax in 2025. Yet \nminutes later, the Republican leader offered the pending substitute \namendment to put that provision back in.\n  Do they really believe those who oppose the Cadillac tax will not \nrecognize that they voted with them and then immediately reversed \nthemselves and voted against them? I am offering them a chance to \ncorrect the record.\n  My amendment will again remove the provision that restarts the \nCadillac tax in 2025. I urge all Senators, particularly the 90 who just \nvoted yes, to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I appreciate the senior Senator from Nevada \nprotecting the bipartisan amendment that was put forward by the junior \nSenator from Nevada to make sure that stays in the bill. I suggest that \nwe have a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2917) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2919.\n\n[[Page S8355]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of my \namendment to allow families in Wisconsin and across the country to keep \ntheir high-quality affordable health insurance under the Affordable \nCare Act.\n  My Republican friends want to repeal the Affordable Care Act and turn \nback the clock to the days when only the healthy and wealthy could \nafford the luxury of quality health insurance. The plan before us would \nstrip millions of Americans of their premium tax credits and take away \nnew Medicaid coverage for thousands of people across this country.\n  My amendment is simple. It would prevent Republicans from taking away \nthese tax credits and Medicaid for millions of low-income Americans. \nThanks to the Affordable Care Act, over 183,000 Wisconsinites--hard-\nworking Wisconsinites--have obtained quality, affordable private health \ninsurance coverage through the marketplace. Almost 90 percent of these \nWisconsinites are receiving support to make their coverage more \naffordable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. I ask unanimous consent for 10 more seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Americans deserve to know their coverage will be there \nwhen they need it the most. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment because in the United States of America, health care should \nbe a right guaranteed to all, not a privilege reserved for the few.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment. This amendment would exempt individuals eligible for \nadvanced premium tax credits from the larger tax credit repeal in the \nbill. As a matter of policy and fairness, I do not believe that just \nbecause an individual is eligible for an advanceable tax credit, they \nshould be exempt from the larger repeal.\n  I also object to the repeated attempt to pay for this amendment by \nincreasing taxes on hard-working Americans. I urge my colleagues to \noppose this message.\n  The pending amendment No. 2919 would cause the underlying legislation \nto exceed the authorizing committee's 302(a) allocation of new budget \nauthority or outlays. Therefore, I raise a point of order against this \namendment pursuant to section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, when President Clinton proposed his health \ncare bill in 1993, Republicans were so upset that they came up with a \nradical idea. This radical idea was to give tax credits to poor people \nto buy private insurance, to set up an insurance exchange where they \ncould do that, to ban preexisting conditions, and to include an \nindividual mandate--in short, the Affordable Care Act, built by \nRepublicans, many of them still in this Chamber today.\n  At the heart of that proposal was the idea that people should get a \ntax cut in order to be able to buy private insurance. At the heart of \nthe underlying Republican amendment is a gutting of that ability of \nindividuals to go out and buy private insurance for themselves.\n  This amendment is pretty simple. It says that at the very least we \ncan come together on the idea that we should preserve those tax credits \nfor the most vulnerable--for pregnant women, for victims of domestic \nviolence, for people suffering from heart disease, cancer, and \nAlzheimer's. At the very least, we can come together and decide to \nprotect those tax credits--a Republican idea at the genesis for those \nvulnerable individuals.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment.\n  Under ObamaCare, health insurance plans are decreasing, they are \nnarrower, and they are giving sick individuals fewer choices and fewer \noptions over their health care.\n  Repealing ObamaCare is the first step in moving toward health care \nthat is better for all Americans, including those who Senators Murphy \nand Stabenow intend to help.\n  This amendment also again proposes the Buffett tax, taxing foreign \ninversion corporations as domestic, and expanding limitations on \nexecutive compensation deductibility.\n  I believe the problem with Washington's finances is that our \ngovernment spends too much and lives outside its means. I am \ncontinually working to put our country's finances on a sustainable path \nso that more Americans can keep more of their hard-earned money. We \ndon't need higher taxes.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the upcoming motion to waive.\n  Mr. President, the pending amendment No. 2918 would cause the \nunderlying legislation to exceed the authorizing committee's 302(a) \nallocation of new budget authority or outlays. Therefore, I raise a \npoint of order against this amendment pursuant to section 302(f) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974.\n\n[[Page S8356]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for years the American people have been \ncalling on Washington to build a bridge away from ObamaCare. For years \nDemocrats prevented the Senate from passing legislation to do just \nthat, but in just a moment that will change.\n  It will be a victory for the middle-class families who have endured \nthis law's pain far too long on their medical choices, on the \naffordability of their care, on the availability of their doctors and \nhospitals, and on the insurance they liked and wanted to keep. A new \nSenate that is back on the side of the American people will vote to \nmove beyond all the broken promises, all the higher costs, and all the \nfailures. We will vote to build a bridge away from ObamaCare and toward \nbetter care. We will vote for a new beginning.\n  We hope the House will again do the same, and then President Obama \nwill have a choice. He can defend the status quo that has failed the \nmiddle class by vetoing the bill or he can work toward a new beginning \nand better care by signing it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as I have said before, I am very proud of \nthe progress we have made over the last few years toward a health care \nsystem that actually works for our families and puts their needs first.\n  Today more than 16 million people have gained the peace of mind and \nsecurity that comes with health care coverage. Tens of millions of \npeople with preexisting conditions no longer have to worry about \ninsurance companies turning them away, and young adults in this country \nare able to stay covered as they start out their lives, but the work \ndidn't end when the Affordable Care Act was passed--far from it.\n  So I am ready, and I know our colleagues on this side of the aisle \nare also, to work with anyone who has good ideas about how we continue \nmaking health care more affordable, expanding coverage, and improving \nthe quality of care.\n  The legislation we have now spent the last few days debating, which \nhas no chance for becoming law, will do the exact opposite. This will \nundo the progress we have made. It is not what our families and \ncommunities want.\n  I hope that once this partisan bill reaches the dead-end it has \nalways been headed for, Republicans will finally drop the politics and \nwork with us to deliver results for the families and communities we \nserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Chair lays before the Senate the \nconference report to accompany H.R. 22, which will be stated by title.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the House to the amendment of \n     the Senate to the bill (H.R. 22), to authorize funds for \n     Federal-aid highways, highway safety programs, and transit \n     programs, and for other purposes, having met, have agreed \n     that the Senate recede from its disagreement to the amendment \n     of the House and agree to the same with an amendment and the \n     House agree to the same, signed by a majority of the \n     conferees on the part of both Houses.\n\n  Thereupon, the Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of December 1, 2015.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 30 minutes of debate equally \ndivided.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I wish to clarify today a provision \nincluded in the FAST Act conference report.\n  In order to build and restore the Nation's highway infrastructure \nwithout breaking the bank to do so, we are going to need the best and \nlatest in cost-saving construction technologies to help us attain that \ngoal.\n  I supported a provision in the Senate bill that would do just that \nwith regard to construction for key highway components, such as bridge \nabutments, erosion control on highway waterways, and sound walls. My \nlanguage specifically identified ``innovative segmental wall technology \nfor soil bank stabilization and roadway sound attenuation, and \narticulated technology for hydraulic sheer-resistant erosion control'' \nas technologies for research and deployment action by the Federal \nHighway Administration, FHWA.\n  A core value shared by all three technologies is that they can save \ntaxpayer dollars. And we should certainly encourage FHWA to engage in \nresearch and deployment on them.\n  For example, one of the practical and expensive problems with highway \nconstruction is moving and dispensing with excavated dirt. Segmental \nretaining wall, or SRW, technology can reduce transportation \nconstruction costs to the taxpayers by allowing the use of in situ \nsoils in building segmental retaining walls rather than treating the \nexcavated dirt as waste and hauling it away. Using the native soils for \nbank reinforcement can save the hauling costs and time for dirt \nremoval, also reducing construction time. Similar segmental unit \ntechnology can be used to provide additional choices that are also \naesthetically appealing for transportation designers to consider for \nsound attenuation.\n  And articulated segmented unit technology for erosion control, known \nas ACB for the concrete blocks usually used for this purpose linked \ntogether in a durable matrix, is especially durable and resistant to \novertopping in high-water events. Overtopping is a major problem in \nhigh-water events that can degrade or ruin the existing erosion control \nmeasures. Rebuilding and replacing is always a huge cost that we should \nseek to avoid.\n  While the conference report does not retain my provision, we still \nhave options to save the taxpayers money. I would like to point out \nthat provisions appear elsewhere in the conference report that can give \nFHWA essentially the same mission, albeit articulated in a different \nway.\n  Section 1428 of the conference report states that ``the Secretary \nshall encourage the use of durable, resilient and sustainable materials \nand practices, including the use of geosynthetic materials and other \ninnovative technologies, in carrying out the activities of the Federal \nHighway Administration.''\n  Section 1428 might be an alternate means of articulating the same \nconcepts I supported with regard to the innovative segmental wall, or \nSRW, technology. SRW walls use concrete block facing materials that are \nobviously highly durable, resilient, and sustainable. These facing \nunits are anchored into the soils using geosynthetic ties that are also \nhighly tough and durable and described in Section 1428.\n  In passing the conference report, I would like to clarify for FHWA \nstaff to consider SRW technology, using the durable, resilient, \nsustainable materials anchored with geosynthetics as one of the \ntechnologies envisioned in Section 1428. ACBs and segmental block sound \nwalls also fit the definition of durable, resilient, and sustainable \nmaterials and techniques set forth in this section and should enjoy a \nsimilar favorable view under the umbrella of Section 1428.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the highway \ntrust fund, HTF, and the conference report we will be considering \nshortly to accompany the surface transportation reauthorization bill, \nwhich is called the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act, FAST \nAct.\n  First, I am pleased to see that this bill provides 5 years of funding \nfor our Nation's transportation infrastructure. That is the kind of \nlong-range certainty our State and local officials and the private \nsector need to plan transportation infrastructure projects in a \nthoughtful and responsible way.\n  While there are many excellent provisions in the bill, I do have \nsignificant concerns about the way our Nation's surface transportation \ninfrastructure is being funded.\n  First, I will speak about the policy within the bill. I am pleased \nthat the conference committee has retained this Nation's commitment to \ntransportation alternatives. This bill includes more than $4 billion \nfor bike and pedestrian infrastructure, making our roads safer for \neveryone who uses them. My bill creating a dedicated program for \nnonmotorized safety is also included in the reauthorization, which will \nsupport things like bike safety training programs for both bicyclists \nand drivers, again making our streets safer for all who use them.\n  Furthermore, the section 5340 bus program has been kept intact. This \nprogram is for high-density areas like Baltimore and Washington, DC, \nwhich cannot simply widen a road to accommodate extra travelers. The \nFAST Act provides more than $2.7 billion to high-density areas. This is \nsignificant for Maryland in particular. Over the life of this bill, \nMaryland should receive more than $4.4 billion in Federal Highway \nAdministration, FHWA, and Federal Transit Administration, FTA, funding \ncombined. That is an extraordinary amount of funding for a State that \nsorely needs it.\n  I am concerned, however, that the FAST Act undermines the public \ninput, environmental analysis, and judicial review guaranteed under the \nNational Environmental Policy Act, NEPA. If Congress wants Federal \nagencies to approve more permits faster, then we should appropriate the \nrequisite funds for sufficient staff and other necessary resources. We \nshould not undermine the integrity of important project reviews. \nMoreover, the argument that the permitting process takes too long is a \nred herring. More than 95 percent of all FHWA-approved projects involve \nno significant impacts and therefore have limited NEPA requirements. If \nwe really want to speed project development, we should recognize the \nknown causes of delay and not use this bill as a Trojan horse to \ndismantle our Nation's foundational environmental\n\n[[Page S8358]]\n\nlaws. So while I support many of the policies in the bill, I am still \nvery concerned about the impact it will have on our environment.\n  While I have mixed feelings about the policies in this bill, I am not \nconflicted with regard to how it is funded. I am extremely disappointed \nin the hodgepodge of questionable pay-fors that we are using in this \nbill. We certainly needed to address the problem of funding our \nNation's highway and transit systems beyond the myriad short-term \nextensions that Congress has approved in the past. But instead of \nopting for a reliable and permanent future revenue stream to pay for \nthis critical government function, the FAST Act falls back on \nprovisions completely unrelated to highways and mass transit. It relies \non one-time pay-fors that are simply digging a deeper hole for the next \nreauthorization. That is a troublesome precedent.\n  I think we have missed an opportunity here to stick to the ``user \npays'' principle with regard to the Federal gasoline excise tax, which \nhasn't been raised since 1993. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, a 10-cent-per-gallon increase in the tax would fully fund the \nbill for 5 years.\n  Gasoline prices are plunging around the country, with the national \naverage falling in 24 out of the past 30 days, according to the \nAmerican Automobile Association, AAA, earlier this week. The price of a \ngallon of regular gasoline now stands at $2.04 nationally, down 14 \ncents compared to 1 month ago and 74 cents lower than this time last \nyear. AAA officials and others anticipate that the national average \nprice will dip below the $2.00 threshold within a matter of days.\n  So, as I said, I think we may be missing an opportunity here to put \nsurface transportation infrastructure funding back on a solid \nfoundation, appropriately based on the ``user pays'' principle.\n  It is also important from a policy perspective that we price carbon \nmore appropriately to reflect its total costs, promote fuel efficiency, \nand accelerate the absolutely essential shift from fossil fuels to \ncleaner, more sustainable sources of energy. Lower gasoline prices let \nmotorists keep more money in their pockets in the short term. But we \nhave to think about the long term, too, and if we needlessly delay \nmaking that inevitable shift, the long-term costs to human health and \nthe environment will dwarf any perceived short-term gains.\n  There is one so-called offset in the bill that I adamantly oppose: \nthe use of private collection agencies, PCAs, to collect tax debt. I \noppose this provision not only because it simply will not raise revenue \nbut also because it is terrible tax policy that puts a target on the \nback of low-income and middle-class families. The Treasury Department, \nthe Internal Revenue Service, IRS, and the National Taxpayer Advocate \nall join me in opposing this provision.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation, JCT, scores this provision at over \n$2.0 billion over 10 years, but since JCT only takes into account \nincoming and outgoing tax revenue, its score doesn't take into account \nthe IRS's implementation and oversight costs and the opportunity costs \nof farming collections out to private collectors.\n  Twice before, from 1996 to 1997 and from 2006 to 2009, Congress \nrequired Treasury to turn over some tax collection efforts to PCAs with \nmiserable results. The first attempt resulted in the loss of $17 \nmillion and contractors participating were found to have violated the \nFair Debt Collections Practice Act. Under legislation enacted in 2004, \nthe IRS again attempted to use PCAs to collect Federal taxes in 2006. \nIn September of that year, the IRS began turning over delinquent \ntaxpayer accounts to three PCAs who were permitted to keep between 21-\n24 percent of the money they collected. While the program was supposed \nto bring in up to $2.2 billion in unpaid taxes, data from the IRS \nshowed that the program actually resulted in a net loss of almost $4.5 \nmillion to the Federal Government after subtracting $86.2 million in \nadministration costs and more than $16 million in commissions to the \nPCAs.\n  In analyzing the PCA offset last year, the IRS prepared a preliminary \nestimate of the percentage of individual taxpayers who have ``inactive \ntax receivables'' that would be subject to private debt collection and \nwho are low-income. After reviewing collection data for fiscal year \n2013, the IRS found that 79 percent of the cases that fell into the \n``inactive tax receivables'' category involved taxpayers with incomes \nbelow 250 percent of the Federal poverty level. So nearly four-fifths \nof delinquent taxpayers were almost surely in the ``can't pay'' \ncategory and would be unlikely to make payments when contacted by a PCA \ninstead of the IRS.\n  Not only are low-income taxpayers more vulnerable to begin with, PCAs \nactually provide fewer options for them to meet their tax obligations. \nIRS employees, unlike the PCAs, have a variety of tools at their \ndisposal they can use to help delinquent taxpayers meet their tax \nobligations, especially those facing financial difficulties. These \ntools include the ability to postpone, extend, or suspend collection \nactivities for limited periods of time; making available flexible \npayment schedules that provide for skipped or reduced monthly payments \nunder certain circumstances; the possibility of waiving late penalties \nor postponing asset seizures; and offers in compromise, OIC, which are \nagreements between struggling taxpayers and the IRS that settle tax \ndebts for less than the full amount owed.\n  In contrast, the PCAs' sole interest is to collect from a taxpayer \nthe balance due amount they have been provided. They have no interest \nin whether the taxpayer owes other taxes or may not have filed required \nreturns. They cannot provide any advice or use any of the tools IRS \nemployees have, such as extensions or offers in compromise.\n  In October, I joined 15 other Senators--including several of my \nFinance Committee colleagues and Ranking Member Wyden--in signing a \nletter the senior Senator from Ohio, Mr. Brown, sent to leadership on \nthe dangers and shortcomings of this provision. Unfortunately, our \nmessage was not heard. So, because we refuse to turn to obvious and \ncommonsense financing solutions for our transportation infrastructure \nproblems, we have decided instead to use an offset that has \nhistorically lost money, all on the backs of low-income taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, the FAST Act conference report is a bipartisan, \nbicameral achievement. I congratulate the House and Senate conferees \nfor reaching an agreement; I know it has been an arduous process. The \nreauthorization contains many good provisions and provides 5 years of \ndesperately needed funding for our Nation's crumbling transportation \ninfrastructure. I will vote for the conference report, but I will do so \nwith serious reservations about how this bill is funded. Our surface \ntransportation infrastructure is a crucial component of our national \nsecurity and economic competitiveness. Reauthorizing our surface \ntransportation programs used to be a relatively routine matter; now it \nis becoming harder and harder to do and we are relying more and more on \ngimmicky funding mechanisms. These are worrisome precedents.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, over the past few years, the public has \ngrown increasingly skeptical of Congress being able to function.\n  When Republicans took the majority in January, we promised the \nAmerican people we would get the Senate working again, and we have been \ndelivering on that promise.\n  This Transportation bill conference report is another major \nlegislative achievement and the result of hard work by several \ncommittees in the House and Senate who put together key provisions to \nspur long overdue infrastructure investment and safety improvements.\n  This bill will give States and local governments the certainty they \nneed to plan for and commit to key infrastructure projects. It will \nalso help strengthen our Nation's transportation system by increasing \ntransparency in the allocation of transportation dollars, streamlining \nthe permitting and environmental review processes, and cutting red \ntape.\n  Republicans and Democrats alike got to make their voices heard during \nthis process, and the final conference report is stronger because of \nit.\n  As chairman of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, I \nhad the opportunity to work on various sections of the bill with \nRanking Member Bill Nelson. The\n\n[[Page S8359]]\n\nprovisions under our committee's jurisdiction comprise roughly half of \nthe 1,300 pages of legislative text.\n  One particular focus was on enhancing the safety of our Nation's \ncars, trucks, and railroads, and the final bill we produced makes key \nreforms that will enhance transportation safety around the country.\n  Over the past year, the Commerce Committee has spent a lot of time \nfocused on motor vehicle safety efforts. Last year was a record year \nfor auto problems, with more than 63 million vehicles recalled.\n  Two of the defects that have spurred recent auto recalls--the faulty \nGeneral Motors ignition switch and the defective airbag inflators from \nTakata--are responsible for numerous unnecessary deaths and injuries--\nat least 8 reported deaths in the case of Takata and more than 100 \ndeaths in the case of General Motors. Indications point to the Takata \nrecalls as being among the largest and most complex set of auto-related \nrecalls in our Nation's history, with more than 30 million cars \naffected.\n  Given the seriousness of these recalls, when it came time to draft \nthe highway bill, one of our priorities at the Commerce Committee was \naddressing auto safety issues and promoting greater consumer awareness \nand corporate responsibility.\n  The conference report includes our committee's work to triple the \ncivil penalties that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration \ncan impose on automakers for a series of related safety violations--\nfrom a cap of $35 million to a cap of $105 million--which should \nprovide a much stronger deterrent against auto safety violations like \nthose that occurred in the case of the faulty ignition switches at \nGeneral Motors.\n  I am also pleased that the conference report includes the Motor \nVehicle Whistleblower Safety Act, which I introduced with Ranking \nMember Nelson and others to incentivize auto companies to adopt \ninternal reporting systems and establish a system to reward employees \nwho ``blow the whistle'' when manufacturers sit on important safety \ninformation. The conference report also improves notification methods \nto ensure that consumers are made aware of open recalls.\n  The new notification requirements include a provision incentivizing \ndealers to inform consumers of open recalls when they bring in their \ncars for routine maintenance, as well as a grant program to allow \nStates to notify consumers of recalls when they register their \nvehicles.\n  Our committee also worked with the House Energy and Commerce \nCommittee during the conference process to incorporate a modified \nprovision from my Democrat colleague, the senior Senator from Missouri, \nwhich will prevent rental car companies from renting unrepaired cars \nthat are subject to a recall.\n  In the wake of the recall over the GM ignition switch defect, the \ninspector general at the Department of Transportation published a \nscathing report identifying serious lapses at the National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration--or NHTSA--the government agency \nresponsible for overseeing safety in our Nation's cars and trucks.\n  The concerns raised included questions about the agency's ability to \nproperly identify and investigate safety problems--a concern that is \nfurther underscored by the circumstances surrounding the Takata \nrecalls.\n  In addition to targeting violations by automakers, our portion of the \nhighway bill also addresses the lapses at NHTSA identified in the \ninspector general's report. While the conference report does increase \nfunding for NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation, that will only \nhappen contingent on the agency's implementation of reforms called for \nby the inspector general, ensuring that this agency will be in a better \nposition to address vehicle safety problems in the future.\n  Combating impaired driving is also a priority. I am pleased to \nannounce that the conference report creates a grant for States that \nprovide 24/7 sobriety programs. I have been a long-time champion of \nthese programs, which have been very effective in States, like my home \nState of South Dakota, where it originated.\n  This provision is intended to allow States to certify the general \npractice on minimum penalties which can meet the definition under the \nrepeat offender law, and we expect that NHTSA should reasonably defer \nto a State's analysis underpinning such a certification.\n  Another significant portion of the final conference report is made up \nof a bipartisan rail safety bill put together by the Republican junior \nSenator from Mississippi and the Democrat junior Senator from New \nJersey that we merged in conference with the passenger rail bill that \nthe House passed earlier this year.\n  The resulting passenger rail title includes a 5-year reauthorization \nof Amtrak that includes a host of safety provisions that our committee \nadopted following the tragic train derailment in Philadelphia. I know a \nnumber of my colleagues are very pleased with various provisions that \nwill strengthen our Nation's rail infrastructure and smooth the way for \nthe implementation of new safety technologies.\n  Our transportation infrastructure keeps our economy--and our Nation--\ngoing. Our Nation's farmers depend on our rail system to move their \ncrops to market. Manufacturers rely on our Interstate Highway System to \ndistribute their goods to stores across the United States.\n  And all of us depend on our Nation's roads and bridges to get around \nevery day.\n  For too long, transportation has been the subject of short-term \nlegislation that leaves those responsible for building and maintaining \nour Nation's transportation system without the certainty and \npredictability they need to keep our roads and highways thriving.\n  I am proud of the final conference report that passed the House \nearlier today by a strong vote of 359-65. I urge my colleagues to join \nin passing this long-overdue bill so it can be signed into law by the \nPresident without further delay.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the Commerce Committee's \nrelated provision be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Commerce Committee Provisions in Five-Year Surface Transportation Bill\n\n       Below is an extended summary of key provisions in the \n     Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee's \n     titles in the five-year surface transportation bill:\n\n\n   IMPROVED PROJECT DELIVERY AND DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (DOT) \n                               MANAGEMENT\n\n       Project Streamlining--Provides additional authority to \n     streamline project delivery and consolidate burdensome \n     permitting regulations (similar to the administration's GROW \n     AMERICA proposal).\n\n\n                        IMPROVING HIGHWAY SAFETY\n\n       Keeps Drug Users Off the Roads--Allows for more effective \n     drug testing for commercial truck drivers.

Also \n     requires manufacturers to identify and include applicable \n     part numbers when notifying NHTSA of safety defects, making \n     this information publicly available.\n       Incentivizes Dealers to Notify Consumers of Open Recalls--\n     Incentivizes auto dealers to inform consumers of open recalls \n     at service appointments.\n       Creates Program for States to Notify Consumers of Recalls--\n     Creates a state pilot grant to inform consumers of open \n     recalls at the time of vehicle registration.\n       Improves Tire Recall Efforts--Increases the time tire \n     owners and purchasers have to seek a remedy for tire recalls \n     at no cost to consumers. Creates a publicly available \n     database of tire recall information. Also includes\n\n[[Page S8360]]\n\n     a provision adopted in conference to direct NHTSA to study \n     the feasibility of requiring electronic identification on \n     tires in order to facilitate registration and ease the burden \n     on small businesses.\n\n\n                                FREIGHT\n\n       Develops a National Freight Strategy and Strategic Plan--\n     Sets goals to enhance U.S. economic competitiveness by \n     improving freight transportation networks that serve our \n     agriculture, retail, manufacturing, and energy sectors. \n     Focuses freight planning efforts in the Office of the \n     Secretary with the Undersecretary for Policy to provide \n     multimodal coordination.\n       Requires Additional Freight Data--Establishes a working \n     group and an annual reporting requirement to collect \n     additional freight data to help improve the movement of \n     freight throughout the country.\n       Improves Freight Planning--Improves freight planning \n     efforts to ensure that freight planning is multimodal and \n     addresses the links between highways, railroads, ports, \n     airports, and pipelines.\n\n\n                         FLEXIBILITY FOR STATES\n\n       Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) Grant \n     Consolidation--Consolidates state trucking enforcement grants \n     to provide additional flexibility to states to administer \n     enforcement programs.\n       NHTSA Grant Flexibility--Increases emphasis on ``Section \n     402'' highway safety grants to address each state's unique \n     highway safety challenges. Also increases opportunities for \n     states to obtain grants for implementing graduated drivers \n     licensing, distracted driving laws and impaired driving. \n     Creates a new non-motorized grant to create programs to \n     enhance safety for pedestrians and bicyclists.\n\n\n                    REGULATORY REFORM & TRANSPARENCY\n\n       Petitions--Requires FMCSA to respond to stakeholder \n     petitions for review of regulations or new rulemakings.\n       Transparency--Requires FMCSA to maintain updated records \n     relating to regulatory guidance, and provides for regular \n     review to ensure consistency and enforceability.\n\n\n              NHTSA OVERSIGHT & VEHICLE SAFETY ENFORCEMENT\n\n       Vehicle Safety Enforcement--Triples penalties for auto \n     safety violations per incident and triples the overall \n     penalty cap to $105 million, provided that NHTSA conducts a \n     previously-required rulemaking on penalty assessment factors.\n       Whistleblower Incentives--Incentivizes auto employees to \n     come forward with information about safety violations by \n     authorizing the Secretary to award a percentage of certain \n     collected sanctions to whistleblowers. Based upon the \n     bipartisan Motor Vehicle Safety Whistleblower Act, which \n     passed the Senate by voice vote in April (S. 304).\n       Increases Funding for Vehicle Safety--Following the record \n     number of auto recalls in 2014, the bill authorizes \n     additional funding increases to GROW AMERICA levels for \n     vehicle safety efforts, but only if the DOT Secretary \n     certifies that certain reforms have been implemented \n     following the scathing inspector general (IG) audit of NHTSA \n     following the GM ignition switch defect.\n       Increases Corporate Responsibility--Requires rules on \n     corporate responsibility for reports to NHTSA and updates \n     recall obligations under bankruptcy; increases the retention \n     period during which manufacturers must maintain safety \n     records and expands the time frame for remedying defects at \n     no cost to consumers.\n       Provides Increased Oversight of NHTSA--Requires DOT IG and \n     NHTSA to provide updates on progress to implement IG \n     recommendations to improve defect identification, requires an \n     annual agenda, clarifies the limits of agency guidelines, and \n     directs IG and Government Accountability Office GAO audits of \n     NHTSA's management of vehicle safety recalls, public \n     awareness of recall information, and NHTSA's research \n     efforts.\n\n\n                            CONSUMER PRIVACY\n\n       Driver Privacy--Makes clear that the owner of a vehicle is \n     the owner of any information collected by an event data \n     recorder. Based on the bipartisan Driver Privacy Act, which \n     the Committee approved in March (S. 766).\n\n\n                    TRUCKING REFORMS & IMPROVEMENTS\n\n       CSA Reform--Addresses shortcomings in the Compliance, \n     Safety, and Accountability (CSA) program following concerns \n     raised by the DOT IG, the GAO, and a DOT internal review team \n     about the reliance on flawed analysis in the scores used to \n     evaluate freight companies, while maintaining public \n     information on enforcement data and consumer information on \n     the scores of intercity buses.\n       Beyond Compliance--Establishes new incentives for trucking \n     companies to adopt innovative safety technology and \n     practices.\n       Commercial Driver Opportunities for Veterans--Establishes a \n     pilot program to address the driver shortage by allowing \n     qualified current or former members of the armed forces, who \n     are between 18 and 21 years old, to operate a commercial \n     motor vehicle in interstate commerce. Currently, 48 states \n     allow 18-21 year olds to drive intrastate on county, state, \n     and Interstate highways.\n\n\n                                  RAIL\n\n       Passenger Rail Reform--Reauthorizes Amtrak services through \n     2020, empowers states, improves planning, and better \n     leverages private sector resources. It also creates a working \n     group and rail restoration program to explore options for \n     resuming service discontinued after Hurricane Katrina. Many \n     of these provisions are based on the bipartisan Railroad \n     Reform, Enhancement, and Efficiency Act (S. 1626), which \n     passed the Commerce Committee by voice vote in June.\n       Railroad Loan Financing Reform--Reforms the existing $35 \n     billion Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing \n     Program to increase transparency and flexibility, expand \n     access for limited option freight rail shippers, and provide \n     tools to reduce taxpayer risks.\n       Rail Infrastructure Improvements--Improves rail \n     infrastructure and safety by consolidating rail grant \n     programs, cutting red tape and dedicating resources for best \n     use. It also establishes a Federal-State partnership to bring \n     passenger rail assets into a state of good repair.\n       Expedites Rail Projects--Accelerates the delivery of rail \n     projects by significantly reforming environmental and \n     historic preservation review processes, applying existing \n     exemptions already used for highways to make critical rail \n     investments go further.\n       Dedicated Funding for Positive Train Control (PTC)--\n     Establishes a new limited authorization with guaranteed \n     funding for the Secretary of Transportation to provide \n     commuter railroads and States with grants and/or loans that \n     can leverage approximately $2+ billion in financing for PTC \n     implementation.\n       Testing of Electronically-Controlled Pneumatic (ECP) \n     Brakes--Preserves the DOT's final rule requiring ECP brakes \n     on certain trains by 2021 and 2023, while requiring an \n     independent evaluation and real-world derailment test. It \n     requires DOT to re-evaluate its final rule within the next \n     two years using the results of the evaluation and testing.\n       Liability Cap--Increases the passenger rail liability cap \n     to $295 million (adjusting the current $200 million cap for \n     inflation), applies the increase to the Amtrak accident in \n     Philadelphia on May 12, 2015, and adjusts the cap for \n     inflation every five years going forward.\n       Cameras on Passenger Trains--Requires all passenger \n     railroads to install inward-facing cameras to better monitor \n     train crews and assist in accident investigations, and \n     outward-facing cameras to better monitor track conditions, \n     fulfilling a long-standing recommendation from the National \n     Transportation Safety Board.\n       Thermal Blankets on Tank Cars Carrying Flammable Liquids--\n     Closes a potential loophole in Department of Transportation \n     regulations and reduces the risk of thermal tears, which is \n     when a pool fire causes a tank car to rupture and potentially \n     result in greater damage.\n       Real-Time Emergency Response Information--Improves \n     emergency response by requiring railroads to provide \n     accurate, real-time, and electronic train consist information \n     (e.g., the location of hazardous materials on a train) to \n     first responders on the scene of an accident.\n       Grade Crossing Safety--Increases safety at highway-rail \n     crossings by requiring action plans to improve engineering, \n     education, and enforcement, evaluating the use of locomotive \n     horns and quiet zones, and examining methods to address \n     blocked crossings.\n       Passenger Rail Safety--Enhances passenger rail safety by \n     requiring speed limit action plans, redundant signal \n     protection, alerters, and other measures to reduce the risk \n     of overspeed derailments and worker fatalities.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I would also like to conclude by \nunderscoring my appreciation regarding the collaborative work with my \nfriend from Florida, Senator Bill Nelson, ranking member of the \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, and his Committee \nstaff.\n  I would also like to thank the following Senate colleagues and staff: \nLeader McConnell; Senator Inhofe; Senator Boxer; Senator Hatch; Senator \nCornyn; Senator Fischer, who chairs the Surface Transportation \nsubcommittee and who also served on the conference committee; Neil \nChatterjee, Hazen Marshall, Scott Raab, Sharon Soderstrom, and Jonathan \nBurks in Leader McConnell's office for helping to guide this bill \nthrough the Senate and ultimately through conference with the House; \nDave Schwietert; Nick Rossi; Rebecca Seidel; Adrian Arnakis; Allison \nCullen; Patrick Fuchs; Cheri Pascoe; Peter Feldman; Katherine White; \nRobert Donnell; Andrew Timm; Ross Dietrich; Jessica McBride; Paul \nPoteet; Jane Lucas; Frederick Hill; and Lauren Hammond.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Vermonters take great pride in our historic \ndowntowns and small communities. In our cities and towns, we have a \nculture of getting things done--and finding a way to accomplish our \nshared goals. That is why, like many Vermonters, I have been frustrated \nwith the back-to-back short-term patches to keep our highway trust fund \nafloat. I have consistently advocated for a long-term solution that \nwill give States the ability to move forward with building and \nrepairing roads, bridges, and byways; to promote rail safety and \ntransit and to invest in the critical infrastructure that supports our \ncities and towns; to enable interstate and intrastate commerce; and to\n\n[[Page S8361]]\n\ncreate jobs for American workers. The time to pass a plan for long-term \ntransportation funding has finally come.\n  The FAST Act will bring stability where, for too long, there has been \nuncertainty. This bill ensures that Vermont will receive the funding it \nneeds, more than $1.1 billion over the next 5 years, to allow \nVermonters to move forward on infrastructure projects that have been \nwaiting in the wings. In Vermont, the construction season is short and \nthe need is great, and a series of stopgap measures to kick the can \ndown the road was never the right answer. I am pleased there will \nfinally be the stability needed for Vermont and all States to move \nforward to bolster our country's infrastructure.\n  This legislation also reverses changes made to the Federal Crop \nInsurance program, which was a careful balance first struck in the farm \nbill, sending a clear message that we should not thoughtlessly tamper \nwith the farm bill until its next expiration in 2018. And while I am \nglad that the harmful Freedom of Information Act exemptions that we \neliminated in the Senate bill remain out of this conference report, I \nam concerned that a new exemption was added. Nowhere is the free flow \nof information more important than when the safety of every Vermonter \nand every American is at stake.\n  We Vermonters know that, in a democracy, demanding 100 percent of \nwhat you want and refusing to negotiate effective compromise is a \nformula for stalemate and paralysis. As a result, Vermonters know that \nto actually get something done, compromise is a must, and we have \nadvanced the ball a long way down the field. This legislation provides \nstability to move our infrastructure forward to support our economy. It \nsupports safety provisions to protect the well-being of those traveling \nAmerica's highways and rails.\n  Frankly, to facilitate the thriving communities, commerce, and \neconomic growth that we want and need, we should be doing far more to \nrebuild our crumbling infrastructure. This process should not be \nreduced to ``searching under sofa cushions''--as some have described \nit--to scrape together the budget to pay for the vital roads and \nbridges that are so important to us in so many ways. But with this \nbill, we finally are providing our States and communities with longer \nlead times to plan and accomplish this work on our infrastructure, and \nthat signals at least a flicker of progress. We have had enough kicking \nthe can down the road and generating year after year of uncertainty. It \nis time to bring stability and certainty back to our infrastructure and \ntransportation.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I intend to support the surface \ntransportation bill before us. It has been more than a decade since we \nhave had a true multi-year transportation bill. And while this bill \ngives State transportation and transit agencies funding certainty for \nthe next 5 years, it is not all that it could or should have been.\n  I worked hard to retain the transit density formula, which the House \nhad tried to eliminate. If the House had prevailed, the Rhode Island \nPublic Transit Authority, RIPTA, would have lost upwards of $8.5 \nmillion of its Federal allocation each year--about one-third of its \nyearly Federal funding. The loss of funding would have been devastating \nto RIPTA and to the thousands of Rhode Islanders who rely on bus \nservice to get to work, to the store, and to medical appointments. \nNonetheless, the funding increase provided under this part of the \nformula is disappointingly low in comparison to the increase provided \nto rural and growing States, as well as to States that have established \nfixed guideway systems.\n  I am also pleased that the bill addresses some key priorities for \ntransit workers, including mandating new rules to protect drivers from \nviolent assaults, as well as dedicating funding to frontline workforce \ntraining. And overall, the bill continues critical worker protections, \nparticularly under the Davis-Bacon Act.\n  On the highway side of the ledger, the bill includes a vital increase \nin formula funding that will give the Rhode Island Department of \nTransportation a baseline from which it can begin to address the high \npercentage of structurally deficient and functionally obsolete bridges \nin the State, as well as the high percentage of roads with unacceptable \npavement conditions.\n  In addition, both the transit and highway titles of the bill each \nhave new competitive programs, including the restoration of a \ncompetitive bus and bus facility program for transit agencies and the \nestablishment of a grant program for nationally significant freight and \nhighway projects, those that typically exceed $100 million.\n  The bill also includes other important matters, including a long \noverdue reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, which has \nessentially been shuttered since July due to opposition to an extension \nby some on the other side of the aisle.\n  On the other hand, there are provisions in the bill that are \nconcerning, beginning with how it is paid for. Rather than relying on \nthe gas tax or another predicable and related funding source, the bill \nis built on a hodge-podge of offsets like outsourcing tax collection to \nprivate debt collectors, which has been tried before and wound up \ncosting revenue rather than generating it. It also calls for selling \noff portions of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve under the assumption \nthat oil prices will increase, and it taps into funds held by the \nFederal Reserve--something current and former Fed officials have \ncautioned against.\n  In addition, the bill has a number of extraneous provisions, \nincluding a measure that preempts a State's ability to regulate Small \nBusiness Investment Companies, SBICs, and allows certain fund advisers \nwith significant assets under management to escape Securities and \nExchange Commission, SEC, registration altogether. In the wake of the \nfinancial crisis, it remains unclear to me why we would be so hasty to \nweaken investor protections. The bill also restores a wasteful \nagricultural subsidy that I have long fought against and that was just \ncut under the bipartisan budget agreement last month.\n  That leads me to a larger point concerning the double standard that \nis being applied to important legislation that invests in our people, \nour economy, and our national defense on the one side and to special \ninterest benefits, primarily offered under the Tax Code, on the other. \nFor years, Congress has tied itself in knots to develop offsets to buy \ndown the sequester, to reduce student loan interest rates, to cover \nemergency unemployment assistance, and to pay for infrastructure \ninvestments like this surface transportation bill; yet without a second \nthought, deficit ``hawks'' in the majority shrug off billions of \ndollars in tax cuts and tax extenders with little regard for the cost. \nBoth types of expenditures have an impact on the debt and deficit. We \nshould be honest about it and account for both in the same way.\n  Despite these concerns, I believe that after years of work and \nwaiting, we should adopt this bill so that transportation agencies can \nmove forward with their plans with the confidence that Federal funding \nwill be there.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, America's infrastructure was once the envy \nof the world. But for decades, we haven't maintained these public \nworks.\n  The quality of U.S. infrastructure now ranks just 16th in the world, \naccording to the World Economic Forum.\n  The dismal state of our outdated roads, bridges, and railways is \ncosting Ohioans valuable time, money, and energy.\n  To create jobs and keep America on top of the global economy, \nCongress must pass a long-term bill that invests in a world-class \ninfrastructure.\n  The bill that the Senate will soon consider does not contain the \nrobust investment that the President and most experts think we need, \nbut it does make progress over the next 5 years.\n  In Ohio, a quarter of our bridges are ``structurally deficient'' or \n``functionally obsolete.'' Forty-five percent of our State's major \nurban highways are congested, costing our drivers $3.6 billion a year \nin additional repairs and operating costs.\n  During the negotiations on this legislation, I fought to include \nprovisions important to Ohio, and we have made progress on my State's \ntop priorities.\n  The bill would create a new competitive grant program to fund job-\ncreating projects of regional and national significance, like the \nreplacement of the Brent Spence Bridge between Cincinnati and Kentucky.\n\n[[Page S8362]]\n\n  Each year, 4 percent of America's GDP crosses the Brent Spence, which \nwas built more than half a century ago.\n  Replacing this bridge isn't just a top priority for the region's \nbusiness community--it is a safety issue for the hundreds of thousands \nof cars that drive over it every week.\n  The bridge would be eligible for funds from the $800 million per year \npot of funding, which would grow to $1 billion annually in fiscal year \n2020. It is a big win for the Brent Spence project and Ohio jobs.\n  The legislation would also boost funding for Ohio's highway and \ntransit programs.\n  Nationwide, overall highway spending would increase by 15 percent \ncompared to current law, and annual transit spending would grow 18 \npercent.\n  By 2020, that growth will deliver more than $200 million of new \nhighway investment to Ohio each year.\n  In addition to repairing roads, the bill will help Ohio's many \ntransit agencies, providing up to $20 million of new funds each year. \nIn Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Columbus, our transit systems carry more \nthan 250,000 passengers every day.\n  The bill also provides up to $340 million annually for a new \ncompetitive bus program I championed. This was a top priority for \nOhio's transit providers, and I am pleased they will have a much-needed \nsource of funding for bus replacement.\n  And as a long-time supporter of Buy America, I am pleased that the \nlegislation would increase the amount of American-made steel and other \ncomponents that will go into buses and subway cars.\n  The bill also would finally reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, which \nis critical to helping Ohio companies create jobs and sell their \nproducts around the world.\n  After some on the far right allowed the Ex-Im Bank to expire in \nJune--for the first time in the Bank's history--we heard stories of \nlost contracts, risks to future export business, and manufacturing jobs \nmoving out of the United States to Canada and Europe.\n  This is about ensuring that U.S. manufacturers can be competitive in \na global marketplace.\n  While we argued about funding U.S. infrastructure and allowed the Ex-\nIm Bank to expire, China announced that its export-import bank will \nprovide a $78 billion credit line to China Railway Corp to support its \ninfrastructure projects at home and abroad.\n  With countries like Brazil and China investing in 21st century \ntransportation systems, we cannot let the U.S. fall behind.\n  This is no way to run a global economic power.\n  In addition to renewing Ex-Im, the Transportation bill also contains \nimportant provisions for community banks and credit unions.\n  It includes changes to the bank exam cycle for small banks, a bill \nthat Senators Donnelly and Toomey introduced.\n  It streamlines privacy notices for financial institutions--a bill \nthat Senator Moran and I introduced last Congress and that had the \nsupport of 97 other senators and which Senators Heitkamp and Moran \nreintroduced this year.\n  The bill also allows privately insured credit unions to become \nmembers of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, a proposal I introduced \nlast Congress and Senators Donnelly and Portman spearheaded this \nCongress.\n  Since May, Senate Democrats have been pushing for a package of \nmodest, bipartisan proposals like these to help community banks and \ncredit unions. We have resisted efforts to rollback important Wall \nStreet reforms.\n  The House agreed with this approach, and that is why these provisions \nwere added to the Transportation bill.\n  So when you hear that we need to attach ``community bank regulatory \nrelief'' to must-pass appropriations legislation, don't believe it.\n  Relief for small banks and credit unions is already in the \nTransportation bill.\n  Let me be clear: I will not support riders to undermine Wall Street \nreforms in legislation to fund the government.\n  Like any bill of this significance, the long-term transportation \nmeasure isn't perfect. I have strong concerns with the process that led \nto this agreement and with some of the proposals used to pay for it.\n  I think it was a mistake to tap Federal resources that have nothing \nto do with transportation to cover the bill's cost.\n  Under this bill, we are funding highways in part by taking money from \nbanks and the Federal Reserve. It is a bad precedent.\n  We made real improvements to the bill's language on the use of the \nFederal Reserve Banks surplus fund and to the rate of the dividend paid \nto banks over $10 billion. But these pay-fors are not a sustainable way \nto fund transportation projects.\n  Instead of this shortsighted approach that just delays the problem, \nCongress should be looking for a long-term solution to replenish the \nhighway trust fund.\n  I will support this bill because it is the best option we have right \nnow to keep America on top of the global economy and provide the \ninvestment that Ohio needs. But I hope that Congress won't lose sight \nof the need to identify long-term, robust investment in world-class \ninfrastructure.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, Senator Boxer deserves tremendous credit \nfor negotiating a long-term funding bill for our crumbling roads and \nbridges. The Fixing America's Surface Transportation, FAST, Act is an \nimportant turning point in addressing our Nation's infrastructure \nneeds, and the bill will create quality jobs and stimulate economic \ngrowth. The FAST Act ends years of short-term congressional extensions \nand legislative gridlock that prevented our country from making \ncritical investments in our roads, bridges, and mass transit.\n  The bill reauthorizes Amtrak and provides vital funding for positive \ntrain control technology and hazmat training programs. This 5-year \nreauthorization will allow our States and communities to finally plan \nfor the future and address long-overdue maintenance backlogs. \nAdditionally, the FAST Act takes important steps towards addressing the \ngrowing problem of violence against our transit operators. These hard-\nworking men and women deserve a safe working environment, and I will \ncontinue to work with my colleagues to make sure we do everything we \ncan to achieve that.\n  However, I must oppose the bill because Republicans have used this \nstrong bill as a vehicle to roll back rules that protect consumers and \nour financial system.\n  This is the third time in the last year that Republicans have used \nthis hostage-taking approach. Last December, Republicans used the \ngovernment funding bill as a vehicle for a provision written by \nCitigroup lobbyists that would repeal a critical anti-bailout rule in \nthe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Weeks \nlater, Republicans used a broadly popular, bipartisan bill extending \nthe Terrorism Risk Insurance Act to jam through another provision that \nweakened Dodd-Frank's rules on risky derivatives trading. And now, in \nthe FAST Act, Republicans have handed out more than a dozen goodies to \nfinancial institutions, including a requirement that does little but \nbog down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with needless \npaperwork and administrative tasks.\n  If Democrats continue to support bills that include these kinds of \nrollbacks, it will simply encourage Republicans to use other must-pass \nbills to repeal or weaken even larger portions of Dodd-Frank and our \nother financial rules. That is why I must oppose this bill--and why I \nhope the American people weigh in with their representatives against \nthis kind of cynical hostage-taking.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a joint statement by the chair and ranking member of the \nHouse Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Representative \nShuster and Representative DeFazio, and the chair and ranking member of \nthe Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, myself and \nSenator Boxer, to clarify an issue with the Joint Explanatory Statement \nof the committee on conference for H.R. 22.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S8363]]\n\n  \n\n\n Joint Statement of The Honorable Bill Shuster, The Honorable Peter A. \nDeFazio, and The Honorable James Inhofe, The Honorable Barbara Boxer on \nthe Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee on Conference H.R. 22, \n              Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act\n\n                            December 3, 2015\n\n       Title XLIII of the Joint Explanatory Statement provides a \n     summary of section 43001 concerning requirements in agency \n     rulemakings pursuant to this Act. Section 43001 of the House \n     amendments to H.R. 22 was not agreed to in conference and \n     does not appear in the conference report to accompany H.R. \n     22. The summary of section 43001 in the Joint Explanatory \n     statement therefore appears in error. Accordingly, title \n     XLIII of the Joint Explanatory Statement has no effect.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I raise a point of order under rule XXVIII \nthat section 32205 exceeds the scope of conference for the conference \nreport to accompany H.R. 22.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I move to waive the point of order raised \nunder rule XXVIII that section 32205 of the conference report to \naccompany H.R. 22 exceeds the scope of conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The waiver is debatable.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if I could just be heard for 30 seconds or \nless. Please, please don't alter this, because if this passes and we \ndon't waive the point of order, this bill is gone. The House bill \ndidn't even have an extension. So if this bill goes down, we have no \nhighway system.\n  Please vote with Senator Inhofe and myself. It is urgent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, both sides have agreed to have 5 minutes \nequally divided.\n  How much time did the Senator from California take?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California used 30 seconds.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I recognize Senator Roberts for 45 \nseconds.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise to address the point of order \nraised against the highway bill.\n  Among the many provisions of the bill, the legislation realizes a \ncommitment made by House and Senate leadership to restore egregious, \nharmful, counterproductive, contract-breaking cuts to the Federal Crop \nInsurance Program. The commitment we reached with the House was to \nreverse these damaging cuts and policy changes in order to protect our \nproducers. That is their No. 1 priority for risk management.\n  The message from farm country couldn't be more clear: Do not target \ncrop insurance. The point of order would not only strip out much of the \nneeded crop insurance fix, but it could also prevent the timely \npassage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I recognize the junior Senator from \nArizona, Mr. Flake, for such time as he wants to use of his 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, what we are doing is targeting a specific provision \nthat was air dropped into the highway bill. This isn't an attack on the \nhighway bill. It is an attack on a provision that increases crop \nsubsidies $3 billion over what is in the budget deal.\n  We are often accused in this body of reversing cuts that we make \nbefore the ink is dry. In this case, we actually made a deal to reverse \nthe cuts before the ink was even put to paper.\n  Now, if we are ever going to get serious about controlling our \ndeficit and addressing our debt, then we actually have to stick to some \nof the cuts that we have made. That is what this point of order is all \nabout.\n  I urge support of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I recognize the Senator from Michigan, \nSenator Stabenow, for 15 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to support the transportation \nbill and crop insurance. We made a deal with farmers when we gave up \ndirect subsidies that, instead, we would ask them to have skin in the \ngame and to have crop insurance to manage their risk.\n  They have a 5-year bill that gives them certainty. We should not pull \nthe rug out from under them at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I recognize the Senator from Kansas, Mr. \nMoran, for 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the point of order \nand ask my colleagues to support the crop insurance program. In Kansas \nthe weather is not always our friend. The most important farm program \nthat farmers benefit from is the crop insurance program.\n  We have eliminated other farm programs over a long period of time in \nthe name of reform but have replaced them by crop insurance. Now crop \ninsurance becomes the target.\n  I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I recognize the Senator from New \nHampshire, Mrs. Shaheen, for such time as she needs to use for her \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Thank you, Senator Inhofe. I will be brief.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important to challenge the provision in \nthis legislation.\n  I support the highway bill. I think the negotiators did a great job \nto get us a 5-year bill, but the fact is this provision was not \nincluded in either the House transportation or the Senate \ntransportation bill. It is an indefensible reversal of the bipartisan \nbudget bill that became law less than a month ago. It is a $3 billion \ngiveaway to the insurance companies, and I think we need to challenge \nthis kind of move when it gets dropped into a bill.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would ask the Chair the time remaining \nfor the proponents and opponents?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 1 minute \nremaining, and the Senator from Oklahoma has 15 seconds.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I wish to end by saying this is not an \nattack on the highway bill. It has its own issues, but this provision \nsimply attacks the subsidy--the $3 billion subsidy--that was added back \nin after we had agreed in a bipartisan way to these cuts. We cannot \ncontinue to go back on the cuts that we have made. In this case we \ndidn't even wait 1 month or 2 months. The agreement was made on this \nfloor before the bill was even passed. We have to get away from that \nkind of practice.\n\n  So I urge support for this point of order, and I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me make sure everyone understands what \nwe are doing here. The budget act of 2015 had major cuts in the Federal \nCrop Insurance Program. Some of those were restored in the highway \nbill. Now, if the highway bill is changed--if this should pass--it has \nto go back to the House, which means we could not have it this year. In \nother words, the issue here is not how you feel about crop insurance; \nit is whether or not you want this bill.\n  I would suggest to the 65 Members who are here today and who voted \nfor the bill that it would be very difficult to explain how you could \nvote for the bill and then turn around and vote for the very order \nagainst it that would kill the bill for this year in 2015.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The 60-vote threshold having been achieved, \nthe conference report to accompany H.R. 22 is agreed to.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments to \ncongratulate the chairman of our environment committee, Senator Inhofe, \nand his ranking member, Senator Boxer, for an extraordinary job. This \nhas been a fascinating experience, particularly for Senator Boxer and \nme. To say that our relationship got off to a rather rocky start is to \nput it mildly. We found ourselves 20-some odd years ago on the opposite \nside of a very contentious issue with a lot of--shall I say--rather \nfeisty exchanges on the floor of the Senate. It is also pretty obvious \nthat we are not exactly philosophical soulmates. But I had heard \nSenator Inhofe say over the years how much he had enjoyed working with \nSenator Boxer and that there were actually things they agreed upon.\n  I made a mental note of that and wondered whether there might be some \nopportunity at some point down the way to team up with Senator Boxer. \nThat finally happened this year. As Senator Inhofe and Senator Boxer \nwould certainly underscore, we had challenges. We had the complexity on \nour side of the Ex-Im Bank issue, which created some serious internal \nRepublican problems. We had a flirtation among some Members on the \nother side that we could shoehorn a major territorial tax bill into \nthis bill. Senator Boxer and I were skeptical about that from the \nbeginning because it is an article of faith on our side that tax reform \nis not for the purpose of taking the money and spending it, but of \ntaking the money and buying down the rates.\n  We had all kinds of odd potential allowances that led to the floor \ndebate last summer, for which we had an administration that was less \nthan enthusiastic with what Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe and I were \ntrying to do. Senate Democratic leadership hadn't exactly bought in on \nit either. In the meantime, our good friends in the House on my side of \nthe aisle were calling it the Boxer bill, which of course was really \ngreat for me to hear.\n  We had all kinds of tripwires on the path to getting what we thought \nwas important for the country, which was a multiyear highway bill, \nwhich--I believe I am correct, Senator Boxer--we haven't done since \n1998.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Actually, 10 years.\n  I am told it was 17 years since we had a bill of this size.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It has been 17 years since we had a bill of this \nduration, which we all thought was important for the States and \nlocalities, for people who build and repair the roads to have some \ncertainty. In the end, there wasn't really a philosophical problem \nhere. The question was, How can we pull together these disparate pieces \ninto one mosaic that actually had a chance to get somewhere?\n  I want to say to Senator Boxer, in particular, that this has been one \nof the most exhilarating and satisfying experiences I have had in the \ntime that I have been in the Senate. I never would have predicted 20-\nsome-odd years ago that I would be having it with Barbara Boxer. But \nthis shows, in my opinion--I know Senator Inhofe agrees--the Senate is \nat its best when people can identify common interests and work together \nto get a positive result for the country.\n  I want to say to both of these great colleagues how much I appreciate \ntheir extraordinary work, particularly Senator Boxer because we were \nsuch opposites in almost every way. What actual fun it was to get to \nknow her better and to work on this together. She has a year left. \nMaybe we can find something else. Congratulations to both of you on an \nextraordinary accomplishment for the American people.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is great, Mr. Leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. We have a lot of requests for speakers to be heard. I am \ngoing to put myself at the end of the line so that everyone else can \nget in there first. The order is going to be Senator Boxer, and I \nunderstand she might want to share a little time with the Senator from \nFlorida. Then Senator Lee from Utah, Senator Enzi after that, and then \nwhoever else wants to talk. If nobody else wants to talk, then I will \nwind it up.\n  Before I turn it over to Senator Boxer, I am going to tell a story \nbecause I want to make sure that Senator Sullivan doesn't have to wait \nfor 2 hours to hear it. Ten years ago, in 2005, we had the last bill of \nthis nature. It was a bill that we passed. I was an author of it, and I \nwas very proud. That was 10 years ago. That was the last time we did a \nbill like this. I remember standing here, as I am standing today. The \nchairman of that committee wanted to talk about what a great bill that\n\n[[Page S8365]]\n\nwas--the Transportation reauthorization bill--and all of a sudden the \nalarms went off. They said: The bombs are coming. Everybody run. \nEvacuate, evacuate.\n  I wasn't through talking. I talked for about 15 minutes. It is very \neerie when you are standing here and are the only one in the U.S. \nCapitol making a speech with the TV going but no other people are \naround. I made my speech. Afterward I started going down, and I saw a \ngreat big guy walking down the steps very slowly. I went up to Ted \nKennedy. I said: Ted, you better get out of here; this place is going \nto blow up.\n\n  He said: Well, these old legs don't work like they used to.\n  I said: Let me help you.\n  I put my arm around his waist. Some guy had a camera. The front page \nof the cover of that magazine said: Who says that conservatives are not \ncompassionate?\n  That is my story. We will go on to Senator Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I completely neglected to mention an \nextraordinarily important player in all of this, and that is Neil \nChatterjee of my staff, who befriended Senator Boxer and Bettina before \nI realized that there might be a possibility that we could do something \ntogether. Neil has done an extraordinary job. I think I can safely say \nhe enjoyed the confidence of both sides and allowed us to work together \nin a positive and constructive way. I want to thank Neil Chatterjee for \nthe great job that he did as well.\n  Mr. INHOFE. We certainly agree with that.\n  Senator Boxer.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am hardly ever at a loss for words, as you all know. I \nwas so touched tonight. A terrible tragedy happened in my State \nyesterday. You all know about the emotions of that and then the \nemotions of this. I am going to set aside the emotions of the tragedy \nand talk to my friends here.\n  What we did was the impossible dream. It was, in many ways, a very \nlong and winding road to get to this night. People worked together who \nnever thought they would find that common ground. We found it. The \nreason we found it is we were willing to set aside the misperceptions I \nthink we had on so many fronts and recognized that our people needed \nthis badly.\n  As I often say, if you want to buy a house and you go to the bank and \nthe bank says ``Oh, you have great credit, but I can only give you a \nmortgage for 6 months,'' you are not going to buy the house. You are \nnot going to build a major road if you are worried about the funding. \nWhat we have done is extraordinary. For the first time in 17 years, we \nhave a long bill. We have a bill that lasts 5 years.\n  I have to say--and I did not think of it--I think the pay-for was \nbrilliant, the major pay-for. There are others who don't like it. Many \npeople on my side said we should look at the gas tax. I looked at the \ngas tax. I agreed with the chamber of commerce on the gas tax, but I am \nonly one of six people here who probably voted for it.\n  When you come up against these barriers, you need to be very \ncreative. The international tax reform--Leader McConnell was never \ngoing to allow that. I got that message. I still encouraged my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to work on it, but it didn't work \nout. What are we going to do? Just fold up our tent and say the general \nfund is going to pay for this? We don't have enough in the general \nfund. We have deficits. We all know that.\n  What I want to say is that with 60,000 bridges in disrepair--falling \ndown, structurally deficient--and 50 percent of our roads in disrepair, \nwe have a lot of work to do. This gives our States the certainty.\n  The relationships that developed between the staffs--I am going to \nwithhold my comments on that until later. When everybody finishes, I am \ngoing to be here because I am going to mention every single name on \nboth sides. I can't thank you enough. They didn't sleep during the \nThanksgiving break. They worked constantly.\n  Let's face it, this bill was the ``Perils of Pauline.'' Even last \nnight my senior leader asked me to do something I could never do in a \nmillion years on this bill. I must have turned so pale that I almost \nfainted. Bettina almost had a heart attack on the spot because we \nthought that maybe we would not have this bill. But he knows me well \nenough to know what I can do, and that makes for a great working \nrelationship.\n  I will talk about the details of the bill later. Basically, it is a \n5-year bill. Over the period, it is a 20-percent increase, which is \nhuge for our States. It is roads. It is transit. There are new \nprograms, freight programs that Senator Inhofe and Maria Cantwell \nworked on. Ex-Im is in there. I know it is controversial for some, but \nfor our small businesses it is great.\n  I predict that this bill is going to give the economy a real boost--I \nreally mean it--because of the certainty it is bringing and because of \nthe fact that millions of jobs will be created. That always boosts us. \nIt helps with our deficits.\n  I will yield the remainder of my time--just 2 minutes--to Senator \nNelson, with the deepest thanks to Senator McConnell; Senator Inhofe; \nSenator Thune; Senator Nelson, who is just a hero; Senator Brown; all \nof the members of the conference committee who signed the conference \nreport.\n  I yield this time to Senator Nelson, and then we will go back to \nSenator Inhofe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding, Mr. \nPresident. I am going to say two short paragraphs, but first, my \ncommendations to the leadership that has already been mentioned by the \nesteemed majority leader; my commendations to my colleague, our \nchairman on the commerce committee, Senator Thune, who has been a \npleasure to work with; and my thanks to the staff, including Kim \nLipsky, the staff director for our minority staff on the commerce \ncommittee.\n  I want to echo what you have said. Because of this bill, we are going \nto provide States and communities with over $300 billion over 5 years \nto repair the roads and bridges of this country and greatly improve \nrail and port projects, and as a result, we are going to create jobs. \nIn my State of Florida, this translates to $12 million that can be used \nfor improvements on Interstate 95, Interstate 75, and projects, such as \nSunRail, Tri-rail, and the streetcars in Fort Lauderdale. This is just \na small example, and I am so grateful to everyone. I thank everyone \nvery much.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we will go forward with the previous \nagreement and hear from the Senator from Utah, Mr. Lee, followed by \nSenator Enzi from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the highway spending \nbill before us today--and not just the failed substance of the \nlegislation. I rise to oppose the bill's irresponsible and \nunsustainable funding mechanisms and the cynical process that produced \nit.\n  We are told this bill fully funds Federal highway spending for the \nnext 5 years and that it won't add a single dime to the Federal \ndeficit. The math may add up on paper, but does anyone really think the \npay-fors in this bill are honest, responsible ways to fund a government \nprogram?\n  Let's look at a few examples. Of the $70 billion this bill uses to \nbailout the highway trust fund over the next 5 years, more than $50 \nbillion comes from an accounting gimmick that steals money from the \nrest of the Treasury's general fund.\n  Here is how the shell game works. Normally, the Federal Reserve sends \nthe profits from its portfolio assets directly to the U.S. Treasury. \nThese surplus profits are actually one of the major reasons our Federal \nbudget deficits have fallen in recent years below where they were a \nshort time ago. However, this bill would siphon off that money and \nredirect it into the highway trust fund.\n  Just today, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen testified before the \nJoint Economic Committee, where she commented on this particular \nprovision--on this particular aspect of this bill.\n  She said:\n\n       This concerns me, I think financing federal fiscal spending \n     by tapping resources at the Federal Reserve sets bad \n     precedent and impinges on the independence of the central\n\n[[Page S8366]]\n\n     bank; it weakens fiscal discipline, and I would point out \n     that repurposing the Federal Reserve's capital surplus \n     doesn't actually create any new money for the federal \n     government.\n\n  That is not the only funding gimmick found in this legislation. It \nalso purports to raise $6.2 billion in revenue for transportation and \ninfrastructure projects by selling oil from the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve.\n  Let's leave aside for a second that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve \nwas never intended to be a piggy bank for congressional appropriators. \nWhat makes this pay-for particularly objectionable is that its authors \nassume they can get $93 for a barrel of oil when it is currently \nselling for less than $40 per barrel. Only in Washington could we come \nto love a provision like this. Only in Washington could we come to \naccept a provision like this as somehow acceptable. If we are going to \nstart selling Federal assets at fantasy prices--prices that do not \nexist and will not exist in any universe for the foreseeable future--\nthere is absolutely no limit whatsoever to the number of things that we \ncan pretend to pay for. But that is what we will be doing--pretending \nto pay.\n  As bad as this bill's funding schemes are, the cynical process used \nto secure votes in its favor might well be far more troubling. For \ninstance, this bill adds back $3.5 billion in crop subsidy spending \nthat we just cut last month in the budget deal.\n  Is this really how we do business in the Senate? We reduce spending \none month in order to appear fiscally responsible only to reverse \ncourse the very next month when we think no one is looking? You don't \nneed to oppose crop subsidies to see the dishonesty and cynicism of \nthis particular maneuver.\n  Even worse, this bill would never have had a chance of passing the \nSenate were it not for a deal to include the renewal of the Export-\nImport Bank as part of this legislation. I have spoken out against the \nExport-Import Bank many times before, so there is little need to \nrevisit the mountain of evidence proving that it is one of the most \negregious, indefensible cases of crony capitalism in Washington, DC. \nBut it is worth highlighting some of the so-called reforms that Ex-Im \nsupporters included in the bill.\n  First, there is the new Office of Ethics created within the Export-\nImport Bank. Presumably, this is supposed to help the Bank's management \nreduce the rate at which Ex-Im employees and beneficiaries are indicted \nfor fraud, bribery, and other wrongdoing. Since 2009, there have been \n85 such indictments, or about 14 per year.\n  The bill also creates a new position called the Chief Risk Officer \nand requires the Bank to go through an independent audit of its \nportfolio. Only in Washington will you find people who believe that an \norganization's systemic ethical failings can somehow be overcome by \ncreating a new ethics bureaucracy or that hiring a new risk management \nbureaucrat is a suitable replacement for market discipline or that \ngiving another multimillion-dollar contract to a well-connected \naccounting firm will somehow substitute for real, actual political \naccountability.\n  None of these bogus reforms will make an ounce of difference. None of \nthem will change the essential purpose of the Export-Import Bank, which \nis to use taxpayer money to subsidize wealthy, politically connected \nbusinesses.\n  Finally, it must be stressed that this bill does nothing to fix our \nfundamentally broken highway financing system. After this legislation \nis enacted, the highway trust fund will spend more money than the \nFederal gasoline tax brings in. And after this series of fraudulent \npay-fors are exhausted in just 5 years, we will be right back to where \nwe have been for the last decade, and that is trying to find enough \nmoney for another bailout without attracting too much attention from \nthe American people.\n  Let's not forget that the States are big losers under the status quo \nsystem too--under the current system that we have. Federal bureaucrats \ndivert at least 25 percent of State gasoline dollars to nonhighway \nprojects, including mass transit, bike paths, and other boondoggles \nsuch as vegetation management, whatever that is.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield? I have a favor to ask. I will \ngive the Senator from Utah all the time in the world, but he originally \nasked to speak for 5 minutes. I plan to respond to the issues he is \ntalking about, which I don't happen to agree with, but I wonder if the \nSenator from Utah will allow his colleagues to speak in the order we \nagreed to and then come back and allow the Senator from Utah to finish \nhis remarks.\n  I ask the Senator through the Chair if that will work?\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I have less than a page of my remarks that I \nprepared left.\n  I ask unanimous consent for permission to have an additional 2 \nminutes to complete my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEE. As I was saying, Federal bureaucrats divert at least 25 \npercent of State gas tax dollars to nonhighway projects, including mass \ntransit, bike paths, and other boondoggles such as vegetation \nmanagement. Federal Davis-Bacon price-fixing regulations then \nartificially inflate construction costs by at least 10 percent, and \nFederal environmental regulations, such as those issued under the \nNational Environmental Policy Act, add an average of 6.1 years in \nplanning delays to any federally funded project.\n  I understand that Washington is not ready for a more conservative \napproach to infrastructure funding--at least not yet--one where States \nget to keep their transportation dollars and decide how and on what \nthey will spend those dollars, free from interference by Federal \nregulators.\n  We can have honest disagreements from policy, and I know there is \nmore work to do in making the case for conservative transportation \nreform, but what I refuse to accept is the toxic process that produced \nthis bill--the backroom deals, the about-face on crop subsidies, and \nthe Export-Import Bank. The American people deserve better than this, \nand I won't stop fighting to ensure that we do better than this in the \nfuture.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for \nletting me interrupt at this time. We passed a bill earlier, and \nnormally I would have spoken after final passage, but I didn't want to \nhold people up who had transportation plans, so I reserved my comments \nuntil later. I appreciate this opportunity to speak at this time.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Oklahoma and the Senator from \nCalifornia for the significant highway bill they passed tonight. I know \nthere was a lot of work that went into that and a lot of good things \nwill come out of it. It will make a difference for the economy in the \nUnited States.\n  As chairman of the Budget Committee, I know if we can get the private \nsector to increase by just 1 percent, we bring in $400 billion more in \nrevenue without raising taxes, and raising the economy by 1 percent in \nthe private sector is significant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/senate-section/article/S8366-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8366-S8367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RESTORING AMERICANS' HEALTHCARE FREEDOM RECONCILIATION BILL\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today we also passed the most comprehensive \nand far-reaching repeal of ObamaCare that is possible under the \nreconciliation rules. We expect the House to pass this version shortly \nand soon this repeal will head to the President's desk for the first \ntime in his tenure.\n  Our bill will eliminate more than $1.2 trillion in ObamaCare tax \nhikes and save nearly $400 billion over 10 years. Lifting the burdens \nthis law has placed on hard-working families will help move the Nation \nforward from ObamaCare's broken promises to better access to patient-\ncentered health care for each and every American.\n  As I noted earlier, our Nation has made great strides in improving \nthe quality of life for all Americans, but these changes were always \nforged in the spirit of bipartisan compromise and cooperation. We still \nneed health care reform, but it has to be done the right way. To have \ngood health care, we will have to have ideas from both parties, not \njust one party.\n  Tonight we made significant progress to pointing out a bunch of the \nflaws,\n\n[[Page S8367]]\n\nand there were a lot of people who were involved in that and I wish to \ntake this opportunity to thank them.\n  We gave instructions to the Finance Committee and the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee that they were each to save $1 \nbillion. So Senator Hatch and his staff went to work on it, and Senator \nAlexander and his staff went to work on it, and they accomplished that \ntask in conjunction with the House. So I thank them for their effort.\n  I thank the Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee, and \nespecially my staff director, Eric Ueland; as well as my deputy staff \ndirector, Dan Kowalski; the parliamentarian, Tori Gorman; the senior \nbudget analyst, Steve Robinson; the budget analysts, Greg D'Angelo and \nTom Borck; the junior budget analyst, Kaitlin Vogt; the chief counsel, \nGeorge Everly; the assistant counsel, Clint Brown; the director of \nregulatory review, Susan Eckerly; and the editor, Elizabeth Keys.\n  I also wish to thank the people on my personal staff who had to put \nsome of their projects kind of secondary at times and then had to pitch \nin and help with the budget as well.\n  I also want to express my appreciation to the staff from Leader \nMcConnell's office. Leader McConnell is a tremendous strategist and has \nopened the process for the Senate so that great things like the highway \nbill can be done, and that is done by allowing committees to do \namendments, and then allowing the committee bill to come to the floor \nand have amendments from both sides of the aisle in an open process, \nand then to go to conference committee and have the conference \ncommittee do their work to make sure that the House and the Senate are \ntogether. Some of the chief people who worked on that are the chief of \nstaff, Sharon Soderstrom; his policy advisor, Scott Raab; his budget \nand appropriations policy advisor, Jon Burks; and his policy director, \nHazen Marshall. In addition, our floor and cloakroom staff has been \nvery helpful, led by Laura Dove and Robert Duncan.\n  Senator Cornyn and his staff did a marvelous job of helping to find \nout what difficulties there were and what things needed to be \ncorrected. Senator Thune did a great job of lining up speakers, and \nSenator Barrasso did a great job with his staff in lining up some of \nthe messaging.\n  Thanks are due to the Senate Finance Committee, including the staff \ndirector, Chris Campbell; the chief health counsel and policy director, \nJay Khosla; and the health policy advisor, Katie Simeon; the tax \ncounsel, Preston Rutledge; and the health policy advisor, Becky Shipp.\n  I extend my gratitude to the staff of the Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee, as well as Senator Alexander, who has done a \nmarvelous job there. I thank his staff director, David Cleary, his \ndeputy staff director, Lindsey Seidman, his senior policy adviser and \nhealth council, Liz Wroe, and his health policy director, Mary Sumpter \nLapinski.\n  I also need to thank the former budget staff people who lent their \nexpertise on this, particularly Bill Hoagland.\n  We are in a process that may help with some of the future accounting \nfor projects and things and that is to do some budget reform. A lot of \npeople have talked about budgeting reform and we have been doing some \nhearings on budget reform. We will be putting together a bill, and to \nmake it a bipartisan bill it will have to go into effect in 2017. At \nthat point nobody will know who will be in the majority, so we will all \nwork to have a process that will be fair to both sides just in case we \nhappen to be in the minority or the other side happens to be in the \nminority.\n  So we have a lot of people on both sides who have been working on \nthat issue, and we will hold a number of hearings yet and hopefully \ncome up with a process where we can get rid of old programs, eliminate \nduplication, and make the programs that we have be far better. Some of \nthe people who have worked on that in the past have been Senator \nDomenici, who was the chairman of the committee; Senator Gregg, who was \nthe chairman of the committee; and Senator Patty Murray, who was the \nchairman of the Budget Committee. One of the early ones, Senator Phil \nGramm, has donated some of his time to come and work with both sides to \ntake a look at what some of the future economic problems are, and he is \nalso one of the foremost economic predictors, so we can make sure all \nof those things will come together as we work on future budgets.\n  Of course, I would be grossly in error if I didn't mention the House \nchairman of the Budget Committee, Tom Price. He and I have been meeting \nat least once a week with our staffs and coordinating what is being \ndone on both sides, both from a process standpoint, from a policy \nstandpoint, from a bill standpoint, and from a budget standpoint. I \nthink that paid off in what we are seeing tonight.\n  Last and particularly not least, I need to think the \nParliamentarians. I need to thank Elizabeth MacDonough, Leigh \nHildebrand, Michael Beaver, Thomas Cuffie. These are some unsung heroes \nof the U.S. Senate who do a bipartisan--a nonpartisan job for us of \nkind of refereeing when asked, and when you are doing a reconciliation \nbill, you are forced to ask. I had no idea what the process was and the \ndifficulty and the time that is involved, but all of that was spent by \nthe Parliamentarians.\n  We are all familiar with the rule book that is in every one of these \ndesks and about this thick. That is a small part of it. In their \noffice, they have file cabinets full of precedents. If you are drafting \na bill that has to meet the kind of rules and the tight constraints \nthat a reconciliation bill has, they have to meet with you on a regular \nbasis and give their opinion and review all of these precedents to see \nif it can be put together the way we think it ought to be put together \nto be sure that when it comes to the floor, it can be voted on and when \nit is done, it actually is a bill that will be possible to send to the \nPresident's desk.\n  So I thank the Parliamentarians for presiding. I know the tremendous \njob they do of advising whoever sits in the Presiding Officer's chair, \nbut this was a whole new level of instruction as I found out all of the \nthings that they have to have as a part of their knowledge, and I \nreally appreciate the effort they go to, the knowledge they already \nhave, and the important role they play in this process.\n  I know I left out a lot of people, but to anybody who participated, I \nwant to thank them for their efforts and hope that out of all of these \nbudget processes, what we come up with is a better America.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me first of all thank the Senator from \nWyoming. It is interesting that every time we are involved in \nsomething--it could be reconciliation, the budget or the highway bill--\nhe is always in the center and he has always been the anchor that holds \nus all together, and we appreciate that so much.\n  I will recognize the Senator from Washington, Ms. Cantwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/senate-section/article/S8367-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8367-S8369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRANSPORTATION BILL\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise tonight to thank my colleagues \nwho worked so hard on this transportation package that we have just \nvoted on. I thank Chairman Inhofe and Senator Boxer for their hard \nwork, as well as Chairman Thune and Senator Nelson from the commerce \ncommittee for their hard work.\n  The last thing I would have predicted at the beginning of this year \nis that Senator Boxer would have joined forces with Senator McConnell \nto force through a transportation package that many of us probably \nthought wasn't even a reality. I would like to thank the Senator from \nCalifornia because I think there are times in everybody's career where \nyou have to decide that you are going to stand up and push forward no \nmatter how many arrows are shot in your back or no matter how many \nquestions people ask. You have a vision of a path that you see and you \nrealize that at the end, you think you can produce a package that will \nreally be good for America.\n  That is what Senator Boxer has done. She has produced a package that \nwill not only be a great legacy for an already great career but will be \nthe very anecdote we need right now to an economy that is greatly \nchallenged by a lack of infrastructure investment.\n\n[[Page S8368]]\n\n  I say that because the Senator from California and I both represent \nWest Coast States that see Asia as a great economic opportunity and \nthat represent ports up and down the West Coast. We probably have the \ntop one and two and three and four ports on the west coast as far as \nvolume. The key thing that we know is that our own quadrennial review \nof energy products told us that we can't even move product because we \ncompete so much for room on our rails, and battle congestion on our \nhighways. So for the first time, because of this legislation, the \nUnited States of America will have a national multimodal freight \npolicy, along with a national freight strategic plan to say that we \nhave to identify the freight network that is most critical to moving \nproduct to the United States of America and through our ports, and that \nwe should have a program to direct funding to those multimodal projects \nthat are going to help get U.S.-made products outside of the United \nStates and to the markets where they need to be delivered.\n  So again, I thank Senator Thune and Senator Nelson for fighting for \nthese provisions in the commerce committee bill that got merged into \nthis package and all of the staff on both sides of the aisle in the \ncommerce committee who helped on this and Senator Boxer and Senator \nInhofe for including this.\n\n  I know that many times I ran into staff in the hall and they said: \nYes, we know, freight can't wait. Which is kind of a moniker that we \nhad come to talk about because freight really can't wait. If we are not \nshipping it in a timely fashion from North America, from the United \nStates, I guarantee to my colleagues that products will be delivered to \nAsia or to Europe from someplace else and we will lose business.\n  So I think the U.S. Congress and the Senate tonight has understood \nthat our infrastructure needs a shot in the arm to move freight and to \nestablish this policy I know is going to pay dividends for us. So thank \nyou very much for making sure that provision was in this legislation. \nIt is a very key moment for us looking at the fact that we are an \nexporter and that we want our products to reach markets in a timely \nfashion.\n  I also want to thank the Secretary of Transportation because he gets \nthis policy, and the national advisory committee that his predecessor \nestablished on freight will be very helpful for us in identifying the \nprojects and using the resources that are in this legislation to move \nforward.\n  I also want to say how happy and grateful I am that the resolution of \nthe Export-Import Bank debate is finally over tonight, and finally we \nhave resolved the fact that the Bank will be reauthorized for 4 years. \nThere are hundreds of millions of dollars of projects that need to be \napproved and they can hopefully start moving through the process.\n  I will point out that the Board needs nominees to fill the vacancies, \nand we should get that done so we can finish this process. But the fact \nthat we are making a commitment for 4 years to the strategy that, yes, \nwe want to manufacture products and, yes, we want to build things and \nship them to overseas markets--whether they are grain silos, whether \nthey are airplanes, whether they are music stands, whether they are \ntractors--whatever they are, we want to build them and we want to reach \ndeveloping countries and international markets, and we are going to \nmake sure the credit agencies that assist bankers in finalizing those \ndeals exist, and we are making that commitment for 4 years.\n  So if there is anybody who has arrows in their back over that, I also \nthank them for continuing to fight to make sure we got through this \nprocess. My colleagues know that both a majority of people in the \nHouse--a majority of Republicans--supported this idea and finally got \ntheir voices heard through a discharge petition, and the majority of \nthe U.S. Senate supported this position.\n  So I hope people who have allowed this process to finally take place \nwill understand how valuable the freight provision and the export bank \nprovision is for us as a country to continue our export strategy.\n  Our strategy is to build great products and to sell them to a \ndeveloping world. Ninety-five percent of consumers are outside of the \nUnited States, so let's sell products, but we have to fix our \ninfrastructure to do it. We have to make sure that credit is available \nto do it, and we have to make sure we continue to move forward with the \nother policies that are going to help us with this strategy.\n  So, again, I want to say how grateful I am. I will tell my colleagues \nI don't think it is a perfect bill, but everybody here understands it \nis not a perfect bill. Again, I want to thank the Senator from \nCalifornia for her decision to take what is a challenging process and \npersevere on an investment strategy that--each and every one of us \nwould have written a different one, but at least it got us to this goal \nof making needed investment in critical infrastructure at a time that \nour country needs to be able to move products and get things to \ncustomers around the globe, and this will very much help in that \nprocess.\n  Again, I thank the staff on both committees, on both sides of the \naisle, and everybody who was involved in making these policies a \nreality.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I wish to address very briefly the \ncomments made by one of the Senators earlier about how bad this bill \nis.\n  I think it is important for us to understand that it shows us how \ndifficult a bill like this is because we are facing accusations, and it \nis the kind of thing that people would want to believe, but it is just \nnot true. We don't have the things that sound good. The Export-Import \nBank, that is something I had to swallow. I have opposed the Export-\nImport Bank every opportunity I have had for the last 20 years.\n  Yet this is a huge bill. This is the largest bill in 17 years. The \nmost important part of this to me is those who criticize it fail to \nrealize that when we take an oath of office, we hold up our hand--every \nSenator does--to uphold the Constitution of the United States. It says \nin the Constitution, the only two things that we are mandated to do in \narticle I section 8 is to defend America and roads and bridges.\n  Ever since 1956, when Eisenhower came and did the national bill, the \nNational Highway System, it has been successful, but where we have \ndropped the ball is we have been failing to have the Transportation \nreauthorization bill. We take into consideration all of the things that \nwe are supposed to do, and these are things that we are supposed to do \nin accordance with the Constitution.\n  It is easy for me to say this because I have been ranked the most \nconservative Member many times and probably more than anyone else, but \nI recognize that we do have this responsibility.\n  Having said that, let me just say that I agree with the comments that \nwere made by the majority leader and by Senator Boxer. She and I have \ndisagreed more than we have agreed on things, but we have gone through \na couple of these bills together and people look at us and think, If \nboth of them want to do this, there must be something good about them.\n  So I have enjoyed working with Senator Boxer. It has been my honor to \ndo it. We have actually shocked a lot of people with how well we get \nalong. That is not going to happen after this bill, but it did before.\n  So let me just say this. I wish to thank some people. I appreciate \nthe fact that the Senator from Wyoming recognizes his staff. I look \naround here and I see these two guys. They were up more nights all \nnight long than they were sleeping all night long, and this is for a \nlong period of time. We have been working on this for a long period of \ntime. It is the result of months and months of really hard work.\n  In particular I want to thank our EPW team of Alex Herrgott, who was \ntrying to drive this thing, and Shant Boyajian, one who does maybe the \nhardest part, the actual road part; he is the expert that pulled that \nthrough. We also had Chaya Koffman, Susan Bodine, Jennie Wright, Andrew \nNeely, Donelle Harder, Daisy Letendre, and Kristina Baum.\n  And Senator Boxer's team: David Napoliello, whom I really enjoyed \nworking with. This is funny. I could talk to David just as I talk to \none of our people here. We all have the same concerns, and so it makes \nit easier. I\n\n[[Page S8369]]\n\nalso thank Andrew Dohrman and Jason Albritton. I would include so many \nothers, but I see that Senator Boxer is still here, and I would like to \njust conclude right now. I know Senator Boxer wants to recognize some \nof the people that worked so hard in her shop, and we worked with a lot \nof people.\n  I will yield to Senator Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am so relieved we voted on a 5-year, \nfully-funded surface transportation bill that increases funding for our \nhighway and transit programs. This is a monumental accomplishment for \nus all. The Environment and Public Works Committee has led the way to \nachieving the longest surface transportation bill that this country has \nseen in 17 years, which is essential for jobs, for our safety, and for \nour economic standing in the world.\n  This bill, which passed the House by a vote of 359 to 65, will \nprovide the certainty that our States and local governments need to \nplan and construct improvements to the Nation's surface transportation \nsystem. It will support millions of jobs and thousands of businesses. \nOur bill has the support of a broad coalition of labor, business, and \ngovernment organizations, including the AFL-CIO, Transportation Trades \nDepartment of the AFL-CIO, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Americans for \nTransportation Mobility Coalition, Teamsters, Transportation \nConstruction Coalition, American Road and Transportation Builders \nAssociation, National Association of Counties, U.S. Conference of \nMayors, National Conference of State Legislatures, National Governors \nAssociation, National Association of Manufacturers, American Trucking \nAssociations, Highway Materials Group, Associated General Contractors, \nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation, American Traffic Safety Services \nAssociation, Transport Workers Union, American Society of Civil \nEngineers, International Union of Operating Engineers, Amalgamated \nTransit Union, United Steelworkers, Leadership Conference on Civil and \nHuman Rights, Coalition for America's Gateways and Trade Corridors, and \nAmerican Association of Port Authorities.\n  The FAST Act is a comprehensive bill that, among other things, \nmodernizes federal highway and transit programs, motor carrier and \nvehicle safety programs, and includes a passenger rail authorization. \nWe should also not forget that it reauthorizes the Export-Import Bank, \nwhich is so important for jobs and our economic competitiveness.\n  It was a mammoth task to put this bill together and it has been a \nroller coaster ride from day one. I am pleased that this entire process \nwas jump-started when my dear friend Jim Inhofe, who has been my \npartner on many infrastructure issues, worked with me to pass a highway \nbill out of the EPW Committee on June 24 by a unanimous 20-0 vote. I \ntruly believe that it was our overwhelming bipartisan vote that set the \nstage and built momentum for this bill to begin moving through the \nSenate.\n  I also want to thank Chairman Shuster and Congressman DeFazio in the \nHouse. They led a strong bipartisan effort in the House of \nRepresentatives which allowed us to go to conference with the wind at \nour back, and while it was never an easy negotiation and neither side \ngot everything that they wanted, I think we are all pleased with the \noutcome. I want to thank all the members of the conference committee, \nwith a special thanks to Senators Durbin and Nelson, who are strong \nsupporters of the conference report.\n  Let me highlight a few things in this bill that I am so proud of:\n  The bill creates and significantly funds two new programs: No. 1, the \nNational Highway Freight Program, which will improve goods movement; \nand No. 2, the Nationally Significant Freight and Highway Projects \nProgram, a competitive grants program to support major projects.\n  It provides $199 million to help commuter railroads install positive \ntrain control. It includes the Raechel and Jaqueline Houck Safe Rental \nCar Act, to protect consumers from leasing unsafe recalled rental \nvehicles. This cause has been incredibly important to me. I have worked \ntirelessly to get this safety provision into law. It will save lives in \nthe future and is an example of the positive things we can do to \nprevent families from suffering from tragedies resulting from defective \nrental cars in the future.\n  I have been working for years to pass a long-term transportation \nbill, because our Nation's aging infrastructure needs robust investment \nto keep us competitive in the global marketplace. Our country has over \n61,000 structurally deficient bridges and 50 percent of our Nation's \nroads are in less than good condition. More than 30,000 people die from \ntraffic accidents each year.\n  The passage of MAP-21, for which I chaired the conference committee \nin 2012, provided 2 years of certainty and made key innovations for \ntransportation.\n  Now, the FAST Act, which increases highway and transit funding, will \nenable our State and local governments to make new investments to \nimprove our roads, bridges, and transit systems, which will improve \nsafety, increase mobility, and keep goods moving efficiently. Improving \nour transportation infrastructure should not be a partisan issue, and I \nthank Leader McConnell and Senator Inhofe for working closely with me \nto do the right thing for our country.\n  This entire process has been about trust, teamwork, and persistence, \nand I couldn't be more proud of what we have accomplished.\n  I would like to thank all of the staff that played an important role \nin this bill. As I have said, getting to this point has been a process \nthat would make the workings of a sausage factory look appealing in \ncomparison.\n  Mr. President, I know it is late, and I know we are all exhausted, \nbut you have to mark a moment. I think this bill was such a monumental \neffort and the staffs that we are mentioning--Senator Inhofe is right--\nthey were working constantly. The reason I know is that I called them \nconstantly.\n  Senator Inhofe is right again. I called my staff; I called his staff; \nI called Senator Thune's staff. I called everybody's staff. Right? I \ndrove them crazy.\n  One time my little granddaughter was there, and I was getting into a \nbit of an altercation with a Member from the House, and I whispered to \nmy granddaughter: Tell him to help your grandmother.\n  She got on the phone and said: Please help my grandmother. She had no \nidea.\n  The gentleman on the other end said: Oh, boy, you are tough. OK. We \ngot through that night all right.\n  I am going to also thank the House family who helped us write the \nSafe Rental Car Act.\n  In closing, I am going to read these names on my team: Bettina \nPoirier, David Napoliello, Andrew Dohrmann, Tyler Rushforth, Jason \nAlbritton, Ted Illston, Mary Kerr, Kate Gilman, Colin MacCarthy, and \nKathryn Bacher.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S8369, December 3, 2015, in the middle of the third \ncolumn, the following language appears: . . .

Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute today to Governor \nOlene Walker, a woman beloved in my home State of Utah and regarded \nacross the\n\n[[Page S8370]]\n\nNation as a model of civility and selfless service. Governor Walker \npassed away last Saturday from causes incident to age. In her 85 years \nof life, she led with compassion and humility, earning the respect and \nadmiration of everyone she served.\n  Governor Walker's life was one of humble service, and her modest \nbackground made her rise in politics all the more impressive. Raised in \nrural Utah, she developed her trademark work ethic on the family farm \nand spent much of her childhood milking cows, hauling hay, and \nharvesting sugar beets. Both as a young woman working in her family's \nfields and as a Governor serving the people of Utah, no task was ever \nbelow Olene--she was always willing to do whatever was necessary to get \nthe job done and to help those in need.\n  As a State legislator, a Lieutenant Governor, and a Governor, Olene \nwas steadfast in her commitment to help society's most vulnerable, \nespecially small children. Her work in the area of health care reform \nprecipitated the establishment of our State's Children Health Insurance \nProgram, which helps provide medical insurance for Utah's \nunderprivileged youth. After becoming Utah's first female Governor, she \ncontinued her advocacy for children by championing education reform.\n  Governor Walker's Read With a Child Early Literacy Initiative was \nessential to her reform efforts. This program sought to improve \nchildhood literacy by encouraging parents to read with their kids for \nat least 20 minutes every day. The initiative's focus on the family \nspeaks to a simple truth: meaningful societal change doesn't begin in \nthe bustling chambers of Congress but in the quiet solitude of the \nhome, through the daily interactions between parent and child. As a \nformer homemaker and as a mother of seven, Olene understood that \nhealthy homes lead to a healthy society. This belief influenced many of \nher pro-family policies as Governor.\n  Perhaps more than anyone I know, Governor Walker exemplified the \nteaching that the greatest among us is the servant of all. She often \neschewed the trappings of public office and even refused to use a \ndriver. After leaving the Governorship, Olene volunteered to serve as \nthe primary president for her local church congregation. This humble \nposition was a significant departure from her role as Utah's chief \nexecutive. Instead of negotiating with legislators and managing State \nagencies, Olene led dozens of little children in song and prayer, \nteaching them about the words of Christ and his early apostles. Anyone \npreoccupied with prestige or positions of power would surely consider \nthis new responsibility a demotion, but Olene wasn't one of those \npeople. She never concerned herself with titles, standing, or \nprominence; she cared only about serving others in whatever capacity \nshe could.\n  And she served until the very end. Even after retiring from office, \nOlene remained in the public sphere and continued to advocate for \neducation reform. She was also active in ecclesiastical service and \nwould eventually serve a 2-year mission in New York City for the Church \nof Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. She was equally engaged in \nacademia and was instrumental in establishing the Olene S. Walker \nInstitute of Politics and Public Service at Weber State University. In \naddition to hosting public forums, the institute helps students find \njobs and internships in government and encourages women to become \ninvolved in politics.\n  Through her trailblazing example, Governor Walker leaves a legacy of \nleadership that is sure to inspire generations of young Americans. With \nher passing, we have lost not only an exemplary stateswoman but also a \nloving mother and a friend. I am deeply grateful for my association \nwith Olene Walker. I consider myself lucky to have known Olene and even \nluckier to have served alongside her. Elaine and I send our deepest \ncondolences to the Walker family. May God comfort them, and may He \ncomfort all of us as we mourn the loss of an exceptional woman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/senate-section/article/S8370-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8370-S8371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ROBERT STIVERS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to recognize a good friend of \nmine and the Kentucky Senate president, Robert Stivers, for the honor \nhe recently received of being named one of the country's top nine \npublic officials of the year by Governing magazine. Senator Stivers \ncertainly deserves this recognition, as he has led the Kentucky Senate \nadmirably since his elevation to the president's post in 2013.\n  Senator Stivers has served in the Kentucky Senate since 1997. He \nrepresents the 25th District in eastern Kentucky, which includes parts \nof Clay, Knox, Lee, Owsley, Whitley, and Wolfe Counties. Like myself, \nRobert is a proud graduate of both the University of Kentucky and the \nUniversity of Louisville. Before becoming senate president in 2013, he \nserved as the senate's majority floor leader from 2009 to 2012.\n  Senator Stivers is perfectly suited for his leadership role, as he is \na man who naturally knows how to build consensus and coalitions. He \nremains a practicing attorney in his hometown of Manchester and is \nfinely tuned in to the needs of his constituents. The Clay County \nChamber of Commerce honored Senator Stivers with its Man of the Year \naward in 2000. In 2002 he received both the AARP Appreciation Award and \nthe Kentucky River Lincoln Club Outstanding Service Award.\n  Senator Stivers was recognized as one of the top public officials in \nthe country because he has led the Kentucky Senate to pass some very \nimportant measures, including a bill to address the growing scourge of \nheroin and prescription pain pill abuse in our State. That is an issue \nI have followed closely over the years, and I can attest firsthand that \nSenator Stivers has been a real champion in working to find a solution.\n  Senator Stivers also led the senate to pass a measure providing \nfunding for a new cancer research center at the University of Kentucky. \nThis new facility will prove to be of immeasurable benefit to the \npeople of Kentucky and also helps establish the University of Kentucky \nas one of the region's top research universities, which will attract \nmore talent and funding to the Commonwealth.\n  I would ask all of my colleagues to join me in congratulating \nKentucky Senate President Robert Stivers on this honor, and I thank him \nfor his service to the people of our State. Those of us in Kentucky who \nhave watched him at work have known for a long time that he is a \ntalented and energetic legislator. And he is a great public servant on \nbehalf of the people of Kentucky.\n  The Lexington Herald-Leader recently published an article detailing \nSenator Stivers' recognition by Governing magazine. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, Nov. 17, 2015]\n\n Magazine Names Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers a Top Public \n                           Official in Nation\n\n                           (By Jack Brammer)\n\n       Frankfort--Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers has \n     been named one of the country's nine public officials of the \n     year by Governing magazine.\n       Stivers, R-Manchester, was nominated for the award by the \n     magazine's editors. The magazine has honored individual state \n     and local government officials for their accomplishments \n     every year since 1994.\n       The publication commends Stivers for his bipartisan work \n     since assuming the role of Senate president in 2013.\n       Landmark legislation that has passed during Stivers' \n     presidency include bills to address abuse of prescription \n     drugs and heroin, and providing funding for a new cancer \n     research center at the University of Kentucky.\n       ``It is an honor to receive this award on behalf of our \n     work in the legislature,'' Stivers said in a statement. ``We \n     are fortunate to have so many dedicated servants in the \n     Kentucky General Assembly who were willing to put aside \n     politics and do what was best for the Commonwealth of \n     Kentucky. While there is still plenty of work to be done, I \n     am very thankful to my colleagues and staff for their work on \n     significant pieces of legislation. It has been a great \n     year.''\n       Stivers was appointed this year as the incoming chairman of \n     the Southern Legislative Conference, which is to hold its \n     annual meeting in Lexington in 2016. Stivers also will be \n     chairman of the Council on State Governments in 2018.\n       Stivers will travel to Washington, D.C., next month to \n     receive the award. He represents the 25th District, which \n     encompasses Clay, Knox, Lee, Owsley, Whitley and Wolfe \n     counties.\n\n[[Page S8371]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/senate-section/article/S8371-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n          RECOGNIZING THE LAS VEGAS LATIN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the 40th anniversary of \nthe Las Vegas Latin Chamber of Commerce.\n  Since its inception, the Latin Chamber of Commerce has been a \nchampion for the Hispanic business community in Nevada. In working to \nfulfill its mission of promoting the success of its members and the \nmore than 18,000 Hispanic-owned small businesses in the Silver State, \nthe chamber is driving growth in Nevada and enriching the U.S. economy. \nBy cultivating positive business, cultural, and educational \nrelationships and expanding opportunities for Latino businessowners, \nthe Latin Chamber of Commerce has ensured the success of hundreds of \nnew businesses and transformed the very fabric of southern Nevada.\n  The Latin Chamber of Commerce was founded nearly four decades ago by \na handful of determined individuals who were seeking the resources and \nsupport necessary to realize their personal and professional goals. \nUnder the leadership of Arturo Cambeiro, the organization's first \npresident, the chamber developed the foundation needed to become a \nleading advocate for Hispanic-owned businesses and Latino \nentrepreneurs. Today, the Latin Chamber of Commerce has grown to \ninclude more than 1,500 members throughout the Silver State, making it \none of the largest organizations of its kind in the country. I applaud \nthe Latin Chamber of Commerce for its 40th anniversary of dedicated \nservice to the Hispanic community. The chamber's work is truly \nappreciated and admired.\n  I also commend the leadership of the Latin Chamber of Commerce, \nparticularly Mr. Otto Merida and Ms. Victoria Napoles-Earl. Their \ntireless commitment to the Latino business community has played a \ncritical role in the growth and success of the chamber. For the last 40 \nyears, Mr. Merida has dedicated his work to developing and expanding \nthe presence of the Latin Chamber of Commerce in southern Nevada. He \nhas worked hard to fulfill the Chamber's mission and led the \norganization with the highest standards, currently serving as the \norganization's chief executive officer. Ms. Napoles-Earl joined the \nchamber in 1987 and recently announced her retirement after 30 years of \nservice. I would like to congratulate her on her upcoming retirement \nand career accomplishments. From starting as the chamber's office \nmanager to becoming its senior vice president, Ms. Napoles-Earl has \ndedicated her career to investing in Latino-owned businesses. During \ntheir distinguished careers, Mr. Merida and Ms. Napoles-Earl have \nsuccessfully secured millions of dollars in funding for Latino \nbusinessowners, including grants, loans, and contracts. On behalf of \nthe chamber and the thousands of Hispanic-owned businesses in Nevada, \nMr. Merida and Ms. Napoles-Earl have effectively advocated for policies \nthat help Latino entrepreneurs start and expand their business.\n  In addition to their roles at the Latin Chamber of Commerce, Mr. \nMerida and Ms. Napoles are active members in the community and have \nheld various leadership positions at the State and local levels. Mr. \nMerida has worked for the State of Nevada's Department of Education, \nserved as chair of the Las Vegas Housing Authority, and was appointed \nto the Nevada Commission on Economic Development. Ms. Napoles-Earl has \nserved as a commissioner for the Nevada Commission on Minority Affairs \nand on the board of directors of Dignity Health's St. Rose Dominican \nHospitals. I have had the honor and privilege of working closely with \nMr. Merida and Ms. Napoles-Earl throughout my time in Congress, and I \ncan say without reservation that the Hispanic business community in \nNevada is fortunate to have them working on its behalf. You will be \nhard pressed to find more effective advocates.\n  As the Latin Chamber of Commerce begins its next chapter, I wish them \ncontinued success for years to come and thank them for supporting the \neconomic growth and development of Latino entrepreneurs for 40 years \nand counting.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/senate-section/article/S8371-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF NORTHERN NEW \n                                ENGLAND\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this week, Planned Parenthood of Northern \nNew England marked its 50th anniversary with a well-attended gathering \nin South Burlington, VT. The event came less than a week after the \ndeadly tragedy at a Planned Parenthood center in Colorado. The weight \nof that tragedy, more than 2,500 miles away from Vermont, was evident \nas those in the crowd bowed their heads in a moment of silence as the \nnames of victims were read. But this South Burlington gathering also \nillustrated the depth of support for an organization that plays a \ncritical role in health care for women of all ages throughout Vermont, \nthroughout New England, and throughout our country.\n  The Planned Parenthood Association of Vermont began in 1965 when a \nsmall but active band of women gathered at the Unitarian Church in \nBurlington. Within the next 3 years, Maine and New Hampshire also \nestablished family planning centers, and by the mid-1980s, Planned \nParenthood of Northern New England was formed.\n  In 2014 alone, Planned Parenthood centers around Vermont provided \nvital primary and preventive services to over 16,000 patients. In a \nrural State like Vermont, the need for health care providers in remote \nareas is acute. More than 90 percent of Vermont's Planned Parenthood \ncenters are located in rural or medically underserved areas. Many \nVermonters describe Planned Parenthood as their primary source of \nhealth care. In just one example, without the services that Planned \nParenthood provides, thousands of low-income women in Vermont would \nlose their ability to have regular cancer screenings that could save \ntheir lives.\n  Over five decades, Planned Parenthood has weathered many challenges \nthat include ensuring the safety of its own health care providers. In \nthe aftermath of 9/11, more than 500 anthrax threat letters were sent \nto Planned Parenthood locations and other reproductive health care \nproviders; yet it seems unimaginable that we are here in December 2015, \nin the U.S. Senate, once again debating whether to defund an \norganization that does so much to ensure the health and well-being of \nwomen across the country.\n  In August I spoke in opposition to this misguided, distortion-filled, \npartisan effort. I said at the time that the issue was unfortunately \nall too familiar. With the critical issues that face us today, why are \nwe spending our time and energy on this ideologically driven effort to \nbar funding for women's health centers? I am saddened that we are even \ntalking about this provision today, not even 1 week since a gunman \nstormed that Planned Parenthood in Colorado and caused such carnage. \nThis is shameful, and it is cynical. It is time for the mean-spirited \nassault on women's health care to end.\n  I was heartened by the supporters, both women and men, who turned out \nto mark the 50th anniversary of Planned Parenthood of Northern New \nEngland this week in South Burlington. They included the next \ngeneration of young women who have been ``passed the torch'' to stand \nup for their rights to health care and reproductive freedom. They are \ncommitted to making sure Planned Parenthood will be around for another \n50 years--and they give me hope. Let us not turn our backs on them by \nturning back the clock.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/senate-section/article/S8371-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8371-S8372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SUPPORTING THE COFFEE FARMERS IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, like many Senators, I have followed the \nappalling situation facing citizens of the Eastern Congo, where armed \ngroups have fought for years over control of minerals and territory, \npillaging, raping, and killing civilians in the process.\n  The innocent people who struggle to survive in the midst of this \nviolence and destruction rely on subsistence agriculture, as well as \nraising crops for export; yet their own government makes it doubly \ndifficult.\n  For decades, coffee was an important agricultural export from Eastern \nCongo. But after years of armed conflict, official coffee exports have \nreportedly decreased by over 80 percent from peak levels 30 years ago. \nThe majority of this coffee is produced by\n\n[[Page S8372]]\n\nsmallholder farmers, most of whom are women, and for whom coffee is a \nsignificant source of income.\n  Today a consortium, including the Eastern Congo Initiative, the \nHoward Buffett Foundation, and Starbucks Coffee Company, are trying to \nhelp Congolese farmers by revitalizing the industry. Needed \ninfrastructure has been built, a supply chain is in place, and \nAmerica's largest coffee company has provided a reliable buyer. This is \na welcome and worthwhile effort to improve the lives of people in rural \nCongolese communities that should have the support of the Congolese \nGovernment.\n  Despite this collective effort, Congolese coffee farmers are being \ncrippled by oppressive taxes that make their coffee uncompetitive in \nthe global marketplace. While Congo's official export tax rate is 0.25 \npercent, many export officials reportedly continue to levy taxes of 7.5 \npercent, which is the previous rate. In addition, there are often \ninformal tax levies that charge another 3 to 8 percent. These excessive \ntaxes force exporters to pay smallholder farmers less for their coffee, \nwith the result that farmers smuggle their crop into neighboring \ncountries. The livelihoods of these farmers and the success of the \nEastern Congo Initiative-Buffett-Starbucks joint venture are put at \nrisk by the Congolese Government's actions.\n  I want to yield to Senator Graham, who has traveled to Africa and \nobserved the challenges facing small farmers like those I have \nmentioned.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I want to thank my friend from Vermont with whom I have \nworked for years to help improve the lives of small farmers in Africa \nand elsewhere. The situation facing coffee farmers in the Eastern Congo \nshould concern all Senators, as there is an opportunity, thanks to the \nEastern Congo Initiative, the Buffett Foundation, and Starbucks, to \nsignificantly increase the income of people who have long struggled to \nget out of poverty. The Congolese Government should take immediate \nsteps to eliminate this unofficial tax rate and other specious \nfinancial charges that are jeopardizing the livelihoods of their own \npeople. The government must be part of the solution--and not the \nproblem--to Congo's myriad challenges.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator from South Carolina, the chairman of \nthe Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations, who chaired a hearing \nearlier this year when we heard compelling testimony about this \nsubject.\n  I ask my friend from Delaware, the former chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Africa, who has traveled to Africa many times, \nincluding this year with President Obama, to discuss how this situation \nin the Eastern Congo relates to the requirements of the African Growth \nand Opportunity Act.\n  Mr. COONS. I thank the Senator from Vermont for calling the Senate's \nattention to the challenges facing coffee producers in the Eastern \nCongo. The Congress passed the African Growth and Opportunity Act, \nAGOA, to advance economic growth and political stability in sub-Saharan \nAfrica. AGOA furthers these objectives by offering trade benefits to \ncountries that meet certain requirements, including commitments to \npolicies that alleviate poverty and reflect market based economic \nprinciples. Moreover, as part of this year's AGOA renewal, we included \nprovisions to enhance industries where African women are making strong \ncontributions. Since its inception, exports from AGOA countries to the \nUnited States have grown 300 percent. Agriculture is the largest \nemployer in Africa, and in the years to come, farming can play a key \nrole in accelerating exports even further and realizing the vision of \nAGOA.\n  To meet the standards of AGOA and gain eligibility, the Congolese \nGovernment must do away with the excessive export and other taxes \ncurrently being levied on its coffee farmers. Impeding the growth of \ntheir coffee industry and lowering the standard of living of their own \nfarmers is inconsistent with the language, intent, and spirit of AGOA. \nLowering this tax burden should be required before the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo is granted AGOA benefits.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the senior Senator from Vermont for his \nleadership on this issue. Last year, I had the privilege of leading the \nfirst all-women Senate delegation to sub-Saharan Africa to examine \nfood, agriculture, and the critical role women play in local economies. \nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United \nNations, nearly 50 percent of all the agricultural work in the region \nis done by women.\n  Yet, too often, women are not afforded equal opportunities to own \nproperty, earn an education, or participate in the political process. \nThat is why I was eager to lead two bipartisan provisions included in \nthe recent AGOA renewal. The first makes clear that we expect our \nAfrican trading partners to make progress toward establishing policies \nthat support men and women. And the second expands existing \nagricultural trade technical assistance programs at USDA and USAID and \nprioritizes outreach to organizations and sectors that support women.\n  At its core, AGOA is about creating the building blocks of an \nimproved trading relationship with sub-Saharan African nations. For the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, coffee production presents a critical \nexport opportunity. That is why we must insist that the Congolese \nGovernment addresses its inconsistent and burdensome export taxes on \ncoffee producers--most of whom are women--before regaining eligibility \nfor AGOA benefits. We have an opportunity to send a strong message to \nour African trading partners that we expect them to recognize how vital \nwomen are to the development of those nations' economies.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the senior Senator from Vermont for his \nleadership on this issue. Last year, I travelled to sub-Saharan Africa \nwith Senator Stabenow. In Africa, we saw firsthand that empowering \nwomen and girls as leaders in agriculture is important to promoting \neconomic development. When we returned, we fought to make sure \npromoting economic opportunities for women was an important aspect of \nrenewal of the African Growth and Opportunity Act.\n  Investing in women produces a good return on investment. According to \nthe U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, if women had the same \naccess to economic resources as men, this could increase agricultural \nproductivity by 20-30 percent.\n  The Congolese Government's export taxes on coffee producers have the \nopposite effect. It unfairly burdens women. It should be repealed \nbefore the Democratic Republic of the Congo receives any additional \nAGOA benefits.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I want to thank the Senator from South Carolina and the \nSenator from Vermont for their important work in improving United \nStates foreign assistance. I thank Senator Leahy for bringing this \nissue to our attention today. The Senator from Delaware and I have \nworked for years on the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on \nAfrican Affairs, and I look forward to continuing that work. Throughout \nour travels on the African continent, we have seen the beneficial \neffects of increased agriculture productivity and better access to \nmarkets, facilitated by U.S. economic development and trade preference \nprograms.\n  I am proud of our work to reauthorize the African Growth and \nOpportunity Act. We made it stronger, more accountable, and hopefully \nmore accessible to sub-Saharan African countries and their people. \nUnfortunately, Congo's ineligibility makes export opportunities more \ndifficult for Congolese businessmen and farmers. I echo my colleagues' \ncall on the Congolese Government to become more transparent and \nresponsive to the needs of its people.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as you can see, there is bipartisan support \nfor these coffee farmers who face oppressive economic constraints that \nlimit their ability to be competitive in the marketplace and earn a \ndecent living. I join my colleagues who have spoken on this issue today \nin urging the Congolese Government to address these concerns for the \nbenefit of its people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/senate-section/article/S8372-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8372-S8373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, section 4305 of S. Con. Res. 11, the \nconcurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2016, allows the \nchairman of the Senate Budget Committee to revise the allocations, \naggregates, and levels in the budget resolution for legislation related \nto health care reform. The authority to adjust is contingent on the \nlegislation not increasing the deficit over either the period of the \ntotal of fiscal years 2016-2020 or the period of the total of fiscal \nyears 2016-2025.\n  I find that Senate amendment 2916 fulfills the conditions of deficit \nneutrality found in section 4305 of S. Con. Res. 11. Accordingly, I am \nrevising the allocations to the Committee on Finance, the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions, HELP, and the budgetary \naggregates to account for the budget effects of the amendment. I am \nalso adjusting the unassigned to committee savings levels in the budget \nresolution to reflect that, while there are savings in the amendment \nattributable to both the HELP and Finance committees, the Congressional \nBudget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation are unable to produce \nunique estimates for each provision due to interactions and other \neffects that are estimated simultaneously.\n  The adjustments that I filed on Tuesday, December 2, 2015, are now \nvoid and replaced by these new adjustments.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide \ndetails about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            BUDGET AGGREGATES\n                      BUDGET AUTHORITY AND OUTLAYS\n  (Pursuant to Section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and\n Section 4305 of S.Con.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to pay \ntribute to a friend of mine, Patricia Geadelmann. Pat serves as special \nassistant to the president for board and governmental relations at the \nUniversity of Northern Iowa, my alma mater. Pat is retiring in January \nafter more than 43 years at the university.\n  She began her career teaching physical education and health at the \nMalcolm Price Laboratory School and achieved the rank of professor. \nSince 1984, she has served in the UNI administration under four \ndifferent presidents. In fact, in total, Pat has worked at UNI under 5 \nof the 10 presidents the university has had. Before that, she was an \nundergraduate student at the university.\n  Her experience and her knowledge of the University of Northern Iowa \nis unmatched. Needless to say, she has been an invaluable resource for \neach of the presidents she has served with and to the university as a \nwhole. In fact, it is hard to imagine UNI without her. I have worked \nwith Pat in her capacity as the head of government relations for the \nUniversity of Northern Iowa for most of my time in the Senate. With \nsomeone who has her level of knowledge and experience, you would be \ntempted to wonder whether she reports to the president or the president \nreports to her. But, if you know her, you know she is as unassuming as \nshe is dogged in her dedication to the university's best interests.\n  The University of Northern Iowa was lucky to have her, and on behalf \nof the UNI family, we are sorry to lose her. We wish her well in her \nnew ``retired'' career as minister of care and visitation at First \nPresbyterian Church in Waterloo.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/senate-section/article/S8373-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8373-S8374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MAYOR JIM HAGGERTON\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today with my colleague Senator Cantwell, \nI wish to commemorate Mayor Jim Haggerton for his 30 years of public \nservice. Mr. Haggerton first served the people of Tukwila, WA as a \nmember of the planning commission from 1985 to 1994 and thereafter as a \nmember of the city council from 1994 to 2007. Since 2008, Mr. Haggerton \nhas served as mayor of Tukwila. On December 31, Mr. Haggerton will \nretire after 30 years of service to Tukwila.\n  During his tenure, Mr. Haggerton has consistently provided \noutstanding leadership, kept the interests of the public at the \nforefront of his work, celebrated the city's diversity, and supported \nits neighborhoods, businesses, and residents. Mr. Haggerton \nsuccessfully spearheaded dozens of major development and public \ninfrastructure projects including the new Klickitat interchange, the \nTukwila South Development Agreement, opening the LINK Light Rail \nStation in Tukwila, the South Park Bridge, a permanent Tukwila Commuter \nRail and Amtrak Station, the Southcenter Parkway, and the redevelopment \nof Interurban Avenue. Mayor Haggerton fought to redevelop neglected and \ncrime-ridden property along Tukwila International Boulevard, which \nculminated in the Tukwila Village Development Agreement. Additionally, \nMr. Haggerton fiercely advocated to fund new crimefighting initiatives \nand led efforts to build sports and recreational facilities in Tukwila. \nThroughout his career, I was consistently impressed with Mayor \nHaggerton's commitment and contributions to the local community.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I join my colleague Senator Murray in \ncommemorating Mayor Haggerton's 30 years of public service. As mayor, \nMr. Haggerton led the effort to develop and adopt Tukwila's first \nstrategic plan,\n\n[[Page S8374]]\n\nproviding a clear vision for economic development in the city. Mayor \nHaggerton was also among the first to offer regional assistance to the \nOso, Arlington, and Darrington communities following the devastating \nState Route 530 mudslide in 2014. Throughout his tenure, Mayor \nHaggerton has served on multiple regional and national boards and \nalways carried out his job with a passion for and commitment to helping \nothers.\n  As our constituents in Washington State know, Mr. Haggerton had a \ngenuine interest in learning about the issues facing those he was \nelected to serve. He has been an integral leader in Tukwila and played \na critical role in shaping the city's history. I have no doubt that Mr. \nHaggerton's work in Tukwila and the greater Puget Sound region will \nhave a lasting impact on generations for years to come.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, together Senator Cantwell and I commend \nMayor Haggerton for his long-standing dedication to public service. \nOver the past 30 years, Mayor Haggerton has always been an unwavering \npartner for the citizens of Tukwila, available with a friendly smile \nand positive attitude. We express our sincere gratitude, respect, and \nappreciation to Mr. Jim Haggerton for his service to the city and \nresidents of Tukwila, South King County, and the State of Washington \nand for his friendship and partnership as we have worked with him in \nWashington, DC, on behalf of the people of the great State of \nWashington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/senate-section/article/S8374-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DANIEL J. JONES\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to praise today the work of Mr. \nDaniel Jones, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee staff, who \nis leaving the Senate tomorrow.\n  Many of us enter public service for the simple goal of making a \ndifference. After knowing Dan for 9 years, I can say that he is one of \nthe few people working here on Capitol Hill who has helped make \nhistory. Without his indefatigable work on the Intelligence Committee \nstaff, the Senate report on the CIA's Detention and Interrogation \nProgram would not have been completed, nor would its executive summary \nhave been released to the public, an effort that led to the recent \npassage of critically important and long overdue anti-torture \nlegislation.\n  Dan came to the Intelligence Committee in January 2007 from the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, where he served as an intelligence \nanalyst. In his first 2 years on the staff, he played a key role in \noverseeing counterterrorism efforts and the FBI's transition from a \npure law enforcement agency to an intelligence agency--a transition \nthat has proven instrumental to the Bureau's ability to identify and \nthwart numerous terrorist attacks over the past several years.\n  However, his service and focus shifted following the revelation in \nDecember 2007 that the CIA had previously destroyed interrogation \nvideotapes that showed the brutal treatment and questioning of two \ndetainees, Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri. Then-Chairman Jay \nRockefeller assigned Dan and fellow staffer Alissa Starzak to review \nthe CIA cables describing those interrogation sessions. For the next \nseveral months, Dan worked at his full-time job at the committee while \nalso working nights and weekends at CIA headquarters, poring through \nthe cables.\n  The report that he and Alissa produced in early 2009 was graphic, and \nit was shocking. It demonstrated in documented fact and in the CIA's \nown words treatment by the U.S. Government that stood in contrast to \nour values and to what the committee had previously been led to \nbelieve. The report sparked a comprehensive investigation by the \ncommittee, with a 14-1 vote in March 2009, that Dan led and then saw \nthrough to its completion.\n  While carrying out the investigation into the CIA program, Dan also \nco-led the committee's investigation into the attempted bombing of \nNorthwest Flight 253 over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009 by Umar Farouk \nAbdulmutallab. Five months later, the committee produced a bipartisan \nreport that found 14 specific points of failure that resulted in \nAbdulmutallab being able to board the flight and attempt to detonate \nhis explosive device at the direction of al-Qaida in the Arabian \nPeninsula. The report also made both classified and unclassified \nrecommendations to improve our counterterrorism efforts.\n  But back to the investigation on the CIA Detention and Interrogation \nProgram--to say that Dan worked diligently on this study is a gross \nunderstatement. He, along with other committee staff, worked day and \nnight, often 7 days a week, from 2009 through December 2012. He became \nan expert in one of the most unfortunate activities in the history of \nour intelligence community, going through more than 6 million pages of \nmaterials produced for the study, as well as immersing himself in the \nanti-torture provisions in U.S. law, as well as human rights materials, \nand the background of other similar historic Senate investigations. \nThroughout this period, Dan regularly briefed me on the team's \nfindings. Each time, I noted the obvious toll that this was taking on \nhim physically, but he always remained committed to concluding the \nreport.\n  From the end of 2012 through the end of 2014, Dan stewarded the \nreport through two bipartisan committee votes, a lengthy period of \nreview and meetings with the CIA, and an 8-month long redaction review \nleading to the release of the executive summary of the study on \nDecember 9, 2014. He then played a key role in enacting reforms \nfollowing the release of the executive summary, in particular the \npassage of a provision in this year's National Defense Authorization \nAct that will prevent the future use of coercive interrogation \ntechniques or indefinite, secret detention in the future.\n  While Dan is known most for his leadership on the CIA detention and \ninterrogation review, his public service doesn't end there. Before his \nFederal service, Dan taught for Teach for America in an inner-city \nschool in Baltimore, MD, and he has served on the board of his alma \nmater, Elizabethtown College. His dedication to service is also \ndemonstrated by his two master's degrees, a master's of public policy \nfrom the Kennedy School of Government and a master's of arts in \nteaching from Johns Hopkins.\n  I want to use this opportunity to thank Dan Jones for his \nindispensable work over the past 9 years and to wish him the very best \nas he moves on to future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/senate-section/article/S8374-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO LEFFRICH ``TIM'' MAYO, SR.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS: Mr. President, today I wish to say goodbye to one of \nthe great members of the staff of this institution, Leffrich ``Tim'' \nMayo, an exceptional individual with a deep devotion to the Senate, who \nretired from service on December 3, 2015, after over 35 years of \nservice.\n  Tim, who some called ``Mayo'', began working at the U.S. Capitol in \nMay of 1979 as a bus boy in the Senators dining room on the \nrecommendation of a friend, the late Lawrence Green. Following that \nposition, he held many positions in the Russell Building coffee shop, \nSenate labor division, and finally in the Architect of the Capitol's \nfurniture division.\n  Tim really enjoyed working with Senators and their staff. He was \nexceptional at finding the perfect pieces of furniture that would fit \nthe needs of Members and staff alike. If he knew you were looking for \nsomething in particular, he would search the warehouses until he found \nit. He knew every office and their styles and needs.\n  Tim would always greet you with a smile and a big hello. He was \nwilling to help others no matter what the task or situation. Nothing \nwas too challenging or difficult for him. He got great pleasure out of \nmeeting new staff, visitors, and people from all over the world.\n  We will all miss Tim's smiling face and eager assistance in the Halls \nof the Senate, but also wish him the best as he moves on to bigger and \nbetter things in his retirement.

His wife, Sharon, long served as his primary round-the-\nclock caretaker and was confined to their home due to Rick's condition, \nwhich required an external ventilator to breathe at all times. \nEventually his needs surpassed his ability to stay home, and he had to \nmove into a long-term care facility.\n  While Rick was still at home, the Rosebud Health Care Center, RHCC, \nfacility initiated a contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs, \nVA, to be able to provide care and services to veterans in its long-\nterm care unit. The previous aging and resource center for Rosebud \nCounty was in Glendive, MT, about 1 hour and 40 minutes away from \nRick's home in Forsyth, MT. Thankfully, RHCC received approval from the \nVA to provide care services close to home for Rick on November 1, 2015.\n  Rick's persistence and advocacy throughout his illness helped serve \nas the catalyst for RHCC establishing a contract with the VA that \nallows for veterans to receive long-term care in Forsyth. Our State has \none of the largest populations of veterans per capita, and Rick's \nefforts have led the VA to create additional resources to help to \nprovide health care services to Montana's extensive veteran population.\n  I am so proud to have advocates like Rick and Sharon fighting for \nveterans in Montana. Through his inspiring work to increase veterans' \naccess to care, Rick Young has created an unmatchable legacy that will \nleave a lasting mark on our State. Keep fighting, Rick. I am rooting \nfor you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/senate-section/article/S8375-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MAYOR JOE RILEY\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to speak today about Mayor \nJoe Riley, who is retiring after decades of service to the people of \nCharleston, SC.\n  Simply put, Joe Riley is one of the best mayors in America and a \nliving legend in South Carolina political history. He is a hard-\nworking, dedicated public servant who has spent most of his adult life \nserving the people of Charleston. I have never known anyone who loves \ntheir job more than he.\n  Years ago, Mayor Riley came into office with a vision for Charleston, \nbut like all great leaders, he understood he couldn't do it alone. He \nwent to work doing what he does best--bringing people together for the \ncommon good.\n  Now, as he retires from serving as mayor of the city he loves, the \nrevitalization of this historic city is absolutely stunning. Thanks to \nhis years of service, Charleston is now recognized as one of the best \ndestinations to visit, not only in the United States but in the world.\n  Joe Riley will go down in history as a transformative mayor who \nturned his vision for Charleston into reality. We are all better \nbecause of his service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/senate-section/article/S8375-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PAUL KOESTER\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Paul \nKoester on his retirement after over 41 years of service to the U.S. \nAir Force. It gives me great pleasure to recognize his years of \ndedication to protecting our country and our State.\n  Mr. Koester grew up in Colorado Springs, CO, and later enlisted in \nthe U.S. Air Force in 1974 with the intention of serving 4 years as a \njet engine mechanic. During his time in basic training, he decided to \nchange course and test to become a pararescue airman. After \nsuccessfully passing his training, he spent the next 4 years at \nElmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska as part of the 71st Aerospace Rescue \nand Recovery Squadron. During his time serving in this squadron, he was \ncredited with saving over 75 lives.\n  From 1980 to 1986, Mr. Koester served at McClellan Air Force Base in \nCalifornia and Little Rock Air Force Base in Arkansas. He soon after \ndecided to join the Air National Guard. For the next 16 years, Mr. \nKoester served in the 102nd Rescue Squadron at Francis S. Gabreski Air \nNational Guard Base in New York. On September 11, 2001, Mr. Koester and \nhis squadron assisted as first responders during the collapse of the \nWorld Trade Center, aiding in saving the lives of many victims of the \nattack. His bravery and selflessness during this time of crisis will \nnever be forgotten.\n  Three weeks later, Mr. Koester was deployed to the border of Kuwait \nand Iraq to serve as part of Operation Southern Watch. Following his \nreturn from this mission, Mr. Koester made the decision to resume \nActive Duty and was sent to Nellis Air Force Base in 2003 as part of \nthe 58th Rescue Squadron. He concluded his service with this unit after \n12 years of service. At his 60th birthday celebration, Mr. Koester was \nrecognized as the oldest enlisted member actively serving in the Air \nForce and the longest serving pararescue airman with 13 deployments \nthroughout his career. Our country and the Silver State are fortunate \nto have had someone of such dedication serving to protect our freedoms.\n  As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have had no \ngreater honor than the opportunity to engage with the men and women who \nserved in our Nation's military. I recognize Congress has a \nresponsibility not only to honor the brave individuals who serve our \nNation, but also to ensure they are cared for when they return home. I \nremain committed to upholding this promise for veterans like Mr. \nKoester in Nevada and throughout the Nation.\n  Mr. Koester has demonstrated professionalism, commitment to \nexcellence, and dedication to the highest standards of the U.S. Air \nForce. I am proud to call him a fellow Nevadan, and I ask my colleagues \nto join me today in recognizing Mr. Koester for his years of service \nand in congratulating him on his retirement. I wish him well in all of \nhis future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/senate-section/article/S8375-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONGRATULATING BILL LANDON\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Bill \nLandon on receiving the 2015 Air and Surface Transport Nurses \nAssociation Lynn Stevens Excellence in Safety Award. It gives me great \npleasure to see him receive this prestigious award after years of hard \nwork within northern Nevada.\n  In 1998, Mr. Landon began his air ambulance career in Greeley, CO. In \n2003, he joined Care Flight in Reno and has since served as safety and \ntraining coordinator and flight paramedic. During his time at Care \nFlight, he has been a key contributor in the founding of a formalized \nsafety committee, which meets twice a month and is comprised of medical \nflight staff pilots, air communication specialists, managers, and \nmaintenance personnel. This important committee, chaired by Mr. Landon, \nworks to review, develop, and implement safety initiatives for Care \nFlight and those that it serves. As chair, Mr. Landon spearheads \nimportant safety trainings, including an annual training for hospital \nemergency departments, pre-hospital agencies, and ski patrols servicing \na 40,000 square mile area. His unwavering dedication to Care Flight in \nReno has helped provide hundreds of hours of safety and medical \ntraining needed to save lives throughout northern Nevada. His work for \nour State is invaluable.\n  The Lynn Steven's Excellence in Safety Award goes to individuals who \nhave gone above and beyond in the transportation community to promote \nsafety awareness. This accolade is truly prestigious and attained by \nonly the most influential members in this community. Since 1981, Care \nFlight has served northern Nevada's health organizations as an \nimportant resource for transportation with flight paramedics and pilots \nto respond to a variety of medical emergencies. Our State is fortunate \nto have someone like Mr. Landon serving Care Flight and its safety \ninitiatives.\n  Throughout his tenure, Mr. Landon has demonstrated professionalism, \ncommitment to excellence, and dedication to his trade. I am honored by \nhis service and am proud to call him a fellow Nevadan. Today, I ask all \nof my colleagues to join me in congratulating Mr. Landon on receiving \nthis award, and I extend my deepest appreciation for all that he has \ndone for many across northern Nevada. I offer him my best wishes in his \nrole as safety and training coordinator in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/senate-section/article/S8375-4", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8375-S8376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO KRISTI BLACKLER\n\n Mr. ROUNDS.

JOHN A. KNAUSS\n\n Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, recently the oceans lost one of \ntheir greatest champions. With the passing of Dr. John A. Knauss, Rhode \nIsland has lost a beloved teacher, a visionary leader, and a brilliant \nscientist. We will all miss him a great deal.\n  John's accomplishments are too many to list, but I will note a few.\n  In 1966, Dr. Knauss was named to the Commission on Marine Science, \nEngineering, and Resources, where he and his colleagues recommended \nthat Congress form a new and independent Federal agency to advance \nmarine and atmospheric sciences and better understand our oceans, \ncoastlines, and Great Lakes. That agency became the National Oceanic \nand Atmospheric Administration, which conducts some of the most \nimportant ocean science in the world and where John served as \nAdministrator from 1989 to 1993.\n  Along with Rhode Island Senator Claiborne Pell and Dr. Athelstan \nSpilhaus, Dr. Knauss developed the National Sea Grant College Program. \nTheir model was the country's land grant college system--century-old \ncenters of learning that promote better use of America's vast resources \nof land. Pell and Knauss thought that surely our oceans and Great Lakes \nneeded a similar network of institutions to conduct coastal and marine \nscience and promote conservation of such important natural assets.\n  Congress agreed. In 2016, Sea Grant will celebrate 50 years of good \nwork on behalf of our oceans and Great Lakes. In recognition of his \nvision and leadership in forming Sea Grant, NOAA named one of its most \nprestigious fellowships in his honor--the NOAA Sea Grant John A. Knauss \nMarine Policy Fellowship. Every year, around 50 of the Nation's top \ngraduate and postgraduate students are selected for Knauss fellowships \nto spend a year working on marine and coastal policy issues for the \nFederal agencies and congressional offices in Washington, DC. Two \nKnauss fellows, Adena Leibman and Anna-Marie Laura, have worked in my \nSenate office, helping shape national oceans policy.\n  But perhaps his most significant achievement is the Graduate School \nof Oceanography, GSO, at the University of Rhode Island. John founded \nthe GSO in 1962, served as its dean for over 25 years, and built it \ninto an international leader in marine research. Today, sitting atop a \nbluff overlooking Rhode Island's beautiful Narragansett Bay, the GSO is \nhome to 41 faculty and 170 graduate students engaged in cutting-edge \noceanographic science and pursuing degrees across a range of \nspecialties, including the country's first marine affairs and ocean \nengineering programs. It is a true Rhode Island treasure, one we should \ncontinue investing in, and a testament to Dean Knauss's leadership and \ncommitment to our oceans.\n  Easily lost among his accomplishments in founding and leading ocean \nresearch institutions are his personal contributions to oceanography. \nIn his dissertation for the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, John \nwas the first to make comprehensive measurements of the Pacific \nEquatorial Undercurrent--a current that runs for thousands of miles \nbeneath the surface of the Pacific Ocean. He later discovered another \nmajor current in the Indian Ocean.\n  John will be remembered for his collegiality and gift for \ncollaboration among the administrators, faculty, students, and other \nresearchers and ocean-minded professionals that he touched. Like the \ncurrents he studied, connecting vast oceans in one system, the \ninstitutions and programs he created and led bind together leading \nminds in ocean science, bettering our understanding of our ocean world \nand how important it is to us.\n  I offer my and Sandra's condolences to the Knauss family, to the \nmarine science community, and to the countless people John Knauss \ntaught, mentored, and inspired through the years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/senate-section/article/S8376-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n               Enrolled Bill and Joint Resolutions Signed\n\n  At 9:32 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bill and joint resolutions:\n\n       S. 1170.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan urging the President of the United States and United \n     States Congress and the United States Office of Management \n     and Budget to support plans to upgrade the Soo Locks at Sault \n     Ste. Marie, Michigan, and approve the United States Army \n     Corps of Engineers' reprogramming request to fund an Economic \n     Reevaluation Report for replacing the Davis and Sabin locks; \n     to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 105\n\n       Whereas, The Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, are \n     of the utmost importance to Michigan and play a critical role \n     in our nation's economy and security. Each year, \n     approximately 10,000 Great Lakes vessels, carrying 80 million \n     tons of iron ore, coal, grain, and other cargo, safely and \n     efficiently traverse the locks. Nearly 80 percent of domestic \n     iron ore, the primary material used to manufacture steel, \n     travels from mines in Minnesota and Michigan's Upper \n     Peninsula through the Soo Locks; and\n       Whereas, Only one of the four Soo Locks is large enough to \n     accommodate the modern vessels that commonly traverse the \n     Great Lakes. Seventy percent of cargo is carried on these \n     large ships that can only pass through the Poe Lock. The \n     remainder of cargo goes through the smaller MacArthur Lock, \n     with the smallest 100-year-old Davis and Sabin locks rarely \n     used; and\n       Whereas, The reliance on one lock poses a serious risk to \n     national security and the economies of the state of Michigan \n     and the United States. A long-term outage of the Poe Lock due \n     to lock failure or terrorist attack could cripple the economy \n     and disrupt steel production in the United States. It is \n     estimated that a 30-day outage would result in economic \n     losses of $160 million; and\n       Whereas, Upgrades to the Soo Locks are needed to ensure \n     national security and unfettered commerce through the Great \n     Lakes. To this end, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has \n     requested funding to conduct a study crucial to moving \n     forward with the construction of a second, large lock. The \n     Economic Reevaluation Report would examine the economic \n     benefits and costs of replacing the Davis and Sabin locks \n     with a lock similar in size to the current Poe Lock: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we encourage the President and \n     Congress of the United States and the U.S. Office of \n     Management and Budget to support plans to upgrade the Soo \n     Locks at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and approve the U.S. \n     Army Corps of Engineers' reprogramming request to fund an \n     Economic Reevaluation Report for replacing the Davis and \n     Sabin locks; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, the members of the Michigan congressional \n     delegation, and the Director of the U.S. Office of Management \n     and Budget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/senate-section/article/S8378-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. BARRASSO, from the Committee on Indian Affairs, with \n     an amendment in the nature of a substitute:\n       S. 1704.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nand modify the incentives for biodiesel; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Biodiesel Tax \nIncentive Reform and Extension Act of 2015. I am pleased to be joined \nby Senator Cantwell. Our bill will modify the biodiesel fuel blenders \ncredit to a domestic production credit, and extend the credit through \n2018.\n  Congress created the biodiesel tax incentive in 2005. As a result of \nthis incentive, and the Renewable Fuel Standard, biodiesel is providing \nsignificant benefits to the nation. Domestic biodiesel production \nsupports tens of thousands of jobs. Replacing traditional diesel with \nbiodiesel reduces emissions and creates cleaner air.\n  Homegrown biodiesel improves our energy security by diversifying our \ntransportation fuels and reducing our dependence on foreign oil. \nBiodiesel itself is a very diverse fuel. It can be produced from a wide \narray of resources such as recycled cooking oil, soybean and other \nplant oils, and animal fats.\n  Senator Cantwell and I have been advocating for years a modification \nto the current incentive. We have proposed making the credit available \nfor the domestic production of biodiesel, rather than a mixture credit \navailable to the blender of the fuel, going back to 2009.\n  The bill we are introducing today is similar to an amendment that I \noffered with Senator Cantwell during consideration of the tax extenders \npackage in the Senate Finance Committee in July of this year. Our \nbiodiesel reform amendment passed unanimously by voice vote.\n  Converting to a producer credit improves the incentive in many ways. \nThe blenders credit can be difficult to administer, because the \nblending of the fuel can occur at many different stages of the fuel \ndistribution. This can make it difficult to ensure that only fuel that \nqualifies for the credit claims the incentive It has been susceptible \nto abuse because of this.\n  A credit for domestic production will also ensure that we are \nincentivizing the domestic industry, rather than subsidizing imported \nbiofuels. It's projected that imports from Argentina, Singapore, the \nEuropean Union, South Korea and others could exceed 1.5 billion gallons \nover this year and next.\n  We should not provide a U.S. taxpayer benefit to imported biofuels. \nBy restricting the credit to domestic production, we will also save \ntaxpayer money. The amendment adopted in the Finance Committee is \nestimated to reduce the cost of the extension by $90 million.\n  Importantly, modifying the credit will have little to no impact on \nthe consumer. Much of the credit will continue to be passed on to the \nblender and ultimately, the consumer. Additionally, the U.S. biodiesel \nindustry is currently operating at only 60 percent of capacity. The \ndomestic biodiesel industry has the capacity and access to affordable \nfeedstocks to meet the demand of U.S. consumers.\n  It is my understanding that representatives from the House and \nSenate, along with the White House, are currently meeting to finalize a \ntax extender package before the end of the year. I strongly urge them \nto maintain the Senate position, and include the biodiesel reform \npolicies that were adopted in the Senate Finance Committee.\n\n[[Page S8381]]\n\n  This modification will ensure that the credit is doing what Congress \nintended--incentivizing investment in domestic biodiesel production. \nSurely, House and Senate leaders recognize that we should not be \nproviding a U.S. taxpayer subsidy to already heavily subsidized foreign \nbiodiesel imports.\n  I therefore urge my colleagues to support this common-sense, cost \nreduction modification.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/senate-section/article/S8381-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 326--CELEBRATING THE 135TH ANNIVERSARY OF DIPLOMATIC \n            RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND ROMANIA\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON (for himself, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Inhofe) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

RES. 328\n\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, no family should lose a loved one to a \ndrunk driver. But, sadly, so many families do--every day, every month, \nevery year. It happens in my State. It happens all across our Nation. \nIt is tragic, it is senseless, and it must stop.\n  Last weekend, according to the Albuquerque Journal, police reported \nthat an ``extremely intoxicated'' driver ran a red light and smashed \ninto the car of three young people.\n  Robert Mendez was 27 years old. His brother Sergio Mendez-Aguirre was \n23, and their friend Grace Sinfield was 20.\n  The violence of the collision was so great that their car flipped \nover. They died early Sunday morning--at the end of the Thanksgiving \nweekend. The police investigation continues. But this much is certain: \nA holiday that began in joy--for these families--ended in great sorrow.\n  Sergio Mendez-Aguirre graduated from the University of New Mexico \nwith honors in chemistry. Robert Mendez was a student at UNM. Grace \nSinfield was studying to be a writer.\n  Our hearts go out to the Mendez and Sinfield families. These young \npeople were just beginning, just starting out in life, and just finding \ntheir way.\n  Robert Mendez's family remembers how he believed that, ``Fear is \neveryone's number one enemy. Take chances, make mistakes, and learn \nfrom them. After all, we grow from experience. Life is too short to \nlive timidly.''\n  The Albuquerque Journal reported that Sergio Mendez-Aguirre once \nasked, ``What can make you more happy than making others happy?'' His \nanswer was, ``Nothing can.''\n  Grace Sinfield's family spoke of her great spirit. ``She was a true \nfriend who taught us how to love unconditionally; she was the life of \nevery party. She attracted laughter like she was a magnet. Just as \nimportant and relevantly, she was always responsible and by proxy made \nthose around her more responsible and better people.''\n  Three young lives--full of promise--and now over in one terrible \nmoment--they will be missed by so many in Albuquerque.\n  Every DWI death is a tragedy--and an unnecessary tragedy. It doesn't \nhave to happen. But, year after year, for too many families, it does. \nMore than 10,000 people are killed every year, and another 290,000 are \ninjured, all as a result of drunk driving.\n  Those are horrific numbers, but they are more than just numbers. They \nare stories of profound loss and should outrage us all. In years past, \nit was even worse. In 1980, 25,000 people--two and one-half times more \npeople than now--died because of drunk driving--25,000 people, in 1 \nyear.\n  We are making progress thanks to determined families and law \nenforcement and thanks to groups like Mothers Against Drunk Driving. I \nam proud to work with them. But we still have work to do. There are \n10,000 families--every year--to remind us--10,000 families in grief, in \npain, and all because of drunk driving. No parent should have to grieve \na child's loss on the holidays--or any day.\n  When I was elected attorney general in New Mexico 25 years ago, we \nhad the highest rate of DWI deaths in the Nation. We were the worst--\ntoo many drunk drivers, too many repeat offenders, too many innocent \npeople dying every year.\n  We pushed for reform. We identified solutions--in law enforcement and \nin prevention. But there was a lot of push back, a lot of opposition in \nthe State legislature. And then along came a mom named Nadine Milford. \nHer daughter and granddaughters were killed by a drunk driver on \nChristmas Eve 1992. It is hard to imagine such a loss.\n  So we changed New Mexico's DWI and traffic safety laws. We got it \ndone because of moms like Nadine, because of families and friends who \nhad had enough and would not take no for an answer.\n  In the early 1990s, my State had up to 500 DWI deaths a year. Last \nyear, it was 166. But that is still 166 too many. We still lose too \nmany innocent lives--young and old alike--in New Mexico and all across \nour Nation.\n  I believe new technology will help. That is why I have pushed for the \nDriver Alcohol Detection System for Safety, or DADSS. This technology \nis critically important and will make a critical difference. We all \nknow this. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration knows it. \nThe auto industry knows it. And they are working together to make it \nhappen.\n  DADSS would be built into new vehicles. It would analyze a driver's \nbreath or blood alcohol content. It would stop drunk drivers from \nturning on the engine. If you are drunk, you will not drive, period.\n  This could save 59,000 lives over 15 years. It could save up to $343 \nbillion. The highway bill includes continued funding for DADSS research \nover the next 5 years. I am grateful the conference committee supported \nthis vital technology.\n  But technology alone is not enough. In the meantime, the message \nshould be loud and clear. Anyone who gets behind the wheel while \nimpaired should not drive.\n  That is why I also urge passage of a resolution I am submitting--\nsupporting the December 3, 2015, National Day of Remembrance for \nvictims of drunk and drugged driving. We want to say to their \nfamilies--we have not forgotten them. We remember. We will do all we \ncan to prevent these tragedies.\n  There are still far too many, far too often. In the time I have been \nspeaking, two more people have been injured in a drunk driving crash. \nEvery hour, another life is taken.\n  We all have to say--enough is enough. We have to keep saying it--\nuntil every single person in this country gets the message: If you \ndrink, don't drive.\n  Albuquerque police officer Simon Drobik spoke for all of us--when he \nsaid, ``Talk to your kids about drinking and driving. Share these \ntragic stories with them so they understand driving is a big \nresponsibility. If you see your friend or loved one trying to get \nbehind the wheel after drinking STOP THEM. Do the right thing.''\n  Officer Drobik is right. We all need to do the right thing. Let's not \nwait for 10,000 more families to lose their loved ones.\n  We have to keep up the fight. Nelson Mandela said, ``It always seems \nimpossible--until it is done.'' We can keep drunk drivers off the road. \nIt is not impossible. We can get it done.\n  For the sake of all families, for those who grieve now--and for those \nwho may grieve in the future--let's do all we can. Let's work together. \nLet's stop these senseless tragedies. Let's get it done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/senate-section/article/S8382-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8382-S8383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2891.
