Mr. President, yesterday the Senate voted overwhelming \nto pass another piece of important legislation for our country. By a \nvote of 74 to 21, the Senate said yes to protecting the private \ninformation of every American. The significant bill we passed would do \nso through the sharing of threat information from cyber attacks.\n  It couldn't have passed without the hard work of Senators from both \nsides of the aisle. I particularly thank Senator McCain, Senator Ron \nJohnson, and Senator Tom Carper, who worked hard to move this bill \nforward. I appreciate in particular the outstanding work of our \nchairman, Senator Burr from North Carolina, and our vice chair, Senator \nFeinstein from California. They worked together seamlessly to move this \nchallenging bill forward.\n  It is worth noting something the vice chair recently said. She said: \n``One of the things I've learned from two prior bills of this type is \nthat if you really want to get a bill done, it's got to be bipartisan--\nparticularly a bill that's technical and difficult and hard to put \ntogether.''\n  After watching the Senate fail to act on cyber threat information \nsharing for years, the new Senate majority resolved to move forward \ninstead. As our Democratic colleague from California put it, ``We stood \nshoulder to shoulder and the right things happened.''\n  Yesterday's bipartisan vote was an important step forward for our \ncountry. It represents the new Senate's latest notable accomplishment \non behalf of the American people. We remain determined to keep pushing \nahead as Congress continues its work to send a strong cyber security \nbill to the President's desk.\n  On another matter, the House will soon consider the fiscal agreement. \nAfter the House acts, the Senate will take up the measure. Republicans \napproached the recent fiscal negotiations with several goals: No. 1, \nreject the tax increases proposed by Democrats; No. 2, secure long-term \nsavings via structural entitlement reforms; and No. 3, protect our \ntroops and strengthen national security. The agreement pending before \nthe House meets those goals. It is not perfect--far from it--but here \nis what we know: It is offset with other cuts and savings. It would \nenact the most significant reform to Social Security since 1983, \nresulting in $168 billion in long-term savings. It would repeal more of \nObamaCare. It would provide greater certainty to our military planners \nto help ensure readiness and preparedness for our troops.\n  At a time of diverse and challenging global threats, when we see ISIL \nconsolidating gains in Iraq and Syria and Russian aircraft flying over \nSyria as the forces of Assad march alongside Iranian soldiers and \nHezbollah militias, the importance of this cannot be overstated.\n  Our All-Volunteer Force loyally goes into harm's way, and our \ncommanders tell us that additional resources are required to ensure \ntheir safety and preparedness.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider these important issues as they \ncontinue to examine the agreement. We plan to consider it after the \nHouse acts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/senate-section/article/S7551-6", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, our goals regarding the budget agreement \nwere to make sure that we got rid of sequestration--we did that for 2 \nyears--and that we had a treatment in this legislation where defense, \nwhich is so important to our country, is treated no better or no worse \nthan nondefense. We accomplished that.\n  We are months behind in the appropriations process because the \nRepublican leader decided he was going to\n\n[[Page S7552]]\n\npush forward and not take care of the middle class. I was stunned--I \nshouldn't say that. That is not appropriate. I was not surprised when \nthe Republican leader laid out his goals for his budget agreement--not \na single word about the middle class.\n  I compliment the negotiators for coming up with something that is \nreally good. It is a 2-year deal that allows more money to be spent for \ndefense and nondefense, and it doesn't affect the deficit in any way. \nIt is a good agreement.\n  Before we start the backslapping and congratulations, let's make sure \nthat we, first of all, pass the budget agreement. I think we will. I \nwas happy to see the new Speaker-to-be came out for the budget \nagreement today. He complained about it yesterday, and when he was \nreminded that it was the same pattern he and Senator Murray came up \nwith 2 years ago, I guess he changed his mind. He said now he is in \nfavor of this. I think that is good, that Congressman Ryan said that.\n  After we pass the budget framework by December 11, we have to make \nsure the appropriators are able to move forward on legislation that \ntakes into consideration the budget agreement we have. I am certain \nthat can be done, but it is not a given based on all of the finger-\npointing by the Republicans.\n  This is a significant agreement. I repeat: We have relief from the \nvexatious sequestration. We have dollar-for-dollar help for the middle \nclass as well as defense. There are no destructive riders in this.\n  When we work together, as we are supposed to do--as the Republican \nleader just mentioned--on legislation, it works out well.\n  I would suggest this. We had the House of Representatives yesterday, \nafter years of refusing to move forward on an important piece of \nlegislation--that is, to reestablish the Import-Export Bank. It only \ncame about as a result of courageous Republicans saying: We have had \nenough of this.\n  This is one of the most important business-directed initiatives we \nhave here, and it has been held up for years in the House of \nRepresentatives. It was because of these courageous Republicans who \nsaid: We have had enough of this. And they joined with Democrats to do \nwhat is rarely done in the House of Representatives. They signed a \ndischarge petition--getting more than 218 votes--to say: We have had \nenough of this stalling; we want to move forward. And they did. \nYesterday, that passed by a vote of 313 votes. That is a tremendous \npush.\n  I hope that over here the Republican leader will move forward on this \nnow. There are stories coming out every day about American companies \nthat are moving their businesses overseas because the Export-Import \nBank is gone. It creates 160,000 jobs for people to work in this \nindustry. It is important to our country. Right now, businesses are \nmoving out of the United States because this legislation never came \nforward. The Bank had to close. It is basically closed right now.\n  I hope that we are not going to wait for some package deal with the \nhighway bill. The highway bill should stand or fall on its own merits.\n  We are pleading with the Republicans to allow us to have a vote on \nthis. We have Republicans who will vote with us. Virtually every \nDemocrat will vote for it. We should get it done this week. Every day \nit is held up is a bad day for the American business community.\n  I ask the Chair to announce the business for today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/senate-section/article/S7552-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is possible this week that we will pass \na budget agreement for the fiscal year we are currently in. That year \nstarted October 1 and runs, of course, until the end of December in the \nnext calendar year. If we do reach that agreement--and I hope we do--it \nis going to give us some opportunities. One opportunity it will give us \nis to spare ourselves the possibility of this Congress failing to enact \na new budget ceiling to basically guarantee the full faith and credit \nof the United States of America. We won't face that showdown. Also, the \npossibility of a government shutdown will be relieved by the passage of \nthis budget agreement.\n  Those are good, positive things for this institution and for the \neconomy of America, but there are specifics that also need to be noted \nbecause this budget agreement gives us a chance to invest in areas of \nour budget that sadly would have been overlooked if we hadn't reached \nthis agreement.\n  This morning we had an extraordinary presentation by the National \nInstitutes of Health. Twenty Senators came to hear the presentation \nabout research at the National Institutes of Health and what it means \nto us. Dr. Francis Collins is the Director and is an extraordinary man. \nHe is a medical doctor who was given the task of mapping the human \ngenome and did it. He did it in an extraordinary way, creating new \ninformation and new opportunities.\n  A doctor from the Mayo Clinic explained what that meant. It meant \nthat we have now reached a point where we can map the genome of \nindividuals, their DNA, and we can then make decisions on the \nappropriate prescriptions for illnesses and diseases they face and in \ndoing that, be more effective, save lives. That is what medical \nresearch can mean. Each of us will not only have a basic biography in \nour medical record--when we were born and some of the basic illnesses \nwe have faced--but also our individual map of our DNA, which will \ninstruct doctors when it comes to treatment of cancer, if it should \nstrike us, or some other disease.\n  It is an amazing leap forward. It is a leap forward that would not be \npossible without medical research. Yet, in the past 12 years, we have \nseen a downturn in investment in medical research of more than 20 \npercent--more than 20 percent. It has meant that a lot of researchers \nhave been discouraged and walked away and said there is no future in \nmedical research. What a loss. They don't make a lot of money--many of \nthem don't. If they don't think we are going to support them with our \ninvestment in NIH and medical research, they look in other places.\n\n  This morning we considered where we are. At this moment in time, the \nSenate, under the leadership of Senator Blunt of Missouri and the \nAppropriations subcommittee on health and human services, has provided \nbasically a 7-percent increase in the funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health next year. That is a good thing.\n  I will say quickly that Senator Blunt cut a lot of other areas in his \nbill that I think need to have help, but I hope that he will stand tall \nand tough when it comes to that 7-percent increase as we approach this \nbudget negotiation. The House, conversely, did not give such an \nincrease to NIH, but they increased the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, which is a companion sister agency that is important for \nmedical research.\n  We have a chance to come together on a bipartisan basis and come up \nwith a number that gives 5-percent real growth in spending at both the \nNational Institutes of Health and Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention. It will pay us back many times over.\n  Most Americans say: What are we going to do about the cost of \nMedicare? Medicare is an important program to over 40 million \nAmericans, and the costs keep going up. There are two facts that we \nlearned about this morning and people should be aware of them: $1 out \nof every $5 spent under our Medicare system is spent on Alzheimer's and \ndementia. If we could have a means of early detection, prevention, \ntreatment or cure for these horrible diseases, that would dramatically \nchange the lives of millions of Americans and millions of families, and \nit would dramatically reduce the cost to Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Medicare spends $1 out of $3 for the treatment of people with \ndiabetes. If we put the research into finding a cure\n\n[[Page S7553]]\n\nfor diabetes and can alleviate the suffering associated with that \ndisease, it not only will help lives across America, but it will save \nus money in our important health care programs. Investment in medical \nresearch by the United States of America has been the pillar for the \nworld when it comes to looking to a better day for the people who live \nin each country.\n  This brain initiative, which was described to us this morning by the \nNational Institutes of Health, needs to be funded. It is not adequately \nfunded now. We dedicated some $350 million to Alzheimer's and brain \nresearch. It sounds like a lot of money. It is about one-third of what \nthe researchers need. They have that many opportunities waiting to be \nfunded. Will they all succeed? No, but that is the nature of research, \nand each one of them will be a good investment which will lead us to \nthe day of prevention, treatment, and a cure when it comes to \nAlzheimer's.\n  I hope that we come together on a bipartisan basis when it comes to \nthis budget. In this area of medical research, there is plenty of room \nfor us to work together, and there has already been leadership shown on \nthe other side of the aisle. We are going to help to try to move that \nforward, both in the Senate and in the House, on a bipartisan basis.\n  When I meet with people across my State--and I guess many other \nStates--and talk about political issues, there are a lot of folks with \nsome very strongly held opinions on one side or the other, but when it \ncomes to funding medical research, I have found that this is the kind \nof issue that opens the doors. People of all political stripes agree \nthis is a good investment for the future of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/senate-section/article/S7553-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7553-S7554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it hasn't been a very good week or two for \nthe University of Phoenix. The University of Phoenix is the largest \nfor-profit university in the United States. University of Phoenix \nstudents cumulatively owe more in student debt than any other \ninstitution of higher education in America. The students enroll at this \nuniversity, which is largely online but has some classroom experience, \nthey sign up for a higher tuition than they would at community colleges \nor most universities, and when they can't finish and drop out, they \nstill have debt, or when they finish, they may have a diploma that \ncan't find a job.\n  The University of Phoenix--this private, for-profit company--receives \nnearly $3 billion a year in Federal Student Aid funding, but the \nquality of education from this for-profit school is suspect. The for-\nprofit college and university industry is the most heavily subsidized \nfor-profit business in America. We have seen a lot of warning signs \nabout the University of Phoenix. We've seen how they target the \nmilitary and veterans.\n  Paul Rieckhoff of the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America said \nthat the University of Phoenix ``is constantly reported as the single \nworst by far'' when it comes to for-profit colleges taking advantage of \nveterans.\n  Well, it has caught up with them. A few weeks ago the University of \nPhoenix was placed on probation by the Department of Defense, \nrestricting the company from enrolling new servicemembers who used the \nDepartment's tuition assistance or spousal MyCAA programs. The \nDepartment found violations by the company, the University of Phoenix, \nafter completing a review prompted by an investigative report from the \nCenter for Investigative Reporting.\n  The article that started this investigation exposed the University of \nPhoenix's strategy to flout Department of Defense rules, including an \nExecutive order meant to protect our servicemembers--men and women in \nuniform and their spouses--from aggressive and unfair recruiting by \nfor-profit colleges. You see, if these for-profit colleges can sign up \na member of the military or their spouse, they can bring in the money \nthat is set aside in the Tuition Assistance program for education and \ntraining, and so they want to sign up as many members of the military \nand their families as they can.\n  The University of Phoenix avoided the rules set down by the \nDepartment of Defense by sponsoring events at military bases--not just \na few but a lot. In one instance they paid $25,000 to sponsor a concert \nfor military members and their families. They spent $25,000 for a \nconcert? The company gave away computers and wrapped the stage in a \ngiant University of Phoenix banner. They used official Department of \nDefense seals and logos on challenge coins and gave them out to \nservicemembers in order to show that they had some kind of close \nrelationship with the military.\n  In other instances found by the Center for Investigative Reporting, \nthe University of Phoenix sponsored resume workshops, which essentially \namounted to recruiting members of the military and their family to sign \nup for this for-profit college. According to the article, the company \nsponsored hundreds of events, such as rock concerts, Super Bowl \nparties, father-daughter dances, Easter egg hunts, chocolate festivals, \nfashion shows, and even brunch with Santa, on military bases.\n  The University of Phoenix spent $250,000 to sponsor events over the \nlast 3 years at one place--Fort Campbell, KY. Let's face it, these were \nrecruitment events for the University of Phoenix, and they were paid \nfor, by and large, with taxpayers' dollars. In the name of corporate \nsponsorship, the University of Phoenix could gain direct access to \nmilitary bases with a nod and a wink from servicemembers. They told \nthem they cared about the military. They also cared about the fact that \nthey had potential students who would sign up and spend their TA \nbenefits at the University of Phoenix. It paid off for them. The \nUniversity of Phoenix is the fourth largest recipient of Department of \nDefense tuition assistance funds. In fiscal year 2014 the University of \nPhoenix received more than $20 million from these benefits. It is not \nsurprising then that the company would be so concerned about the \ndecision by the Department of Defense to put them on probation. It \nmeans they will lose access to millions of dollars from these military \nfamilies, and it was reflected when their stock went down in value.\n  Since the Department of Defense took action against the company, the \nUniversity of Phoenix stock value has plummeted nearly 50 percent. In \nits decision, the Department of Defense also cited concerns related to \nongoing investigations of this same University of Phoenix by the \nFederal Trade Commission and the attorney general of the State of \nCalifornia. In fact, there are two ongoing investigations of the \nUniversity of Phoenix by the Federal Trade Commission, one is related \nto deceptive marketing and advertising, and a second is related to \nsafeguarding student and staff personal information.\n  In addition to the attorney general in California, at least two other \nStates are also investigating the company. The U.S. Securities and \nExchange Commission and the Department of Education inspector general \nalso have ongoing investigations at the University of Phoenix.\n  The Department of Defense is not alone. Many agencies, Federal and \nState, are investigating this major for-profit university. They do have \nsome friends though, and one of them is the Wall Street Journal.\n  Last week, on the same day an editorial of a similar tone appeared in \nthe Wall Street Journal, a few of my colleagues in the Senate sent a \nletter to the Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter, telling him to lay off \nthe University of Phoenix despite the fact that the Department noted \nthe violations were of such frequency and such scope that they were \n``disconcerting.'' My colleagues in the Senate think the Department of \nDefense's decision to protect servicemembers and to put this university \nunder probation was ``unfair.''\n  There is no question that the Department of Defense has a duty and a \nresponsibility to protect members of the military and their families \nfrom exploitation. They have established rules under the Voluntary \nMilitary Education Program, and now my colleagues in the Senate are \nwriting letters to the Department of Defense saying: Look the other \nway. The letter they sent criticized the Department for its concern \nover the University of Phoenix's continued participation in Voluntary \nMilitary Education Program in light of the multiple ongoing \ninvestigations. I think it would be grossly\n\n[[Page S7554]]\n\nirresponsible for the Department of Defense to back off of this \nprotection of our military because of a letter from Members of the \nSenate.\n  The broad and ongoing regulatory scrutiny of the University of \nPhoenix gives the Department of Defense legitimate cause for concern \nwhen it comes to the company's future participation in the Voluntary \nMilitary Education Program.\n  My colleagues in their letter said: ``The TA program is critical to \nour nation's servicemembers' educational and career opportunities.'' I \ncouldn't agree more. That is exactly why the Department of Defense \nshould ignore the demand of my Senate colleagues and exactly why they \nshould not turn a blind eye to the University of Phoenix's violations.\n  In order to provide quality educational options for servicemembers \nand to ensure that taxpayer dollars are not being wasted, we must \npromote integrity in the program, and the highest priority should not \nbe the profitability of a for-profit university, such as the University \nof Phoenix. The highest priority is quality education and training for \nthe members of the military. I thank the Department of Defense for \ntaking this bold action and encourage them to remain steadfast in \nprotecting students, military members, their families, and taxpayers \nwhen it comes to future decisions related to the University of \nPhoenix's participation in the Voluntary Military Education Program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/senate-section/article/S7554-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7554-S7557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXPORT-IMPORT BANK\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP.

The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am delighted to be here with my \ncolleague, and I thank the Senator from North Dakota for her \nexhilaration we all share because of the vote last night in the House \noverwhelmingly in support of Ex-Im.\n  I am here to reiterate my strong support for reauthorization of the \nExport-Import Bank, and I applaud the Members of the House who easily \npassed the reauthorization bill last night. It is actually easy to see \nwhy the bill got so much support. It is good for American jobs, it is \ngood for small businesses, and it reduces our national debt. The fact \nthat Republican leadership has let this program go dark for so long, \nheld hostage by political pandering, is outrageous.\n  The longer Ex-Im is shuttered, the more it hurts American \ncompetitiveness. In my home State of Washington, nearly 100 \nbusinesses--the majority of them medium or small businesses--used the \nBank services last year to help sell their products overseas. We are \ntalking about everything from Apple and airplane parts to beer and \nwine, to software and medical training supplies. In fact, I actually \nrecently visited one of these small businesses--a brewery in Seattle.\n  In 2011, Hilliard's Brewery started with three employees dedicated to \nmaking good beer. Thanks to a loan from the Ex-Im Bank, Hilliard's \ntapped into foreign markets and developed a following. Fast forward to \n2015. They have dramatically increased their production, they continue \nto grow, and they built a business that thrives today.\n  The reality is that people in other countries want American-made \nproducts. That is great because these businesses support tens of \nthousands of jobs around the country and they keep our economy moving. \nThe Export-Import Bank is the right investment because it expands \nAmerican businesses' access to emerging foreign markets, creating jobs \nright here at home. Do you know what it costs taxpayers? Not a single \npenny. In fact, the Export-Import Bank puts money back into our \ncountry.\n  Here is the bottom line: Republican leaders allowed partisan \npandering to put the brakes on a program that creates jobs, strengthens \nour small businesses, and helps our economy grow. I believe--and I am \njoining my colleagues today--it is time to put this ideology aside. \nLet's restart this proven program. It is critical the Ex-Im Bank \ncontinues to receive the strong bipartisan support we have seen in the \npast as we work to reauthorize this bill that is a success. I am proud \nto join my colleagues to say let's get this done.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, yesterday was a great day, and it was a \ngreat day not just because something we have worked so long and hard on \nactually was advanced, and that we care about, reopening the Ex-Im \nBank, but it was when a majority of people in the U.S. Congress stood \nup, led by a Republican from Tennessee, Representative Fincher, and \nactually said: We are not going to let hard rightwing politics get in \nthe way of American jobs, American manufacturing opportunities, and get \nin the way of moving our country forward. I think that speaks volumes, \nand I hope it becomes an opportunity to move other broad bipartisan \npieces of legislation forward.\n  The frustration the American people have with the U.S. Congress is \nthat things that seem to be no-brainers--legislation that seems to be \nso obvious in terms of the right kind of policy--do not get done in the \nU.S. Congress. So I am elated with what happened over in the House.\n  Now the ball is back in our court. We have been waiting for a number \nof months to see House movement on this. Because of the discharge \npetition, because of this big vote, we now see House movement. The \nHouse has done their job. It is now time for us to do our job.\n  I want to point out a couple of things about that vote. It ended up \nbeing over 70 percent of the House of Representatives. Think about \nthat. In this time of hard partisan fighting, we have 70 percent of a \nbody agreeing to an important public policy. What also is significant \nabout that vote is 127 Republicans--in fact, a majority of Republicans \nin the House--voted to support the Ex-Im Bank, reauthorize it, open it \nup, and open up this opportunity for American manufacturers.\n  There can be no debate. Along with my colleague from Washington, we \nhave been saying all along that we believed there was broad support in \nthe House of Representatives to do this. I think they hadn't had a test \nvote in the past. Now we know, and we can say it with great certainty, \nnot only is there majority support, there is supermajority support for \nthe Ex-Im Bank.\n  Now it is our turn. Now it is our job once again. A few short months \nago I stood in this body, working with my two great colleagues who have \njoined me on the floor, to push back and say: Look, if we believe in a \ntrade agenda, we believe as the three of us have voted, to support TPA. \nWe are now evaluating and analyzing TPP. What sense does it make to \ntake one of the most significant and important trade tools such as the \nEx-Im Bank--something that levels the playing field and creates huge \nopportunities for us to be competitive against a world where these kind \nof private agencies are supported by every major economy and every \nmajor government, including some of the developing nations right now--\nwhat sense does it make to shut down or restrict that tool? In what \nworld does that make sense? We have been making this commonsense \nargument and fighting against things that make absolutely no sense and, \nquite honestly, in many ways seems almost idiotic.\n  Unfortunately, there are casualties to this failure in America today. \nAmerican jobs have been lost, American economic opportunity has been \nlost, and\n\n[[Page S7555]]\n\nAmerica's position as a leading manufacturer and exporter of quality \ngoods has been challenged because we have sent a message that we are \nnot open for business. We have sent the message that we no longer are \ngoing to engage with the rest of the world in terms of developing and \nsupporting exports. That is the wrong message.\n  I think the House yesterday sent a huge message to those foreign \nnationals in those countries who think we were willing to basically \nabrogate the ground--give the ground away to other companies from other \ncountries. We sent a loud-and-clear message that is not going to happen \non our watch.\n  I rise to make one final point before I ask my colleagues to join me. \nI will make one final point, which is this bill is going to come over \nfrom the House of Representatives. We have been having this discussion \nabout what can we attach it to. We need to attach it to something \nbecause the House will not take it independently. Isn't that what we \nhave been hearing; that the House couldn't possibly move this without \nbeing on a so called must-have piece of legislation. That argument is \nway gone. It has been blown up by the vote yesterday in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Now that we no longer have that argument and we know we have a \nsupermajority here--at least 64 votes and probably likely 67 votes for \nthe Kirk-Heitkamp bill--we need to move this bill now. Let's open the \nEx-Im Bank. Let's tell American small businesses that we are on their \nside. Let's tell American manufacturers that we hear you. We hear that \nwe can't put you in a challenging and competitive global economy and \nthen weigh you down with 100 pounds of inactivity on the Ex-Im Bank.\n  We are going to be talking a lot about this in the next 2 or 3 weeks \nbecause it is not enough to wait for the next must-pass vehicle to pass \nthrough. I jokingly tell my staff I am going to introduce a bill called \nthe vehicle and say: Here it is. The bill is ready to go right now. We \nare ready to make this happen. I am very excited for the Ex-Im Bank but \nmore excited for so many of our workers, so many of our small \nbusinesses that have struggled and that have wondered why Washington \ncannot listen to their concerns. I think that question was answered \nyesterday, so I am very excited to call on my colleague from the great \nState of New Hampshire to also talk about the importance of the Ex-Im \nBank at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am delighted to join my colleagues on \nthe floor, Senator Heitkamp, Senator Murray, and Senator Cantwell. I \nthank them for their leadership in keeping the issue of reauthorizing \nthe Export-Import Bank front and center in this Congress. We are here \nto celebrate what the House did yesterday in voting overwhelmingly with \na bipartisan majority to reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank. The House did what \nmany people have been predicting for months they would do if they could \nactually get this bill to the floor; that is, pass it with an \noverwhelmingly bipartisan majority, including a majority of House \nRepublicans.\n  Why are we so concerned about reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank? It is \nbecause--as Senator Heitkamp said so well--exporting has become \nincreasingly important throughout the country, especially in my home \nState of New Hampshire and for so many of our small businesses that are \nlooking to stay competitive in this global economy. Ex-Im levels the \nplaying field, and when American companies have a level playing field \nthey can compete and win.\n  Unfortunately, it has been a small ideological minority of Members of \nCongress in both the Senate and the House who have kept this \nlegislation from coming to the floor and have kept the Ex-Im Bank shut \ndown. The vote yesterday shows it is time to change that.\n  Ex-Im provides billions of dollars of money to help American \nmanufacturers reach foreign markets. It has been 4 months now since the \nBank's charter expired and we are already starting to see the \nconsequences. Some companies have discussed moving manufacturing from \nthe United States, which means we will lose manufacturing jobs. We are \ngoing to start seeing consequences for small businesses as they start \nlosing out on new sales because they are operating at a disadvantage.\n  Businesses such as Boyle Energy in New Hampshire have gotten support \nfrom the Ex-Im Bank. The Bank has supported $314 million in export \nsales from New Hampshire businesses since 2009. It is time for the \nSenate to take up this legislation, to pass it, to come together and \nget this done for our small businesses, for our economy, and for our \njobs.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I thank my great colleague from New \nHampshire, who has done so much in her State to raise awareness about \nthe importance of the Ex-Im Bank and who has also stood firm with the \ntwo great Senators from Washington, the Senator from Missouri, and the \nSenator from Delaware to basically say: You cannot just look at trade \nagreements and think you got every piece of important trade legislation \npassed.\n  So she has been a champion. But we all have to admit that none of us \nhave been as diligent, none of us have been as eloquent, and none of us \nhave been as tenacious as the great Senator from the great State of \nWashington, who understands this issue so well and has been fighting \nfor this issue for a number of years. So I yield the floor to the \nSenator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleagues for \ncoming to the Senate floor this morning to give an important message to \nour colleagues--that it is now time to take up the Export-Import Bank \nissue and pass that legislation today.\n  I thank my colleague from North Dakota, who has had this legislation \nin the Senate and has worked hard on the banking committee to make sure \nthis legislation is moving forward and has been there at every step in \nthe process. Being from a State that knows exports matter, she knows \nthat having a finance regime that allows banks to take advantage of the \nfact that they need credit insurance has been a good thing for the \nAmerican economy. It has helped us grow jobs in the United States, as \nwe are selling exports to overseas markets. So she has been a stalwart.\n  My colleague from New Hampshire who just left the floor, Senator \nShaheen--I have visited her State and facilities and manufacturers \ninvolved in aerospace and other types of manufacturing that are trying \nto win in the international marketplace with their products by selling \nthem overseas.\n  When we cancel a program that actually helps us pay down the \ndeficit--those individuals who get financing through a bank and a \ncredit agency like the Export-Import Bank actually have to pay a fee. \nThat has actually helped us reduce the deficit. It is money paid every \nyear, and it helps us reduce the deficit. My colleague Senator Shaheen \nhas been a great advocate for reauthorization of the Export-Import \nBank.\n  As my colleagues have talked about, the dirty little secret is out in \nWashington; that is, you cannot pass the Ex-Im Bank reauthorization \nbecause there is not enough support in the Congress to do so. Well, the \nanswer is, that was a bunch of hooey promulgated by some very \nconservative think tanks that wanted to hold conservative Republicans \nhostage, and then they tried to hold all of us hostage. That is right--\nthey tried to hold all of us hostage, saying that we cannot pass this.\n  We know the House of Representatives, with 313 votes--a majority of \nthe Republicans in the House--voted for the reauthorization of the \nExport-Import Bank. They now join 67 people here who want to go to and \nmove that legislation in the Senate. So the majority of people in both \nthe House and Senate have supported the reauthorization of the Export-\nImport Bank and have done so for more than a year, but we let it \nexpire. What happened? We let down the American economy because the end \nresult has been a loss of jobs.\n  I will give one example of 850 jobs that went from U.S. companies \nover to these countries instead because without the Export-Import Bank, \nthey lost deals that went to other places because other countries also \nhave credit agencies that help small and regional banks\n\n[[Page S7556]]\n\nfinance the sale of U.S.-made products. As they are being sold to say \nSouth Africa or an Asian country or someplace else, the companies \ncannot find the financing--a lot of agricultural products--and so they \ncome to a bank in their community and say: Help finance my sales \noverseas.\n  In fact, Senator Murray and I met with a great--my colleague from \nNorth Dakota will like this--microbrew manufacturer in Ballard, WA, and \nthey said: You know, we are trying to sell into the Scandinavian \nmarket. They like our products, but we are not big enough as a \ndistributor to finance the sale of our products into those markets. So \nwe either have to take that on our books ourselves or find a way to \ntake our company and leverage it with some capital to increase our \nmarket exports.\n  So what did they do? They tried to minimize that. Otherwise, do you \nknow what that company would have to do? They would have to take all \ntheir capital and put it aside to leverage that money to expand the \nmarket. Instead, they said: Well, let's go to a bank and get them to \nloan us the money so we can expand our products into Scandinavia, where \npeople love drinking this Ballard beer.\n  The bank says: Well, we like that idea. We like you. You are doing \nwell. But we are a little afraid of your selling into that distribution \nmarket in Scandinavia. We want you to have some credit insurance.\n  That is what the Export-Import Bank does. It says to that banker in \nBallard: We will provide you a little credit insurance.\n  Do you have to pay a fee for that? Yes, you have to pay a fee for \nthat. What does that fee do? It helps the Federal Government pay down \nthe deficit. Who wins? We all win because that Ballard company now gets \nto grow. I would say that over in Scandinavia, they get to drink great \nbeer that is made in Washington State. As one of the largest hops \nproducers in the United States, my colleague from an agricultural State \nunderstands this. So everybody wins. Then the Ballard company gets to \nexpand jobs. So that is what this is all about.\n  In this instance, we lost 850 jobs.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Will the Senator from Washington yield?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Yes.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. One of the issues we heard so often during this debate \nhas been that the private sector will step in, that the private sector \nwill take on this responsibility, that we don't need to have the \nExport-Import Bank, that the private sector will fill the gap. Were \nthere any cases where the private sector stepped up and filled the gap \nof the Ex-Im Bank?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for that question \nbecause that is the issue. What people don't understand is that there \nare so many of these deals that--basically there was a U.S. company \nthat wanted to sell its ability to build bridges to an African country. \nYet, because the Export-Import Bank expired, that African country ended \nup basically going with a competitor, an Asian competitor. Same thing \nhere. When we don't finance these deals--I know of a deal that GE lost \nto Rolls-Royce. Why? Because the credit agency in Europe could finance \nthe deal, so they just bought a different product.\n  The issue is not that somehow the private sector is going to step in \nhere and basically help in a capital market. It is the same way the \nSmall Business Administration works. The Small Business Administration \nhas 7(a) loans to help finance the sales that basically go through Main \nStreet banking, but the Small Business Administration provides a little \ncertainty and predictability to the process so that we are not seeing \nhuge losses. Basically, the Small Business Administration has not seen \nlarge defaults, and neither has the Export-Import Bank.\n  So these are tools that basically people try to say to us will be \npicked up somehow, that the private sector will respond to this. Well, \nin developing markets around the world, when U.S. manufacturers are \ntrying to compete and build a great product, all you are doing by \nkilling the Export-Import Bank is enabling some other manufacturer in \nEurope or Asia or South America to compete with our manufacturers on an \nuneven playing field. You are giving them an advantage our \nmanufacturers don't have.\n  So, literally, people on the other side of the aisle have shipped \njobs overseas by saying they don't want to support the Export-Import \nBank, and they have held it up for so many months now that we have lost \njobs. This is only one example.\n  There have been tens of thousands of jobs lost since the Export \nImport-Bank failed to get reauthorized. Now the question is, Why are we \ngoing to wait 1 more day? Now that the House has passed the bill, with \na majority of Republicans supporting it, why would we wait 1 more day \nto pass a key tool that is instrumental in supporting jobs in the \nUnited States of America?\n  I hope my colleagues--I appreciate so much my colleague from North \nDakota talking about this because, you know, being--I don't if it is \nthat we are ag States, that we see how much the global economy means to \nour States, but we know this: that 95 percent of consumers are outside \nof our borders and that if we want to increase our economic activity in \nthe United States and grow jobs, we better be selling to those 95 \npercent of consumers outside of the United States.\n  If you want to sell to those 95 percent of consumers outside of the \nUnited States, first you have to build a great product or develop a \ngreat agricultural product, but then you have to be able to have the \ncompetitive tools to reach them from a financing and banking system.\n  So the funny thing is that all of those people on the other side who \nbasically act as though they are against the Export-Import Bank because \nthey think it is some sort of mysterious organization, those are the \npeople who basically wanted to bail out Wall Street. They are the ones \nwho are behind the big banks. They are the ones who are trying to \nbasically disassemble all of the banking reforms we passed to protect \nthe American consumers. So they are not for some sort of great, good \ngovernment; they basically are just looking for a trophy to put on \ntheir mantle to say that, oh, we killed this government program, which, \nas I have said, is wrong because it actually helps us create jobs in \nthe United States of America, it helps U.S. manufacturers win in the \nUnited States of America, it helps us get our products to places they \nwould not already go, and it helps pay down the Federal deficit. So it \nis a win-win situation for all of us.\n  What we have to do now is to get this reauthorized. We should not \nwait another minute. The notion that all of my colleagues should take \naway from this is that a minority of people holding up voting on this \nhas also been wrongheaded. To allow a minority to thwart what is such \nan essential tool has been a mistake. What we need to do is right that \nmistake immediately by passing this legislation here in the Senate, get \nthe Bank back operating, let our U.S. manufacturers and agricultural \nproducers win again in the international marketplace, and help our \neconomy grow with these important jobs that are related to exports.\n  I again thank my colleague for being down here on the Senate floor. \nWe are not going to give up. We are going to be down here. That is \nbecause, as you know, we are having all of these budget discussions, \nand people should remember that over the last 20 years, the Export-\nImport Bank has generated $7 billion to the Treasury--$7 billion over \n20 years. So not only does it help us grow jobs, it actually has helped \nus pay down the deficit.\n  I hear a lot of discussion about budget deals and transportation \npackages and things of that nature. So, to me, if you want to put more \nrevenue back into our coffers, then support the Export-Import Bank \nimmediately and you will be recognizing immediate revenue for any of \nthese budget discussions that we are having and that we need to move \nforward on.\n  I am not under the impression that somehow all of the people in the \nSenate are now going to support this legislation and that it is going \nto move quickly, because there will still be some on the other side of \nthe aisle who don't support moving forward. But I would say that \nnumber--$7 billion over 20 years--I think it is worth a few procedural \n60-vote thresholds to get that money and to give Americans the \ncertainty that this particular program will be reinstated and that we \nwill be\n\n[[Page S7557]]\n\nback to letting hard-working Americans who build a great product get \nthe credit assurances they need to sell their products on a global \nbasis and to win in the international marketplace. That is what America \nis all about. Don't hold these people down. They are the people who \ncreated, with great ingenuity and great sweat, the great products that \nhave made our country great. So let them export their products. Don't \nmake it harder for them just because you want to win a trophy from the \nHeritage Foundation.\n  Let's get back to making sure we are making this place operate. We \nknow the majority both in the House and Senate supports the Export-\nImport Bank and the jobs it creates. Let's get this bill reauthorized \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, we have been promised repeatedly since \nthe end of June that we would be given an opportunity to reopen the Ex-\nIm Bank, that we would be given the tools to get the Ex-Im Bank \noperating and providing credit to American manufacturers.\n  If you had told me that the end of July would come and go without \nputting the Bank back in business, I would have said: That won't \nhappen.\n  If you had told me that we would go through all of August and all of \nSeptember without putting the Bank back in business, I would not have \nthought that could happen.\n  We are now at the end of October and, quite frankly, we are at the \nend of our patience--and so are American manufacturers and so are \nAmerican workers. The time to deal with reopening the Bank, the time to \nmove this legislation is right now.\n  The patience has run thin. The promises have never materialized in \nterms of moving this forward.\n  We were told in the very early stages, back when we began to move \nthis issue, that the only way we could possibly get it through the \nHouse of Representatives was if it were put on a must-pass piece of \nlegislation, something such as the reauthorization of the surface \ntransportation bill--whether we are going to have highway bills or \nwhether we are going to put it on the debt limit or whatever it is--\nbecause the House couldn't possibly move this legislation forward \nwithout any opportunity to put it on something else.\n  That myth has disappeared. That theory is no longer available. That \nargument is no longer available to anyone in this Chamber. So the \nquestion becomes this: Now that we know the will of the Congress, \nreflecting the needs of the American people, the needs of the \nmanufacturers in this country, and now that we know what the vote count \nis, why can't we get this done? Why would we tell the American public \nthat in the face of an overwhelming majority in support of a critical \npiece of trade infrastructure and legislation that we can't get it \ndone, that we have to wait even more months to see the Ex-Im Bank back \nin business?\n  We will be back. We will continue to talk about this issue. We will \ncontinue to raise the concerns that we have about further delay and \nwhat that further delay is costing. But we also are extremely grateful \nfor the work that was done in the House of Representatives against \ngreat odds to move this forward, to send a message to American \nmanufacturers: Yes, this place can function, and we will listen to you, \nand we are moving forward on getting you this critical tool to keep \npeople once again employed in your shops, to keep people once again \nworking to export the great American products to the global economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/senate-section/article/S7557-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7557-S7559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        LEGISLATION IN CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, after years of hard work the Senate \nyesterday passed legislation that will help keep the personal \ninformation of people safer, whether that personal information is in \nthe hands of your bank or your credit card holder or whomever.\n  As we know, the threat of cyber attacks is all too real. Twenty-one \nmillion Americans lost their personal information and sensitive \nbackground information at the Office of Personnel Management just this \nlast summer--21 million. As a matter of fact, the suggestion has been \nmade that many of those people were individuals who filed extensive \nquestionnaires--or responses to extensive questionnaires--in order to \nobtain a security clearance. So you can imagine the sensitivity of that \ninformation. That followed on a breach at the Internal Revenue Service \nin which the data of more than 100,000 taxpayers was stolen.\n  It is a felony to divulge Federal income tax information of a \ntaxpayer. It is a felony. Yet somehow, some way, this cyber attack at \nthe IRS was able to get data on more than 100,000 taxpayers.\n  The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act is legislation that has \nbeen long overdue, and we are, frankly, behind the curve here. But this \nbill garnered wide bipartisan support in the Senate. Now we have the \nopportunity to work with our House colleagues, who have, I believe, a \ncouple of cyber security bills, and to try to reconcile those \ndifferences in a conference committee, which is typically the way we \nreconcile those differences and competing ideas.\n  But suffice it to say that this legislation, once enacted into law \nand signed by the President, will help deter future cyber attacks and \nequip the public and private sector with the tools they need to be more \nnimble. Specifically, what it will do is allow companies and \nindividuals to share information with the government without concern \nabout losing a competitive advantage. Right now, when you are attacked \nin your company, obviously it is not something you particularly want to \nbrag about, but you do need to let the people whose information has \nbeen stolen know so they can protect themselves. But what there will be \nis more information sharing, along with some legal protections for \npeople who cooperate on a voluntary basis.\n  As Senator Burr, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee said time \nand again, there is nothing compulsory about this system. Nobody is \nforced to participate. But I think, over the long run, businesses and \nindividuals will find it in their best interest to share this \ninformation and to receive information in a way that will help protect \nour personal data.\n  The passage of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act was, \nrightly, a major priority for the Senate. As I said, I am hopeful--\nalong with our House colleagues--that we can get a bill to the \nPresident's desk for signature soon.\n  But this is just one more example--the latest example, really--of the \nproductivity of this new majority in Congress that was elected just \nlast November. We have worked hard. Without sacrificing our principles, \nwe have worked hard to find common ground, working on a bipartisan \nbasis to move legislation across the floor and to get it enacted into \nlaw that serves the best interests of the American people, such as the \npassage of the bill to help victims of human trafficking, which passed \n99 to 0 in the Senate and now is the law of the land. It was the first \nmajor effort to help the victims of human trafficking we have \nundertaken here in 25 years.\n  We have also passed out of the Senate--and we are working on \ndifferences with the House--the Every Child Achieves Act. As Chairman \nAlexander of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee \npoints out, this is a fix to No Child Left Behind. This legislation \nwill devolve power from Washington, DC, back to parents and local \ncommunities so they can have a greater say in their children's \neducation.\n  Once again we have learned the lesson, perhaps painfully, that a one-\nsize-fits-all solution does not work for everyone. We are a big, \ndiverse country. A lot of communities are better equipped--certainly \nthey are more nimble, more flexible, and more adaptive--to change \ncircumstances than the Federal Government. Even though we had the best \nof intentions with No Child Left Behind, we needed to make this \nnecessary fix and again devolve power back from the Federal Government \ndown to parents and local communities for their children's education \nwhile maintaining high standards at the same time.\n  We have also passed a multiyear highway bill. I think there were more \nthan 30 different temporary patches of\n\n[[Page S7558]]\n\nour highway bill because of the inadequacy of the highway trust fund. \nWhen you buy a gallon of gasoline, I think about 18 cents goes into the \nhighway trust fund out of that gallon of gasoline. Unfortunately, \nthough, our demands have exceeded the amount of money in that fund.\n\n  For States such as mine, we are a donor State. So we send a buck to \nWashington, DC, and we get 92 cents back. A friend of mine in the Texas \nLegislature called that Federal money laundering, and I think he is \nright.\n  But we have stepped up--the voters in Texas last year, actually--by \npassing a supplemental appropriations for highway and infrastructure \nout of our rainy-day fund. Actually, on November 7, we will have \nanother referendum in Texas to try to fill that gap between what the \nFederal Government is doing and what the State government can and must \ndo in order to meet our transportation needs.\n  By passing a multiyear highway bill, the Senate has now prompted our \nHouse colleagues to, in turn, pass their own multiyear highway bill, \nand now, perhaps later today, we will pass another short extension to \nNovember 20 and then work to reconcile those two differences and then \nget that to the President's desk.\n  That is not particularly sexy work, but it is very important. It is \nsort of what we are supposed to do in the Congress, which is to perform \nthe task of governing and helping to address the issues that confront \neveryday working American families.\n  Then just last week the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 15 to 5 to \npass, on a broad bipartisan basis, the first criminal justice reform \nthat we have done since the 1990s. I have cosponsored that legislation \nand was proud to do so. A lot of what this bill contains--particularly \nsomething called the CORRECTIONS Act--was based on a successful \nexperiment in Texas and other States where they realized that you could \nlock people up for committing crimes but someday they are going to get \nout. When they do, we have an interest in making sure, for those who \nare willing, that they are prepared for life on the outside or \notherwise they end up becoming what a young man in Houston just last \nweek or so told me. He called himself a ``frequent flier'' in the \ncriminal justice system. We know what that means. That means the \nturnstile just kept turning. He would get out and go right back in \nbecause he was woefully unprepared for life outside. So whether it is \neducation, whether it is mental illness issues, drug and alcohol issues \nor just employable skills, it is in our interest to provide incentives \nto people in prison so they are better prepared when they get out.\n  I am not suggesting that this is some sort of panacea and that all of \na sudden our prisons will be emptied and people won't commit crimes \nanymore. That is not true. But for those who can be saved, for people \nwho want a helping hand and are willing to take responsibility for \ntheir own rehabilitation, I think this legislation is very important.\n  So while we still have a lot to do, I think we can take some \nsatisfaction in the productivity that we have had--notwithstanding the \nvery challenging political environment and the polarization of our \npolitics in America today.\n  This week Members from both parties, as well as the White House, have \nbeen talking about legislation to deal with our budget and ensure our \ncountry meets its financial responsibilities. Indeed, there has been an \nannounced deal, negotiated by the leadership in the House, the Senate, \nand the White House, which the House of Representatives will be voting \non at about 5 p.m. today.\n  I think it is worth reminding everybody how we got to this point. \nStarting in June, our colleagues from across the aisle started what \nthey advertised as a filibuster summer--in other words, a strategy to \nblock any and all of the appropriations bills that come across the \nSenate floor. There are 12 of those appropriations bills. If we were \ndoing things the way we should be, we would take them up individually. \nThe American people could read them, understand them, and we could \ndebate them, hopefully improve them, and then pass them into law to \nfund some of the basic functions of our government, such as the Defense \nDepartment, for example. It is ironic that many of these appropriations \nbills sailed through the Appropriations Committee on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  Well, for the first time in 6 years, the Committee on Appropriations \nhad voted out all 12 of those bills. The reason they were able to do so \nis because under this new majority, we were able to actually pass a new \nbudget, which gave the top capped spending lines to the Appropriations \nCommittee so they could do their job to consider those spending bills, \nto rearrange priorities, and hopefully gain greater efficiency and \neconomize on the spending.\n  So even though many of our Democratic friends voted for those bills \nin the Appropriations Committee, they came to the floor and voted \nagainst them to create this huge cliff that we knew was coming on \nNovember 3 and, indeed, on December 11.\n  Senate Democrats carried this strategy of filibuster summer into the \nfall and continued to block appropriations bills, turning \nnoncontroversial funding priorities, such as our Nation's military and \nsupport for our veterans, into partisan games. That is what created \nthis so-called shutdown narrative and drama.\n  It wasn't an accident; it was a premeditated plan by our Democratic \nfriends in the minority. So, as a result, Congress was once again \nstaring down several major deadlines with little time to waste.\n  I have to say that if your attitude in Congress is ``I want 100 \npercent of what I want or I am not going to settle for anything,'' you \nare not going to get anything. It is just that simple. It is just a \nsimple fact of life that the only kind of negotiated outcomes we have \nhere are imperfect; they are flawed.\n  While this budget agreement isn't perfect--it is flawed--it does \ncontain several important priorities. First of all, the Budget Act of \n2015 doesn't raise taxes. That is important to me and certainly \nimportant to my constituents. They think this administration has raised \ntheir taxes more than enough already. This agreement lays the \nfoundation to fund the government through 2017 without a tax increase.\n  Importantly, the legislation repeals a section of ObamaCare. We will \nhave more to say about that in this coming weeks, but it repeals a \nmajor section of ObamaCare that required large employers to \nautomatically enroll their employees in the ObamaCare health plans. \nThat is a pretty big deal for a law that has been on the books since \n2010. Rolling back ObamaCare, I believe, is essential to helping the \nAmerican people meet their basic needs--to get the health care they \nwant at a price they can afford, and not based on some sort of mandate \nfrom the Federal Government. It is also necessary for the health of our \nNation's economy.\n  Perhaps from my standpoint, and I suspect the Presiding Officer's \nstandpoint, the single most important part of this legislation is it \nwill fund our military and make sure our military has the resources it \nneeds to protect us here at home and our allies around the world.\n  As part of the artificial drama that was created over this deal, the \nPresident of the United States vetoed the National Defense \nAuthorization Act. This is the fundamental law by which Congress says \nto our men and women in uniform: We are going to make sure you have the \nresources you need in order to do the job you volunteered to do. And \noh, by the way, we are also going to take care of our families because \nin the military today, with an all-volunteer military, our military \nfamilies are vitally important too. But in an incredibly cynical move, \nthe President vetoed the Defense authorization bill in order to gain \nleverage in this negotiated budget deal. It truly is shameful. It is \ninexcusable for the Commander in Chief to hold our men and women in \nuniform hostage by doing something like that.\n  We all know we are living in a world marked by insecurity at every \ncorner, from rampant instability in the Middle East to a newly \naggressive Russia in Eastern Europe and in the Arctic, and a rising \nChina that continues to--Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 \nmore minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. In addition to instability in the Middle East and an \naggressive Russia in Eastern Europe and in the Arctic, a rising China \nis trying\n\n[[Page S7559]]\n\nto expand its own territory at the expense of our allies and friends in \nthe Pacific.\n  I am glad to see the U.S. Navy challenge the phony claims of China in \nthe South China Sea that jeopardize those important sea lanes that are \nso critical to our security and to our commerce.\n  So this deal, as flawed as it is, finally provides the military and \nour military families with the resources they need in order to do the \nincredibly important job we ask them to do. If you think about all the \nareas that the Federal Government is involved in, this is the No. 1 \npriority. There is no ``Yellow Pages'' where you can look to outsource \nnational security. It is the Federal Government's responsibility, and \nit is about time we provided our men and women in uniform with the \nresources they need in order to get the job done.\n  In conclusion, this bill actually takes significant steps in \nreforming, in a fiscally responsible manner, our Social Security \ndisability system. It will provide long-term savings from changes to \nSocial Security. In fact, this will represent the first bipartisan \nreform we have had since the early 1980s.\n  I look forward to continuing to discuss this legislation with our \ncolleagues and finding a way to move forward as we face the big \nchallenges still ahead of us in the Senate. The only alternative to \nthis negotiated deal would be a clean debt ceiling increase and a \ncontinuing resolution at current spending levels, which would have a \ndevastating impact on our military and our national security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/senate-section/article/S7559-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of \nreauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank. I know some of my colleagues were here \nearlier, and I wanted to join them, but I was at a hearing over in \ncommerce. I do want to thank Senators Cantwell and Kirk for their \nleadership on this issue. I also want to thank my colleagues, Senators \nHeitkamp, Shaheen, Mikulski, and Boxer, who were on the floor today \nvoicing their strong and continued support for the Ex-Im Bank.\n  Yesterday, the House voted 313 to 118 to reauthorize the Export-\nImport Bank. That is a strong bipartisan vote that included a majority \nof Republicans. It included seven of the eight Members of the \ncongressional delegation from the State of Minnesota, including several \nRepublicans.\n  The Ex-Im Bank also has bipartisan support here in the Senate, which \nhas voted twice this year to reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank, both times \nwith more than 60 votes. Now it is time for the Senate to take up this \nbill and vote to reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank with no further delay. This \nyear, the Senate has been in the lead on this. We have shown the kind \nof bipartisan support that helped the House to get the numbers they \nneeded, and now we must simply pass the bill.\n  The Ex-Im Bank has been reauthorized 16 times in its 81-year history, \nevery time with a broad bipartisan majority. As yesterday's House vote \nand previous votes in the Senate show, the Ex-Im Bank still has the \nsupport of a broad bipartisan majority.\n  Since coming to the Senate, I have been working to boost America's \nability to compete in the global economy. I serve on the President's \nExport Council. I believe America needs to be a country that once again \nthinks, invents things, and exports to the world. We like our financial \nindustry--we have the sixth biggest bank in the country out of \nMinnesota--but we all know we can't simply rely on the financial \nindustry to keep the economy going. The economy has to be a bread-and-\nbutter economy, and that means making things, and that means exports.\n  When 95 percent of the world's customers live outside of our borders, \nthere is literally a world of opportunity out there for U.S. \nbusinesses. U.S. exports have helped expand our economy over the past 4 \nyears, reaching an alltime high of $2.3 trillion, an increase of 34 \npercent since 2009 after inflation.\n  We know there are about 85 credit export agencies in 60 other \ncountries, including every exporting country in the world. Our \nbusinesses are competing against these foreign businesses, which are \nbacked by their own countries' credit export programs and often receive \nother government subsidies. Why would we want to make it harder for our \nown companies to compete in a world where all the other exporting \nnations have an export-type bank financing authority? When our \ncompanies are competing against overseas companies for contracts, they \nneed the Ex-Im Bank.\n  In 2014, the Ex-Im Bank provided support for $27 billion worth of \nU.S. exports. This sounds like a lot, but in the same year China \nfinanced more than double that amount--$58 billion compared to $27 \nbillion--and South Korea and Germany also provided more support for \ntheir exports. If we don't get this done, Mr. President, China will eat \nour lunch.\n  If we want a level playing field for our businesses, we need to have \nthe U.S. Ex-Im Bank open and running. Do you know what our companies \nfind out right now? Well, the charter has lapsed. When these U.S. \ncompanies or our foreign competitors go to the Ex-Im Bank Web site, do \nyou know what they see on the Web site? I will tell you. I went to the \nWeb site and saw it myself. It says this: ``Due to a lapse in EXIM \nBank's authority, as of July 1, 2015, the Bank is unable to process \napplications or engage in new business or other prohibited \nactivities.'' Every one of our foreign competitors knows this is up on \nour own U.S. Web site.\n  To me, this is about jobs. As the ranking member of the Joint \nEconomic Committee, I know that in 2014 the Ex-Im Bank provided $20.5 \nbillion in financing. That supported 164,000 jobs. I know there are \nhundreds of companies in Minnesota--I think the exact number is 170--\nthat use financing authority. The vast majority of them are small \ncompanies. These small business owners, like many small business owners \nall across the country, know it is essential for their ability to \nexport. They can't have a full-time bank person in their small \ncompanies. They can't have a full-time expert on trade with various \ncountries--Kazakhstan, you name it--all around the world. They need the \nhelp of the Ex-Im Bank to know how to get this financing.\n  I visit all 87 counties in my State every year, and a lot of that \ntime is spent visiting these small businesses. Even when I don't mean \nto find an Ex-Im-type business, I find one. I heard from Fastenal and \nMiller Ingenuity, both from Winona. I have heard from EJ Ajax \nMetalforming, a leader in workforce policies. So everywhere from \nFastenal to PERMAC, an award-winning women-run manufacturer in \nBurnsville, I have found that Minnesota businesses get help from Ex-Im \nBank.\n  The time is here. We can't put it off any longer. Our colleagues in \nthe House, despite the fact that they didn't even know if they had a \nSpeaker for a number of weeks, were able to pass this bill. Now it is \nour turn. Let's get this done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/senate-section/article/S7559-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7559-S7561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PUBLIC EXPRESSIONS OF FAITH\n\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, it is just past the middle of football \nseason in America--a sad thing for a lot of us who are football fans. \nThis is the time when some fans are thinking seriously about the \nplayoffs and other fans start thinking seriously about trying to get \ntheir coach fired.\n  In Bremerton, WA, coach Joe Kennedy is in trouble not because the \nteam has a losing record but because he has the audacity to kneel down \nand pray on the 50-yard line after the football games are over and \nthank God for the chance to coach there and for the safety of his \nplayers.\n\n[[Page S7560]]\n\n  Gratitude to God is certainly not a crime in America. In fact, that \nis encouraged every year in the national prayer proclamation given by \nevery President for decades, including this one. Coach Joe Kennedy is \nthe varsity assistant coach and the JV head coach in Bremerton, WA. He \nenjoys working with the guys and coaching football. He has an excellent \nemployment record at the school and has been a great motivator of the \nguys on his team.\n  Since 2008, Coach Kennedy has had the habit of walking out to the 50-\nyard line after the game is over and kneeling down to pray. After a few \nweeks of his starting to do this in 2008, a couple of the Christian \nstudents on the team also asked if they could come and kneel down next \nto him, which they have done and he has allowed them to do. They are \nnot required to pray. They are not required to be there at all. But \nthose students have the freedom they have exercised to express their \nfaith, and so does Coach Kennedy.\n  For some reason, this season has been different. Now the district has \nasked the coach not to pray after the games. Instead, they want to \nprovide him with a private room where he can go and pray separately so \nno one will see him. I have a letter from the district where they say \nthey will give him this accommodation: ``[A] private location within \nthe school building, athletic facility or press box could be made \navailable to you for brief religious exercise before and after games.'' \nThey literally want him to go into another spot so no one will see him \npray. That seems to be the accommodation here. They are saying to him \nthat he has the freedom to pray in a location we choose.\n  The district has the fear that if anyone sees the coach praying, they \nmay think the coach endorses or that the district endorses a particular \nfaith. They wrote in a separate letter to the coach these criteria to \nsay: As we go forward, these are the standards to apply. Quoting from \nthe district:\n\n       Students are free to initiate and engage in religious \n     activity, including prayer, so long as it does not interfere \n     with the school or team activities. Student religious \n     activity must be entirely and genuinely student-initiated, \n     and may not be suggested, encouraged (or discouraged), or \n     supervised by District staff.\n\n  Second, and continuing to quote:\n\n       If students engage in religious activity, school staff may \n     not take any action likely to be perceived by a reasonable \n     observer, who is aware of the history and context of such \n     activity at BHS, as endorsement of that activity. Examples \n     identified in the Borden case include kneeling or bowing \n     of the head during the students' religious activities.\n       You and all District staff are free to engage in religious \n     activity, including prayer, so long as it does not interfere \n     with job responsibilities. Such activity must be physically \n     separate from any student activity, and students may not be \n     allowed to join such activity. In order to avoid the \n     perception of endorsement discussed above, such activity \n     should either be non-demonstrative--\n\n  In other words, you can't see it outwardly--\n\n     (i.e. not outwardly discernible as religious activity) if \n     students are also engaged in religious conduct, or it should \n     occur while students are not engaging in such conduct.\n\n  In other words, don't get near a Christian student when they are \npraying and bowing their head and also bow your head.\n  It is an odd thing that the district would worry that their actions \nwould be perceived that they may have an official policy for \nChristianity, but they don't seem to have the same worry that their \nactions to try to eliminate anyone expressing their faith would be an \nofficial policy of atheism at the campus, since if they purged all \ndisplays of faith from any person, it would appear that no faith is the \nendorsed faith of the district.\n  Under this policy, if a teacher who is a Christian sees another \nChristian student praying, they have to get away from them or at least \nwalk past them as if they are disinterested. I don't think people \nunderstand how offensive that is to our faith. If I see a student \npraying, I would want to stand by them to hear their prayer, to be \nencouraged by their prayer.\n  Under this policy, if a Christian student had been bullied at school \nand they wanted to sit by a Christian teacher at lunch, when that \nstudent at lunch bowed their head to pray over their low-calorie lunch \nmeal, at their school lunch, the Christian teacher would either have to \nwalk away or they would have to ignore their prayer, further \nostracizing the student.\n  Citizens don't lose their freedom of faith just because they also \nwork for a State or Federal agency. People can display their faith--as \nthis coach did for 7 years, and it had not been a problem for this \ncoach to kneel down and pray at the end of the game. I am confused why \nsuddenly now the district is concerned about this display of faith.\n  Individuals can display their faith personally. It is their personal \nfaith. It is not some endorsement by the district. A Wiccan teacher can \nwear a pentagram necklace. A Muslim teacher can wear a head scarf. A \nChristian can bow their head to pray at lunch, even a faculty member. A \nSikh teacher can wear a turban. All of those are outward displays of a \ncertain faith. How can a school district say that if you display your \nfaith in a way that someone else can see it and figure out that you \nhave faith, suddenly that is a violation of the establishment clause of \nthe Constitution?\n  Courts have ruled that in a school setting, prayer cannot be \nmandatory in the school, compelled by the school, led by the school. \nWhile some have a problem with this interpretation, frankly, I don't. \nI, quite frankly, think teachers have multiple different faiths and \nmultiple backgrounds, and I have the responsibility as a parent to \ntrain my child how to pray consistent with our faith. That is not the \nresponsibility of that teacher at school to be able to teach them their \nfaith. That is my job.\n  I do have a problem when an individual teacher is restrained from \npracticing their own faith or an individual student is restricted from \nthat. It is entirely different when a district states that a coach may \nnot quietly pray or allow students to voluntarily participate with a \ncoach in prayer when they share the same faith. After a game is over \nand all the players are free to leave, that is their own free time. \nThey can go to the locker room, they can talk to their parents, and \nthey can flirt with the cheerleaders on the sidelines. That is their \nown time. They can choose to do what they want to do, but they \nshouldn't be restricted from praying if they also choose to do that.\n  The Bremerton School District attorneys have chosen to apply the \nBorden v. School District of the Township of East Brunswick to this \nparticular case. In that case, the coaches couldn't lead a prayer or \nparticipate if all the players were required to be present before the \ngame. This is a required team meeting in the Borden School District of \nthe Township of East Brunswick. This is completely different. This is \nafter the game, when no player is required, no one is expected to be \nthere, and those students and those coaches are on a brief period of \nrespite after the game.\n  For some reason, in this day and age, some citizens have become \nterrified of faith in America and prayer in America. They are \nfrightened when people exercise their faith and live according to their \nsincerely held religious beliefs. So they try to quash it quietly. That \nis astounding to me--as a nation that was based on this basic principle \nof people being able to live their faith, not just to have it but to be \nable to live it.\n  If a coach went to the 50-yard line after the game, sat down on a \nlawn chair and drank a Coke, no one would have a problem. If a coach \nwent to the 50-yard line and sang Michael Jackson's ``Thriller'' and \ndid the dance moves, he would be a YouTube sensation, but the district \nwould have no problem with it. But if a coach goes to the 50-yard line, \nkneels down and prays, somehow that is a different type of speech or \naction. It is not. It is speech. It is the freedom of faith. It is who \nwe are as Americans and our diversity in America. There is nothing \ndifferent about that speech.\n  The establishment clause in the Constitution is clear: ``Congress \nshall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or \nprohibiting the free exercise thereof. . . . ''\n  This is not the freedom to have a religion. This is the freedom to \nexercise it. It is very clear in the Constitution.\n  For some in this generation, they want to talk about freedom of \nworship. You can worship and you can go to a place of worship, you can \nworship with anybody, any way you want to, if you go over there and do \nit, but they don't want people to actually come out and live their \nfaith publicly.\n\n[[Page S7561]]\n\n  We don't have freedom of worship in America. China has freedom of \nworship. We have the free exercise of religion, where we can live our \nfaith outside of our church buildings, in our private lives, even if \nyou are a public individual.\n  It is reasonable for this Congress to speak out on this issue because \nit is a First Amendment freedom. Protecting one coach's right to pray \nprotects every person's right to pray in the Nation.\n  So let me ask a question. Is the district going to engage in stopping \ncoaches from kneeling down on the sideline during the fourth quarter in \na last-second field goal attempt and prevent them from praying on the \nsidelines? That is a rich tradition in football.\n  How about this moment. Last Saturday at Oklahoma State University, we \nhad an incredible tragedy where a car careened through the homecoming \nparade, killing many and injuring many more. It was a horrible tragedy. \nIt happened just hours before the game. Players and coaches at Oklahoma \nState University walked out of the tunnel, and before the game \nstarted--when typically they would all gather and cheer together--they \ninstead chose, players and coaches, to kneel down on the sideline and \nto pray for the families who were affected by this incredible tragedy \njust hours before. This apparently offends some people, that people in \na State setting would express their private faith. Nothing was mandated \nabout this. This was a group of players and coaches, that their heart \nwas grieved for what was happening in their city and among the Oklahoma \nState family. This shouldn't be prohibited in America. This is who we \nare.\n  I don't challenge the people in Bremerton. These are all honorable \npeople who want what is best for Bremerton, WA, families. They all care \nabout their kids there. The superintendent, the principal, the coaches, \nthey all care about the kids there. This is a genuine misunderstanding \nof what our Nation protects and what our Nation stands for.\n  Article 6, clause 3 of the Constitution says this: ``No religious \ntest shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public \ntrust under the United States.''\n  In our Constitution, any individual who serves in any public trust in \nthe United States doesn't have to set their faith aside nor have to \ntake on any faith. In America, you can have a faith and live it or you \ncan have no faith at all. That is the United States of America.\n  Every day in this Chamber, including today, the Chaplain for the U.S. \nSenate begins our session in prayer. In this Chamber, the words ``In \nGod We Trust'' are written right above the main doors as we walk in, \nthe same as it is in the House Chamber above the Speaker's chair. We \nare not a nation that is trying to purge all faith. We are a nation \nthat allows people to live their faith.\n  I ask individuals in this Chamber right now who choose to, to even \npray with me as I close out this statement.\n  Father, I pray for Coach Kennedy and the leadership of Bremerton, the \nsuperintendents, and the principals. They have a difficult job, and I \npray that You would bless them today. And I pray that You encourage \nthose students, as they struggle with this basic religious freedom that \nwe have in this Nation, that there would be a unity there and a \ndecision that would be made that would clearly stand on the side of \nfreedom. For the coaches and teachers of all faiths who serve there and \nserve across our Nation, I pray that You would bless those coaches and \nteachers today. They do a difficult task. As they walk with students \nthrough difficult decisions, I pray that You would encourage them in \nYour faith.\n  Thank You, Jesus, for the way that You sustain our Nation and for the \nfreedom that we have. We ask Your help in protecting us.\n  In Your Name I pray. Amen.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/senate-section/article/S7561-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7561-S7566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUESTS--S. 2165 AND S. 697\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 270, S. 2165, a bill to \npermanently authorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund; that the \nbill be read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would \nlike to ask that the consent be modified to pass a short-term \nextension, S. 2169, with my amendment, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify his request?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I will \nnote that we secured this language an hour ago. We have no complete \ninsight on the impact of the language, and this is language more \nappropriately debated in the committee process. I wish to ask my \ncolleague to consider introducing it for action on the floor at some \nfuture point and not use it to obstruct funding or authorization of the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund. If my colleague is not comfortable \nwith such a suggestion, then I would object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator declines to modify his request.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. LANKFORD. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, this first request was to get this bill \ndone right now and reauthorized. I am going to turn to a different \npossibility, which is to secure a debate here on the floor which would \nafford my colleague from Oklahoma the opportunity to present his \nthoughts.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by the \nmajority leader, after consultation with the Democratic leader, but no \nlater than Thursday, November 12, the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 270, S. 2165; that there be 1 hour of \ndebate equally divided between the proponents and opponents; that upon \nthe use or yielding back of time, the bill be read a third time and the \nSenate proceed to vote on passage of the bill; that the vote on passage \nbe subject to a 60-affirmative-vote threshold; and, finally, that there \nbe no amendments, motions or points of order in order to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LANKFORD. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, we have now seen a demonstration. I want to \ntalk to Senator Merkley about this. I ask unanimous consent to engage \nin a colloquy with him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL. The Land and Water Conservation Fund is a piece of \nlegislation that has been in place and in law for 50 years, as Senator \nMerkley knows. It has been in place for 50 years, and it has expired. \nThere is overwhelming support for this. A number of us have signed \nletters. Senator Burr, who is here, I know has been a leader in terms \nof working on the Republican side. We have a huge amount of support, \nbut a small little group is objecting to this moving forward.\n  I say to Senator Merkley, this is showing the dysfunction that here \nwe have a bill and the leadership cannot get the bill on to the floor. \nI wanted to ask the Senator in terms of his State. I know in my State \npeople love their parks. They love the Land and Water Conservation \nFund. I think the same is true in Oregon; isn't it? This is something \nthat we shouldn't have let lapse, and we have to put it in place.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. My colleague from New Mexico is absolutely correct. For \nthese 50 years that he noted, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has \nprotected millions of acres of our land, including playgrounds and \nparks, our most treasured national landscapes--\n\n[[Page S7562]]\n\nall without costing our taxpayers a single dime. It is, without \nquestion, our Nation's most important and successful conservation and \noutdoor recreation program.\n  Oregon, specifically, has received about $300 million over the past \nfive decades, safeguarding areas that are now complete treasures for \nour State, such as the Oregon Dunes and the Hells Canyon Recreation \nArea. These special places are part of our heritage, and protecting \nthem has been made possible through this fund. It is a commitment to \npreserving these special places for future generations in Oregon and \nthroughout the Nation, and it also serves to really strengthen the \noutdoor recreation economy in our State.\n  What is a win for our heritage is also a win for our rural economy. \nThis effort to torpedo something of great value in terms of protection \nof special places and our rural economy is a step or a stride in \nabsolutely the wrong direction.\n  Mr. UDALL. I say to Senator Merkley, one of the things we face here \nis that because the Land and Water Conservation Fund has not been \nreauthorized, there are Senators who are trying to attach this to other \npieces of legislation. You and I have worked very well on the Toxic \nSubstances Control Act, which now has over 60 votes. This has really \nheld down both pieces of legislation. The Land and Water Conservation \nFund can't be reauthorized, and we can't pass the Toxic Substances \nControl Act, which has overwhelming support.\n  We are in a situation where the leadership needs to step in and say: \nBoth of these have huge support in the Senate--bipartisan support. \nLet's get a vote on them. Let's not continue to have this gridlock and \ndysfunction.\n  Does the Senator see it that way in terms of how this is playing out \non the floor right now?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I absolutely share the Senator's perspective on this. In \nterms of the Toxic Substances Control Act, TSCA, or the Lautenberg Act, \nas we now call it, this is an effort to remove--and you have championed \nthis in a bipartisan way. You have brought this forward. It has been \napproved through an extensive committee process, and we have a shot, \nfinally, to have a process in which we can take and remove toxic items \nfrom everyday products.\n  A good example is that we are standing here on a carpet, and the \ncarpet is full of flame retardants that don't really retard flames but \ndefinitely cause cancer. Having those scientifically analyzed and \nconsidered as to whether they should be in our carpets or not makes a \nlot of sense. You think of little babies crawling during their first \nmonths of life on these carpets, and their noses are right down there \nin the dust. The dust is attached to these toxic chemicals. I believe \nyour bill--this bill--not only is bipartisan, but it has more than 60 \nor at least 60 cosponsors.\n  Mr. UDALL. Yes.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Here we are with this paralyzed process where a few \nindividuals say: You know, I guess it is not important to get toxic \ncancer-causing items out of our household products. Also, it is not \nimportant that our States get flexible funds to preserve special \nplaces.\n  I suggest that rather than blocking such legislation, folks who have \nthat mind come to the floor and make their case. If they want more \ncancer for our children, come to make your case. If you don't want to \npreserve special places in America, come and make your case. But do not \nobstruct this body from being able to have the conversation.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Would the Senator consider consent to join the \ncolloquy?\n  Mr. UDALL. Please, Senator Lankford.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Thank you for letting me join the conversation.\n  The argument here is not against whether I would want or other \nMembers would want cancer-causing items or would want to have the \ndegradation. The problem is the degradation in our public parks and \nlands.\n  We have an $11.5 billion backlog in our national parks right now. \nInexplicably, the Land and Water Conservation Fund does not allow for \nthe maintenance of what we have. The U.S. Government currently manages \n29 percent of the land mass in the United States. We have a \nmultibillion dollar backlog, including in our national treasure, which \nis the national parks that are out there.\n  This amendment that I have, and which others are proposing, is to \nsimply say: Before we keep adding land--at least at the same rate we \nare adding more land--we should be maintaining that land. It is \nequivalent to if you are going to buy car, you need to at least set \naside some money to pay for gas.\n  All that we are asking for is something that has been asked for now \nfor a long time through multiple committees and multiple hearings, and \nthat is, that as we engage in purchasing new property, we also make \nsure we are setting aside dollars from the Land and Water Conservation \nFund to actually maintain what we are purchasing.\n  The dollars that are there already are a $20 billion amount that is \nset aside for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The fund continues \nto function under the current CR. Appropriations have already been \nplanned and put in place by the committees to be able to put it out \nthere. This doesn't affect the current ongoing functioning. It only \naffects new dollars coming to the Land and Water Conservation Fund. It \nis already functioning as it is. In fact, it has a 65-year account set \naside for it.\n  The challenge now is this: Are we going to maintain what we have or \nare we going to keep purchasing new lands and not maintain what we \nhave? I would say we can protect us from cancer-causing agents and we \ncan maintain what we have as well.\n  Mr. UDALL. Thank you, Senator Lankford, for that intervention.\n  I think the important point here--and I know Senator Burr is here on \nthe floor so I am going to make a unanimous consent request with regard \nto TSCA. But let me just say that I can't agree with the amendment that \nSenator Lankford has talked about. I know it is very controversial--the \nidea of taking money out of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which \nis going to the States for parks and to the Federal side for parks, and \ndedicating that to maintenance. That is something we should have done \nin budgets long ago, and the problem is we haven't had adequate budgets \nfor our parks. So we have a backlog.\n  Senator Merkley mentioned, in terms of TSCA, the health and safety of \nchildren. There is one person I want to talk about, a woman by the name \nof Dominique Browning. She works with an organization called Moms Clean \nAir Force. She worries about her kids and the toys and the products \nthey use. She herself survived kidney cancer. When she asked her doctor \nwhat caused the kidney cancer, he said:\n\n       It's one of those environmental ones. Who knows? We're full \n     of chemicals.\n\n  This is about people such as Dominique Browning, who want to see a \ncop on the beat who is going to do something about chemicals. I think \nthis dysfunction, this inability to deal with two very popular bills, \nis something on which we need the leadership to step in. The leadership \nhas the control of the floor and is able to move forward.\n  So I rise today in support of the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety \nfor the 21st Century Act.\n  Last week, the Senate missed an opportunity to move forward on this \nbill and to send it to conference with the House. I was disappointed, \nbut, I know that we can still get this done. And for the protection of \nAmerican families we must get this done.\n  The Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 is supposed to protect us. \nIt doesn't.\n  There are over 84,000 known chemicals and hundreds of new ones every \nyear. Only five have been banned by the EPA. Only five out of 84,000.\n  TSCA is broken. We all know this. It fails to protect families. It \nfails to provide confidence in consumer products. We have a chance to \nchange that. And that is what our bill will do. That is why 60 Senators \nfrom both sides of the aisle support this critical reform.\n  For decades now, the risks are there, the dangers are there, but, \nthere is no cop on the beat. American families are waiting for real \nprotection.\n  Unfortunately, last week, because of Senate dysfunction, we asked \nthem to wait a little longer.\n  They have waited too long already, because this is about our health \nand safety. This is about our children and\n\n[[Page S7563]]\n\ngrandchildren. This is about people like Dominique Browning, who works \nwith Moms Clean Air Force, who worries about her kids, and the toys and \nproducts they use every day. She herself survived kidney cancer. When \nshe asked her doctor what caused her kidney cancer, he said: ``It's one \nof those environmental ones. Who knows? We're full of chemicals.''\n  This is about people like Lisa Huguenin. Lisa is a Ph.D. scientist \nwho has done work on chemical exposure at Princeton and Rutgers and at \nthe State and Federal level. But she is a mother first. Her 13-year-old \nson, Harrison, was born with autism and auto-immune deficiencies. Five \nyears ago, Lisa testified before Senator Lautenberg's subcommittee on \nthe need for reform. She is eager to see TSCA reform pass the Senate \nand be signed into law.\n  The time for TSCA reform is now, and it may not come again for many \nyears. It has passed the House. It is ready to move through the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by the \nmajority leader, after consultation with the Democratic leader, the \nSenate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 121, S. 697, a bill \nto reauthorize and modernize the Toxic Substances Control Act; that the \nonly amendment in order be a substitute amendment to be offered by \nSenator Inhofe; that there be up to 2 hours of debate equally divided \nbetween the two leaders or their designees; that following the use or \nyielding back of time, the Senate vote on adoption of the Inhofe \namendment; that upon disposition of the substitute amendment, the bill \nbe read a third time and the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the \nbill, as amended, if amended, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask the \nauthor of this unanimous consent request to modify the unanimous \nconsent request to allow an amendment to be considered in the TSCA \ndebate, where we would take up the Cantwell-Murkowski bipartisan \nlanguage on the reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation \nFund.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify his request?\n  Mr. LANKFORD. I object to the modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma objects.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. BURR. I object to the underlying unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, we have hit a roadblock, not because of the \nsubstance, but because of a disagreement over a completely unrelated \nbill, the re-authorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. A \nbill that I, along with a majority of Senators, strongly support.\n  I respect my colleague, Senator Burr. He is a true leader on LWCF. It \nnever should have expired.\n  The reauthorization has strong, bipartisan support. Fifty-three \nSenators signed a letter led by Senator Burr recently, and I am \nconfident there are over 60 supporters.\n  I believe that we will reauthorize and continue to fund LWCF. As the \nranking Democrat on the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, that is \nan extremely high priority for me and it is extremely important to the \npeople of my State.\n  I want to work with Senator Burr. But, LWCF is being blocked by a \nsmall minority from Senator Burr's own party.\n  We have to fight that, and we will. But, TSCA reform should not be \nheld up by demands for a vote on unrelated LWCF legislation.\n  Groups like the National Wildlife Federation and others who support \nLWCF reauthorization have called to decouple the two. Other members of \nthe LWCF coalition have told me this as well.\n  The safety of American families should not be held hostage to the \nLWCF because the result is all too obvious. The safety of our children \nand grandchildren is put at risk each and every day that we delay TSCA \nreform. Is it any wonder the American people look at the Senate with \ndismay and confusion? At times like this I share their frustration.\n  Again, I respect Senator Burr. He is a cosponsor of our bill. And I \nknow he does not want a dysfunctional Senate. He fought hard to get the \nSenate to work out its differences on his cyber security legislation. \nThe Senate passed that bill this week.\n  The Lautenberg Act deserves the same push. We need cooperation, not \nultimatums. I will keep doing what I can to continue the conversation \nand move forward.\n  We cannot sacrifice the health of infants and pregnant women, of the \nelderly and our most vulnerable, to Washington gridlock and \nobstruction.\n  It has been a long road. This is a balanced bill and a bipartisan \nbill. One that Republicans, Democrats, industry, and public health \ngroups can all support. This is historic and urgently needed reform.\n  So, we won't give up. We will keep going. We aren't just Senators. \nMany of us are also parents and grandparents. We know how important \nthis is.\n  This is about the health and safety of our families too, and I \nbelieve we can do this.\n  Our former colleague, Senator Lautenberg, who began this effort years \nago, believed we could as well. TSCA reform was his last legislative \neffort, and he believed it would save more lives than anything he had \ndone. We are proud to have the support of his widow, Bonnie. I want to \nrepeat what Bonnie said so eloquently at the EPW hearing earlier this \nyear.\n  She said: This cause is urgent, because we are living in a toxic \nworld. Chemicals are rampant in the fabrics we and our children sleep \nin and wear, the rugs and products in our homes and in the larger \nenvironment we live in. How many family members and friends have we \nlost to cancer? We deserve a system that requires screening of all \nchemicals to see if they cause cancer or other health problems. How \nmany more people must we lose before we realize that having protections \nin just a few states isn't good enough? We need a federal program that \nprotects every person in this country.\n  Bonnie Lautenberg is right. How long must American families wait?\n  They have waited long enough. They should not keep waiting because of \na dysfunctional Senate.\n  Moms like Dominique and Lisa are watching and waiting and asking. \nWhat are we doing to protect their children, and the children of New \nMexico, New Jersey, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and every other \nState.\n  Reform is 40 years overdue. So, one way or another, we will pass this \nbill in the Senate. We will resolve our differences with the House, and \nthis critical reform will go to the President's desk.\n  Senator Merkley, we are here at this point where we saw--and we have \nnow been joined by Senator Markey also, and if Senator Markey wishes to \nparticipate in this colloquy, I would ask consent to do that.\n  We are at a point where we have two very popular pieces of \nlegislation that have enough votes to get them on the floor and to deal \nwith a filibuster, and we don't have the ability to do that. So that is \nwhere we are. It is time for this place to abandon dysfunction and \nabandon the kind of gridlock we see and get these bills on the floor.\n  As Senator Merkley said, if people have an objection or an amendment \nlike the Senator from Oklahoma, they can come down and offer it. I \ndon't know what my friend's thoughts are, but Senator Markey is here \nand I am sure is willing to speak on this issue also.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I think what is extraordinary about this situation is \nthat both of these bills have at least 60 cosponsors, which as Senator \nUdall pointed out is enough to close debate and get to a final vote. \nThere was a time not very long ago when even controversial bills were \nvoted on by a single majority. Unfortunately, we are now at the point \nwhere virtually every bill has to get cloture because some individual \nobjects to having a debate, even if they are not willing to stand on \nthe floor and debate it, and that is another topic. The Senator from \nNew Mexico and I have suggested that we need to change that, so if \nsomeone objects to certain legislation, that Member should be on the \nfloor speaking\n\n[[Page S7564]]\n\nabout their objection so it is transparent to the American public.\n  Nonetheless, in this situation, we already have 60 supporters for \nboth of these bills. We have 60 supporters and cosponsors for the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund and 60 supporters for TSCA--the Lautenberg \nact, which is now my colleague's act--and they are both very important \nto our country. So for us to fail to get these bills on the floor and \nact is a dramatic example of the failure of this institution to be able \nto operate as a legislature.\n  This can be cured. The majority leader could arrange to bring these \nbills to the floor. With his support and the support of the cosponsors, \nwe could get cloture to bring those bills to the floor, and that would \nnot only be a tribute to how the U.S. Senate functions, it would also \ndo important work for the people of America by reauthorizing the funds \nto protect our special places and creating a system that will operate \neffectively to get toxic chemicals out of our everyday products.\n  I think it comes as a shock to people across America that we have not \nregulated a single chemical that goes into toxic products since 1991, \nand it is absolutely unacceptable. They believe and expect that the \nitems they handle every day have gone through the process of being safe \nand that we are not poisoning ourselves, and it is very shocking to \ndiscover that is not the case.\n  These are two very important bills to our country. Both of these \nbills have 60 supporters. Let's get them to the floor and show that the \nSenate can actually be a deliberative body and that we can do good work \nfor the future of America.\n  Mr. UDALL. I thank my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I thank the Senators from New Mexico and \nOregon for their leadership on this issue.\n\n       It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was \n     the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the \n     epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity. . . .\n\n  There is a certain Dickensian quality to the Senate floor today. We \nrarely have debate on environmental bills that enjoy not only token \nbipartisan support but overwhelming bipartisan support. Today is the \nbest of times, the age of wisdom, and the epoch of belief because we \ncan debate not just one environmental bill that has overwhelming \nbipartisan support but two bills that have overwhelming bipartisan \nsupport. Yet today is also the worst of times, the age of foolishness \nand the epoch of incredulity because a handful of Senate Republicans \nhave just prevented both of these bills from even getting a vote.\n  First, we had a request to reauthorize the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, a program conceived of by John F. Kennedy, who \npresented Congress with draft legislation for it in 1963. I am proud to \nbe counted among the more than 60 Senate supporters of the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund.\n  Next, we had a request to consider reform of the Toxic Substances \nControl Act that helps to protect the American people against these \ndangerous toxic chemicals. I am proud to be a supporter of the language \nthe Senate is expected to vote on, and some have predicted upward of 85 \nSenate votes in favor of that environmental bill.\n  First, a handful of Senate Republicans will not allow a vote on the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund because they don't like the program, \nand then other Senate Republicans who do like the Land and Water \nConservation Fund will not allow a vote on TSCA because we couldn't act \non the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  This is nothing short of absurd. It is hard enough to reach a \nconsensus in the U.S. Senate on any issues, much less environmental \nissues, but some of our colleagues seem determined to snatch defeat \nfrom the jaws of victory.\n  Shouldn't we be able to make this the best of times on both of these \nbills while we have the chance to do so instead of perpetuating the \nworst of times view that Americans increasingly have of the ability of \nCongress to get its job done?\n  I hope all of my colleagues can come together so we can agree that \nhere, where there are far more than 60 votes on the Senate floor for \ntwo historic environmental bills--that we do not allow for a small \nhandful of Members to be able to stop both bills from being able to \neven be considered on the Senate floor.\n  Yesterday's agreement on the debt ceiling and on having the budget go \nforward is how Congress should be operating. We should take the big \nissues, try to work together, and understand that there are going to be \ndifferences of opinion, but when there is overwhelming support for \nlegislation, we should be able to move forward.\n  I thank the Senator from New Mexico. I thank all who have worked on \nthis issue on a bipartisan basis. This bill has vastly improved the \nTSCA bill from where it was months ago, and I highly recommend it to my \ncolleagues on the Senate floor. The Land and Water Conservation Fund is \nsomething that goes back so many decades, and it is central to a \ncontinuation of the commitment that each and every State in our country \nis able to make on two environmental programs.\n  I hope we can find a way of resolving this issue because it is time \nfor us to take action on the Senate floor on these two critical \nenvironmental issues.\n  I yield back to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Let me stand and take all the blame. I am the guy holding up the \nchemical bill, TSCA.\n  This is the greatest deliberative body in the world. This is an \ninstitution that has never shied away from any debate or any vote, and \nwe proved it last night as we passed a very technical, difficult cyber \nsecurity vote. We can take on tough issues and we can weed through \nthem, but what we are doing today is a charade. We said that at 12 we \nwould come down here and that there would be competitive unanimous \nconsent requests. It is a joke. It is an absolute joke. We forced the \nPresiding Officer to be here to object, knowing he strongly objects to \nthe legislation.\n  There is one guy who has been trying to facilitate this, and that is \nSenator Inhofe. Throughout the whole process he has tried to work it \nout, but the fact is maybe we are at a stalemate. To suggest that I \nshouldn't have the opportunity to amend any piece of legislation is to \ntake every right I have as a U.S. Senator. To come to the floor and \nchastise any Member because they would like to amend legislation--that \nis why we were sent here by our constituents from our States.\n  If we look back at over 200 years of history, we know this body \ndoesn't allow the biggest State to win. It allows every State to have \ntheir voice heard and every Member has the right to provide input on \nbehalf of their constituents.\n  Let me say to the authors on both sides that I am going to hold up \nthe chemical bill until there is an opportunity for me to either amend \nit or to offer the Land and Water Conservation Fund and permanently \nextend it on another piece of legislation. It is plain and simple.\n  We can come and do these unanimous consent requests, we can feel good \nand go home and look and say: Here is what I did. I am on both sides of \nan issue. If that works, then do it.\n  I will be brave enough to tell everyone I am the guy holding it up. I \nam holding it up because I am an equal Member of the U.S. Senate. I am \nnot scared to debate TSCA, and I am not scared to debate the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund because that is what this institution was \ncreated to do.\n  I sort of get the impression that we set this up to determine who is \nmore committed to something. That is what the vote is for. It is not \nabout the talk or the debate, it is the vote. If we can't get to the \nvote, it is difficult to determine who is for something and who is \nagainst it.\n  Let me say to my colleagues that the Land and Water Conservation Fund \nwas set up over 50 years and receives\n\n[[Page S7565]]\n\nits funding off the royalties of the exploration on offshore oil and \ngas; 87.5 percent of it goes to the general revenue fund of the Federal \nGovernment and 12.5 percent goes to the Land and Water Conservation \nFund.\n  The Land and Water Conservation Fund was never set up to handle \nmaintenance at any State or Federal facilities. It was set up to allow \nindividual treasures to be preserved by leveraging Federal dollars \nagainst private and State dollars to take in parcels, such as the \nAppalachian Trail, to take buffer pieces against things like the Blue \nRidge Parkway, to protect a certain treasure in a State where the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund went in and matched with private dollars \nand then turned around and turned it over to the State for a State \npark. The benefit is if it is private land, there is no access, but \nwhen it is public land held by the State, fishermen and hunters can \naccess it for recreational use and can now use that State park.\n  I am exactly where the Presiding Officer is. I don't want to increase \nthe Federal footprint of what we own, whether it is land or buildings. \nI want to get out of the business of ownership. I only want to preserve \nthose things that up to this point we have determined are valuable to \nfuture generations, and that is not by increasing the size of those \nFederal holdings, it is just about protecting those Federal \nholdings. And when we talk about protecting and providing for \nmaintenance, let me suggest that it is a conversation we need to have \nwith appropriators because they are getting 87.5 percent of the royalty \nsplit.\n\n  The Land and Water Conservation Fund, when we originally conceived \nit--I admit I was not here 50 years ago; I think John McCain was the \nonly person who might have been around--it was envisioned when that \nfund was created that when we take something from the land, we put \nsomething back. So when we take resources, we are going to protect \nsomething over here. It was also the direction of the legislation that \n$900 million a year go into this Land and Water Conservation Fund. We \nhave averaged over those 50 years somewhere in the neighborhood of \nabout $385 million a year.\n  The Presiding Officer stopped me one day and he said: What about the \n$20 billion in the fund? There isn't any $20 billion in the fund. \nAppropriators spent that every year. They get the royalty split 100 \npercent, 20 percent goes over into this fund, they appropriate X, and \nwhat is left over they spend, along with the other 87.5 percent.\n  Do we want to do maintenance in national parks? Appropriate it. The \nmoney is there, and it is not taxpayer money. We are collecting it off \nof royalties on expirations. And it is very important that we do that \nmaintenance. It is also important that the National Park Service \nprioritize maintenance over every other thing that is funded when \nmaintenance is eliminated. But I think we have to understand it is not \nan either/or. We can be good stewards and invest in how we leverage \nFederal dollars with private dollars and also invest in the maintenance \nof existing facilities. If that wasn't the case, States would be up \nhere crying for more money, more money, more money to maintain their \nparks. But they understand that is their responsibility and they budget \nfor it.\n  As I sat here a little while ago, I thought this was more reminiscent \nof an episode of ``Star Trek.'' I was waiting for somebody to say, \n``Beam me up, Scotty.'' This is crazy. I will agree with my good friend \nfrom New Mexico--maybe it does take leadership making a decision that \nwe are going to do both of these, but the leader doesn't control things \nwhen we get the debt ceiling from the House. He doesn't control what \nlegislation we have to do. Let's face it--we don't have to do either \none of these. If we did, the Land and Water Conservation Fund after 50 \nyears would not have expired.\n  I might say I came to the floor and I begged at the time that I would \nbe satisfied if we just extended for 60 days the Land and Water \nConservation Fund in TSCA. We could have debated it and voted on it \nwith just one amendment. But some said: No, not a 60-day extension; we \nwant it to expire. Well, it has expired, and the price to bring it back \nis permanent reauthorization. It is no longer 60 days or 90 days, it is \npermanent reauthorization. Why? Because this may be the best Federal \nprogram we have ever run. It is not funded with taxpayer money. It \ntakes those royalty moneys and it leverages against State and private \ndollars to maximize the preservation for the next generation. Name \nanother program that does that. Name another program that doesn't stick \ntheir hand in the taxpayers' pocket, that leverages it with private \ndollars to maximize the impact of it. This program does it day in and \nday out in all of the States in the United States.\n  I could argue today that I would love to see as part of the amendment \nthat North Carolina gets a bigger share of that. But, as the Presiding \nOfficer knows, with me, that is sort of left up to appropriators \nbecause they are the ones who decide where the money goes. I am not \nhere to prosecute them, but I am here to say to my colleagues: Let's \nquit being foolish. Let's have an honest debate on two different bills \nor put them together. I have heard that we can't amend TSCA and put \npermanent reauthorization in because then it stands a chance of not \npassing in the House. Bull. I just say bull to that. Give the House a \nchance. There are just as many people over there who support the \npermanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. They \nare not all captured in the U.S. Senate. Why? Because a majority of \nAmerica is for permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund. Why wouldn't they be? It is their future. It is \nabout their children and their grandchildren.\n  I will end with this. To all of my colleagues, this is not about us. \nNo piece of legislation that we bring on this floor, we debate, and we \nvote on is about us. If it is, we are nothing better than a crisis \nmanagement institution. This is about generations to come. This is \nabout our children and our grandchildren. And when we look through that \nwindow at the issue, we understand the stewardship we assume. We assume \nstewardship in the way we spend taxpayers' money, we assume stewardship \nin the direction of this country, we assume stewardship in the impact \nwe have globally around the world, and we assume stewardship when we \ntalk about taking care of this footprint God gave us.\n  I remember the debate as we got ready to build a visitors' center \noutside. I remember the history lessons that the more senior Members \ngave me at the time when I said: It will cost a lot of money. We can \nbuild it on top of the ground for about half the cost as we can build \nit underneath the ground.\n  I was given the history of this building being the byproduct of a \nbill through Congress called the Residence Act in 1790. Congress \nappropriated 500,000 taxpayer dollars to build it. When the British \ncame, the building wasn't finished, but they were nice enough to burn \nwhat we had built. Most of the exterior was saved. The interior needed \nto be totally redone. Congress ended up appropriating another chunk of \nchange, and the original Capitol design was not completed until 1823. \nAnd by 1823, the footprint needed to increase because the size of the \nSenate and the House had grown; therefore, we needed more space.\n  I remind my colleagues that at the original time, we had housed in \nthis building the House, the Senate, the Library of Congress, and the \nSupreme Court. And we started this wing--what we are in--in the Senate \nand the wing in the House. Outside they look identical; inside they are \nvery different. But when they did that, they doubled the length of the \nCapitol, and they actually had to then take off the Bulfinch dome of \nwood and copper sitting on a sandstone base, and they built the dome we \nknow today--cast iron, 9 million pounds, still suspended on that \noriginal sandstone and limestone base.\n  Since 1863, when the Statue of Freedom was lowered on top of this \nCapitol, it has looked exactly the same. I have said for 21 years that \nmy responsibility is to make sure that 100 years from now and 200 years \nfrom now, it looks exactly like this on the outside. That was the \ncompelling reason for spending twice as much money to put the Capitol \nVisitor Center underground where it didn't obstruct what is a \nhistorical footprint of America's history.\n  This building--walk around it. It is a museum of American history--to \nthink that an Italian artist could depict\n\n[[Page S7566]]\n\nscenes in American history probably better than Americans, but he \nunderstood why this country was created, and that influenced his \nartwork throughout the Capitol.\n  Let me just suggest to my colleagues that maybe it is time for us to \ngo back on a tour of the Capitol, to realize that our Founders came \nhere not to accomplish anything for themselves but to make sure their \nchildren and their grandchildren had something better. And when we \nstart looking at our jobs the same way they looked at creating this \ncountry and the same way they looked at preserving this building, then \nI will assure my colleagues we will settle issues like this in the way \nthat the Senate functions and functions well, and that is in debate and \nin votes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, what just happened here, just so we can \nallow the American people to understand, was the really honest, sincere \neffort on two bills that have overwhelming support--the Land and Water \nConservation Fund and the Frank Lautenberg 21st Century Chemical Safety \nAct--we wanted to get these on the floor so that we can have debate and \nhave amendments. It is exactly what just happened in the last week and \npart of this week on the cyber security bill. We got a bill on the \nfloor, there were amendments, we invoked cloture, and then we passed \nthe bill at the end of the day. That is what we are trying to do.\n  Individual Senators don't have control of the floor. They do have the \nability to come to the floor and ask to put bills on the floor, and \nthat is what happened here. Senator Merkley showed up and asked to put \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund bill on the floor, with specific \noutlines, and it was objected to. I asked to put the Frank Lautenberg \n21st Century Chemical Safety Act on the floor, and it was objected to. \nThat is the only power we have. The leadership has the ability to \ncontrol the floor, and that is why we are on the floor speaking about \nthis.\n  So this was in no way a charade; this was an honest, sincere effort \nto try to do everything we can to make sure that everything is \ntransparent here in terms of who is objecting, who doesn't want things \nto move forward, and who is for moving forward on two very popular \nbills.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in a period of morning business.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know there is a 10-minute limit; however, \nI do not see anyone else seeking the floor, so I ask unanimous consent \nto continue for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/senate-section/article/S7566-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7566-S7567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SENATE CAREER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this is really a personal speech. I was \nvery grateful for the indulgences of my fellow Senators who allowed me \nyesterday to make a few observations after I cast my 15,000th vote. I \nwould like to elaborate a bit more.\n  I have never lost sight of what a great opportunity and \nresponsibility the Senate affords this Senator from Vermont, day after \nday, to make things better for Vermonters and for all Americans, to \nstrengthen our country and ensure its vitality on into the future, to \nforge solutions in the unending quest begun by the founders of this \ncountry to form a more perfect union.\n  Over the last 40 years, I have been blessed to be able to serve with \nsome of the giants of the Senate: Mike Mansfield, Howard Baker, Robert \nByrd, Walter Mondale, Hubert Humphrey, Bob Dole, George Mitchell, and \nmy mentor when I came here, then-senior Senator from Vermont, Senator \nBob Stafford. I would note that I became the only Democrat ever elected \nfrom my State. Senator Stafford was really ``Mr. Republican'' in \nVermont. And I wondered what the relationship would be. He immediately \ntook me under his arm and guided me and worked with me, and there \nwasn't a day that went by that we didn't consult and I didn't gain from \nhis wisdom and experience.\n  There are so many others. Marcelle and I have made close friendships \non both sides of the aisle, like Senator John Glenn and his wife Annie, \nwho were Democrats, and Senator Cochran and Senator Lugar, Republicans. \nI had the privilege and have had the privilege to serve with more than \n370 Senators in all from different walks of life and every corner of \nthis Nation, these different backgrounds, different stories, and \ndifferent life experiences, both parties. And this has made this \ninstitution the greatest deliberative body in the world.\n  I cast my first vote in this Chamber in 1975. It was a resolution to \nestablish the Church Committee. The critical issues of the post-\nWatergate era parallel issues we face today.\n  I also had a front-row seat, a bit part in an historic effort, \ninitiated by a Democrat--Senator Mondale of Minnesota--and a \nRepublican--Senator Pearson of Kansas--to change the Senate's earlier \ncloture rule, which had been abused for decades in thwarting the will \nof clear majorities of the American people on such crucial issues as \ncivil rights reforms.\n  That project might not sound difficult, but changing the way the \nSenate operates is something akin to trying to change the weather.\n  Late--actually very late one night--in a lengthy, difficult debate--\nand we sometimes went around the clock--Senator Mondale and Majority \nLeader Mansfield enlisted me, the most junior Senator, to play a role. \nThey asked me to stay on the floor one night around 2 in the morning to \ntake the gavel as the Presiding Officer. They expected that a lot of \ntight rulings were coming up. I felt so honored, but I did feel the \nhonor drain away as Senator Mansfield explained, no, no, they just \nneeded somebody big, 6-foot-3, 200 pounds, and who was still awake, to \nbe the Chair for those rulings, in case tempers flared. Sometimes a \nSenator is no more than a conscious body in the right place at the \nright time.\n  But among those 15,000 votes I have been proud to cast on behalf of \nVermonters, some were Vermont-oriented, some national, some global: the \norganic farm bill, the charter for what has become a thriving $30 \nbillion industry--I fought for years for that and got it through with \nbipartisan support; stronger regulations on mercury pollution and \ncombating the effects of global warming; emergency relief for the \ndevastation caused by Tropical Storm Irene. In that case, Senator \nGrassley, who spoke on the floor yesterday--I recall the morning after \nthat storm, flying around the devastated State of Vermont. The first \ncall I got was from Senator Grassley saying, ``You Vermonters stood \nwith us. We will stand with you.'' How much that meant, based on \nrelationships that were built over the years.\n  We adopted price support programs for small dairy farmers. We fought \nfor the privacy and civil liberties of all Americans. I remember \nsupporting the Reagan-O'Neill deal to save Social Security--President \nRonald Reagan and Democratic Speaker Tip O'Neill. We fought for \nnutrition bills to help Americans below the poverty line, joined by \npeople like Bob Dole and George McGovern. Bipartisan--strongly \nbipartisan--campaign reform in McCain-Feingold. The bipartisan Leahy-\nSmith Act on patent reform was the first reform in 50 years. I worked \nwith Mike Crapo from Idaho to reauthorize and greatly expand and \nstrengthen the Violence Against Women Act.\n  I was proud to oppose the war in Iraq, a venture that cost so many \nlives and trillions of taxpayer dollars. Serving on the Armed Services \nCommittee in April of 1975, I became the first and only Vermonter to \ncast a vote to end the war in Vietnam, and by a one-vote margin, we cut \noff authorization for the war.\n  Every significant legislative success I have had has been achieved \nthrough\n\n[[Page S7567]]\n\nthe often slow process of methodically building bipartisan coalitions. \nA breakthrough in the Senate Judiciary Committee last week in beginning \nto come to grips with criminal justice reform is a fresh example of \nthis and so was enactment this summer of the electronic surveillance \nreforms in our USA FREEDOM Act.\n  I would remind everybody, we are not alone in this body. Legislative \nwork in a democracy in large part is the art of compromise. Compromise \nis essential in assimilating and digesting competing points of view and \ncompeting interests, which are all the more diverse in a large and \nheterogeneous nation like ours. We are not just some small nation made \nup of just one particular class of people. The remarkable strength of \nthe United States is that we have people who came here from all over \nthe world and made us a strong nation. And I think we Senators keep \nfaith with our core values as we listen to the perspectives of others. \nInsisting on our way or no way at all is a surefire recipe for \nstalemate, to the great detriment of the entire Nation and the people \nwe represent. As Winston Churchill once said: ``The maxim, `nothing \navails but perfection,' may be spelled shorter: PARALYSIS.''\n  Some measure of self-restraint is essential for a legislative body in \na democratic republic like ours to function. Louis Brandeis once said, \n``Democracy substitutes self-restraint for external restraint. It is \nmore difficult to maintain than to achieve.'' He was right. Self-\nrestraint in a democracy is not an easy virtue.\n\n  In the previous Congress, as President pro tempore, I had the \npleasure of accompanying Chaplain Barry Black to the podium as he \noffered the morning invocation. I like to think--maybe it is more that \nI like to hope--that some of his inspiration rubs off on us, at least a \nlittle, each day. One morning years ago, for instance, he said: ``Give \nthem (the Senators) the stature to see above the wall of prideful \nopinion.'' We can each point to each other, the other 99, and say: See, \nthat is for you. We have to remember it is for us, too, each one of us.\n  I was talking, my wife Marcelle and I, last night about 15,000 votes. \nIt didn't seem possible when I came here as a junior Member of the \nSenate. I also know there is a lot more work to do. I hope we can \nrestore the bipartisan campaign finance reform that so many in this \nbody--Republicans and Democrats--supported. I hope we can restore the \nhistoric and foundational Voting Rights Act. I hope we continue to \nfight to support our farmers, who give us food security and are the \nvery fabric of this country. We are a nation that can feed ourselves. I \nthink we should fight against government overreach in the wake of \nnational security threats. Sometimes going into all our private matters \nis itself a national security threat. We should do more to support our \nveterans and their families. When they come back from war, we should \ncontinue that support. We should expand education opportunity for all. \nMy family came to Vermont in the 1850s. I became the first Leahy to get \na college degree and my sister, the second one. We hope our children \nand grandchildren will have the same educational opportunities. We \nshould rebuild the American middle class and offer helping hands to \nlift all Americans out of poverty. We should fund our roads and \nbridges. We build roads and bridges in other countries in wars where \nthey sometimes get blown up. Let's build some in our own country where \nwe need them. We should pass appropriations bills, not continuing \nresolutions. Pass them every year, each year. It is a lot of work, but \nnot an insurmountable goal. It will take good will and bipartisan \ncooperation to achieve them.\n  We 100 Senators should never forget that we are but the public face \nof an institution that is supported by thousands of hard-working staff, \nour office aides and policy experts--my own, of course, among the best \nin the Senate--the Capitol Police, the folks who keep order and help to \nshowcase this great building to millions of tourists, and those bright \nand dutiful Senate pages in the well of this Chamber, all of them are \npart of the Senate family.\n  The Senate at its best can be the conscience of the Nation. And I \nhave seen that happen over the years when we've risen up together and \nexpressed the conscience of the Nation. And I marvel in the fundamental \nsoundness and wisdom of our system every time it does. We can't afford \nto put any part of the mechanism on automatic pilot. It takes constant \nwork and vigilance to keep our society working.\n  It is easy for politicians to appeal to our worst instincts and to \nour selfishness. Political leaders serve best when they appeal to the \nbest in us, to lift our sights, summon our will, and raise us to a \nhigher level. I still get a thrill every time I walk in this building \nand walk out on this floor, knowing the history of this place, just \nknowing I am going to be a part of that history. Senators have come and \ngone, but I have had one partner through these 15,000 votes: my wife, \nMarcelle. We came here in 1975 with three wonderful children: Kevin, \nAlicia, and Mark. Alicia was here in the Chamber yesterday representing \nher husband, Lawrence, and their children. And I remember my parents \nand Marcelle's parents visiting often. I remember how much they enjoyed \nvisiting here, seeing what we are doing. But I think they especially \nwanted to visit their three grandchildren. Well, now I look at our \ngrandchildren--Roan, Francesca, Sophia, Patrick, and Fiona--and I \nunderstand how my parents felt.\n  I am so grateful to my fellow Vermonters for the confidence they have \nshown in me. It is a measure of trust that urges me on and which I will \nnever betray or take for granted.\n  As I have reflected on these 15,000 votes, it reminds me of the \nsignificance every time we vote, why I feel energized about what votes \nlie ahead, and how we can keep making a difference.\n  I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer for his forbearance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to reflect on the comments the \nsenior Senator from Vermont has shared. I want to say to Senator Leahy \nthat what he has reflected in the course of his career of casting \n15,000 votes, spanned over four decades in the Senate--some would say \nthe courtliness, the gentlemanliness, the bipartisanship, the \ndeference, the respect, the honor--some would say these are old-\nfashioned ideas.\n  This Senator happens to feel they are American values, and how often \nhave we seen those characteristics not on display? Tonight the House of \nRepresentatives is going to pass not only raising the debt ceiling so \nwe can pay our bills but also a budget template--a blueprint--under \nwhich we can then appropriate the specifics.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for one moment?\n  Mr. NELSON. Absolutely.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from Florida and I have been \nfriends for decades. To get this praise from a man who served with \ndistinction as a Congressman, a Senator, and an astronaut means a great \ndeal to me. I thank him.\n  Mr. NELSON. The Senator is very gracious, but I stood to comment upon \nthe characteristics he has exemplified in his public life that is a \nrole model for all of us. I was about to say, here we are seeing \ntonight that the U.S. Congress is going to be able to move ahead \nwithout falling off the fiscal cliff because there is going to be a \nbipartisan vote in the House of Representatives. My goodness gracious, \nisn't this what it is supposed to be all about?\n  The Senator from Vermont can remember well over 30 years ago when \nthis Senator was a young Congressman, and the role models in the House \nof Representatives at the time were Tip O'Neill and Bob Michel--the \nDemocratic speaker and the leader of the Republicans. They had their \nfights, and at the end of the day they were personal friends. They had \na personal relationship. They then could work out all the thorny \nproblems and build consensus in order to govern.\n  I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/senate-section/article/S7567-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7567-S7568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRANSPORTATION BILL\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I came to talk about the Transportation \nbill. We have it in front of us. Transportation has laid the foundation \nof our country's success, whether it was\n\n[[Page S7568]]\n\nHenry Ford, who showed us how to do mass automotive manufacturing, \nrevolutionized the manufacturing of cars, whether it was Henry Flagler, \nwho built a railroad on an unsettled land along the East Coast of \nFlorida, brought in the development of my State, whether it was the \nWright brothers--these guys were much more than bicycle shop owners. \nThese guys were geniuses who studied the movement of birds. They were \nthe first ones to be able to figure out how--what they called it in the \nday--a heavier-than-air flying machine could do that. These ideas, and \nover the years the investments, helped make this country become a \nglobal leader in almost everything.\n  With regard to transportation, we have gotten off course. Rather than \nmaking big investments, we keep kicking the can down the road. Today's \nextension--short-term extension, I might say--of the highway trust fund \nis one more example of this because it is just putting off what we have \nto do, which is improve our roads, our rails, and our port \ninfrastructure. That means we have to increase the investments in our \ninfrastructure and focus on the area that will not only create jobs and \nsupport our economy but will rehabilitate this infrastructure. Our \nroads are crumbling. Our bridges are crumbling. Remember a few years \nago when the bridge collapsed on the main interstate highway in \nMinnesota--killing a number of people, injuring others. Our \ninfrastructure is crumbling. We need to do these investments in our \ntransportation infrastructure to make sure it is safe.\n  In July the Senate stood tall. We had a Republican chairman and a \nDemocratic ranking member, Senator Inhofe and Senator Boxer, and they \ncame together just like that--like it is supposed to be around here--\nand they passed the highway bill. We call it the highway bill, but it \nincludes a lot more: ports, rail, highway safety, all the things that \ngo on with building a new road, such as sidewalks. We passed that. It \npassed overwhelmingly. It passed overwhelmingly bipartisan--but then \nyou get to the point of how in the world are we going to pay for it.\n  That bill included many important provisions that will keep workers \non the job. For the first time, the bill included a freight rail \nprogram that aims to improve freight across all types of \ntransportation--not just freight but trucks, ports. Of course, what \nthis is going to do is it is going to help us move goods more \nefficiently, whether they are traveling through a port or on rail or on \nthe highways.\n  For the first time, this highway reauthorization was a bipartisan \nreauthorization of Amtrak. Amtrak was last reauthorized 2 years ago--\nway back in 2013. With a strong commitment from the commerce committee \nchairman, Senator Thune, all of us on the committee were able to \ninclude provisions that will improve our passenger rail systems. In the \ncommerce committee, we fought to improve safety and increase \ninvestments in our infrastructure. There were many provisions--\nespecially on trucking and vehicle safety issues--that needed to be \nimproved. What we put in the bill was to prevent rolling back safety \nimprovements in transportation.\n  Here we are. Today we need to pass this bill so we can quickly get to \nwork on the final bill. This is a stopgap temporary message. I urge the \nHouse to work toward a bipartisan compromise like the Senate bill \nrather than weigh the bill down with a whole bunch of ideological \nthings, safety rollbacks and giveaways to industries. This highway bill \nis too important to get mired in partisan politics. For us to maintain \nthe safety, efficiency, and growth of our transportation system, \nCongress must put an end to the instability caused by what we are going \nto have to do today, which is a short-term extension. We can only do \nthis by working together to find commonsense and bipartisan solutions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/senate-section/article/S7568-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7568-S7570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               OBAMACARE\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it has been a while since I have come to \nthe Senate floor to talk about the shortcomings of the so-called \nAffordable Care Act--a few months at least. The last time I spoke about \nObamaCare on the floor, I spoke at some length about the ever-\nincreasing insurance premiums that had resulted from the law's \ndraconian mandates and regulations.\n  Sadly, as I rise to revisit this subject, things haven't gotten \nbetter for ObamaCare. In fact, if the Obama administration's own \nestimates are to be believed, things are actually getting much worse. \nAs we all know, this Sunday, November 1, marks the beginning of the \n2016 open enrollment period for the ObamaCare health insurance \nexchanges. This is an important milestone for the health care law in \nlarge part because President Obama and his supporters have, since the \nday the law was passed, repeatedly promised that as Americans become \nmore familiar with how the law works, the more they will grow to love \nit.\n  ObamaCare proponents wrote off problems in the first year of \nenrollment as glitches that were to be expected as the country \ntransitioned to a new health care system. Problems in the second year \nwere similarly dismissed as necessary growing pains as everyone learned \nfrom the mistakes that were made the previous year. Now, as we approach \nthe third year of enrollment, supporters of the President's health care \nlaw are running out of excuses. At this point, most reasonable \nAmericans--including many who may have initially been huge supporters \nof this endeavor--expect the system created under the law to work the \nway it was designed to work.\n  You know what? The law is working the way it was designed to work. \nThe problem is, it is not working the way the designer said it would \nwork. At the time the law was drafted, the architects of ObamaCare said \nthey can impose all new mandates and regulations on the insurance \nmarket, requiring massively expanded coverage above and beyond consumer \ndemand, claiming that any increased costs that resulted from these \nrequirements would be offset when more young and relatively healthy \nconsumers were forced to buy insurance or pay a fine. Of course, they \nonly called it a fine when they were drafting the law and initially \nselling it to the American people. Now a few years and a Supreme Court \ndecision later, we were all supposed to call that fine a tax, but I \ndigress.\n\n  My point is that those who drafted the President's health law and \nthen subsequently forced it through Congress on a strictly partisan \nbasis said their new system would expand health coverage for everyone \nwithout increasing costs. In fact, they went further. They claimed that \nit would actually bring costs down. However, due to the way the law was \nactually designed, it was never going to work that way.\n  No matter how many ad campaigns the government charged to the \ntaxpayers and no matter how many talk shows the President went on to \nencourage hip, young audiences to enroll in the exchanges, the numbers \nwere never going to add up. This is true for one simple reason: For all \nthe attention the drafters of ObamaCare paid to expanding coverage and \nremaking the health insurance industry, they did not do anything to \nreduce the actual costs of health care in America.\n  The problems with ObamaCare are not due to bad marketing, they are \nthe result of fundamental design flaws. Health care costs are the \nbiggest barrier keeping participants out of the insurance market. \nHealth care costs are among the main factors contributing to wage \nstagnation for American workers. And health care costs continue to be \nthe single largest problem plaguing our Nation's health care system. \nYet despite the obvious problems, health care costs were all but \nignored when the so-called Affordable Care Act was being drafted, and \nthe few provisions in the law that were aimed at bringing down costs \nwere either poorly conceived, terribly implemented or both.\n  For example, we had the Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan Program, \nor CO-OP Program, which was created\n\n[[Page S7569]]\n\nto encourage the development of a nonprofit health insurance sector. \nSpecifically, under the CO-OP Program, HHS dealt out $2.4 billion in \nloans to 23 nonprofit startup plans. Many of which were headed not by \ninsurance or health care experts but by political activists with no \nactual business experience.\n  Almost immediately we began to hear reports of mismanagement in the \nprogram and poor decisionmaking at the CO-OPs themselves. Earlier this \nyear, the HHS Office of Inspector General reported that 21 of the 23 \nCO-OPs that received loans under the program--loans that were supposed \nto last for 15 years, by the way--had suffered staggering losses. This, \nof course, was not surprising given the inexperience of many of the \nfounders of the CO-OPs and the lack of oversight and accountability at \nHHS with regard to the program.\n  While a nonprofit insurer may not be focused on avoiding losses, one \nwould assume that, at the very least, staying in business would be a \npriority. Yet, over the last several months, 10 of the 23 CO-OPs have \nhad to close their doors, with more failures expected in the near \nfuture. The latest CO-OP failure was announced just yesterday and took \nplace in my own home State of Utah, hitting pretty close to home for a \nnumber of people in my State who are just trying to find affordable \nhealth insurance.\n  Every time one of these CO-OPs fails, they leave patients and \ncustomers in the lurch. A failed CO-OP in New York that was called \nHealth Republic and was considered by many to be a flagship for the \nloan program will leave more than 150,000 customers looking for new \ninsurance when its doors close at the end of the year. And, of course, \n$2.4 billion is hardly chump change. Yet that is how much the American \ntaxpayers have shelled out to these CO-OPs, and as of right now, it is \nunlikely that any of that money is ever coming back.\n  Despite these obvious problems with ObamaCare, we hear a constant \ndrumbeat from my friends on the other side of the aisle that the law is \na smashing success. My friends and colleagues have gotten very good at \ncherry picking favorable data points to make these types of claims. \nThey will cite an enrollment number out of context or a premium \nprojection that is slightly smaller than one that came before it as \nevidence that ObamaCare is working and that the only problems with the \nhealth care system they so graciously gifted to the American people are \nthe terrible Republicans who have dared to raise objections.\n  I expect that as time wears on and the number of isolated-yet-\nfavorable data points continues to get smaller and smaller, more people \nwill see this ruse for what it is. Case in point, earlier this month \nthe Department of Health and Human Services released its latest \nprojections for enrollment in the ObamaCare exchanges. For anyone who \nhas an interest--political, financial or otherwise--in defending the \nAffordable Care Act, the numbers are not good, and I am being kind when \nI say that.\n  The Obama administration projects that in 2016, roughly 1.3 million \npeople will newly enroll in the exchanges. Now, 1.3 million may sound \nlike a big number, however, as always, context is important here. When \nthe law was originally passed in 2010, the Congressional Budget Office \nprojected that we would see an increase of about 8 million enrollees on \nthe exchanges in 2016 compared to 2015. Now HHS is predicting that \nenrollment will be less than a quarter of that projection.\n  It gets worse.\n  In 2010 CBO also projected that by the end of 2016, roughly 21 \nmillion patients would be enrolled in plans purchased on the exchanges. \nNow, HHS projects that the number will likely be less than half of \nthat, probably a little more than 10 million people. In other words, \nall the rosy claims and predictions we heard at the time the law was \npassed about the impact these new exchanges would have on insurance \nmarkets and premiums were based in large part on the assumption that \ntwice as many people would enroll. Now, by its own terms, ObamaCare is \nbecoming a bigger failure by the day.\n  Unfortunately, I am not done.\n  HHS also estimates that there are 19 million Americans who earn too \nmuch income to qualify for Medicaid but still qualify for ObamaCare \nexchange subsidies who still have not enrolled. According to their \nnumbers, a little less than half of these people buy insurance off the \nexchange without getting subsidies, leaving more than 10 million people \neligible for subsidies on the exchanges but still uninsured. The \nadministration also says about half of that eligible-but-uninsured \npopulation is between the ages of 18 and 34 and that nearly two-thirds \nof them are in excellent or very good health.\n  In other words, a huge portion of those refusing to purchase health \ninsurance on the exchanges, even though they are eligible for ObamaCare \nsubsidies, are the same young and healthy consumers that the Affordable \nCare Act was designed to coerce into the health insurance market in \norder to subsidize all of the new mandates and regulations imposed \nunder this law.\n  The exchanges are failing to attract the very customers they need in \norder to stay afloat. If they cannot attract more of this prized \nDemocratic base, the ObamaCare exchanges--and with them the entire \nObamaCare system itself--will collapse under their own weight.\n  The question now becomes this: What is keeping these young and \nhealthy consumers from enrolling on the exchanges? Why are millions of \npeople opting to pay a fine and forego coverage rather than purchasing \nhealth insurance with the aid of a government subsidy? The answer, for \nanyone who wasn't listening earlier, is costs. According to a recent \nsurvey by the nonpartisan Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the vast \nmajority--nearly 80 percent--of uninsured Americans who have looked for \ninsurance said that after weighing everything, they could not afford \nthe purchase.\n  Sadly, the cost problem is only getting worse. As we learned earlier \nthis year, insurance plans in markets across the country have been \nrequesting dramatic increases in their premiums, and those increases \nhave been confirmed as the enrollment date has drawn closer.\n  Just yesterday I had a number of representatives from hospitals in \nNew York and around New York City say they cannot continue to handle \nall of the nonpaying emergency room customers. They don't know what to \ndo, and they are in danger of losing the health care systems they have \nestablished.\n  In Minnesota, for example, there are five insurance carriers on the \nexchange. In 2016, all five will be offering insurance policies with \nrate hikes in the double digits between 14 and 49 percent.\n  In Oregon, premiums for the second lowest cost silver plan on the \nexchange, the benchmark plan, will go up by about 23 percent. In \nAlaska, that hike will be more than 31 percent. In Oklahoma, consumers \non this benchmark plan will see an increase of more than 35 percent in \ntheir monthly premiums.\n  My own State of Utah will not be immune to this trend, unfortunately. \nLast week, the Deseret News reported that on average insurance rates \nfor plans on Utah's federally run exchange will be 22 percent higher \nnext year.\n  Keep in mind that these numbers only reflect premiums and do not take \ninto account potential increases in total out-of-pocket costs, which \ncan include things such as copayments or deductibles.\n  In a sense, all of this creates a vicious, self-perpetuating cycle. \nThe plans on the exchanges, even with the ObamaCare tax subsidies, are \ntoo expensive for millions of the young, healthy consumers whom the \nexchanges need in order to keep the costs down. As a result, not enough \nmembers of this valuable demographic segment purchase insurance, \ncausing plans to become more expensive and leading more insurers to \ndrop out of the marketplace.\n  None of this should be surprising. From the outset, opponents of \nObamaCare, including myself and many of my Republican colleagues, \npredicted this exact outcome. The cycle moves in only one direction: \nhigher costs, fewer choices, and a health care system that offers \npoorer and poorer care to the American people. Absent some sort of \nindependent and intervening action to bring costs down, there is no \nscenario in which this gets better. It will only get worse.\n\n[[Page S7570]]\n\n  I know that some of my colleagues have some specific intervening \nactions in mind. For example, they would like to see the Federal \nGovernment not only regulate the products offered on the insurance \nmarket, but the prices as well. And when the inevitable happens--when \nno private insurance provider can remain profitable in an environment \nwhere both product and price are set by the government--these same \ncolleagues will, of course, want the government to step in and provide \na plan of its own. In fact, that was what was in many of their minds at \nthe beginning--socialized medicine. They figured this would push us \ntowards it, and it certainly will if we don't change course. Soon \nenough, because only the government will be able to provide health \ninsurance without the pesky need to turn a profit, the government's \nhealth insurance will be the only available option.\n  I don't want to imply base or bad motives on the part of those who \nsupported health care--by the way, it was a totally partisan vote--but \nlet's be honest about what is going to happen here. A vast group of \npeople on the left are really hoping that the government can do it all, \nand the government will pay for everything. Somebody has to feed the \ngovernment too.\n  Well, in the eyes of many--including, I believe, a number of my \ncolleagues here in Congress--the only way to end the downward spiral we \nare currently facing under ObamaCare is, as I have said, to create a \nsingle-payer health care system. In other words, socialized medicine--\nwhere the government provides health care for everybody. We can imagine \nhow the costs are going to go up when that happens.\n\n  I made this very claim back in 2010 when the Affordable Care Act was \npassed, and left-leaning politicians and pundits said it was a paranoid \nscare tactic. But now, as ObamaCare's downward spiral is becoming more \nobvious, I suspect that my argument is seeming less farfetched by the \nday.\n  Fortunately, the march toward a single-payer system is not our only \noption. We can take action right now to right this ship. We can control \ncosts. We can take government out of the equation and give patients and \nconsumers more choices.\n  There are a number of ideas out there that would accomplish these \ngoals. One of them, of course, is the plan Senator Burr and I have \noffered, along with Representative Fred Upton in the House. Our plan is \ncalled the Patient CARE Act. I have spoken about it at length a number \nof times here on the floor and elsewhere. While ours is not the only \ngood plan out there, a number of respected health care experts have \nanalyzed the Patient CARE Act and concluded that it would, in fact, \nbend the cost curve and make health care more affordable for everybody.\n  Once again, the failure to bring down costs is easily the biggest of \nObamaCare's many failures. Our plan would ensure that Congress does not \nrepeat that failure.\n  I am well aware that health care policy is a contentious topic around \nhere. I know there are a myriad of views and no shortage of fierce \ndisagreements on virtually all aspects of our failing health care \nsystem, but right now, it should be clear to everyone that the so-\ncalled Affordable Care Act was grossly misnamed. The law has failed to \nmake health care more affordable, and it has failed to correct far too \nmany of the problems that have long plagued our Nation's health care \nsystem. The sooner more of our colleagues--particularly those on the \nother side of the aisle--recognize and admit this failure, the sooner \nwe can begin to work together on a plan that will deliver real results \nfor the American people and not continue on this spiraling downward \npath of moving toward socialized medicine where we have one-size-fits-\nall medicine for the people in this country and, frankly, government \nrunning it. That has never worked, and it is not going to work in this \ncountry.\n  We need to revamp this program, and we have needed from the beginning \nto do so. I hope people will listen. I hope the citizens out there will \nstart to pour it on and let everybody know that this is a disaster and \nthat there are ways we might be able not only to stop the disaster, but \nalso to increase good health care, excellent health care for the \nbenefit of our people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/senate-section/article/S7570-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7570-S7571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRANSPORTATION BILL AND POSITIVE TRAIN CONTROL\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak about a piece of \nlegislation that is pending before the Senate and is expected, as I \nunderstand it, to be considered tomorrow, and that would be a short-\nterm extension of the Transportation bill.\n  While I am tired of short-term extensions of transportation bills, it \nis my understanding that in this particular case a short-term extension \nwill lead us to a long-term transportation bill. I certainly welcome \nthe opportunity to consider something that would meet the needs of our \ncountry--its infrastructure needs, our highways, roads, bridges--for a \nnumber of years to come. We have to get to the point at which we are \ndealing with issues over a longer period of time than we do when we do \na short-term extension.\n  It is also important for us to make certain there is certainty so \nthat the Kansas Department of Transportation and other departments \nacross the country, as well as highway contractors and those who use \nour highways, can have certainty in what the transportation system--the \nroads, bridges and highways--is going to be.\n  There is another issue of uncertainty that is out there, and it has \nto do with positive train control. Included in the legislation, \nextending the time for us to consider a transportation bill, is a \nprovision that extends the deadline for the final implementation of \npositive train control, a safety issue that has long had consideration \nhere in Congress, and we are well on our way to having positive train \ncontrol in our rail transportation system, both passenger and freight. \nBut we need to have an opportunity for that implementation to occur \nover a slightly longer period of time than what was originally planned \nwhen positive train control became a mandate, a requirement upon our \nrailroads.\n  I am pleased that we are going to consider an extension of the \nTransportation bill that puts us in a position to deal with a long-term \ntransportation bill. I am also pleased--and I wish to spend just a \nminute or two speaking--about a provision that is included in that \nextension, and that deals with extending the positive train control \nimplementation.\n  I wish to thank my colleague from South Dakota, Senator Thune. He is \nthe chairman of the committee that I am on, the commerce committee. I \nthank him for his leadership in advancing this effort and allowing us \nthe opportunity to deliver the certainty that we need on this important \nissue.\n  There is no allegation that those who are implementing positive train \ncontrol are inattentive or that they lack desire; there is no \nsuggestion that it is an undue delay, that they are not doing what \nneeds to be done. Every indication we have from all experts is it has \nnothing to do with a lack of commitment of the railroads; it has to do \nwith the fact that we can't get there in the time that we had hoped for \noriginally when we set forth this requirement.\n  We know there is a pending implementation date, a deadline of \nDecember 31. We know it is unattainable. It is unattainable despite the \nfact that billions of dollars have already been spent to get PTC \ninstalled as quickly and as safely as possible. However, the reality is \nthat without an extension of that deadline beyond December 31, \nrailroads and shippers--that deadline to take the necessary precautions \nto alter their service standards is imminent. In other words, if they \nhave to comply, they are going to change their schedules, and that has \ntremendous economic consequences to businesses that depend upon rail \ntransportation. It creates a significant problem in contingency \nplanning required by a shutdown of the supply chain that uses rail \ntransportation. Congress needs to act now.\n  There are suggestions that I understand from a number of my \ncolleagues that the extension we are going to presumably be voting on \nin the next day--that the vote be delayed or that the extension be \nshortened. I want to express my conviction that it is necessary for \nCongress to act now, not later. Our Nation's economy cannot afford--\nthose who work in Kansas in agriculture, including our farmers and \nranchers, and\n\n[[Page S7571]]\n\nthose who work in manufacturing, as well as our laborers in the \naircraft industry--cannot afford a rail disruption that would occur if \nwe don't do this extension immediately. We need to extend the deadline. \nAs I say, it could have a devastating impact upon thousands of \nmanufacturers, farmers, ranchers, and certainly the passengers who \nutilize rail transportation--who use Amtrak and other passenger \nservices across the country.\n  I would indicate to my colleagues that just a few weeks ago my \ncolleague from Montana, Senator Tester, and I joined in a bipartisan \neffort to ask our colleagues to express the need for this extension, \nand we were successful in getting 43 Senators, 12 of whom were \nDemocratic Senators, to sign a letter encouraging our leadership to \nbring forth this issue. So in a very bipartisan way, with broad \nagreement, this extension needs to occur.\n  Incidentally, the House passed this extension by unanimous agreement. \nAgain, apparently there was little controversy or no controversy; it \npassed by voice vote. So we have significant bipartisan support, \nbicameral support. The House has already acted, and it is time for us \nto do so.\n  I wanted my colleagues to know that many in this Chamber have \nencouraged this to occur. We are on the precipice of it happening, and \nwe ought not allow it to be delayed or shortened. The extension needs \nto occur this week. The vote needs to occur this week. The extension \nneeds to be for a sufficient period of time to send that message of \ncertainty and give the rail industry the opportunity to come into \ncompliance in a timeframe that is reasonable and manageable.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/senate-section/article/S7571-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7571-S7574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor for a very unusual \nreason this afternoon. It has to do with an attack on for-profit \ncolleges by a longstanding campaign by certain groups and individuals \nwho have been opposed to for-profit colleges. They were able to destroy \none out in California, and they are continuing to attempt to make those \nattacks work on other for-profit colleges.\n  This is a very unusual situation because what we are seeing take \nplace are conclusions being drawn and action being taken--in this case \nby the Department of Defense--without due process, as a result of \npressure exerted by a Member and Members of the Senate, which then has \nresulted in action without due process.\n  Last week there was a very interesting editorial in the Wall Street \nJournal entitled ``Obama's For-Profit Stealth Attack. The Pentagon \npunishes Phoenix on orders from Senate headquarters.''\n\n       Earlier this month the Defense Department cut off military \n     tuition assistance to new students at the for-profit \n     University of Phoenix, which enrolls about 9,300 \n     servicemembers at its 105 campuses nationwide.\n       Defense's reasons for discharging Phoenix are vague: A \n     review ``in response to allegations published by the Center \n     for Investigative Reporting'' in a June drive-by on the \n     college found minor breaches in decorum.\n\n  Let me emphasize that. I say to my colleagues, there was a story \nwritten by an outfit called the Center for Investigative Reporting--I \ndon't know anything about them, and I am sure the Department of Defense \ndoes not. But as a result of an investigation by an outfit that none \nhave ever heard of, then action was taken by the Department of Defense. \nIt was not a Department investigation. There was no scrutiny. This is a \nremarkable case of the Senate exerting influence in a way which is, I \nthink, almost unprecedented.\n\n       To wit, Phoenix had distributed unauthorized ``challenge \n     coins,'' which commonly denote tokens of recognition, with \n     military insignia. Yet many non-military outfits including \n     the University of Miami, Boeing and Intel--\n\n  And I would point out Southern Illinois University--\n\n     hand out such coins.\n\n  It is not an uncommon practice to hand out coins.\n\n       Phoenix's real offense, according to the Center for \n     Investigative Reporting--\n\n  Remember, this has nothing to do with the Government of the United \nStates--\n\n     is using the coin to ``imply military support'' for the \n     college.\n\n  My friends, at least 100 institutions in America give out challenge \ncoins. I wonder if those institutions have committed grievous crime in \nthe view of the CIR.\n\n       Defense also censured Phoenix for failing to obtain \n     approvals from the ``responsible education advisor'' to \n     sponsor events on military bases.\n\n  First, it is good to sponsor military events on military bases. Lots \nof organizations, lots of companies, lots of corporations sponsor \nevents on military bases. In this case, although the responsible \neducation advisor was not consulted, the commanding officer of the base \nwas consulted and gave his approval.\n\n       Yet as the CIR article showed, military officials have \n     welcomed the university onto their bases.\n\n  They welcomed them because they were honoring those who serve--\nremarkable.\n\n       Phoenix didn't navigate all the correct bureaucratic \n     channels.\n       In any case, as Defense acknowledges, ``the University of \n     Phoenix has responded to these infractions with appropriate \n     corrective action at this time.''\n\n  So as minor as these offenses may have been and technical in nature, \nthey have taken the corrective action, but still a Senator wants them \npunished.\n\n       But political general Dick Durbin, the Illinois Democrat \n     who is leading the charge against for-profits in the Senate, \n     nonetheless commanded the Pentagon to ``bar the company from \n     further access to servicemembers.''\n       So the department is putting Phoenix on ``probation'' \n     because it finds the ``scope of these previous violations'' \n     to be ``disconcerting.'' What's really disconcerting--\n\n  According to the Wall Street Journal.\n\n     --is the Obama Administration's politicization of military \n     policy. Defense also cites ``inquiries'' by the Federal Trade \n     Commission and California Attorney General Kamala Harris.\n       To be clear, Phoenix hasn't been charged with wrongdoing. \n     According to the Defense Department, 96% of the university's \n     servicemembers successfully completed courses, a higher rate \n     than the public Central Texas College . . . and nonprofit \n     Liberty University. . . . In essence, the Obama \n     Administration's military tribunal is punishing Phoenix for \n     being a target of the political left.\n       Yet this is the White House standard of due process, so \n     Phoenix should be nervous.\n\n  I say to my friends and colleagues, they are nervous.\n\n       Last year the Education Department, Consumer Financial \n     Protection Bureau and Ms. Harris mounted a coordinated \n     campaign that drove for-profit Corinthian College out of \n     business without ever proving misconduct.\n\n  This is why I say to my colleagues that I am on the floor because \nclearly, without any proof of misconduct, with the power of the U.S. \nSenate, the Department of Education, the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau, and Ms. Harris, they were able to drive a college out of \nbusiness. And it is obvious what this is really all about. This is all \nabout the constant attacks on for-profit colleges, which is an anathema \nto some.\n  Continuing:\n\n       Over the last five years, Phoenix enrollment has dropped by \n     half to 220,000 students due largely to the left's assault on \n     for-profit education, which has knee-capped recruiting. . . . \n     Military tuition assistance makes up less than 1% of \n     Phoenix's revenues. However, many servicemembers who are \n     seeking vocational skills later pursue bachelor's and masters \n     degrees at the university under the GI Bill. Veterans make up \n     20% of the university's enrollment, and many need the \n     flexibility of Phoenix's online courses as they earn a living \n     while going to school.\n\n  Most of our veterans, because of their age, have to earn a living \nwhile going to school.\n  The article continues:\n\n       The Administration's ostensible goal is to discredit \n     Phoenix and choke off veteran recruitment. But the casualties \n     of its attack will be servicemembers who will now have fewer \n     educational options and opportunities.\n       Meantime, General Durbin has commanded the Education \n     Department and Department of Veterans Affairs to ``take \n     appropriate action'' against the company. Bombs away.\n\n  I wish to point out that recently Senator Alexander, the chairman of \nthe\n\n[[Page S7572]]\n\nHELP Committee, Senator Flake, and I wrote a letter to Secretary \nCarter. I will quote from it:\n\n       We strongly believe that these earned benefits and \n     educational opportunities for our servicemembers should not \n     be jeopardized because of political or ideological opinions \n     of some Members of Congress regarding the types of \n     institutions that provide postsecondary education to our \n     troops. . . . However, it is our understanding that Ms. \n     Bilodeau's decision--\n\n  She is the person who is the DOD's voluntary education partnership \nhead--\n\n     and threats of termination of participation in the TA program \n     rely on overly technical violations of the MOU.\n\n  What we are saying is we want due process, and these questions that \nhave been asked--we hope we can get an answer sooner rather than later.\n  Because Senator Durbin wrote also to other agencies of government, we \nare also writing to them.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter to the Secretary of Defense from Senator Alexander, Senator \nFlake, and me.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 22, 2015.\n     Hon. Ashton Carter,\n     Secretary, Department of Defense,\n     Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Carter: We write to ask that you review an \n     October 7, 2015, decision by Ms. Dawn Bilodeau, Chief of \n     Voluntary Education for the Department of Defense (``DoD''), \n     to place the University of Phoenix (``the University'') on \n     probationary and potential termination status with respect to \n     its participation in the DoD Tuition Assistance (TA) Program \n     for active duty military personnel. We strongly support \n     efforts to monitor the integrity of colleges and universities \n     serving our nation's servicemembers. However, based on our \n     review of the relevant documents associated with this \n     decision, we are concerned that the DoD's decision is unfair, \n     requires additional review, and may warrant reconsideration.\n       The TA program is an important benefit that enables active \n     duty military personnel to choose a postsecondary education \n     program that best fits their needs to enhance both career and \n     personal goals. The program also serves as an important tool \n     for the DoD to further the recruitment and retention efforts \n     of our nation's volunteer armed forces. We strongly believe \n     that these earned benefits and educational opportunities for \n     our servicemembers should not be jeopardized because of \n     political or ideological opinions of some Members of Congress \n     regarding the types of institutions that provide \n     postsecondary education to our troops.\n       As you know, the University of Phoenix participates in the \n     TA program through the DoD's Voluntary Education Partnership \n     Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), which conveys the \n     commitments and agreements between colleges and universities \n     and DoD and ensures that the TA funds are spent wisely to \n     support servicemembers attending quality educational \n     programs. However, it is our understanding that Ms. \n     Bilodeau's decision and threats of termination of \n     participation in the TA program rely on overly technical \n     violations of the MOU, fail to acknowledge any of the \n     University's corrective action or pledged cooperation and are \n     based, in part, on unsubstantiated allegations associated \n     with inquiries not initiated by the DoD.\n       With respect to the University's violation of DoD policies \n     on the use of official seals or other trademark insignia with \n     ``challenge coins,'' Ms. Bilodeau's letter concedes that \n     ``the University of Phoenix has responded to infractions with \n     appropriate corrective action at this time.'' While the \n     University has remedied this infraction, we are concerned \n     that traditional public or private, non-profit universities, \n     including Southern Illinois University, utilize similar \n     challenge coins with impunity. (See attached photographs.) We \n     remain skeptical that the DoD is evenly and uniformly \n     enforcing its policies on all institutions of higher \n     education and appears to be unfairly singling out certain \n     institutions of higher education based on a letter from the \n     Vice Chairman of the Defense Subcommittee of the Senate \n     Appropriations Subcommittee. (See Letter to Secretary of \n     Defense, June 30, 2015, attached.) It has also come to our \n     attention that on the evening of October 20th, DoD issued \n     additional new guidance on the use of these coins clearly \n     indicating that the regulatory field remained vague and was \n     not settled.\n       With respect to the University's apparent failure to obtain \n     specific approval for conducting partnership activities at \n     several military installations, it is our understanding that \n     the University obtained approval from the respective base \n     leadership to sponsor, sometimes at their request, \n     partnership events. While the University may have technically \n     violated the MOU's requirement that the University coordinate \n     with the Education Services Officer, those who have served in \n     the military readily understand and respect the chain of \n     command. Approval from the base leadership should be \n     sufficient to meet the requirements of the MOU regardless of \n     the Education Services Officer's involvement and, should not \n     be cited as a basis for probation and possible termination.\n       More concerning, however, is Ms. Bilodeau's rationale to \n     suspend participation in the TA program based on requests for \n     University documents by two government agencies that are not \n     in fact the DoD. It is worth noting that a request of \n     documents does not indicate a violation or admittance of \n     guilt. In fact, Ms. Bilodeau appears to agree, indicating \n     that the allegations by other entities have not yet been \n     substantiated. However, without fair warning or a sufficient \n     opportunity to be heard, the DoD informed the University of \n     Phoenix that, among other things, ``no new or transfer \n     students at your institution will be permitted to receive DoD \n     [tuition assistance]'' and it is actively considering \n     terminating its MOU with the University. Ms. Bilodeau's \n     decision to give the University fourteen (14) days to respond \n     to the probation decision effectively puts the University in \n     the position of having to respond to reviews undertaken by \n     agencies other than the DoD. These actions seemingly assume \n     the guilt of the University before they are proven and ignore \n     the remedied infractions identified by and directly within \n     the jurisdiction of the DoD.\n       The University of Phoenix has a long history of serving \n     working adults and others for whom traditional university \n     schooling is unavailable, including more than 200,000 \n     enrolled civilian and military students spread out across \n     more than 100 locations in 17 states. With almost 20,000 \n     faculty and 8,800 staff in every state and the territories as \n     well as just over 1,400 faculty and 6,300 staff in Arizona \n     alone, the University of Phoenix is a significant member of \n     the Arizona and broader higher education community. Like any \n     organization that chooses to partner with the DoD to serve \n     our servicemembers, the University has a legitimate \n     expectation to be dealt with fairly and reasonably. Given our \n     aforementioned concerns, we believe that the DoD's \n     decision should be evaluated for considerations of \n     fairness and cooperation and ask that you independently \n     and carefully review this bold decision.\n       To help us obtain a better understanding of the DoD's \n     actions in this matter, and to help ensure that all \n     institutions of higher education--for-profit, public and \n     private, non-profit colleges and universities--are held to \n     the same standard of conduct relative to DoD rules and \n     regulations, we ask that you provide us with the following \n     information by October 30th before you take any additional \n     action on this matter:\n       1) What are the specific, factual, and evidentiary bases \n     for the DoD's recent decision to place the University of \n     Phoenix on probationary status?\n       2) Did anyone besides Ms. Bilodeau review this decision? \n     Please provide any internal decision memorandum that reflects \n     that decision when it was originally made.\n       3) Please describe why the DoD official who reviewed the \n     decision believes he/she can place the University on \n     probation when, as Ms. Bilodeau stipulates in her October 7th \n     letter, the University has already remedied identified \n     infractions of the MOU?\n       4) Please provide all documents, including communications \n     from Members of Congress, or their staff, and any outside \n     party regarding the University of Phoenix and this matter. \n     Also, provide the guidelines relating to the establishment of \n     a probation sanction or imposition of probationary status \n     against the University of Phoenix.\n       5) Please provide a list of all institutions of higher \n     education participating in the DoD's Voluntary Education \n     Partnership and/or Tuition Assistance programs that have been \n     placed on probationary status in connection with a violation \n     of their MOU; the reasons each of those schools were placed \n     on probationary status; and whether each such school was \n     given opportunity to make corrective actions before being \n     placed on probationary status.\n       6) Please provide a list of those schools where the DoD MOU \n     was terminated and the reasons for such termination.\n       7) Is it the DoD's practice to place both for-profit and \n     not-for profit universities on probation when another federal \n     or state agency makes a civil investigative demand for \n     documents? If so, please identify other instances where this \n     has taken place and the reasons for taking such action.\n       8) Please list those schools that currently use or \n     previously used challenge coins with DoD official seals or \n     other trademark insignia; indicate whether such schools \n     obtained prior DoD authorization for such use; describe any \n     sanctions imposed for such use; and provide any documents or \n     correspondence relating to such use or sanction \n     determination.\n       9) Please describe the military chain of command as it \n     relates to the MOU and a decision by the base leadership to \n     permit an institution to sponsor an event on base.\n       10) If this probationary period is extended or the MOU with \n     the University of Phoenix is terminated, how many active duty \n     military personnel do you estimate will be impacted by this \n     decision?\n       The TA program is critical to our nation's servicemembers' \n     educational and career opportunities, primarily to prepare \n     them to serve in positions of increased responsibility within \n     the military, but also to prepare them to transition to \n     productive civilian careers. While we support efforts to root \n     out waste, fraud, and abuse, we hope that you will review \n     this situation with great caution and care. The Senate \n     Committee on Health,\n\n[[Page S7573]]\n\n     Education, Labor and Pensions is additionally in the process \n     of reauthorizing the Higher Education Act and exploring ways \n     to ensure quality at all of our colleges and universities is \n     of utmost importance and concern.\n       We look forward to your timely response and should you have \n     additional questions, please feel free to ask your staff to \n     contact our Chiefs of Staff Pablo E. Carrillo (Senator \n     McCain), at (202) 224-7123; Chandler Morse (Senator Flake), \n     at (202) 224-4521; and David Cleary (Senator Alexander) at \n     (202) 224-8798.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John McCain,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n                                                       Jeff Flake,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n                                                  Lamar Alexander,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. We sent these letters to the Veterans' Administration and \nto the Department of Education requesting that they notify us if \nfurther action is taken against the university. We sent these letters \nbecause we feel that the Department of Defense's decision and threats \nof termination of participation by the University of Phoenix in this \nprogram were done simply because the Senator from Illinois sent a \nletter to the Department of Defense highlighting an outside \ninvestigative report--an outside investigative report--suggesting \nwrongdoing on the part of the University of Phoenix.\n  Let's be clear again. There was no due process here. That is what I \nwant--due process. If the University of Phoenix is guilty of some \nwrongdoing, I want to be one of the first to make sure the proper \npenalties are enacted. I do not--I repeat--I do not believe that on the \nbasis of a single investigative report, that action should be taken.\n  With this in mind, I was stunned to hear once again that the Senator \nfrom Illinois is insisting that the DOD not reverse its decision. Given \nhis own involvement in the matter, his suggestion that the DOD not \nreverse its decision just because Members of this body conveyed concern \nabout the merits of its probationary decision and the fundamentally \nunfair way that the DOD made it is, in fact, ridiculous.\n  The whole matter arose from the Senator from Illinois pressuring the \nDOD to take adverse action against the university. His case was based \nnot on an affirmative finding by the Department that the university \nengaged in any newly identified acts of substantial misconduct but a \nreport by an outside investigative group. He then sent letters to the \nDepartment of Education and Department of Veterans Affairs asking for \nsimilar action.\n  After further review of the DOD's decision, it is my opinion that, \nNo. 1, it relies on overly technical violations of a memorandum of \nunderstanding that the university signed with the Department of Defense \nregarding its participation in the Tuition Assistance Program; No. 2, \nit fails to reflect the actions the university has taken to correct and \nidentify violations; and No. 3, it is based in part on unsubstantiated \nallegations associated with inquiries for information by other \nagencies, not findings of new violations.\n  In other words, with our letter, we asked Secretary Carter to review \na lower level decision to put the university on probation where even \nthe DOD conceded, in its very letter to the university announcing its \ndecision, that ``the University of Phoenix has responded to infractions \nwith appropriate corrective action at this time.''\n  With respect to the university's proposed violations of DOD policies \non the use of official seals or other trademark insignia with \n``challenge coins,'' we understand the university has remedied this \ninfraction. But it is worth noting that traditional public or nonprofit \nuniversities, including Southern Illinois University, utilize similar \nchallenge coins with impunity. I remain skeptical that the DOD is \nevenly and uniformly enforcing its policies on all institutions of \nhigher education and appears to be unfairly singling out certain \ninstitutions of higher education based on a letter from the Senator \nfrom Illinois.\n  With respect to the university's apparent failure to obtain specific \napproval for conducting partnership activities at several military \ninstallations, it is our understanding that the university obtained \napproval from the respective base leadership to sponsor, sometimes at \ntheir request, partnership events. While the university may have \ntechnically violated the MOU's requirement that the university \ncoordinate with the education services officer, those who have served \nin the military readily understand and respect the chain of command. \nApproval from the base leadership should be sufficient to meet the \nrequirements of the MOU regardless of the education service officer's \ninvolvement.\n  By the way, the education service officer did not turn this down; \nthey just were not consulted.\n  In the absence of significant, substantiated findings regarding new, \nuncorrected violations, the Department of Defense decided to suspend \nthe university from participating in the Tuition Assistance Program \nbased on document requests by two government agencies that are not, in \nfact, the Department of Defense and does not indicate a violation or \nadmittance of guilt.\n  We call on our service men and women to serve and protect our \ninterests, often at great cost to themselves and their families. Yet \nthe Senator from Illinois suggests that they are not capable of \nchoosing their own path when determining their postsecondary \neducational needs.\n  By the way, on a technical violation of the budget agreement, the \nSenator from Illinois was one of the leaders in voting against the \nDefense authorization bill, which was the result of many years of work.\n  In all cases, opinions should absolutely not be used to essentially \ntarget a valued member of Arizona's education community. The University \nof Phoenix has a long history of serving nontraditional students, such \nas Active-Duty military and others who tend to delay enrollment after \nhigh school, work full time, have dependents, or are single parents for \nwhom traditional university schooling is unavailable. The University of \nPhoenix has graduated more than 80,000 military and veteran students \nwith postsecondary degrees.\n  A recent Wall Street Journal article I quoted--and contrary to the \npreference of this administration, and for the sake of our \nservicemembers who earned and rely on this educational benefit, I \npromise I will not let this issue go.\n  The State of Arizona is proud to have the University of Phoenix as a \nmember of its higher education community.\n  As the questions that I posted in this letter show, I will continue \nto look into this action based on the merits of DOD's decision, not \nideological grandstanding.\n  Recently, as a result of this, I received letters from three students \nwho recently graduated from the University of Phoenix.\n  Andrew Workman of North Carolina said:\n\n       University of Phoenix allowed me to work 50 hours a week \n     and pursue my degree at the same time.\n\n  Ryan Zulkoski of Nebraska received his master's in nursing \ninformatics in 2013. He said:\n\n       I loved my experience and UOPX has opened so many doors for \n     me.\n\n  Jim Wallace of Florida said:\n\n       I am a UOPX graduate, MBA 2006 and veteran of the US Navy \n     Reserve. In my opinion UOPX led the way in educating working \n     professionals. At the time I started my program, no other \n     institutions offered the ability for me to successfully \n     complete my studies, care for my family and work a demanding \n     job. The bottom line is that it was challenging and I worked \n     hard to complete my degree.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have these comments by \ngraduates printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Andrew Workman (North Carolina) joined the United States \n     Navy in 2006. After serving 4 years on active duty he is \n     transitioned into the United States Navy Reserve in which he \n     continues to serve not only his country but his fellow \n     Sailors through the Hire Heroes USA organization. \n     ``University of Phoenix allowed me to work 50 hours a week \n     and pursue my degree at the same time.'' Andrew attended a \n     ground campus and found the classes to be diverse and \n     challenging. ``The team projects and presentations helped \n     build my confidence and laid a foundation for me to be \n     successful in the workplace. You have to work with people \n     from all walks of life in the real-world and University of \n     Phoenix built that into their curriculum.''\n       Ryan Zulkoski (Nebraska) received his Master's in Nursing \n     Informatics in 2013. Ryan has been in the Army National Guard \n     for 12 years and served one deployment to Iraq in 2005 and \n     has many other accomplishments and memberships, including a \n     humanitarian deployment to Nicaragua and participation in \n     Army Honor Guard. He used every last benefit to receive his \n     bachelor's in nursing from University of Nebraska and his\n\n[[Page S7574]]\n\n     master's degree with UOPX. ``UOPX has helped me build an \n     educational foundation to work in a field that I am extremely \n     passionate about.'' Ryan found the quality of the program to \n     be on par with his undergraduate from University of Nebraska. \n     ``I graduated from UOPX in 2013 and have doubled my salary as \n     a Nurse in less than 2 years. I also have 4 children and a \n     wife, so attending a traditional onsite program was \n     impossible. I loved my experience and UOPX has opened so many \n     doors for me.''\n       Jim Wallace (Florida)--``I am a UOPX graduate, MBA 2006 and \n     veteran of the US Navy Reserve. In my opinion UOPX led the \n     way in educating working professionals. At the time I started \n     my program, no other institutions offered the ability for me \n     to successfully complete my studies, care for my family and \n     work a demanding job. The bottom line is that it was \n     challenging and I worked hard to complete my degree.''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, again, I can only point out what the Wall \nStreet Journal said. This is Obama's for-profit stealth attack. It is \nbeing orchestrated and carried out by the Senator from Illinois, who \nhas a well-known record of not supporting the men and women who are \nserving in the military by his latest opposing of the Defense \nauthorization bill on the grounds of OCO. So the men and women who are \nserving in the military and those who have served with honor obviously \nhave a lower priority for him than his vendetta against for-profit \nuniversities. I think it is shameful.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object because I \nwant to make a suggestion.\n  I ask consent that we modify this matter so that we can pass an \namendment to extend the PTC deadline--the deadline for positive train \ncontrol--to make it a 1-year extension to December 31, 2016, and that \nthat be agreed to. Right now, it is 3 years with a 2-year possible \nextension beyond that. I ask that it be changed to 1 year, and that \nfollowing the use or yielding back of time, the Senate then proceed to \na vote on passage of the bill with my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify his request?\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would \nstate to my colleague from California that this is the practice she and \nI so often lament when it comes to highway bills, and that is kicking \nthe can down the road. We know full well that a year from now, we will \nbe back here doing this again.\n  This language, which is agreed upon by both the House and the \nSenate--Democrats and Republicans of the relevant committees worked \nvery hard to draft consensus language. That is what we have arrived at \ntoday. We believe it addresses the situation and provides the correct \nsolution. I think it would be a big mistake to try to modify something \nthat people have worked so hard to get to, knowing full well we will \nnever get what the Senator from California wants to do passed through \nthe House or the Senate.\n\n  The House acted yesterday, and acted unanimously. Very rarely do you \nget a voice vote out of the House of Representatives.

The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I just want to say to my friend I am not \nsurprised, but I am still quite disappointed because I think it is \nhorrible precedent to take a provision out of an underlying bill that \nwe have all worked so hard on and attach it--a 3-year provision, a 3-\nto-5-year provision, a delay in this safety measure--on a 3-week \nextension.\n  Why didn't my friend pull out some of the good things in there for \nsafety, such as the House rental bill, which says you can't lease a car \nthat has been under recall? He didn't do that. I am not blaming him at \nall. I know it was a process. I know that. We didn't pull out the \nincreased fines on NHTSA for car manufacturers who kill people because \nof their negligence.\n  I feel it is a terrible precedent, but I will not object, and I am \ngoing to explain that later. Having withdrawn my objection, I would ask \nthat I may have the floor for 15 minutes immediately following the \nvote, if that is possible, and I would give 5 minutes of that timeframe \nto my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I come to the floor to speak on behalf of the Acting \nAdministrator of the Federal Railroad Administration, who is no longer \nacting but now our Administrator and my friend, Sarah Feinberg.\n  As a native West Virginian, she has the same pragmatic approach to \nproblem solving that we see among our congressional delegation every \nday. When it comes to politics in West Virginia, it really doesn't \nmatter whether you are a Democrat or a Republican. What matters is if \nyou can get the job done.\n  During my time in the State legislature, Sarah's father, Lee \nFeinberg, and I served together. At that time Lee was head of the West \nVirginia Governmental Ethics Commission, and he instilled in her the \nsame sense of moral responsibility that also led him into public \nservice. Today she sits before the Senate, seeking to continue in \npublic service as the Administrator of the Federal Railroad \nAdministration, and I am so pleased this has happened.\n  Over the past 9 months, I believe she has proved herself to be an \neffective and engaged leader with the courage to make tough decisions \nand the character to accept the criticism they often incite. She was \nbaptized by fire after being appointed to this position on January 9 of \nthis year and leading the agency's response to five major incidents \nwithin her first 60 days at the helm.\n  On February 3, six people were killed when a commuter train hit an \nSUV at a grade crossing in Valhalla, NY. On February 4, 14 tank cars \ncarrying ethanol derailed just north of Dubuque, IA. Three of them \ncaught fire. On February 16, 27 tank cars derailed outside Mount \nCarbon, WV, releasing 378,000 gallons of crude oil and igniting a fire \nthat destroyed a nearby house. On February 24, a commuter train in \nOxnard, CA, hit a tractor-trailer at a grade crossing and jumped the \ntracks. On March 6, 21 cars derailed outside of Galena, IL, near the \nborder with Wisconsin, and five of them caught fire.\n  I am a firm believer that elected officials need to be on the ground \nin emergency situations, supporting first responders and assisting \nthose in need, and I was impressed by Ms. Feinberg's response to the \nMount Carbon derailment in West Virginia, which I witnessed firsthand. \nFive weeks into her new job, she executed an efficient and effective \nFederal response that was one of the best I have ever seen in my \nexperience as an elected official and a public servant.\n  There are a lot of smart policy people here in Washington, DC, but \nthe best policy in the world will not mean a thing if it doesn't \ntranslate into anything in the real word. Sarah's response to the Mount \nCarbon accident showed me that she understood that, and that gave me \nfaith in her ability not just to lead but to listen to the people we \nare here to serve.\n  Over the past 10 years, the increase in domestic energy production \nhas been an engine of economic growth. The Energy Information \nAdministration predicts that growth will continue through 2020. From \n2009 until 2014, crude oil production in the United States increased by \nmore than 62 percent--up from 5.35 million barrels per day in 2009 to \n8.68 million barrels a day in 2014--and the majority of this product is \nmoving by rail.\n  In 2008, our railroads moved a meager a 9,500 tank cars carrying \ncrude oil. Last year, that number grew to 500,000 tank cars--a 5,000-\npercent increase. That is unbelievable.\n  Unprecedented new challenges come along with the new economic \nopportunities presented by the growth in domestic energy production, \nand Ms. Feinberg's experience makes her uniquely qualified to lead the \nFRA through this transition. As Chief of Staff to Secretary Foxx, she \nhelped the Department of Transportation develop a holistic strategy to \nimprove the safety and security of crude by rail that required \ncoordination between multiple administrations within the Department.\n  The tough new tank car safety regulations that were finalized in May \nwere dependent on close collaboration between the FRA and the Pipeline \nand Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. Sarah's experience in \nthe Secretary's office and her existing relationships throughout the \nDepartment allow her to cut through redtape and get the right people in \nthe room to get the job done.\n  While the new rules do not solve every problem, they represent a \nmajor step in the right direction. They satisfy all or part of 10 \noutstanding National Transportation Safety Board recommendations, \nincluding all 4 recommendations that were made in April of this year.\n  Since taking the helm at the FRA earlier this year, I have been very \nmuch impressed with Ms. Feinberg's willingness to tackle difficult \nissues and engage stakeholders about realistic solutions. In May, she \nconvened a positive train control task force to try to identify \nopportunities for the FRA to help railroads meet their 2015 deadline \nand become a real part in this process. I think her proactive approach \nto problem-solving will be an asset to the FRA and the entire \nDepartment of Transportation.\n  I thank Chairman Thune and Ranking Member Nelson for moving her \nnomination through the committee yesterday on a strong bipartisan vote \nof 19 to 1. I want to thank all my colleagues for not only nominating \nSarah but confirming her today. I think she will be a great asset to \nour country and do us all proud.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will take my time now. I know my friend \nwanted to have a little time, so I will yield to Senator Inhofe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, first of all, I know the Senator from \nCalifornia was disappointed in a few things that went on procedurally, \nand I am very much in sympathy. But far more significant than that is \nthe bill we are talking about now. We made a tremendous advance to it \njust a few minutes ago. We did what the House has already done. We are \nnow extended to the 20th of November.\n  It is my understanding that the House is going to be taking up--we \nare talking about the highway bill. A lot of things we talk about \naround here are not very important. We all have different ideas about \nwhat is and is not important, but still we have that Constitution, and \nthe Constitution says what we are supposed to be doing. What we are \nsupposed to be doing here is defending America and roads and bridges. \nThat is what we are supposed to be doing.\n  Senator Boxer and I--she is a very proud liberal and I am a very \nproud conservative--have recognized what our duty is when we come here, \nand the second most important bill every year--not every year, because \nwe have the Defense authorization bill every year, but not the \nTransportation authorization bill. That is what is important, and that \nis what we are supposed to be doing here.\n  What we did a few minutes ago is very significant. We are on the same \npage as the House, and that is to have a bill done and on the \nPresident's desk by the 20th of November, which is going to be right \nbefore we have a break for Thanksgiving. It now looks like we are \nassured of doing that.\n  I have to say that in working over the years with Senator Boxer, we \nhave worked in a capacity in which she was the chairman of that \ncommittee and I was the ranking member; then I was the chairman of the \ncommittee and she\n\n[[Page S7576]]\n\nwas the ranking member. We never changed what we stood for or what we \nsaw as significant in the second most important bill we deal with every \nyear.\n  I am anticipating we are going to be able to have this 6-year \nauthorization bill on the floor next week. We are going to be dealing \nwith it, and we are going to be passing it. We already know the number \nof people who have voted for it in the past, so we know where we are. \nOn the other hand, I think this is going to have a privileged motion \nand go straight in for a conference. I look forward to that, and that \nmakes it all possible.\n  You have to keep in mind the Senate isn't doing this. The House is \ngoing on a Veterans Day recess, so we have to work on getting their job \ndone before the recess so we can do ours while they are on recess, and \nthen we will have a happy ending.\n  While I do regret there are some disappointments, I have to say this. \nWhen we are talking about a bill like this, it means that the left and \nthe right have to get together, and we did. I want to applaud my \nranking member, Senator Boxer, for helping us in some of the areas \nwhere we are able to shortcut some of the NEPA requirements and \nexpedite some things that couldn't be done otherwise.\n  Let's keep in mind that if we went ahead and did what we have been \ndoing since 2009, we wouldn't be doing this. We wouldn't be doing any \nmajor bills--no bridges, no major bills. This is a great day to see the \nassurance that this is going to take place, and I applaud Senator Boxer \nin the joint effort we had on the left and the right in this body. We \ndon't see that very often.\n  Mrs. BOXER. No, we don't.\n  Mr. President, I just want to thank my friend. It is such a privilege \nto work with him on these infrastructure issues. I often say we don't \nwork too well together on environmental issues--maybe in another life \nwe might--but right now, in this life, we work really well on \ninfrastructure. So does our staff. I am proud of them.\n  I came down here to try and change a part of this extension--and I \nwill explain it later--that had to do with delaying a safety \nrequirement on the railroad. I feel strongly in my heart about it. By \nthe same token, I agree with my friend that we have to get this bill \ndone.\n  This will be a 6-year authorization, as my friend knows. He insisted \non it. We have 3 years of pay-for. We never give up. Maybe somehow a \nmiracle will happen and we will find more. But right now, Senator \nMcConnell protected our pay-fors.\n  For me, it is a strange day. I am very disappointed in this. I call \nit a rider that was put on this bill. But I am very pleased that the \nHouse is moving forward. My friend cited things that he likes--\ncertainly, expediting some of the rules so we don't get these projects \ndragged out. My sense of it was that I like the fact that we kept the \nequitable share. We didn't change the share between transit and roads. \nWe certainly added, with my friend's help, a freight title. So there \nare many good things. It is a mixed bag for me today. I agree with my \nfriend that we need to move fast on the underlying bill, and I look \nforward to going to conference.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for one observation?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Of course.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The Senator mentioned the fact that we have a 6-year bill \nand 3 years to pay for it. That doesn't really concern me for a couple \nof reasons.\n  One is that once we start projects, I can assure you that there will \nbe a reshuffling of priorities in this Chamber here, where people will \nrealize the one thing we don't want to do is to start construction on \nsomething and then stop. This, I have no question in my mind, is going \nto take place.\n  Secondly, we have the same provision in the House as we do in this \nbody, and that is that if for some reason money is not available, \nnothing else can be done after that 3-year period. We are not going to \nlet that happen. So I think we are going to be in good shape. Job well \ndone.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n  How much time remains of my 15 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Since I did yield about 5 minutes to my friend, I ask \nunanimous consent for another 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Then, of course, Senator Thune will have all the time \nthat he wants to disagree with most of what I am going to say about \npositive train control. That is part of the debate that goes on here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/senate-section/article/S7576-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7576-S7580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         POSITIVE TRAIN CONTROL\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I do want to thank Senator Thune, Senator \nNelson, Senator Inhofe, and others who did something good today, which \nis to allow us to vote to make sure that we have the head of the \nFederal Railroad Administration. Finally, after 8 months, Sarah \nFeinberg got a vote. It is very important. I am glad all this wrangling \nthat we had back and forth led to that happy situation because we need \nher in place. Frankly, we need her in place to oversee this positive \ntrain control.\n  I want to quote what she stated. She stated that worries of a train \nexploding in the middle of a city have caused her sleepless nights. \nThis is an Administrator who cares deeply about her role in safety.\n  There was an article written by someone today that said I stood alone \nin my opposition to moving forward with a 3- to 5-year extension and \ntaking that extension out of the underlying bill and tacking it on to a \n3-week highway bill extension. I want to point out that I did not stand \nalone and I do not stand alone. Senator Blumenthal is hoping to come \nhere later and make his remarks about the fact that he opposed this. I \nspeak here for Senator Feinstein, my great colleague--my senior \ncolleague--who actually wrote the original legislation because these \ncrashes were occurring. And I want to read a little bit from Senator \nGillibrand, who is on a train headed to a funeral for a firefighter in \nNew York. This is her statement:\n\n       After so many preventable railway tragedies that have led \n     to loss of life, it is an insult to the families who have \n     lost loved ones to let the rail lobby slip a multi-year \n     Positive Train Control delay into a three-week extension. The \n     rail industry has purposefully dragged its feet in meeting \n     its safety requirements, and now Congress is quietly aiding \n     them further. It is without debate that Positive Train \n     Control saves lives. The railroads must work as quickly as \n     possible to implement this life-saving technology, so that \n     the millions of Americans who commute by rail every day can \n     do so safely--and Congress needs to do its job and hold the \n     rail industry accountable.\n\n  As I said when Senator McConnell offered the unanimous consent \nrequest, I think it is a terrible precedent to place a major safety \nrollback--I would not call it a repeal; I would say rollback--on a 3-\nweek extension of the highway trust fund. It just isn't right. I am \nvery grateful to the Washington Post for writing a very strong \nstatement--I would say article--about what happens when you don't have \npositive train control on a train. Positive train control is technology \nthat allows the train to slowly come to a stop if there is a real \nproblem, such as another train crossing or a car.\n  It was in 2008 when we really moved on positive train control. A \nhorrific accident occurred in Chatsworth, CA, where a Metrolink \npassenger train and a Union Pacific freight train collided. It was due \nto a distracted engineer. This preventable accident resulted in the \ndeaths of 25 people and injury to 135 others.\n  Friends, we are not talking about some scientific experiment here. We \nare talking about real life, where trains collide, where real people \ndie and get hurt. I have met some of the families.\n  Afterwards, Senator Feinstein and I got together. She was great, and \nit was great to work with her. We passed the Rail Safety Improvement \nAct of 2008, mandating the installation of positive train control on \nmajor passenger commuter and freight rail lines by the end of this \nyear, 2015.\n  Again, I speak for her in my remarks. She is distressed that the 2015 \ndeadline would be extended as much as it was without a chance to really \nlook at the details in the conference, which we hope to have soon.\n  For more than 45 years--45 years--the National Transportation Safety \nBoard, or NTSB, has advocated PTC technology. This isn't something new. \nBut it wasn't until 2008 that Senator Feinstein and I got the \nlegislation done.\n\n[[Page S7577]]\n\n  Let me say this. NTSB is amazing. They are the ones who show up after \nhorrible crashes of rail, of plane, and they are the ones who make \nreally important safety recommendations. Well, actually, they work with \nthe FAA. So they are the ones who come forward after an accident. They \ndo the investigation, and they make the recommendations.\n  Now, this is what they said: If we had put PTC in all those years \nago, 146 accidents or derailments could have been avoided with \nimplementation of the PTC, and at least 300 fatalities and 700 injuries \ncould have been prevented. Since the California accident, 14 PTC-\npreventable accidents or derailments have occurred.\n  So let's be clear. People are dying and they are being injured \nbecause we don't have positive train control.\n  Now, the good news--the great news for my State--is that Metrolink \nand Caltrain already have put PTC on. Amtrak has put it on certain of \ntheir runs. So it is happening. But some of the railroads are dragging \ntheir feet. They have every excuse in the book. Some of the reasons, I \nthink, do need our attention.\n  For example, there are problems with spectrum, and there are problems \nwith rights-of-way. We can work on that. But as Senator Blumenthal \nsaid, instead of giving these 3-year delays, there need to be what he \ncalls metrics so we can ascertain, before they get all this time, what \nthey are doing. Are we going to be faced here in this body in years to \ncome with more requests for delay? Well, if we are not really looking \nover the shoulder of the railroads, the answer is, clearly, yes. They \ndon't want to save the money. And, by the way, the cost-benefit ratio \non this is overwhelming. It is overwhelming.\n  I said before, rhetorically, that it is very interesting that the \nonly piece of freestanding legislation that was pulled out of the bill \nand placed on this 3-week extension was this delay in positive train \ncontrol safety--nothing else, nothing else. This was cherry-picked--\nnothing else.\n  I have worked with several Senators because one of my constituents, \nCally Houck, lost two daughters who rented a car to go on vacation. \nThey were in their twenties. The car was under recall, but the agency \nrented it to them anyway. It exploded. They died. Mrs. Houck couldn't \nbelieve we didn't have a law that said you can't rent a car that is \nunder recall. I bet, if I asked anybody--any stranger to me--if they \nthink they are allowed to rent a car that is under recall, they would \nsay: Of course not. Well, you can. I have fought for years, and I have \ngotten help from Senator Schumer, and Senator McCaskill actually got \nthe bill passed. I am very grateful to her. That is in the underlying \nbill. Why didn't we take that out and put it on immediately so this can \ngo into effect immediately?\n  I think the Washington Post gave us what they think. They wrote a \nstory--a very important story--in the front page yesterday or the day \nbefore, Monday. I want to just say we all know that there are special \ninterests here. By the way, I like to work with the railroads because \nthey do a lot of good things. They are very powerful, they are very \nstrong, and they have a very powerful lobby. It is not a Republican \nlobby or a Democratic lobby. It is a lobby that covers everybody.\n  Let me quote what the Washington Post article notes:\n\n       Rail safety has never been a more pressing issue than it is \n     today. So far, the people who have died in U.S. accidents \n     that PTC could have prevented have generally been crew \n     members or passengers. That could change in dramatic, \n     catastrophic fashion.\n       The number of rail tank cars carrying flammable material in \n     the United States has grown from 9,500 seven years ago to \n     493,126 last year.\n\n  Let me say that again:\n\n       The number of rail tank cars carrying flammable material in \n     the United States has grown from 9,500 seven years ago to \n     493,126 last year.\n\n  Now, just imagine what happens when this flammable material is \ninvolved in a collision. We know. We have seen the balls of toxic fire. \nSeven trains have derailed this year alone, and their contents \nexploded.\n  Now, I understand the pleas for delay. That is why I offered a 1-year \ndelay to my friend, the chairman of the commerce committee. I offered \nhim a 1-year delay. Nobody can tell me that a 1-year delay wouldn't \nwork for now. We can look at it in the conference. If we need to extend \nit, that is fine. No, we weren't able to get it. To me, the only answer \nthat keeps coming back is special interests earmark provision--special \ninterests earmark provision--because it is the only provision that \nbenefits one special interest that was put on this 3-week extension.\n  Some people say: Why do you care so much? The House voted by voice \nvote. Do you know what? They were wrong. They shouldn't have. They \nshouldn't have put it on this bill. This was put on by the House, and \nit was wrong, wrong, wrong.\n  Now, when I spoke with my chairman--my really good friend, Senator \nInhofe--on the floor, I did say I am so pleased at the way we are \nmoving in terms of the underlying bill. I believe we will have that \nbill, and I believe we will have that bill next week. Then why on earth \ndid we have to take this out? If we are moving this bill forward, we \ndidn't have to pluck out one of the provisions. I just don't understand \nit, other than what the Washington Post wrote in their story.\n  I have to say that there are 60,000-plus bridges that are deficient--\nstructurally deficient. They are in the Presiding Officer's State, and \nthey are in my State. Why didn't they pull out a couple of worst \nbridges and say ``fix those bridges''? All they did was pull out a \nprovision that the railroads wanted--not a provision that commuters \nwant, not a safety provision that will save lives. It is very \ndiscouraging.\n\n  We all know about the Amtrak crash. I am going to show you a picture \nof that. It was splayed all across the paper. This is a photo of a \ndestroyed Amtrak train in Philadelphia. We all know the disaster that \noccurred there. This could have been prevented. As a matter of fact, if \nI remember right, they were about to put positive train control on this \nstretch. They were getting ready to do it. Look at this--the suffering \nand the deaths, needless. If there was positive train control and if \nanother train was coming, simply slow down that train and automatically \navoid such a disaster as this.\n  I am passionate about transportation. I am passionate about safety. I \nknow my colleagues are, but we had a very different view about this. I \ncan only say if anything good came out of this, it was the fact that we \nnow have an Administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration. I \nthink that was good because I feel better now knowing that someone who \nreally cares about this now has officially been given the power to \nassert her authority.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Thune as we move the \nunderlying bill through. He knows how I feel. I want to thank him \nbecause he waited around until we had reached an agreement. I \nappreciate that because otherwise we could have had a complete shutdown \nof the entire highway program. We averted that because, with respect \nfor our differences, we worked together all day and have the \nAdministrator in place.\n  I thank Senator Nelson and his staff as well as Senator Thune's \nstaff. For me, having that done is something that means a lot and means \na lot for safety across the board. I hope we will not be doing this in \nthe future. I hope regular order will prevail. I hope we will not be \npulling out important pieces of other bills and passing them as stand-\nalone bills when we are up against a deadline. I don't think it is the \nright way to govern. I don't think it is good governance. I think a lot \nof my colleagues feel the same way.\n  This is behind us. Now we are going to work together. We are never \ngoing to take our eyes off this positive train control. We are going to \nmake sure the railroads are stepping up, doing the right thing--and, by \nthe way, some of them have. I told you two of my railroads have been \nfantastic. They put it all in place. They met the deadline. There are \nmany others that are close to meeting the deadline, but there are too \nmany that are hiding behind excuses and some that have real reasons why \nthey haven't moved forward. I hope they are watching this today because \nI am not going away. None of us are going away. We are going to be \nwatching this carefully and making sure this deadline is really a \ndeadline, not some kind of political cover so the railroads can get out \nof doing what they have to do to save lives. When we\n\n[[Page S7578]]\n\ntake these jobs, that is our overwhelming responsibility--to protect \nand defend our people, whether it is abroad or at home.\n  I again thank my staff, Senator Thune's staff, Senator Nelson's \nstaff, Senator Blumenthal's staff, Senator Feinstein's staff--I hope I \nam not leaving anybody out--Senator Gillibrand's staff, and Senator \nMurphy's staff for getting us to a place where we are accepting this \nwith a heavy heart. We are moving on. We are thankful we now do have in \nplace an Administrator--a wonderful, wonderful Administrator of the \nFederal Railroad Administration.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the one thing the Senator from California \nand I share is a commitment, a longstanding commitment to getting a \nmultiyear highway bill through here. I hope that is going to happen in \nthe next few weeks.\n  We did need to move on a positive train control extension, and I am \ngoing to get into the reasons for that in just a minute. I think \nprobably the most important fact is, as we look at this particular \nissue, that nearly every railroad in the country--including every major \nfreight railroad--will not meet what is an unrealistic December 31, \n2015, deadline for positive train control.\n  Positive train control--or PTC--when working as intended, is a \ncritical safety technology that will prevent certain types of rail \naccidents and save lives. We have the ability to make rail \ntransportation even safer by ensuring full implementation of positive \ntrain control.\n  As the chairman of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation \nCommittee, I can assure my colleagues that these disruptions would have \ncaused cascading and devastating effects for nearly every sector of the \neconomy and every region of the country. Railroads have already started \nnotifying customers that they will stop accepting certain chemical \nshipments in late November and early December to ensure that such \ncargoes are off their system when the existing deadline hits at the end \nof the year.\n  As rail-dependent businesses and their customers prepare for the \nshutdown, they have already started to feel the negative supply chain \neffects on logistics and inventory management. The House-passed short-\nterm highway extension provided an option to avert this completely \navoidable and unnecessary harm.\n  This is not just about the railroads--contrary to what has been said \non the floor that somehow this is a special benefit that only helps \nrailroads. It is about the farmers--many of whom I represent in South \nDakota--who depend upon the railroad for fertilizer. It is about the \nmanufacturers and other businesses that depend upon rail for critical \ninputs, and it is about water treatment facilities that depend on rail \nfor chemicals to purify drinking water. It is about all the workers and \nthe households that benefit from this safe mode of transportation.\n  Rail-dependent commuters and customers cannot afford a \ncongressionally caused railroad shutdown. That is exactly what would \nhappen if we failed to act. Each day well over 1 million riders in the \nUnited States board commuter railroads to get to and from their places \nof work. Over 2 million people work in industries that use hazardous \nchemicals hauled by rail, and the gross economic output of these \nindustries alone is over $2 trillion. In fact, the effects of a looming \nrailroad shutdown would have occurred well in advance of the year-end \ndeadline, which is where we are today. Over 130 farmers, manufacturers, \nand retailers wrote to Congress last week, stating that ``rail \ncustomers are already starting to feel the impact . . . [w]ith a \nshutdown just around the corner rail customers must start putting \ncontingency plans into motion, including adjusting production schedules \nand workforce loads.''\n  This isn't just an economic issue. It has major implications for \npublic health and safety. I mentioned earlier water treatment \nfacilities across this country have urged a deadline extension and \nwrote a joint letter to me reiterating that point. I will quote from \nthe letter, which is what they said: ``Even a temporary interruption of \nwater disinfection chemical deliveries could risk a public health \ndisaster for communities across this country.''\n  The U.S. Conference of Mayors also urged a deadline extension and \nwrote that switching from rail to other modes of transportation would \nlead to additional accidents in our Nation's communities and greater \nexposure to the risks of hazardous materials.\n  The Federal Railroad Administration's Acting Administrator, whom we \njust made permanent Railroad Administration Administrator, has the \nresponsibility for conducting oversight of our Nation's rail network, \nand she expressed concern at a September commerce committee hearing. \nShe said a rail shutdown would ``lead to significant congestion and it \ndoes lead to safety impacts.''\n  Keep in mind, total train accidents per year have decreased by nearly \n50 percent since 2005. Rail is often the safest available way to haul \nmany types of products, especially hazardous chemicals. It would take \nmore than 600,000 trucks on our Nation's roads to replace freight rail, \nlet alone the additional cars and buses needed to replace commuter \nrail.\n  When Congress passed legislation in 2008 mandating the implementation \nof positive train control, it never intended to punish rail customers \nor to harm the economy, but this law failed to properly consider the \ncomplexity and time involved in developing, mass producing, installing, \nand testing a new technology involving a complex network of new \ncomputers and communications equipment deployed on more than 20,000 \nlocomotives and 60,000 miles of railroad track.\n  There is plenty of finger-pointing to go around as to why it didn't \nget done. The bottom line is this: After 7 years of work, over $6 \nbillion of mostly private funds spent, and with about 2 months to go \nbefore the legal deadline, not one single railroad in this country--\ncommuter or freight--has fully implemented positive train control.\n  For years, study after study, including those from the nonpartisan \nGovernment Accountability Office, found that the 2015 deadline for full \nimplementation of PTC was unrealistic. The independent experts at the \nGAO concluded that the vast majority of railroads, including all \nfreight railroads, would not meet the deadline by the end of the year.\n  I am pleased the Senate came together and acted on a solution. The \nbipartisan, bicameral proposal I helped craft does not just extend the \ndeadline for implementing positive train control, it significantly \nincreases accountability and transparency. Our proposal gives the \nSecretary of Transportation the authority to fine railroads if they \nfall behind metrics and milestones on their way to completing \ninstallation and full implementation. It requires detailed and publicly \navailable reporting to ensure progress each step of the way.\n  Under our bipartisan proposal, railroads must implement positive \ntrain control by December 31, 2018. To ensure that PTC works as \nintended, the Secretary has very limited case-by-case discretion to \nallow railroads additional time for testing and certification but only \nif railroads complete all installation, spectrum acquisition, and \nemployee training. To qualify for this additional time, freight \nrailroads must have started using PTC on the majority of their \nterritories or track. These accountability-focused changes, with \nobjective criteria and rigorous oversight, are designed to ensure that \nwe never need another extension.\n  I wish to extend my thanks to our colleagues on the House side--\nRepresentatives Schuster, DeFazio, Denham, and Capuano--for their \nstrong bipartisan leadership and collaboration to address this major \ntransportation issue. This issue has been extensively debated in the \nSenate. This proposal incorporates principles and text that have twice \nbeen reported out of the commerce committee and have passed the full \nSenate in July by a vote of 65 to 34. Let me repeat that. Everything we \nare talking about today--and it was modified a little bit when we \nnegotiated this with the House--but the basic text, basic framework, \nbasic outline of what we just passed had already passed the Senate as \npart of the Transportation bill with 65 votes earlier this year. The \nidea that this is somehow something that is being sprung on Members in \nthe Senate is not consistent with the facts.\n\n[[Page S7579]]\n\n  I am grateful to Senator Blunt and Senator McCaskill for their \npartnership and leadership to bring Congress together to ensure that \nPTC is made safely available as soon as possible. Some have suggested \ndifferent ways to approaching this issue. At a time when we are making \nprogress to finally end the kick-the-can mentality through the \nenactment of a multiyear transportation reauthorization bill, this \nproposal will ensure that we are not injecting that same type of \nuncertainty into another transportation mode, which is our Nation's \nrail system.\n  Attaching the bipartisan agreement on extending the PTC deadline as \npart of the short-term highway extension solves this problem while \nkeeping pressure on the House of Representatives to pass a multiyear \ntransportation bill that we can then reconcile with the Senate-passed \nDRIVE Act, the multiyear transportation bill that passed in this \nChamber earlier this year.\n  I wish to applaud Leader McConnell, Chairman Inhofe, Ranking Member \nBoxer, and Ranking Member Nelson for their continued efforts to push \nfor the completion of a multiyear transportation reauthorization bill. \nDue to constant pressure from the Senate, as was noticed with last \nweek's markup by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, \nwe can actually see the path to getting a bill done with our House \ncolleagues.\n  The fact that the short-term extension before the Senate sets a \nNovember 20 deadline, along with the House planning to take up a \nmultiyear transportation bill next week, indicates that it is, in fact, \npossible to soon get a multiyear transportation bill across the finish \nline.\n  Nobody should misinterpret my work and my efforts with my colleagues \nhere in the Senate in addressing the harms associated with failing to \nfix the looming positive train control deadline. As a major part of the \noverall DRIVE Act, the transportation bill that passed Senate, the \nlegislative text originated from the Senate commerce committee, and I \nwill not be backing down in my efforts to see a host of transportation, \nsafety freight, and rail provisions signed into law in the coming \nweeks.\n  Together we have averted the potential harm that would come with a \ncongressionally caused rail shutdown. We have set a realistic positive \ntrain control deadline. We have held the railroads accountable and \nensured the job is done swiftly and safely. It was important that be \ndone in a swift and safe way.\n  Earlier my colleague from California quoted a story from the \nWashington Post that ran earlier this week. The Washington Post \neditorial board, the very same paper that my colleague from California \ncited, opined: ``Congress should revise the 2008 legislation to give \nrailroads more time to come into compliance, with consequences for \nthose who fail to produce concrete plans for immediate improvement and \nmeet milestones along the way.''\n  But the very newspaper that the Senator from California was quoting \nactually editorialized on their editorial page that Congress needed to \nfix and to put in place an extension that would allow the railroads to \ncome into compliance. That was echoed by a lot of the large newspapers \nacross the country.\n  The Chicago Tribune's editorial board wrote:\n\n       PTC is coming. It's just not coming fast enough to meet \n     what was always an unrealistic deadline. So if your commute \n     is a mess come January, don't blame Metra. Blame Congress.\n\n  The Chicago Sun-Times editorial board opined: ``Congress should \nextend the deadline to give Metra and railroads a chance to get the job \ndone.''\n  The Los Angeles Times editorial board wrote: ``Rather than risk a \nshutdown of crucial transportation services, Congress ought to fast-\ntrack a solution.''\n  The problem we had here is that we didn't have the luxury of time, \nand so the vehicle that came over from the House of Representatives, \nwhich is a short-term extension of the highway bill, presented a chance \nfor us to address this issue knowing full well that it had to be \naddressed and that it had to be addressed in a timely way. We have \nrailroads and shippers in this country, that, as I mentioned earlier, \nhave already indicated they are modifying and adjusting their \noperations and plans right now and notifying customers of the impacts \nand effects of Congress failing to act in a timely way.\n  The reason that this needed to be fixed now is that if we hadn't \nfixed it, we would have started to see the disruptions in our economy \nthat would have come with a shutdown because, as I said, no railroad, \nto date, has been able to meet the positive train control deadline. We \napproached this in a way that we felt was reasonable, rational, \nlogical, and kept the pressure on the railroads and required the \naccountability that is necessary to see this done in a realistic way. I \nthink the end result that just passed the Senate is a good outcome and \na good solution, not just for the railroads in this country but for the \nshippers, farmers, and States such as South Dakota that depend upon \nthose railroads, for the commuters around this country who rely on that \nform of transportation every day to get to work, and for the thousands \nand thousands and thousands of people who work in those railroad-\nrelated industries across this country. This is one example where \nCongress demonstrated that it actually could, in a timely way, act \nresponsibly to bring about a solution that will avoid what surely would \nhave been not only an economic disaster but a public safety disaster as \nwell.\n  I am pleased that our colleagues here in the Senate found a way to \napprove this today, and I hope, as I said before, that we will continue \nto keep the heat on to get a multiyear transportation bill through the \nHouse and the Senate with this short-term extension through November \n20. It gives us a few weeks to complete action on that piece of \nlegislation. But we didn't have the luxury of time nor could we afford \nto wait to act and to make sure that this positive train control \nextension was put in place in a timely way.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, by voice vote, this body has extended \nthe highway funding program, which is a good thing. It has also \nincluded in that extension a delay in the deadline for positive train \ncontrol, which was inevitable. None of us opposed a delay in positive \ntrain control; what we opposed was an extension of that delay with \ninadequate accountability and excessive time.\n  Let's be absolutely clear. This delay in positive train control is \nreally a delay until 2020, not 2018, because when railroads hit 2018, \nthey can apply for 2 more years, and that second extension is dependent \nonly on having completed work on half the system. Much of that \ndetermination is within the control of the railroad itself. That will \nbe the 50 anniversary of the NTSB calling for positive train control.\n  We are not talking about a novel, untested technology. In fact, five \nrailroads will meet the deadline to implement this technology at the \nend of this year. Clearly, all could have at least sought plausibly to \nmeet that deadline. If they had a reason for failing to do so, they \nshould be required to present it case by case, year by year, with a \nfirm deadline of 2018. That is the system I proposed in the legislation \nI offered 6 months ago--well before this deadline became an imminent \nnecessity.\n  Forty-six years ago, two passenger trains collided in Darien, CT, \nkilling four people. There have been similar crashes and catastrophes \nsince that time, resulting in nearly 300 deaths, 6,700 injuries, and \nincalculable economic loss. The worst of those cases was a crash in \nSouthern California in 2008, killing 25 people. Another took place in \nthe Bronx in 2013. Many of us visited the site in the Bronx and \nobserved the remnants of this derailment and so are closely familiar \nwith it. My colleagues in California and in New York have been ardent \nadvocates of positive train control, and I thank them for their \nsupport.\n  These are examples of only a few of the many instances of death and \ndestruction over decades that could have\n\n[[Page S7580]]\n\nbeen prevented by positive train control. Positive train control could \nhave prevented Spuyten Duyvil. It could have prevented other repeated \ninstances of death and destruction that resulted from trains speeding \nexcessively and thereby derailing. It could have prevented trains from \ncolliding. It could have prevented drivers from ignoring signals. It \ncould have prevented death and injury around the country with economic \nlosses far exceeding the cost of installing positive train control.\n  Joe Boardman, head of Amtrak and former FRA Administrator, said: \n``PTC is the most important rail safety advancement of our time.''\n  Today, the Senate delayed it by 5 years. There are reasons and there \nis blame enough to go around. The Federal Government--in all frankness, \nthe Federal Communications Commission--perhaps bears part of that blame \nin the failure to allocate sufficient spending. But let's be honest \ntoday in saying that 5 years of delay was unnecessary. The railroads \nsought it, and they won it with a threat to shut down railroad service \neverywhere in the country--an unacceptable outcome. The question is, \nCan we change this deadline in a smart, responsible way?\n  Unfortunately, the action today rewards the dilatory with unnecessary \ndelay. Congress has sent a message that these deadlines can be avoided \nwithout repercussions and responsibility. That is bad policy. It is a \nbad process. I regret it. There was a better way to act that would have \nensured continued funding for our highways and continued accountability \nfor positive train control, which is indeed the most important rail \nsafety advancement of our time. This is not some abstract, novel \nsystem. It has been around. It has been used. It has been tested. I \nregret that today it has been delayed unnecessarily.\n  Finally, I wish to congratulate and thank Sarah Feinberg, and the \ngood news today is that her nomination has been approved. I look \nforward to working with her, and I welcome her as a new source of \nleadership, which she has already demonstrated. I hope she will act \naggressively and responsibly to ensure that positive train control and \nother safety measures become the law and that the law is enforced as \neffectively and promptly as possible.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/senate-section/article/S7580-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7580-S7583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           REGULATING TOBACCO\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an issue that \naffects the health of our children in every single State.\n  I ask unanimous consent that after I have completed my remarks, \nSenator Blumenthal, Senator Markey, Senator Boxer, and Senator Warren \nbe afforded the opportunity to continue to address the same topic.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I also invite my colleagues to jump in at any point to \nexchange views as well.\n  This issue is one that we have known about for a very long period of \ntime, which is that tobacco addiction destroys lives. I grew up in a \nfamily where my mother didn't smoke and my father didn't smoke, but \nthey both came from large families--many brothers and sisters--and it \nseemed as though every single year when I was young, one of my aunts or \none of my uncles died from smoking. They died from cancer. They died \nfrom heart disease. They died from emphysema. This carnage was all too \napparent.\n  Anyone who has taken the slightest look at this issue knows that the \nstatistics are just unbelievable, the number of deaths and illnesses \ncaused, the number of years lost, the degradation of the quality of \nlife of individuals. For this reason, it had long been a topic here in \nthe Senate that nicotine--the primary acting element in tobacco--should \nbe considered a drug. It is a drug. It has all of these impacts. We \nhave a Food and Drug Administration, and the Food and Drug \nAdministration should be able to regulate it for the health and welfare \nof our Nation.\n  Back in 2009, we debated just such a law here on the floor of the \nSenate and across the way in the House, and that law was adopted. So we \nanticipated that in short order regulations would be issued and they \nwould help address particularly the effort of tobacco companies to \nproduce new products designed to essentially produce nicotine tobacco \naddicts among our children, to entice our children into smoking or \nchewing and this whole new variety, this continuum of products.\n  Here we are years later. It is no longer 2009; it is 2015--6 years \nlater and we have no regulation. During that time, a great deal has \nhappened. Many new products have been introduced in the never-ending \nquest of the tobacco companies to find what they call replacement \nsmokers; that is, young folks who will continue to buy their products \nas their current customers die because they use their products.\n  So 6 years have passed and no action out of the administration. Year \nafter year, we have pushed, we have called as Senators, we have talked \nabout it on the floor, we have held meetings with the key officials, \nand it has always been: We are almost there. We are working on it. We \nknow how important it is.\n  But while this process has gone along so slowly, millions more of our \nchildren have become addicted to tobacco.\n  One of the main instruments the tobacco industry is using are flavors \ndesigned to target children. We can see here on the chart particularly \nflavors in the e-cigarette category. We have a whole variety. We have \ncoffee. We have cherry. We have apple. We have cherry bomb flavoring. I \nwas told today on the phone that there is a Captain Kangaroo flavor and \nthere is a Scooby Doo flavor. There is a gummy bear flavor. These \nflavors are not designed to entice adults into becoming smokers because \nthe industry knows that very rarely does an individual start to use \ntobacco products after the age of 21. It is the youth who experiment, \nand then the nicotine, as an addictive drug, does its work and turns \nthem into lifetime users. That is where, of course, the money is.\n  I was asked in an interview today how it is that the tobacco \ncompanies say these products are not targeted to children. I responded \nvery simply. It is the big lie. No one, no individual can look at the \nflavors of these products and not know they are targeting our children.\n  So what has happened in the last few years is the e-cigarette \nindustry is the most successful of the products that tobacco companies \nhave tested. In fact, in just the last year alone, use by our high \nschool students has tripled. That means we now have 2 million high \nschool--the survey was the previous 30 days, and in the previous 30 \ndays, 2 million of our high school students had utilized e-cigarettes. \nSo the tobacco campaign is working, which means they are hard at work \ncompromising the health and welfare of our children and leading them \ndown a path to suffering and death. That is unacceptable.\n  So we are here today--a number of us--to simply say to our own \nadministration, our executive branch: Get the regulations done. They \nhave now been forwarded from the Food and Drug Administration, from the \nFDA, to the Office of Management and Budget, which does the final \nreview of those regulations. Get the regulations done, and make sure \nthey are strong regulations. Do not put in a clause that grandfathers \nall the products and exempts them from regulations that have been \nproduced up until now. Such a grandfather clause would tear the heart \nout, tear the guts out of the entire effort to regulate these killer \nproducts. And certainly regulate the flavors. That is the key, core \nstrategy of addicting our children. Do not ignore that key, core \nstrategy.\n  This is something very real that this body debated and decided to do \nand turn it over to the executive branch. It is way past time for the \nexecutive branch to act. So we are asking for quick and powerful, \nforceful action to stop the carnage that is ensuing from the failure of \nthese regulations.\n  Several colleagues are coming to the floor to join this conversation. \nThe Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Blumenthal, is planning to jump in \nnext, followed by Senator Markey and then Senator Warren.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am going to yield to Senator Markey, \nif I may, and then follow him in light of the scheduling needs that he \nmay have, and then I will yield to Senator Warren. Thank you.\n\n[[Page S7581]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. MARKEY. Thank you, Senator Blumenthal, and Senator Merkley, thank \nyou for organizing this. Thank you to Senator Warren and to everyone \nwho is here.\n  Mr. President, with Halloween just days away, I would like to share \nsome scary facts about nicotine. Nicotine is the main ingredient in \ncigarettes and is also found in the new cigarettes, the e-cigarettes.\n  Four decades of scientific research have proved the following: First, \nnicotine is addictive; second, nicotine affects brain development; \nthird, nicotine combined with tobacco is responsible for claiming \nmillions of lives.\n  These facts are true, but for years Big Tobacco willfully, \nconsistently, publicly, and falsely denied them. Those lies were \nexposed at congressional hearings, and thanks to the tireless efforts \nof anti-smoking and public health advocates, traditional cigarette \nsmoking has declined from 50 percent of all adults to 18 percent of all \nadults in the United States. How many millions of lives have been saved \nbecause of that?\n  Big Tobacco and the e-cigarette industry are like the undead. \nTraditional cigarettes are being supplanted by e-cigarettes. Today e-\ncigarette sales in the United States alone topped $1 billion, and e-\ncigarette use is growing as fast as the students who are smoking them. \nThe use of e-cigarettes among middle and high school students has \nskyrocketed, tripling from 2013 to 2014, accounting for upwards of 13 \npercent of all high school students. That is when my father began to \nsmoke two packs of Camels a day. My father died from smoking two packs \nof Camels a day.\n  Nearly 2.5 million young Americans currently use e-cigarettes. Why \nthe explosion in youth e-cigarette smoking? It is because Big Tobacco \nand the e-cigarette industry are marketing their dangerous nicotine \ndelivery product to children and teens.\n  Big Tobacco would have our young people think that e-cigarettes are a \ntreat, but they are a cruel trick on those children. The younger a \nperson is when he or she starts using products containing nicotine, the \nmore difficult it is to quit.\n  We know from years of research that flavors attract young people. \nThat is why Congress explicitly banned cigarettes with flavors like \ncherry and bubble gum, because of their appeal to young people. So it \nis very disappointing, but not surprising, that new nicotine delivery \nproducts are available in a myriad of flavors, from cotton candy to \nvanilla cupcake to Coca-Cola.\n  I wonder what this industry is trying to do. Flavors were outlawed \nfrom the traditional cigarette industry. You don't have to be a \ndetective to figure it out because over the past decade we have made \ngreat strides in educating children and teens about the dangers of \nsmoking, and now we can't allow e-cigarettes to snuff out the progress \nwe have made in preventing nicotine addiction and its deadly \nconsequences.\n  We need to ban the marketing of e-cigarettes to kids and teens. We \nneed to ban the use of fruit and candy flavoring clearly meant to \nattract children. We need to ban the online sales of e-cigarettes to \nkeep them out of the hands of children. The dangers of e-cigarettes are \nclear. Every day we wait is another day that young Americans can fall \nprey to harmful products pushed by the tobacco industry.\n  Last year at a commerce committee hearing, when I asked several e-\ncigarette company leaders to commit to ceasing the sale of these types \nof flavored products, a few agreed, but the vast majority have not and \nwill not. Just today the e-cigarette industry trade group, the Tobacco \nVapor Electronic Cigarette Association, threatened the FDA after \nposting on its Web site what the association purports is leaked draft \nindustry guidance under the new deeming rule, tweeting: ``The FDA needs \nto know we mean business.''\n  The association got it partially right. The e-cigarette industry \nshould be put out of business.\n  My father smoked two packs of Camels a day. Back then it was a cool \nthing to do. For decades Big Tobacco denied that there was any linkage \nbetween smoking and cancer. My father died because of that denial of \nthe tobacco industry and the cooperation of the U.S. Congress.\n  Today electronic cigarettes are no better than the Joe Camels of the \npast. Through e-cigarettes, children and teens are still getting \naddicted to nicotine and putting their health and futures at grave \nrisk.\n  I urge OMB to give America's youth a real Halloween treat by \nfinalizing the deeming rule and stopping the sale of these candy-\nflavored poisons.\n  Thank you, and I yield back.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues for \ntheir very powerful comments, and I have a poster as well. In the \nspirit of Halloween, mine uses candy. I doubt that children this \nHalloween are going to receive some of these products--I hope not--when \nthey go door-to-door, but people looking at this poster could easily \nmistake the candy for the candy-flavored cigarillos or the candy that \nlooks like cigarettes, appears to be tobacco products, or the spit \ntobacco that is flavored with candy look-alikes.\n  Today the temptation is to have some fun, use some puns, but I come \nhere in sadness and frankly in anger--sadness that every day thousands \nof people will become addicted to nicotine and suffer from diseases \nthat tobacco causes, whether it is cancer or smoking-related lung \nproblems, and also tobacco-related problems that can increase the cost \nas well as the suffering in our Nation.\n  We are dealing here with indefensible delays in issuing a rule that \nis necessary to enforce the law. Let me be clear about what is \nhappening. The Tobacco Control Act was passed 6 years ago. All of us \nthought the provisions of that Federal law would go into effect to \nprotect Americans against the nicotine addiction that is peddled \nrelentlessly and tirelessly by the tobacco industry. We are 6 years \nlater in an administration that is probably the most pro-public health \nand anti-tobacco abuse of any in our history, and still, 6 years later \nthat law is unenforced, and the reason is there are no regulations.\n  We are 18 months after the FDA released the rule called the deeming \nrule necessary to enforce that law. Eighteen months have passed since \nthe FDA acted, 6 years since the law was passed in this body, and still \nthere is no protection for Americans.\n  This fight goes back years and years, and I was involved as attorney \ngeneral for the State of Connecticut in helping bring a landmark \nlawsuit. I helped to lead that lawsuit as one of the States that sued \nthe tobacco companies for marketing to children.\n  Back then this poster might have been used in court, and I appeared \nin court to say that the tobacco companies, despite their denials, were \nmarketing and pitching to children by using Joe Camel. Today the \nplaybook is exactly the same. The tactics have changed, but the \nstrategy is the same: using pitches, wrappings, and flavors to target \nchildren--not teenagers or college kids--but younger children who are \npersuaded by the model of their older siblings and friends to begin a \nlifetime of addiction and disease.\n  They may be fooled by the candy flavors and the wrappings and the \npitches that are used, but we should not be, the FDA should not be, and \nthe Office of Management and Budget should not be fooled. They should \nnot be waiting to issue this rule. It should be issued now.\n  We have written to them, asking that the rule be issued. A number of \nus wrote a letter to Shaun Donovan. I very simply asked the President \nof the United States for no more delays. Do the rule now. There is no \nexcuse for delay and, by the way, time is not on our side. During every \nyear of delay, thousands more children become addicted, and the \nPresident of the United States knows about that addiction because he is \na former smoker--hopefully it is former, not present--and he knows the \npower of nicotine because he has worked hard to overcome it.\n  Let's prevent young people from becoming addicted in the first place. \nLet's save money and save lives. Please, Mr. President of the United \nStates, issue this rule.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I would like to thank Senator Merkley for organizing this event this \nafternoon and Senators Blumenthal and Markey for their work on this.\n  Smoking produces corporate profits, period. There is the heart of the \nproblem of e-cigarettes. Long after the\n\n[[Page S7582]]\n\nscience showed that cigarette smoking kills, long after the industry \ndenied and denied, long after millions of people died from smoking-\nrelated cancers and heart disease, this country finally got serious \nabout cutting smoking rates.\n  Much of our attention has been focused on ways to keep the industry \nfrom hooking young people, and it is a good approach: If you don't \nstart, you don't have to quit. For decades now public health experts \nhave worked to reduce smoking and to keep kids and teens from becoming \naddicted to cigarettes. Congress passed the laws and implemented \nregulations that restricted access for teens. We increased tobacco \ntaxes, and we clamped down on marketing to kids. State and local \ngovernments along with the private sector limited smoking in public. \nThose combined efforts worked. Since the late 1990s, the youth smoking \nrate has been cut by more than 50 percent.\n  The most recent effort in Congress to address this issue was the \npassage of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of \n2009. The late Senator Ted Kennedy fought for years and years to give \nthe FDA authority to regulate the manufacture, distribution, and \nmarketing of tobacco. I stand at his desk today to continue this fight \nbecause the law was passed but our Federal agencies have still not \nfully implemented it, and the tobacco industry continues to target \nyoung people.\n  The industry profits from getting kids hooked early, so it finds \nevery way it can to undermine all the other work we have done to keep \nkids from getting hooked on nicotine. Because it is harder now to get \nkids hooked with cigarettes, the industry has turned to e-cigarettes.\n  Six years after the Tobacco Control Act was passed, the regulations \nthat deem e-cigarettes as tobacco products and make them subject to all \nof the rules in that bill have still not been finalized. As a result, \ne-cigarettes remain virtually unregulated at the Federal level--no age \nlimits, no marketing restrictions, nothing but a splotchy patchwork of \nState and local restrictions. Even though most states ban the sale of \ne-cigarettes to minors, this is not enough to combat the deliberate and \nwell-financed work of the tobacco industry to hook another generation \nof kids on their products.\n  Now, an investigation last year by House and Senate leaders revealed \nhow the tobacco industry is marketing their products to kids. It found \nthat the industry is following the exact same practices of marketing to \nkids and teens that addicted a generation to cigarettes decades ago. \nTobacco companies market e-cigs with cartoons and Santa Claus. They \nshow popular celebrities and beautiful models using e-cigs.\n  Tobacco companies push e-cigs in flavors designed to appeal to kids--\nflavors like cherry crush and chocolate treat. Tobacco companies \nprovide free samples at concerts and other youth-oriented events. \nTobacco companies advertise on television shows and radio programs that \nattract large audiences of teens and preteens. To bring it all into the \ndigital age, tobacco companies use all of these tactics online and on \nsocial media.\n  The tobacco industry has done all of this before. It is having the \nsame result. According to the CDC, e-cigarette use by middle \nschoolers--that is sixth, seventh, and eighth graders--and high school \nstudents tripled in 2014 alone. New data released yesterday shows that \n21.6 percent of young adults 18 to 24 have used an e-cigarette.\n  For teens, e-cig use is now greater than the use of all other tobacco \nproducts. Look, the tobacco industry is up to its old tricks, but we \nare not going to fall for them again. After more than 6 years since the \npassage of the Tobacco Control Act, the Federal Government is finally \non the cusp of regulations to rein in the industry's e-cigarette \nmarketing efforts. Every day that goes by without this regulation, the \ntobacco industry hooks more kids.\n  We need a strong rule today, and that is why I join my colleagues to \nurge the Office of Management and Budget to act without delay and to \nrelease this important regulation. It is time--no, it is past time to \ntake action, time to push back against the tobacco industry, time to \nstand up for our families' health.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I would like very much to thank my \ncolleagues for coming to the floor and speaking to this issue, my \ncolleagues from Connecticut, Senator Blumenthal; from Massachusetts, \nSenator Markey; and Senator Warren, also from Massachusetts.\n  I must say that this topic of addiction to tobacco and tobacco \nproducts being targeted at our children is not one that is only \nrelevant to one State or this State or that State, it affects children \nin rural America, in urban America, and in every State and corner of \nour Nation. So there is basically a universal impact. That is probably \npart of the reason the Senate came together, during a period in which \nthere has been substantial dysfunction and substantial paralysis, and \nsaid, no, it is time to regulate these tobacco products as the drugs \nthat they are, but during the 6 years since the bill was passed, we \nhave had no regulation. So I appreciate my colleagues coming to the \nfloor and trying to amplify the message that this is unacceptable, \nbecause children will be addicted, they will develop diseases, they \nwill suffer, and they will die because of the inaction in putting the \nregulations forward.\n  This is completely unacceptable. During this time, there have been a \nlot of experimental products put out by the tobacco industry. They have \nput out finely ground tobacco in the form of mints. They put them into \nhour glass-shaped candy holders so that when students would put them in \nour pockets, it would look like a cell phone.\n  That may not make sense in this age of smartphones, but just a few \nyears ago, in 2009, when this was being test-marketed in my State of \nOregon and test-marketed in Ohio, the shape of the most popular \ncellphones kind of had a little bit of an hourglass shape to it. So the \nidea was it would look like a cellphone and not like tobacco when you \nwere in school.\n  They came out with a product of toothpicks made out of finely ground \ntobacco. They came out with a product of breath strips that you put on \nyour tongue. Can you imagine tobacco to freshen your breath? They were \nexperimenting with everything, but the payday was not toothpicks, it \nwas not mints, and it was not breath strips; the payday product is e-\ncigarettes.\n  I am going to put the chart back up about the e-cigarettes. There are \ntwo fundamental myths propagated by the tobacco industry. The first is \nthat they are not marketing to youth. Well, let's examine the type of \nflavors in these products. We have apple--these are just the ones on \nthis chart. We have cotton candy. We have gummy bear. We have \nwatermelon. We have candy crave. We have Red Bull. We have peach.\n  These candy and fruit flavors are designed to appeal to children and \nto mask some of the nastiness of smoking. Well, so that is big lie No. \n1 from the tobacco industry, that they are not targeting our children. \nIt is absolutely clear they are.\n  Furthermore, they have to because they know that replacement \nsmokers--getting new smokers to replace those who are dying because of \ntheir products requires targeting children because very few people \nstart smoking when they are adults or start using tobacco products when \nthey are adults. The mind of the teenager is the perfect moment to gain \ntraction and produce addiction. That is why the tobacco companies are \ntargeting our children.\n  The second myth they put forward is that e-cigarettes are simply a \nwonderful health aid designed to get people to quit smoking. Maybe it \nis healthier than a cigarette with a tobacco leaf ground up inside of \nit or a clear liquid nicotine rather than a cigarette or a cigar. Do \nnot believe for a moment that tobacco companies are trying to help \nindividuals stop smoking. They did not do billions of dollars in \ncommerce by getting people to stop smoking. Everything about targeting \nkids is not about getting individuals to stop smoking but to start \nsmoking. That is the goal, to start smoking, to lead them into a life \nin which they will spend an enormous amount of money buying a product \nthat is destroying their body.\n  Eventually they will suffer. Eventually they will die. It will be a \nheart attack. It will be lung cancer. It will be\n\n[[Page S7583]]\n\na whole host of--emphysema. OK. Maybe not every single individual, but \na huge number of folks who become addicted in their youth will suffer \nsubstantial health consequences. Even those who don't have cancer or \nfull-blown emphysema will experience other health impacts that make \nthem a less healthy individual and compromise their quality of life.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues so much for coming to the floor to \naccentuate this message that we have waited far too long for the \nregulations to get done to take on this industry and that we are \ndemanding that when the regulation is published--and hopefully that \nwill be very soon, as in days or weeks--that will be a regulation that \nis written in a forceful, comprehensive fashion, that will not have a \ngrandfather clause that excludes existing products from regulation, and \nit will not fail to address this powerful instrument being used to \ntarget our children, which are fruit and candy flavors.\n  We ask, now that the Food and Drug Administration has forwarded this \ndecision to the Office of Management and Budget for final \ndecisionmaking, that OMB come out quickly, forcefully, and strongly to \naddress this tremendous blight on our society.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/senate-section/article/S7583-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7583-S7584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time as the ranking Democrat \non the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to bring to my colleagues' \nattention a very disturbing trend that is taking place on us carrying \nout our constitutional responsibilities. It is up to the Senate, and \nonly the Senate, to confirm--advise and consent--appointments by the \nPresident of the United States that require the confirmation of the \nSenate.\n  I think the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which I am honored to \nserve on and act as the ranking Democrat, has acted in a very \nresponsible manner in scheduling hearings and taking action on the \nnominations that have been submitted by President Obama. I thank \nSenator Corker. He has scheduled these hearings in a very timely way \nand scheduled markups in our committee so we can make our \nrecommendations to the full Senate. That is not true of the Senate as a \nbody. There are currently 16--16--highly qualified nominees who have \nbeen recommended for Senate confirmation, none of whom are \ncontroversial, who are awaiting action on the floor of the Senate. Some \nof these nominees have been waiting as long as 10 months, almost a year \nfor action by the Senate. Let me repeat this: Not one of these nominees \nis being held up because of challenges to his or her qualifications to \nassume the responsibilities of the position for which that person has \nbeen nominated. In each of these cases they have cleared the committee \nhurdle by unanimous or near unanimous votes in the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee.\n  So why have we not taken up those nominees for confirmation votes on \nthe floor of the Senate? They are not controversial. They are qualified \nfor the position. The reason is that in each case a Senator has placed \na hold on the consideration of that nominee. What does a hold mean? It \nmeans a Senator has let their respective caucus know they will not \nconsent to the nomination coming before the Senate either as a \nunanimous consent request or for a vote on the floor of the Senate. \nThat has been the prerogative of Members of the Senate. They can do \nthat. The way you overcome that is either the Senator eliminates the \nhold--in these cases each one of the holds have nothing to do with the \nqualifications of the individual for this position--or the majority \nleader, Senator McConnell, brings forward the nomination, if necessary \nuses a cloture motion in order to get this issue resolved. After all, \none Senator should not be able to stop a nomination on the floor of the \nSenate so we cannot carry out our responsibilities of advice and \nconsent.\n  Senator McConnell has been unwilling to do that. I understand the \nchallenges of floor time. I fully do. Ten months some of these nominees \nhave been waiting. These are critical missions for our Foreign Service. \nThe reasons these individuals are being held--let me just give you an \nexample--is because of a Member being upset with the Obama \nadministration for taking the Iran agreement to the United Nations for \na vote before action in the Senate--having nothing to do with the \nnominee we are talking about--or concerns about Secretary Clinton or \nconcerns about the Secret Service but not related to the person who was \nnominated for the position we are talking about. That is just wrong. We \nhave the constitutional responsibility to advise and consent on \nPresidential appointments.\n\n  Let me give some examples that fall into this category of the 16 \nnominees who are currently waiting for Senate confirmation.\n  We have the Secretary of State for Conflict and Stabilization \nOperations. The person who has been nominated for that is Ambassador \nDavid Robinson, a career diplomat with 30 years of public service. He \nhas been the Principal Deputy High Representative in Bosnia-\nHerzegovina, one of the most difficult conflict areas in modern times. \nHe has served both Democratic and Republican administrations. He is a \ncareer diplomat.\n  The position we are talking about focuses on prevention and response \nto mass atrocities and countering violent extremism and election-\nrelated violence. I would think that is a high priority for this \nSenate, to make sure the United States has all hands on deck to deal \nwith these types of international challenges.\n  Ambassador Robinson has served far and wide under dangerous and \ndemanding circumstances. He was the Assistant Chief of Mission at the \nU.S. Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan. He served as the Principal \nAssistant Deputy Secretary for Population, Refugees, and Migration. He \nserved as U.S. Ambassador to Guyana from 2006 to 2008 and as Deputy \nChief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy in Georgetown, Guyana, from 2003 \nto 2006. He also served as the Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. \nEmbassy in Paraguay from 2000 to 2003.\n  He is a highly qualified individual who has shown a clear dedication \nand commitment to serving his country. He has been waiting almost 7 \nmonths for the Senate to act on his nomination.\n  I wish to cite another example, the State Department's Legal Adviser, \nBrian Egan. He has served both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations. This a critical mission, the Legal Adviser. Just \ntoday, in a hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, we \nhad General Allen, and a discussion ensued as to the legal authority we \nhave in regard to some of our activities. It would be good to have a \nconfirmed legal adviser so we can get those types of answers.\n  Like Ambassador Robinson, Mr. Egan has served in both Democratic and \nRepublican administrations. He began his career as a government lawyer \nin 2005, as a civil servant in the Office of the Legal Adviser of the \nState Department, which was headed at the time by Secretary of State \nCondoleezza Rice. He has worked in the private sector. He served as \nAssistant General Counsel for Enforcement and Intelligence at the \nTreasury Department. He served on the National Security Council staff. \nHe is a nonpartisan and fair-minded individual who clearly has the \nskills and the ability to lead the Office of Legal Adviser at the State \nDepartment. He has been waiting 9 months for confirmation--9 months. He \nis a person who has devoted his career to public service.\n  That is no way to treat people who want to give their service to this \ncountry in an important role. We need to carry out our responsibility.\n  At the USAID, the Administrator position has not been confirmed. The \nUSAID Assistant Administrator for Europe and Eurasia has not been \nconfirmed. The inspector general of USAID has not been confirmed. These \nappointments have been in the Senate for some time.\n  I have listened to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle talk \nabout the refugee crisis. We are approaching the number of people who \nare dislocated in this world similar to what we had at the end of World \nWar II. The principal agency that deals with this crisis in the United \nStates is the USAID. We know we have conflict areas all over the world, \nand we have heard over and over again that the way we deal with this--\none of our major tools--is through development assistance. We need \nconfirmed, top management at\n\n[[Page S7584]]\n\nthis agency. The Senate has an obligation to act.\n  None of these nominees are noncontroversial. I want to repeat that. \nThey are not being held by a Senator because of anything to do with \ntheir qualifications for the position for which they have been \nnominated. There have been unrelated issues for a long period of time \ncompromising the critical missions of these agencies.\n  Just as tragically, there are 20 innocent USAID Foreign Service \nofficers who have been held up. These 20 USAID Foreign Service officers \nare not nominated for Ambassador positions or Assistant Secretary \nposition; these are folks who were plucked from a list of 181 \npromotions that must be confirmed by the full Senate for the promotions \nto take effect. In other words, their promotions have not taken effect \nbecause of an individual hold by a Senator for reasons unrelated to \ntheir performance in office--career diplomats, civil service. These are \ncivil servants who are working hard day in and day out serving their \ncountry in both Democratic and Republican administrations. They are not \ninvolved in the politics of the Senate, and yet they are the casualties \nof these politics.\n  These individuals are called upon to serve in challenging and \nsometimes very dangerous places. We are talking about a Supervisory \nProgram Officer in Cambodia, the Deputy Director for East Africa \nOperations in Kenya, the Director of the Democracy and Governance \nOffice in Rwanda, a Senior Advisor for Civilian-Military Cooperation, a \nResident Legal Officer for the Resident Mission in Asia, an Education \nOfficer in Honduras, a Regional Legal Advisor in El Salvador, a Deputy \nController for Financial Management in El Salvador, a Regional Food for \nPeace Officer in Ethiopia, a Regional Legal Advisor in Egypt, a Deputy \nEducation and Youth Office Director in Kenya, the Director of the Food \nfor Peace Program in South Sudan, the Democracy and Governance Director \nin El Salvador, the Economic Growth Team Leader in Zambia, the Economic \nGrowth Office Director in Ukraine, and a Controller for Financial \nManagement in Rwanda.\n  I went through that list because I think everyone would acknowledge \nthat these are people who are serving in very dangerous places.\n  As I mentioned, we had a hearing in the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee with General Allen, who is doing incredible public service \nfor our representative in the Middle East. He said he wanted to thank \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee for the attention we have given \nto our diplomats.\n  Often on the floor of the Senate you hear glowing thanks--and I join \nin that--to the men and women who have worn the uniform of our Nation \nto defend our freedom. Well, our thanks go equally to our Foreign \nService officers who serve in very dangerous positions in order to \nadvance the U.S. principles of democracy and human rights. We know \nabout the casualties we have suffered in that regard. These individuals \nare entitled to their promotions, and it requires our action. To hold \nup their promotions for reasons unrelated to their job performance is \njust plain irresponsible, and we need to take up these nominees.\n  There are ambassadorships that have been open for way too long. I \ncould mention many of the ambassadorships, but I will just mention \ntwo--Sweden and Trinidad and Tobago.\n  Sweden, of course, is a strategic ally and an Arctic Council member. \nAzita Raji has been nominated. She is a businesswoman who has been the \nvice president of J.P. Morgan Securities. She brings her unique \nexpertise from the business sector to help one of our critical \nAmbassador positions. Again, she is a noncontroversial nominee who has \nbeen held up 10 months. Sweden is a critical partner for the United \nStates.\n  In Trinidad and Tobago, John Estrada has been waiting 180 days for \nhis confirmation. Trinidad is a critical place for the United States as \nfar as drug-smuggling activities that bring drugs into the United \nStates. We need a confirmed Ambassador to lead that fight against drug \nsmuggling into the United States. Again, he is being held up for \nreasons unrelated to his own qualifications.\n  I could go through all the 16 nominees. I think I have made my point. \nMy point is that I think the public would be surprised to learn that \none Senator could block a nomination of a President, and that is used \nmany times unrelated to the qualifications of that individual for the \nposition for which he or she has been nominated. It has happened in the \nSenate numerous times, as I have just pointed out.\n  I think it is the responsibility of the Senate to say enough is \nenough. It is time for us to act on these nominees so they can continue \ntheir public service in a confirmed position to help us in our war \nagainst drugs, to help us in our international diplomacy, to help us in \ndevelopment assistance in order to resolve conflicts, and to provide \nthe very best legal advice to make sure that what we are doing is \nconsistent with our Constitution.\n  To do the services of the people for the people of this country, we \nhave to do our service in the Senate, and that is to take up and vote \non the President's nominees to these critical foreign policy positions.\n  I urge my colleagues to allow us to bring these nominees up for a \nvote so we can carry out our responsibility and so these people can \ncarry out their critically important missions to the security interests \nof the United States.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/senate-section/article/S7584-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7584-S7585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COMMERCIAL SPACE BILL\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, it looks like there has been a resolution \nbetween the House and Senate on a commercial space bill which includes \nan update. This goes way back 31 years ago. When this Senator was a \nyoung Congressman, I actually participated in and sponsored the first \nCommercial Space Act. Very few people could have envisioned what would \nhappen 30 years later with this legislation, for indeed commercial \ncompanies are delivering launch services not only to commercial \ncustomers, such as all of our satellites, GPS systems, and some \ncommunication satellites, but also government payloads for the U.S. \nGovernment, obviously Air Force payloads, and various other intel \nsatellites and satellites for foreign countries.\n  Our American space launchers are putting these satellites up into \nspace, and of course it has revolutionized our daily life. How many \namong us are so accustomed to using this device to look up the location \nof an address? How do you think that is happening? It is happening \nbecause we have hundreds of satellites up there in the GPS system--\nscores of satellites--that give you precise locations of any point on \nthe globe where one might want to visit. These devices have gotten so \nsophisticated that they talk to you and say: Go 600 feet and turn right \non such and such street and then turn left. It is just amazing. This \ndoesn't just happen. It happens because of our space industry and in \nparticular our commercial space industry.\n  Since this Senator, as a young Congressman, got into this in the \nbeginning, which was about 31 years ago, we have had to update this \nlegislation. A lot of things have happened, and now there are very \nsignificant things that are happening. For the past decade, we have had \na national laboratory in space, which is one component of what is \nhappening, and it is known as the International Space Station. There \nare six human beings up there. There is an international crew, which \nincludes American astronauts, and one of them, by the way, has now \ncompleted 6 months of a 1-year stay so we can study the effects on the \nhuman body after a long duration in space. That will help us so we can \nbe ready to go to Mars with human beings in the decade of the 2030s.\n  There are other activities on the space station that are commercial \nactivities. There are all kinds of pharmaceutical experiments that are \ngoing on. As a matter of fact, there are drug trials right now, and the \nFDA, having used the properties of zero G on the International Space \nStation, is developing vaccines for salmonella and\n\n[[Page S7585]]\n\nMRSA. If using the properties of zero G may help us to develop vaccines \nthat help us with diseases and bacteria on Earth, then that is a \nsignificant accomplishment. Those are some of the commercial activities \nthat are taking place in space.\n  As we think way into the future, we could be mining other planets, \nand we could certainly be mining asteroids. Wouldn't it be nice if we \nfound an asteroid that was suddenly full of diamonds. We don't even \nhave to stretch our imagination that far. There are all kinds of \nelements on these asteroids.\n  This legislation should be cleared later on tonight and in the \nmorning by both sides. Once it has been cleared, we can take the House \nbill that is down here, amend it on the Senate bill, and send it back \nto the House. The House has agreed with the far-reaching thought of \nmining on asteroids, which will be considered intellectual property so \nit is preserved for the commercial sector and that would be their \nproperty.\n  This whole commercial space business today, including launching and \nsome of the other activities, unbelievably, is a $330 billion industry. \nThe commercial launch industry started out on American rockets. Over \nthe course of the last three decades, our launchers were more \nexpensive, and so international competitors came into this--the \nRussians, in some cases using old Soviet rockets, and the European \nSpace Agency launched the Ariane rocket, which they developed. Other \nnations also have rockets that offer fierce competition to the American \nrockets.\n  The need for this legislation to be passed at this time--by updating \nthe Commercial Space Act--is because we are now seeing commercial \nenterprises that are set on a road in the NASA authorization bill of \n2010 and are becoming so efficient and effective that they are bringing \ndown the cost of launching payloads into orbit. That is also \nbenefitting the U.S. Government, which is buying these launch services \nin order to get government payloads into orbit. Because of that, we are \nnow seeing some of that international business which went to other \ncountries starting to come back to us. Orbital Sciences has a \ncommercial rocket, and SpaceX has a very successful program. Amazon \nfounder, Jeff Bezos, has a rocket company called Blue Origin and is \nlikewise getting into the commercial space business. There are many \nothers as well.\n  This is an exciting time for us to be bringing a lot of this activity \nback to America. Therefore, at the end of the day, what does that mean? \nMore industry, more high-tech, more research and development, more \nexploration, and more jobs.\n  So we are seeing increasingly the U.S. Air Force cooperate on their \ninstallation, the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, using government \nproperty but leased through State or local space authorities, which are \nthen, in turn, leasing to these commercial operators. A good example \nthat has been tremendously successful for the past several years is an \nElon Musk company called SpaceX. They contracted with Space Florida, \nwhich had worked out an arrangement with the Cape Canaveral Air Force \nStation for launch complex 40, for that to be the SpaceX launchpad. \nThey have been enormously successful. They have not only launched \ngovernment payloads--the NASA cargo to and from the space station--but \nthey have also launched other commercial payloads, government payloads \nof foreign countries, as well as government payloads of the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  Eventually, that commercial space company, along with the Boeing \nCompany, will be the ones that, in just 2 years, will launch American \nastronauts on American rockets for the first time since the shutdown of \nthe space shuttle back in 2011--American astronauts on American rockets \nto and from our international space station. Those two companies are \ncompeting for it, but it doesn't mean that just one of the two \nnecessarily wins the competition. Both could be the providers for NASA \nof ways for us to get Americans on American rockets to our own \ninternational space station instead of having to rely on the Russian--\nvery proven and very dependable--Soyuz rocket, which is the only way to \nget our astronauts there at the moment, until we start flying these \nother new rockets.\n  So I wanted to alert the Senate that this is happening as we speak. I \nhope we get all of the clearances in the Senate later tonight--if not, \nearly in the morning--so that we can get this amended, onto the House \nbill. It would basically be this: ``Strike all after the enacting \nclause,'' put the Senate bill on, which we have already negotiated with \nthe House, get it to the House, let them pass it, and get it to the \nPresident for signature. I wanted to bring the Senate up to date on \nwhat is happening.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to speak about the unfortunate \nextension of the deadline for the implementation of positive train \ncontrol, or PTC.\n  As one of the authors of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008--\nwhich established the PTC mandate--I stand here committed to ensuring \nthat PTC is installed on all our Nation's railways as soon as possible.\n  Current law states railroads must fully install PTC by the end of \nthis year. For a variety of reasons, we all know this is not feasible \nfor all railroads. But we can't let this drag on indefinitely.\n  It's a matter of public safety. We must get this done.\n  The focus of the current debate has been on why an extension of the \nmandate is necessary, but I would like to take a step back and remind \nmy colleagues why the mandate itself is necessary.\n  On September 12, 2008, the inattentive conductor of a Metrolink \ntrain--a commuter railroad in the Los Angeles area--missed a red light \nand entered a stretch of single track going the wrong way.\n  The train collided with a Union Pacific freight train, which \ncompletely demolished the first commuter car. The accident killed 25 \nand injured more than 100.\n  This was an absolute tragedy for my State and the country.\n  What is even more tragic: It was 100 percent preventable. Had PTC \nbeen installed, we would have avoided this tragedy.\n  The National Transportation Safety Board has been recommending the \ninstallation of PTC since an accident in Connecticut in 1969.\n  This technology is lifesaving. It prevents train-to-train collisions \nand overspeed derailments and other rail dangers.\n  PTC could have saved 25 lives in Chatsworth. In fact, PTC could have \nsaved at least 288 lives and prevented more than 6,500 injuries in \naccidents across 36 States since 1969.\n  In 2008, at long last, Congress passed a law requiring PTC \nimplementation by the end of 2015, giving railroads 7 years to comply.\n  It is extremely disappointing that most railroads will not meet this \ndeadline.\n  It didn't have to be this way.\n  The passenger railroads in California took this legal and moral \nimperative seriously. They committed resources.\n  In fact, Metrolink will be the first system in the Nation to fully \nimplement positive train control when the Federal Railroad \nAdministration gives its final certification by the end of this year.\n  The Bay Area is also well ahead of the curve. Caltrain will begin \noperating PTC on its line between Gilroy and San Francisco by the end \nof the year, with final certification expected early next year.\n  These stories show that it can be done on time.\n  But the sad fact is few railroads will meet the 2015 deadline as \nmandated by law.\n  Yes, there were some unanticipated challenges and procedural hurdles \nthat have contributed to the delay.\n  But more devastating were legal challenges from the industry and \nrailroads failing to commit the necessary resources.\n  So here we are today, debating an extension.\n  Let me be very clear: the PTC extension provision the House sent over \nis flawed.\n  In my view, we need to be forcing railroads to implement this as soon \nas possible, and the House proposal fails to do that.\n  Instead, it gives all railroads a blanket extension until 2018, even \nthose that would be done well before then.\n  The Secretary of Transportation can take enforcement actions against \nrailroads that miss certain annual milestones between now and 2018, but \nthe railroads themselves get to establish those milestones in the first \nplace.\n  After the 3-year blanket extension, railroads can request an \nadditional 2-year extension, so long as a railroad is about halfway \ncomplete with implementation.\n  That means they will have until 2020--12 years after Congress first \nmandated the technology and 50 years since the National Transportation \nSafety Board began calling for it.\n  This is effectively a 5-year extension, precisely what railroads have \nbeen lobbying for.\n  There are better options available.\n  In fact, we anticipated the need for an extension years ago and \nworked to find reasonable compromises.\n  First, in 2012, we tried to modify the mandate.\n  I supported a provision that passed the Senate in that year's \ntransportation reauthorization bill.\n  It would have kept the deadline in 2015, but allowed the \nadministration to grant up to three 1-year extensions to railroads on a \ncase-by-case basis only when necessary and where railroads were working \ndiligently.\n  But the railroads wanted 5 years, and the provision was dropped from \nthe final bill.\n  Then earlier this year, debate began anew.\n  The Commerce Committee approved a bill that would provide railroads \nwith a blanket extension of 5 to 7 years.\n  I thought that was reckless and unnecessarily long.\n  Together with several of my colleagues, we reintroduced separate \nlegislation along the lines of the provision that passed the Senate in \n2012.\n  This started negotiations that led to the two different provisions \nnow included in the House and Senate transportation reauthorization \nbills.\n  These provisions are each much improved from a blanket 5- to 7-year \nextension, but both remain flawed.\n  In my view, it would be fair and reasonable for the remaining policy \ndifferences between these two provisions to be resolved during \nconference.\n\n[[Page S7587]]\n\n  I hope the conference would lead to a policy that takes the best \nparts of both approaches and would be packaged as part of a bill that \nprovided sufficient resources for the commuter railroads to comply with \nthe mandate. We should let that process play out.\n  We should not rush to pass bad policy on this 3-week extension.\n  I now want to take a moment to describe something that has disturbed \nme throughout this entire process.\n  That is the aggressive stance of the railroad industry.\n  As we have seen in public, railroads have threatened to stop service \nfor rail passengers around Christmas and stop transporting certain \nchemicals before that.\n  Union Pacific's demand letter was the most explicit, acknowledging \nthat ``this will cause significant economic disruption for our \ncountry,'' but that it ``is in the best interest of our employees and \nshareholders.''\n  The railroads claim that the fines that will be charged next year by \nthe Federal Railroad Administration would be so draconian that they \nwould be unable to continue operating as railroads.\n  It is very difficult to believe the government would fine railroads \nto such an extreme. The government's goal is simply to compel the \nfastest possible implementation of PTC.\n  The railroads also say that in the event of a PTC-preventable \naccident, they would be liable for excessive damages. But as we all \nknow, there is a liability cap for passenger accidents.\n  And for hazardous materials accidents, the railroads have been \nshipping chlorine and ammonia for decades. It is offensive that only \nwhen a railroad could face full liability for an accident that they \nfind operation without PTC to be unacceptably dangerous.\n  The railroads' overtly political threats of economic calamity are not \nconstructive. They serve only to create a hysterical atmosphere that \nprevents meaningful negotiations.\n  It is entirely inappropriate that the railroad industry would make \nhostages of America's passenger rail services and chemical shippers in \norder to secure their favored legislative outcome.\n  What we are discussing today is a bad proposal. We should be \nprioritizing public safety. But this House-passed provision does not.\n  The proper place for this debate is in the long-term transportation \nreauthorization bill.\n  It is very unfortunate that this has been attached to a must-pass \nshort term extension of the highway trust fund.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today's extension of the deadline to \nfully implement positive train control technology is deeply \ndisappointing. Passing this extension means that our rail system failed \nto make good on its original deadline, despite having nearly 7 years to \ndo so.\n  There are many reasons for the failure to meet this deadline, and the \nresponsibility for this failure is widely shared. The critical bottom \nline, however, is that positive train control saves lives. And we were \ntragically reminded of that fact again last May, when the derailment of \na speeding train near Philadelphia killed eight passengers, including a \nwonderful Michigan native, Rachel Jacobs, and injured 200 others. Had \npositive train control been in place on this section of track, it could \nhave prevented this terrible tragedy.\n  I understand that today's extension includes concrete milestones, new \nprogress reports, and stronger oversight by the Department of \nTransportation to ensure positive train control is a reality sooner \nrather than later. This needs to be a top priority for all of those \nresponsible for getting this done. This extension should not be seen as \nan excuse to slow progress. We cannot allow any further delays on \ninstalling this essential, lifesaving technology.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, as the Senate votes today on a short-term \nextension of the highway trust fund and an extension of the deadline \nfor positive train control, I rise to discuss the importance of \ntransportation safety and the need for vigorous oversight as both \npassenger and freight railroads strive to implement this life-saving \ntechnology.\n  Congress passed legislation 7 years ago that gave our Nation's rail \ncarriers until December 31 of this year to fully deploy and implement \npositive train control, or PTC, on all rail lines that carry passengers \nor toxic substances. Some railroads have made the investments necessary \nto make significant progress in meeting this deadline, and others have \nbeen slower for a number of reasons, ranging from the costs to the \ncomplexity of the technology.\n  The necessity of quickly implementing PTC took on a renewed urgency \nin May of this year when Amtrak train 188 derailed in Philadelphia, \ntaking the lives of eight passengers and injuring hundreds more. PTC \ncould have prevented this accident, and I am grateful the Federal \nRailroad Administration took swift action with Amtrak to improve safety \nin certain high-risk sections of the Northeast corridor. But more must \nbe done across the country and as soon as possible.\n  In recent months, with a deadline looming, Members on both sides of \nthe aisle have heard from railroads as well as downstream producers, \nshippers, and manufacturers who rely on transporting goods by rail. All \nstakeholders seem to recognize the importance of using new technology \nto make our railways safer. What has not had equal consensus is how \nlong it should take for this new technology to be installed and \nutilized. Recent legislative proposals, including in the Senate-passed \nDRIVE Act, would have created enforcement loopholes that weaken the \ntools of Federal safety regulators.\n  The bipartisan PTC language considered today closes these loopholes \nand sets a new implementation deadline of December 31, 2018. Railroads \nwill be required to set up implementation plans with clear benchmarks \nand timelines that will be enforceable by the Department of \nTransportation.\n  In what I hope will be very rare cases in which railroads may need an \nextension beyond that deadline, a limited period, not to exceed 24 \nmonths in total, may be applied should the railroad meet strict \ncriteria. These criteria include having PTC already implemented in the \nmajority of its territories, acquisition of all needed spectrum for \nimplementation, installation of all necessary hardware components, \ncompletion of employee trainings, and any additional criteria \nestablished by the Secretary.\n  While railroads and commuter authorities face an immense challenge in \nimplementing PTC, now and always, we must place the safety of our \ncitizens above the fear of difficulties incurred by necessary \ntechnological change.\n  As Congress extends the deadline for this lifesaving technology, we \nmust also extend our oversight and commit to meticulous and thorough \nreview of the ongoing implementation process. We should confirm \noutstanding nominees, including the nominee for FRA Administrator, who \nhas direct oversight responsibilities over PTC. Congress must also \ninvest more in our Nation's infrastructure and enable railroads to \naccess grants and various funding sources to help implement this \ntechnology, as well as other critical safety and state-of-good-repair \nneeds. We should remain diligent in ensuring that critical benchmarks \nand good-faith efforts to install the technology are being made by \nindustry and, if necessary, take actions to ensure compliance.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand with me in calling for reasonable and \ncommonsense conditions as we work to ensure every train hauling people \nand toxic materials in this Nation can operate as safely as possible \nwith new technology.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/senate-section/article/S7587-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7587-S7588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REGULATING ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it has now been more than 6 years since \nCongress gave the FDA authority to regulate the tobacco industry, and \nit is absolutely outrageous that we are still waiting for a final rule \nthat would protect our children from e-cigarettes.\n  What has happened while we wait? E-cigarette use among middle and \nhigh school students tripled last year compared to the year before. \nThat means that as many as 2.5 million children are now experimenting \nwith these dangerous products.\n  While we are finally making progress in reducing traditional \ncigarette smoking among young people, the soaring\n\n[[Page S7588]]\n\nuse of e-cigarettes is putting our children at risk of lifelong \naddiction to nicotine.\n  Every day that e-cigarettes continue to go unregulated, more and more \nchildren and teens are being exposed to nicotine--which according to \nthe Surgeon General poses health risks for adolescent brain \ndevelopment.\n  E-cigarettes also contain potentially dangerous chemicals like \nbenzene, cadmium, formaldehyde, propylene glycol, and some of the very \nsame nanoparticles that are in traditional cigarettes according to the \nCalifornia Department of Public Health.\n  But those chemicals are masked by e-cigarette flavors like bubble gum \nand gummy bear--which are clearly marketed toward children.\n  And the industry's dangerous targeting of young people is working. \nNew research published in the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation just this week shows that 81 percent of teens who have ever \ntried an e-cigarette started with a flavored one--81 percent.\n  Combine those flavors with TV ads airing during the most popular \nyouth TV shows and Big Tobacco is clearly seeking to lure the next \ngeneration into a lifetime of addiction to their products. A study \npublished in the journal ``Pediatrics'' last year found that youth \nexposure to television e-cigarette advertisements increased 256 percent \nfrom 2011 to 2013.\n  This is not an accident. Big Tobacco used the same marketing tactics \nwith traditional cigarettes decades ago--until we stopped them. These \ncompanies will not stop until millions more are hooked on nicotine.\n  So what do we do? We need to protect the health of our children by \nregulating e-cigarettes just like traditional cigarettes.\n  The administration needs to issue the final FDA rule to regulate e-\ncigarettes, which is currently at OMB. It has been more than a year and \na half since it was first proposed. While this rule may not go as far \nas I would like, it is a critical first step, and it must be approved \nimmediately.\n  First, the regulation should ban the sale of e-cigarettes to minors \nbecause it is just common sense. Take these dangerous products out of \nthe hands of our children.\n  Nearly every State already bans sales to minors--it is beyond time \nthe Federal Government makes this the law of the land.\n  Second, the FDA should subject products to FDA review before they can \nbe marketed.\n  Third, the FDA should ensure that e-cigarettes are labeled with \nhealth warnings.\n  Fourth, I want the FDA to go even further and ban flavors and \nmarketing tactics that appeal to children--and ban online sales as \nwell.\n  Now, we have seen some progress in how e-cigarettes are being \nhandled--like the Department of Transportation's announcement yesterday \nthat it will ban e-cigarettes from checked bags to reduce the risk of \nfires in flight. But we are still waiting for the final DOT rule \nprohibiting the use of e-cigarettes on board airplanes--where \npassengers are subject to the potentially toxic secondhand exposure.\n  The cost of doing nothing is putting too many lives at risk. The \nresearch is clear, and as time goes by, Americans are worried for their \nhealth and safety--and parents are worried about the long-term health \nconsequences for our children.\n  Just listen to what Sondra, from Corona, CA, told me. She says, ``I \nhave worked in our local high schools for almost 15 years. The e-\ncigarettes definitely need to be regulated for people under 18. I am \nconsistently told by students that `these are better' than traditional \ncigarettes. They don't realize the harm and the addictive qualities are \nstill present.''\n  There is no time to lose. We don't need another public health \nepidemic just as we have finally started to save lives by reducing \ncigarette smoking.\n  I join my colleagues and urge the administration to finalize the \npending regulation. We cannot wait another day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/senate-section/article/S7588-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING DR. JIM SAMPSON\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to honor an illustrious individual \nin both Oregon and the Nation's HIV/AIDS research and treatment \ncommunity who passed away on October 4 of this year. Dr. Jim Sampson, \nwhile born a Georgia southerner, made Portland, OR, his home for the \npast 36 years. As a father, husband, brother, uncle, and friend, Jim \ngenerated an inclusive atmosphere of passion, love, and laughter \nwherever he went. As a medical doctor and a fervent leader in the fight \nagainst HIV/AIDS through research and treatments, Jim brought hope and \ncompassion to his daily interactions with colleagues and patients \nalike. For Jim, no person or job was too big or too small to embrace.\n  In 1979, after Jim graduated from Emory University and the Medical \nCollege of Georgia, he moved to Portland to become the medical director \nof the health services division and the HIV/AIDS program at Multnomah \nCounty Health Department. At a time when a lack of public education and \nstigmatization of HIV/AIDS stymied research in America, Jim fought to \nbuild a greater understanding of the disease. Because of Jim's desire \nto see HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment improve through extensive \nresearch and because of the way he showed love and hope in his \ninteractions with his patients, Jim helped push the doors open wide in \nthe fight against HIV/AIDS.\n  Over the years, Jim expanded his involvement in the community and the \nfield of HIV/AIDS research and treatment. He would go on to become the \nchairman of the Oregon Board of Medical Examiners; cofound the Oregon \nAIDS taskforce; cofound Art AIDS; and sit as executive director and \nprincipal investigator at the Research and Education Group, where Jim \nand his colleagues conducted clinical research. Jim even managed to \nfind time to serve on the board of trustees for the Portland Institute \nfor Contemporary Art and the Pacific Northwest College of Art. Also, \nover the past 35 years, both Jim and his husband, Geof Beasley, created \nan unbelievable Sherwood, OR, garden, Bella Madrona, a place where \nJim's love of community, advocacy, and family still live on. The Bella \nMadrona garden has been nationally and internationally recognized, not \nonly for its remarkable beauty, but as the site for many benefits \nthrough the years, including human and animal rights, environmental \ncauses, and the arts.\n  Jim was a valued and loved leader, a healer, and a family man worthy \nof emulation. With a full and loving heart and an ambitious mindset, \nJim selflessly served Oregon and the Nation. While Jim will be \nremembered by those whose lives he touched, he will especially be \nremembered as a loving husband and partner of 47 years to Geof Beasley; \ndedicated father to daughter Adele; and caring brother to sisters, \nMiriam Tillman and Elizabeth Martin, and brother, George. I honor the \nesteemed life and career of Dr. Jim Sampson and thank him for his \nenduring legacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/senate-section/article/S7588-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7588-S7589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CONGRATULATING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SKANNER NEWS GROUP\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this year marks the 40th anniversary of the \nSkanner News Group, a renowned print and online news publication that \nserves African and African-American communities in Portland, OR, and \nthe Northwest.\n  Since 1975, the Skanner News Group has provided in-depth and \nessential coverage of its community as it relates to politics, social \njustice, civil rights, art, and food, all while holding true to its \nmission statement: ``Challenging people to shape a better future now.'' \nThe Skanner certainly has been a catalyst for change. In the late \n1980s, it was the Skanner's coverage of the debate to rename Union \nAvenue in Northeast Portland for Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard that \nplayed a crucial role in ensuring the community's request was \nfulfilled. Whether it is honoring minority-owned businesses or running \nprofiles on the Black Lives Matter movement, the Skanner is there to \ncover and inform all of us in Portland about the most important issues \nand topics of our time.\n  The Skanner's long list of awards is a testament not just to the \nimportance of this publication, but also the quality of its reporting. \nIt has received multiple National Newspaper Publishers Association \nawards and is a three-time\n\n[[Page S7589]]\n\nwinner of the West Coast Black Publishers Association's ``Publisher of \nthe Year'' award. As well as the national recognitions are local well-\nearned accolades that further demonstrate what the Skanner means to \nreaders across the Northwest.\n  Behind the success of this historic publication is a hard-working \nteam that has been instrumental in building the Skanner these past four \ndecades and positioning it for success for decades to come. I would \nlike to especially acknowledge cofounders Bobbie and Bernie Foster, two \npeople I consider the heart and soul of this operation. Beyond the \npublication, they created the Skanner Foundation, which runs a \nscholarship program that awards $1,000 each to the best and brightest \nyoung people to help them accomplish their educational goals. Bobbie \nand Bernie's passion for giving back is a key component of what makes \nthem and the Skanner so special.\n  In addition to all this great work, the foundation organizes an \nannual Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., breakfast that is renowned in \nOregon as being an event that justly honors one of the greatest civil \nrights leaders of our time. I have been privileged to attend the \nbreakfast and know full well what a huge impact it has.\n  The Skanner News Group is an institution that serves to better our \ncommunity, by inspiring, uplifting, and informing. I would like to \ncongratulate the staff on reaching their 40th anniversary and wish them \nthe best in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/senate-section/article/S7589-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      CONGRATULATING DICK ANDERSON\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate \nRichard ``Dick'' Anderson on receiving the United Service Organization, \nUSO, Volunteer of the Year award. USO Las Vegas proudly offers two \nlocations within McCarran International Airport for our Nation's \nservicemembers and their families to relax and feel at home. Open 24 \nhours and staffed by volunteers like Mr. Anderson, each location offers \nthese brave men and women a place to enjoy free electronic stations, \nentertainment, and food service. I am grateful for all USO Las Vegas \ndoes for Nevada's servicemembers, and it gives me great pleasure to see \na fellow Nevadan, Mr. Anderson, receive this national award in \nrecognition for volunteering to make this operation a reality.\n  Mr. Anderson has been an incredible contributor to this organization, \ndedicating countless volunteer hours to help military families. He \nserves as volunteer outreach team leader and welcome home/deployment \nassist team leader. Throughout the past year, USO Las Vegas has \nundergone great change with the installment of an additional location \nat McCarran International Airport. During this time, Mr. Anderson \noffered a great amount of support to the organization and even created \nthe volunteer outreach team to meet the extra need for volunteers at \nthe new location.\n  Throughout his time volunteering, Mr. Anderson has worked tirelessly \nto plan numerous events, recruit volunteers, and further expand the \norganization. His determination has proven to be successful, helping to \nbring in more than 500 new volunteers since July 2014. From Easter \nevents to fundraising and recruiting, Mr. Anderson has truly put our \nmilitary community first. Our State is fortunate to have someone like \nMr. Anderson--a man of great selflessness and commitment--working to \nhelp our Nation's heroes and their families.\n  There is no way to adequately thank our servicemembers who put their \nlives on the line in defense of our freedoms. Mr. Anderson is a shining \nexample of the manner in which we should respect our men and women in \nuniform. He deeply cares for our veterans, working to make each moment \nhe volunteers count. Without a doubt, his work brings greater happiness \nto Las Vegas' military community.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in recognizing \nall of Mr. Anderson's hard work and congratulating him on receiving \nthis much deserved award. Nevada is lucky to have this incredible \ncommunity member working to support our military men and women, and I \nwish him the best of luck in all of his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/senate-section/article/S7589-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECOGNIZING MARCH FARM\n\n Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate March Farm, \na fourth generation family farm from Connecticut, on its 100-year \nanniversary. Since 1915, when Thomas and Rose Marchukaitis put down \n$2,500 to buy 114 acres of land, the March family has worked hard to \nproduce delicious and healthy fruits and vegetables for the people of \nConnecticut.\n  March Farm, like many of Connecticut's nearly 6,000 farms, is small \nand family owned. Situated in beautiful Bethlehem, CT, they have a \ngrowing community supported agriculture business that now has about 90 \nmembers receiving regular crates of produce. They have worked hard to \nimplement efficient, modern farming practices, even as they eschew \nchemical pesticides and use environmentally sensitive pest mangagement \npractices. These practices and the bucolic setting they are located in \nare part of the reason they were recently named Connecticut's ``best \nfarm/orchard experience'' by Connecticut Magazine.\n  Many of my colleagues may be surprised to think of Connecticut as a \nfarming state, but I am glad to report that farming is alive, well, and \ngrowing at home. The movement towards locally produced fruits and \nvegetables and a growing awareness among consumers about healthy, \nsustainable food choices has supported a nearly 60 percent increase in \nthe number of farms in Connecticut since the 1980s. And many young \npeople, like Ben March, are leaving desk jobs to rediscover the \nfulfilment of farming, reinvigorating this vital sector.\n  These farms are an integral part of the fabric of our communities, \nbut they need our help to continue to thrive. Although small farms like \nMarch Farm make up fully 90 percent of all farms in the United States, \nlarge operations account for the vast bulk of production and sales of \nproduce nationwide. Small family farms face a number of challenges, not \nleast slimmer profit margins and higher risk. I will continue to fight \nfor small, local farm supports such as beginning farmer and rancher \ngrants and robust farm safety net programs.\n  March Farm is an example of the best of Connecticut, and I wish them \ncontinued success over their next 100 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/senate-section/article/S7589-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7589-S7590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING ARROWROCK DAM\n\n Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the 100th \nanniversary of Arrowrock Dam, situated in the great State of Idaho and \nits own ``eighth wonder of the world.'' This landmark is a testament to \nthe vision and hard work of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation in both the \ninitial building of the structure and keeping it operational over the \npast 100 years.\n  Formerly, the site of a private irrigation venture helmed by Arthur \nDe Wint Foote, the Arrowrock Dam was the grandest project undertaken by \nthe Bureau of Reclamation when it began in 1912. The dam stands at 350 \nfeet high and spans 1,150 feet with a record breaking 527,300 cubic \nyards of concrete laid on the dam.\n  The magnificent dam was dedicated 100 years ago on October 4, 1915. \nIt set many records, standing as the tallest dam in the world until a \ntaller one was built in Switzerland in 1924. Arrowrock proved to be a \npopular tourist attraction in that first year, drawing approximately \n12,000 visitors in its first week of operation. The Arrowrock Dam \nreceived acclaim from across the country and even the world.\n  Arrowrock Dam has allowed Idahoans to not only preserve our lands, \nbut also thrive by providing needed irrigation water for agricultural \nuses. Caring for the land shows a commitment to future generations \nwhile using the resources provided for the needs of today. In addition, \nthousands of people a year enjoy the many recreational activities \nprovided by the dam. We have enjoyed 100 years of protection from \nArrowrock, and I look forward to continued improvement of the dam and \nits service to the people of Boise and other Idahoans.\n  I congratulate everyone involved in its building, as well as the \ncontinued maintenance of this landmark. I wish\n\n[[Page S7590]]\n\nthem all the best as we all celebrate the past and look ahead to the \nfuture of Arrowrock Dam.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/senate-section/article/S7590-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/senate-section/article/S7590-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/senate-section/article/S7590-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nREPORT RELATIVE TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY RELATIVE \n TO THE ACTIONS AND POLICIES OF THE GOVERNMENT OF SUDAN AS DECLARED IN \n            EXECUTIVE ORDER 13067 OF NOVEMBER 3, 1997--PM 30\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging the United \n     States Congress and the United States Department of the Army \n     to accelerate federal funding to improve military vehicle \n     safety from rollover accidents; to the Committee on Armed \n     Services.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 156\n\n       Whereas, The United States Department of Defense is seeking \n     to implement fleet management and modernization solutions to \n     meet light tactical vehicle (LTV) requirements while \n     addressing the challenges associated with improving safety, \n     restoring threshold capabilities, maintaining average fleet \n     age, mitigating major component obsolescence, and reducing \n     sustainment and operating costs; and\n       Whereas, The Michigan National Guard and Michigan military \n     community have been and will continue to utilize the high \n     mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle (HMMWV) in their \n     missions to support and protect the United States. Non-\n     armored and up-armored HMMWVs are projected to be in the \n     fleet through 2048; and\n       Whereas, Preventable deadly rollover accidents continue in \n     the HMMWV fleet. Data from the U.S. Army Combat Readiness \n     Safety Center indicates that a significant number of HMMWV \n     rollover accidents and crashes continue today, resulting in \n     death and injury. Accidents occur outside the United States \n     and also within U.S. borders during peace missions and \n     training exercises, endangering the lives and property of \n     civilians as well; and\n       Whereas, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration \n     report data indicates that\n\n[[Page S7594]]\n\n     antilock brake systems (ABS) and electronic stability control \n     (ESC) reduce fatal rollovers by 74 percent and fatal impacts \n     with objects by 45.5 percent. The United States government \n     has mandated ABS and ESC in all road-going passenger vehicles \n     since 2011, and they are now standard equipment on all \n     passenger cars, light trucks, and vans. The technology has \n     been available to the public since 1987; and\n       Whereas, The HMMWV is not currently equipped with ABS or \n     ESC. The HMMWV threshold operational requirements include ABS \n     and ESC for the entire HMMWV fleet. Therefore, these vehicles \n     need to be brought up to operational requirements; and\n       Whereas, The Army Product Director Light Tactical Vehicles, \n     the Michigan National Guard, and the industry have \n     successfully developed and tested solutions using commercial \n     off-the-shelf components modified for defense vehicle \n     application. The proven components, obtained from Michigan's \n     high-volume automotive supply base, can be used to retrofit \n     the entire fleet; and\n       Whereas, Installation of these standard automotive safety \n     enhancement systems will considerably lower the number of \n     HMMWV rollovers and loss-of-control crashes, save lives, and \n     reduce costs; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we urge the \n     United States Congress and the U.S. Department of the Army to \n     accelerate federal funding to improve military vehicle safety \n     from rollover accidents; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate; the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives; the Chairman of the \n     United States Senate Armed Services Committee; the Chairman \n     of the House Armed Services Committee; the Chairman of the \n     Senate Appropriations Subcommittee for Defense; the Chairman \n     of the House Appropriations Subcommittee for Defense; the \n     Under Secretary of the Army; the Commandant of the Marine \n     Corps; the Chief of the National Guard Bureau; the Assistant \n     Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and \n     Technology; and the members of the Michigan congressional \n     delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/senate-section/article/S7594-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. KING:\n       S. 2212.

A bill to provide immunity from suit for certain individuals \nwho disclose potential examples of financial exploitation of senior \ncitizens, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate Aging \nCommittee, I am delighted to be joined today by my ranking member and \ngood friend, Senator Claire McCaskill, in introducing the Senior$afe \nAct of 2015, a bill that would put in place a common sense plan to help \nprotect American seniors from financial fraud.\n  According to the GAO, financial fraud targeting older Americans is a \ngrowing epidemic that costs seniors an estimated $2.9 billion annually.\n  Protecting seniors from financial exploitation and fraud is one of \nthe top priorities of the Aging Committee. Over the course of the past \ntwo and a half years, our Committee has held 15 hearings, six since \nJanuary, examining how fraudsters find and exploit their victims and \nwhat can be done to stop them. The frauds we have highlighted have \nranged from the infamous ``Jamaican Lottery Scam,'' that reached its \nheight in 2013, to the notorious IRS phone scam that burst onto the \nscene this spring, and, more recently, to the shady practices of the \npension advance industry. Sadly, not all scammers are strangers to \ntheir victims, in too many cases, the senior is exploited by someone he \nor she knows well.\n  Although the various scams we have examined differ in scope and \nstructure, one factor is common to all--the fraudsters need to gain the \ntrust and active cooperation of their victims. Without this, their \nschemes would fail. That is why it is so important that seniors \nrecognize as quickly as possible the red flags that signal potential \nfraud.\n  Unfortunately, many seniors do not see these red flags. Sometimes \nthey are too trusting or are suffering from diminished capacity, but, \njust as often, they miss the flags because the swindlers who prey on \nthem are extremely\n\n[[Page S7596]]\n\ncrafty and know how to sound convincing. Whatever the reason, a warning \nsign that can slip by a victim might trigger a second look by financial \nservice representatives trained to spot common scams, who know enough \nabout a senior's habits to question a transaction that doesn't look \nright. In our work on the Aging Committee, we have heard of many \ninstances where quick action by bank and credit union employees, \nbroker-dealers, and investment advisors has stopped a fraud in \nprogress, saving their customers untold thousands of dollars.\n  Let me give you an example. Earlier this year, a senior citizen in \nVassalboro, ME, was looking to wire funds from his account at Maine \nSavings Federal Credit Union to an out-of-state location, supposedly to \nbail out a relative who was in jail. Something about this transaction \ndidn't sound right to the teller supervisor at the credit union. She \nquestioned the customer, who told her he had gotten a call from an \n``official'' at the jail, who had instructed him not to speak to anyone \nabout the transaction. Fortunately for this senior citizen, this \nsupervisor was able to spot this as a scam, and her quick thinking \nsaved him from falling victim to it.\n  In another case, just two weeks ago, an alert bank employee in \nNebraska noticed suspicious withdrawals from the checking account of a \nsenior citizen who was a customer of the bank. Not knowing what to do, \nand without sharing confidential information, this bank teller called \nthe Senate Aging Committee's fraud hotline for guidance. Our staff \nadvised her to contact the local Area Agency on Aging. With the \nSenior$afe program in place, bank tellers all over the country will \nknow how to respond when situations like this arise in the future.\n  Regrettably, Federal laws with the important intention of protecting \nconsumer privacy can make it difficult for financial institutions to \nreport suspected fraud to the proper authorities.\n  Our bill would clarify these laws to encourage banks, credit unions, \ninvestment advisors, and broker-dealers to report suspected financial \nfraud targeting senior citizens to regulators, law enforcement, or \nadult protective services agencies.\n  A key feature of the bill is the liability protection it provides: \nfinancial institutions and their employees are protected from suit so \nlong as employees are trained in how to spot and report suspected \nfinancial exploitation; their reports are made in good faith and on a \nreasonable basis, and they report to the proper authorities.\n  Our bill is based on Maine's innovative Senior$afe program, a \ncollaborative effort by Maine's regulators, financial institutions, and \nlegal organizations to educate bank and credit union employees on how \nto identify and help stop financial exploitation of older Mainers. This \nprogram, pioneered by Maine Securities Administrator Judith Shaw, also \nserves as the template for model legislation developed for adoption at \nthe state level by the North American Securities Administrators \nAssociation, or ``NASAA''. The Senior$afe Act and NASAA's model State \nlegislation are complementary efforts, and I am pleased that NASAA has \nendorsed our bill.\n  Combating financial abuse of seniors requires regulators, law \nenforcement, and social service agencies at all levels of government to \nwork collaboratively with the private sector. Financial institutions \noccupy a critical nexus between fraudsters and their victims, and can \nplay an important role. Their employees, if properly trained, can be a \nfirst line of defense protecting our seniors from these fraudsters. The \nSenior$afe Act encourages financial institutions to train their \nemployees, and shields them from lawsuits when they make good faith, \nreasonable reports of potential fraud to the proper authorities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         North American Securities\n\n\n                             Administrators Association, Inc.,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 27, 2015.\n     Re The Senior$afe Act of 2015.\n\n     Senator Susan Collins,\n     Chairman, Senate Special Committee on Aging, Washington DC.\n     Senator Claire McCaskill,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Special Committee on Aging, Washington \n         DC.\n       Dear Chairman Collins and Ranking Member McCaskill: On \n     behalf of the North American Securities Administrators \n     Association (``NASAA''), I'm writing to express strong \n     support for your work to better protect vulnerable adults \n     from financial exploitation through the introduction of the \n     Senior$afe Act of 2015. Your legislation will better protect \n     seniors by increasing the likelihood that financial \n     exploitation targeting the elderly will be identified by \n     financial services professionals, and by removing barriers \n     that might otherwise frustrate the reporting of such \n     exploitation to state securities regulators and other \n     appropriate governmental authorities.\n       Senior financial exploitation is a difficult but critical \n     policy challenge. Many in our elderly population are \n     vulnerable due to social isolation and distance from family, \n     caregiver, and other support networks. Indeed, evidence \n     suggests that as many as one out of every five citizens over \n     the age of 65 has been victimized by a financial fraud. To be \n     successful in combating senior financial exploitation, state \n     and federal policymakers must come together to weave a new \n     safety net for our elderly, breaking down barriers to \n     identify those who are best positioned to identify red flags \n     early on and to encourage reporting and referrals to \n     appropriate local, county, state, and federal agencies, \n     including law enforcement.\n       As you know, state securities regulators, working within \n     the framework of NASAA, are in the late-stages of our own \n     concerted effort to bolster protections for elderly investors \n     at risk of exploitation, including through the development of \n     model legislation to be enacted by states to promote \n     reporting of suspected exploitation. While the approaches \n     contemplated by the recently announced NASAA model \n     legislation and the Senior$afe Act differ in some respects, \n     they are complementary efforts, both undertaken with the \n     shared goal of protecting seniors by increasing the detection \n     and reporting of elderly financial exploitation.\n       The SeniorSafe Act consists of several essential features. \n     First, to promote and encourage reporting of suspected \n     elderly financial exploitation by financial services \n     professionals, who are positioned to identify and report \n     ``red flags'' of potential exploitation, the bill would \n     incentivize financial services employees to report any \n     suspected exploitation by making them immune from any civil \n     or administrative liability arising from such a report, \n     provided that they exercised due care, and that they make \n     these reports in good faith. Second, in order to better \n     assure that financial services employees have the knowledge \n     and training they require to identify ``red flags'' \n     associated with financial exploitation, the bill would \n     require that, as a condition of receiving immunity, financial \n     institutions undertake to train certain personnel regarding \n     the identification and reporting of senior financial \n     exploitation as soon as practicable, or within one year. \n     Under the bill, employees who would be required to receive \n     such training as a condition of immunity include supervisory \n     personnel; employees who come into contact with a senior \n     citizen as a regular part of their duties; and employees who \n     review or approve the financial documents, records, or \n     transactions of senior citizens as a part of their regular \n     duties.\n       The benefits of the types of reporting that the Senior$afe \n     Act aims to facilitate and encourage are far-reaching. \n     Elderly Americans stand to benefit directly from such \n     reporting, because early detection and reporting can minimize \n     their financial losses from exploitation, and because \n     improved protection of their finances ultimately helps \n     preserve their financial independence and their personal \n     autonomy. Financial institutions stand to benefit, as well, \n     through preservation of their reputation, increased community \n     recognition, increased employee satisfaction, and decreased \n     uninsured losses.\n       In conclusion, state securities regulators congratulate you \n     for introducing the Senior$afe Act of 2015. We share and \n     support the goals of this legislation, and look forward to \n     working closely with you as the legislation is considered by \n     the Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Judith M.

Res. 299\n\n       Whereas Yitzhak Rabin was born on March 1, 1922, in \n     Jerusalem;\n       Whereas Yitzhak Rabin volunteered for the Palmach, the \n     elite unit of the Haganah, the\n\n[[Page S7597]]\n\n     predecessor of the Israeli Defense Forces, and served for 27 \n     years, including during the 1948 War of Independence, the \n     1956 Suez War, and as Chief of Staff in the June 1967 Six Day \n     War;\n       Whereas Yitzhak Rabin served as Ambassador to the United \n     States from 1968 through 1973, Minister of Defense from 1984 \n     through 1990, and Prime Minister from 1974 through 1977 and \n     from 1992 until his assassination in 1995;\n       Whereas, in 1975, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin signed the \n     interim agreement with Egypt that laid the groundwork for the \n     1979 Camp David Peace Treaty between Israel and Egypt;\n       Whereas on September 13, 1993, in Washington, D.C., Yitzhak \n     Rabin signed the Declaration of Principles framework \n     agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, also known as \n     the Oslo Accords;\n       Whereas, upon the signing of the Declaration of Principles, \n     Yitzhak Rabin said to the Palestinian people: ``We say to you \n     today in a loud and clear voice: Enough of blood and tears. \n     Enough! We harbor no hatred toward you. We have no desire for \n     revenge. We, like you, are people who want to build a home, \n     plant a tree, love, live side by side with you--in dignity, \n     empathy, as human beings, as free men.'';\n       Whereas Yitzhak Rabin received the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize \n     for his vision and bravery as a peacemaker;\n       Whereas, on October 26, 1994, Yitzhak Rabin and King \n     Hussein of Jordan signed a peace treaty between Israel and \n     Jordan;\n       Whereas, on November 4, 1995, Yitzhak Rabin was \n     assassinated after attending a peace rally in Tel Aviv, where \n     his last words were: ``I have always believed that the \n     majority of the people want peace, are prepared to take risks \n     for peace. . . Peace is what the Jewish People aspire to.'';\n       Whereas Yitzhak Rabin dedicated his life to the cause of \n     peace and security for the state of Israel by defending his \n     nation against all threats, including terrorism and invasion, \n     and undertaking courageous risks in the pursuit of peace;\n       Whereas, in the years following Yitzhak Rabin's \n     assassination, successive United States Administrations have \n     sought to help Israel and the Palestinians achieve a \n     negotiated two-state solution that ends their conflict;\n       Whereas today Israel and the Palestinian territories are \n     the site of renewed terrorism and violence;\n       Whereas the continuation and deepening of the Israeli-\n     Palestinian conflict in the absence of progress toward a two-\n     state solution has contributed to suffering among both \n     peoples, including being one of several factors driving the \n     current terrorism and violence in Israel and the Palestinian \n     territories; and\n       Whereas today, more than ever, the leadership of Yitzhak \n     Rabin can be a model for securing peace during a time of \n     conflict: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commemorates the life and accomplishments of Yitzhak \n     Rabin and extends its deepest sympathy and condolences to his \n     family and the people of Israel on the twentieth anniversary \n     of his death;\n       (2) recognizes and reiterates its continued support for the \n     close ties and special relationship between the people and \n     Governments of the United States and Israel;\n       (3) reaffirms its commitment to the process of building a \n     just and lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians \n     based on two states for two peoples, living side-by-side in \n     peace and security; and\n       (4) calls on Israeli and Palestinian leaders to quell the \n     current outbreak of terrorism and violence, and to resume \n     work toward a negotiated two-state solution ending the \n     conflict once and for all.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nrecognizing the 20th anniversary of the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin.\n  On November 4, 1995, after a major peace rally, then-Prime Minister \nRabin was gunned-down by an Israeli nationalist. Rabin's brutal \nassassination ended the life of a man who lived for peace.\n  Today, with renewed terrorism and violence in Israel and the \nPalestinian territories, leaders should look to the example of Mr. \nRabin, who forged peace against long odds. His assassin may have ended \nhis life, but his message must live on.\n  During Mr. Rabin's first term as Israel's Prime Minister, he laid the \nfoundation for peace with Egypt by concluding the Sinai Interim \nAgreement on September 1, 1975.\n  The eventual 1979 Camp David Peace Treaty officially ended \nhostilities between the two nations. Importantly, Egypt became the \nfirst Arab state to recognize Israel. Today, because of Mr. Rabin's \nwork, Egypt and Israel remain at peace.\n  During Mr. Rabin's second term as Prime Minister, he continued to \nseek peace with Israel's neighbors. He led the effort to sign the Oslo \nAccords, which created the Palestinian Authority, and which serves as a \nframework for the creation of a Palestinian state today.\n  For their efforts, Mr. Rabin, Yasir Arafat and Shimon Peres won the \n1994 Nobel Peace Prize.\n  That same year, Israel and Jordan also signed a peace treaty, making \nJordan the second Arab state to establish peace with Israel.\n  On this, the twentieth anniversary of the assassination of Yitzhak \nRabin, I offer my condolences to his family. May they continue to find \nsolace in the legacy of a leader who sought peace when others sought \nwar.\n  May leaders all around the world look to him for inspiration on how \nto lead courageously and chart a more peaceful future for one's people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/senate-section/article/S7597-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7597-S7598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 300--DESIGNATING NOVEMBER 7, 2015, AS NATIONAL BISON \n                                  DAY\n\n  Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. Donnelly, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Bennet, Mr. \nHatch, Mr. Udall, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Heinrich, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Whitehouse, \nMr. Lee, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Moran, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Hoeven, Mrs. \nGillibrand, Mr. Thune, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Portman, Mr. Tester, Mr. \nInhofe, and Mr. Markey) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 300\n\n       Whereas bison are considered a historical symbol of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas bison were integrally linked with the economic and \n     spiritual lives of many Indian tribes through trade and \n     sacred ceremonies;\n       Whereas there are more than 60 Indian tribes participating \n     in the Intertribal Buffalo Council;\n       Whereas numerous members of Indian tribes are involved in \n     bison restoration on tribal land;\n       Whereas members of Indian tribes have a combined herd on \n     more than 1,000,000 acres of tribal land;\n       Whereas the Intertribal Buffalo Council is a tribal \n     organization incorporated pursuant to section 17 of the Act \n     of June 18, 1934 (commonly known as the ``Indian \n     Reorganization Act'') (25 U.S.C. 477);\n       Whereas bison can play an important role in improving the \n     types of grasses found in landscapes to the benefit of \n     grassland;\n       Whereas a bison has been depicted on the official seal of \n     the Department of the Interior since 1912;\n       Whereas bison hold significant economic value for private \n     producers and rural communities;\n       Whereas, as of 2012, the Department of Agriculture \n     estimates that 162,110 head of bison were under the \n     stewardship of private producers, creating jobs, and \n     contributing to the food security of the United States by \n     providing a sustainable and healthy meat source;\n       Whereas a bison is portrayed on 2 State flags;\n       Whereas the bison has been adopted by 3 States as the \n     official mammal or animal of those States;\n       Whereas the buffalo nickel played an important role in \n     modernizing the currency of the United States;\n       Whereas several sports teams have the bison as a mascot, \n     which highlights the iconic significance of bison in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas a small group of ranchers helped save bison from \n     extinction in the late 1800s by gathering the remaining bison \n     of the diminished herds;\n       Whereas on December 8, 1905, William Hornaday, Theodore \n     Roosevelt, and others formed the American Bison Society in \n     response to the near extinction of bison in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas on October 11, 1907, the American Bison Society \n     sent 15 bison to the first big game refuge in the United \n     States, now known as the ``Wichita Mountains Wildlife \n     Refuge'';\n       Whereas in 2005, the American Bison Society was \n     reestablished, bringing together bison ranchers, managers \n     from Indian tribes, Federal and State agencies, conservation \n     organizations, and natural and social scientists from the \n     United States, Canada, and Mexico to create a vision for the \n     North American bison in the 21st century;\n       Whereas there are bison herds in National Wildlife Refuges \n     and National Parks;\n       Whereas there are bison in State-managed herds across 11 \n     States;\n       Whereas there is a growing effort to celebrate and \n     officially recognize the historical, cultural, and economic \n     significance of the North American bison to the heritage of \n     the United States; and\n       Whereas members of Indian tribes, bison producers, \n     conservationists, sportsmen, educators, and other public and \n     private partners have participated in the annual National \n     Bison Day since 2012 and are committed to continuing this \n     tradition annually on the first Saturday of November: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates November 7, 2015, the first Saturday of \n     November, as National Bison Day; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n[[Page S7598]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/senate-section/article/S7598-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2750.
