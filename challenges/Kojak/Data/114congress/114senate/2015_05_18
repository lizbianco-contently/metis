Mr. President, it seems as if every day the majority leader \nkeeps telling us how great the Senate is working--better than ever, he \nsays. Let's take a look at a couple of things today.\n  The growing backlog on nominations is another story. There are more \nthan 100 nominations pending in committees. This is an interesting way \nthe Republicans do this. They say we do not have anything on the \ncalendar. We cannot have anything on the calendar if they do not report \nthem out of the committees.\n  There are 48 nominations currently pending in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, including Ambassadors of really important countries, such as \nPakistan, Finland, Sweden, Kosovo, and many other countries. The \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee has 11 pending nominations, and \n9 nominations are waiting in the HELP Committee. At the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee, there is a score--many of \nthem there. There are eight nominations awaiting consideration in the \nbanking committee. Seven are pending in commerce, and six await Senate \nFinance Committee action.\n  In the Judiciary Committee--I spoke here a little while ago, a week \nago, about Judge Felipe Restrepo. He is a Federal district court judge \nin Pennsylvania. It is being delayed, even though both Senators--a \nDemocrat and Republican--from Pennsylvania want this nomination to go \nforward. So they say. He is one of 20 pending nominations awaiting in \nthe Judiciary Committee. That is unbelievable. Committee consideration \nis not the only obstacle to confirmation, the Republican leader also \nslows down the consideration once they get here on the floor.\n  The Republicans' refusal to consider the President's judicial \nnominations is especially pronounced, especially when you consider that \nthe assistant Republican leader came to the floor here and said we are \ngoing to move these expeditiously. He is from Texas. We had one judge, \nGeorge Hanks, who was confirmed by a vote of 91 to 0. He was only the \nsecond judicial nomination we have considered in this Republican \nCongress in some 5 months.\n  Imagine that. We know there are judicial emergencies and vacancies \nthroughout the country, but we have only considered two judges in this \nentire Congress.\n  When this year started, we had 12 emergencies. Now there are 25, more \nthan double from the beginning of this year alone. In Texas alone, \nthere are seven judicial emergencies, the most of any State in the \nNation.\n  Judge Olvera has been nominated to fill a judicial emergency in the \nSouthern District of Texas. His nomination certainly was not \ncontroversial. It was reported out of the Judiciary Committee by voice \nvote in February.\n  At his hearing, as I indicated earlier, the assistant majority leader \nsaid he wanted to move these judges expeditiously. If this is \nexpeditiously, I do not know what the term means. Why is this \nnoncontroversial nomination being delayed for months? Is this the type \nof swift type of confirmation that Texans can expect from their \nleaders?\n  If our Republican colleagues would make good on their public \nstatements and confirm these qualified executive and judicial \nnominations before the Memorial Day holiday, that would be great. But \nthey are not going to. Is the Senate working better than ever? I do not \nthink so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/18/senate-section/article/S2949-6", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2949-S2950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HIGHWAY BILL\n\n  Mr. REID. ``America is one big pothole.'' Those are not my words. \nThey are the words of former Republican Secretary of Transportation Ray \nLaHood, a longtime Member of Congress and a Republican from Illinois. \nThat is how he described America's crumbling infrastructure: ``America \nis one big pothole.''\n  It is hard to argue with Secretary LaHood's assessment. According to \nthe Federal Highway Administration, 50 percent of American roads are in \ndisrepair. Half of the roads we drive on\n\n[[Page S2950]]\n\nare in disrepair. What are State legislatures around the country doing? \nRaising the speed limit.\n  There are a number of places in America where the speed limit is 80 \nmiles an hour. That means that this weekend--Memorial Day weekend--as \nAmerican families load up their cars and head to the beach or the lake \nor to visit loved ones, half of the highways they travel on are in dire \nneed of repair.\n  If that were not troubling enough, 64,000 American bridges are \nstructurally deficient. As each day goes by, these roads and bridges \nget a little worse--one big pothole.\n  It is not just our roads and our bridges. Our Nation's infrastructure \naffects every means of travel. We are all distraught by last week's \nAmtrak train derailment in Pennsylvania. Eight people were killed. \nHundreds were injured. It has been reported that the horrible \nderailment might have been prevented if speed control safeguards had \nbeen installed on this particular section of track.\n  What we have here in this Congress--my Republican friend, the senior \nSenator from Kentucky, is talking about the Senate running better than \never. I think not.\n  The story of our Nation's infrastructure woes is very clear. We have \nthe technology. This great country has the resources. But my friends \nwill not appropriate any money to do this. Stunningly, time and again, \nwe have failed to fix the problems--one big pothole. Fifty percent of \nour roads are deficient, and 64,000 bridges are structurally deficient. \nSpecifically, Republicans in Congress have refused to work with \nDemocrats in making an adequate long-term investment in our country's \nservice transportation.\n  What we have here time after time are short-term extensions of the \nhighway bill. Before the Republicans hit town here, we used to do long-\nterm highway bills--they have stood in the way of doing that--so that \nthe Department of Transportation and leaders in all 50 States could \nplan ahead. That is why we did these long-term bills. The way it is \nnow, a 2-month extension or a 6-month extension does not work. It is \nterribly inefficient and very, very expensive.\n  The highway trust fund runs out in about 8 or 10 weeks. The \nauthorization for the Federal highway program expires later this month. \nLater this month, if we have not extended the highway bill, there could \nbe no money spent on highways.\n  The fact that these programs are expiring is no secret. Our \nRepublican colleagues have known about this deadline for months and \nmonths. Yet here we are at the end of May, and Republicans are no \ncloser to crafting a long-term investment in our roads, bridges, and \nrailways. They have not had a markup in the four committees of \njurisdiction. In fact, Republicans are trying to do the opposite. They \nare going to the extreme of gutting our already inadequate \ntransportation.\n  Look at what happened with Amtrak. The House Republicans chose to cut \nAmtrak in the hours just after the derailment by a quarter of a billion \ndollars. Who could help but be astonished by this act of carelessness?\n  Former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, who knows quite a bit about \nPennsylvania, speaking of the Republicans in Congress said: ``Normally, \nafter a tragedy, a pipeline bursts, a bridge collapses, everyone for a \ncouple of weeks says `we've really got to do something.' Here, less \nthan 12 hours after seven people died''--of course, now it is eight--\n``these Republicans in Congress didn't even have the decency to table \nthe vote.''\n  They went right ahead and did it, cutting a quarter of a billion \ndollars from Amtrak.\n  In addition to what it does and does not do to highways, our bridges, \nour dams, is the fact that it stops job creation. Every billion dollars \nwe spend on highway construction, infrastructure development, we create \n47,500 high-paying jobs. Instead of slashing Federal funding or putting \ncritical transportation infrastructure on the back burner, we should be \ncrafting a long-term plan to boost our Nation's investment and \ninfrastructure.\n  With precious little time before the Federal highway program expires, \nthere is no hope for anything but a short-term authorization longer \nthan a few months. We understand that. We are not happy about it, but \nthat is the reality of the situation that the Republicans have forced \nus to be in.\n  The U.S. highway system is crucial to our Nation's economic well-\nbeing. It is how we move goods and services. It is central to American \nfamilies who use our roads and bridges every day.\n  The American Society of Civil Engineers predicts that our economy \nwill lose $1 trillion without adequate infrastructure investment. That \nis almost 3.5 million jobs, and some say more than that.\n  Congress must invest in working families and businesses by addressing \nour Nation's transportation needs. I invite congressional Republicans \nto work with us in building bipartisan consensus to ensure a strong and \nrobust investment in our Nation's infrastructure. What is being done as \nwe speak is that they are trying to patch together a 2-month extension. \nA 2-month extension or a 6-month extension, I think, is the wrong way \nto go. It is not good for our country.\n  Would the Chair announce the business before the Senate today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/18/senate-section/article/S2950-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to take just a few minutes today to \ntalk about the ongoing effort to maintain funding for the highway trust \nfund.\n  As we all know, while the highway trust fund currently has a large \nenough balance in terms of funding to last another 2 months, \ncontracting authority expires at the end of May. Therefore, unless this \nCongress acts before we break for the Memorial Day recess, we will \nstart seeing work stoppages on transportation projects around the \ncountry.\n  No one wants to see that. There is bipartisan agreement on that basic \npoint. There is similar agreement on the desire for a long-term highway \nbill. Members of both parties are tired of kicking the can down the \nroad and want to see a real, long-term fix. The problem is that the \nbipartisan agreement tends to end there.\n\n  The gold standard for a future, long-term highway bill has been set \nat 6 years. That is what everyone apparently wants to see happen, \nthough few have offered workable solutions on how to pay for it.\n  According to CBO, a 6-year highway bill would cost a little more than \n$90 billion. That is not chump change, even by Congress's standards. It \ntakes real work and significant policy changes to raise that kind of \nmoney. One party cannot do it alone. It takes cooperation and \ncompromise, something that, unfortunately, has been lacking around here \nfor some time.\n  As the chairman of the committee with jurisdiction over the funding \nfor highways, I am committed to finding a solution that gets us as far \ninto the future as possible before we have to revisit the issue again. \nToward that end, I have been working with Chairman Ryan of the House \nWays and Means Committee and others on a path forward.\n  Our initial plan was to pull together enough funding to get us \nthrough the end of 2015. That would have cost roughly $11 billion--with \na ``b''--not an insignificant number, by any means, but very doable \nunder the circumstances.\n  We had roughly $5 billion in agreed-upon tax compliance offsets from \nthe previous highway episode late last year. Chairman Ryan and I \nthought it seemed reasonable to couple that with an equal amount in \nspending reductions and reforms, getting us very close to what we would \nneed to get the country through the rest of the year on highways.\n  For a time, it appeared as though at least some of our colleagues on \nthe other side were willing to work with us on this general framework. \nUnfortunately, that cooperation did not last. In fact, it never really \nbegan.\n\n[[Page S2951]]\n\n  Last week, rather than even consider a path forward that includes \nspending reductions, our Democratic counterparts, at the urging of \ntheir leadership here in the Senate, effectively walked away from the \nnegotiating table. As a result, it appears that the only immediate path \nforward is to extend contracting authority until the end of July, when \nthe funding runs out, setting us up for another deadline and potential \ncliff in just a few short weeks.\n  Let me be clear, I do not fault Republican leaders in either Chamber \nfor taking this route. It was, given the short timetable, the only \noption left after Democrats failed to engage in meeting us halfway with \na balanced package of compliance revenue and spending reductions.\n  But make no mistake, we are going to be here again in 2 months, \nfacing the same problem, because unless someone has $90 billion just \nlying around, a long-term highway solution is not going to simply \nmaterialize between now and July. Don't get me wrong, fixing it in \nDecember was going to be difficult as well, but in the end it will \nlikely take at least that long to find a solution that has a chance of \npassing through both Chambers.\n  The other side's strategy appears pretty transparent. They clearly \nhave two goals in mind. First, they think that if they make Republicans \nvote on highway funding over and over again, we can be cajoled into \naccepting their preferred solution, which is a large tax hike. Second, \nthey think that by maintaining a constant state of chaos and \nuncertainty, they can make the Republican-led Congress look bad or look \nineffectual.\n  That first goal is pretty predictable. After all, a tax hike is their \nanswer to pretty much every question that arises here. I hope I am \nwrong on the apparent second goal. If I am right, it is just sad. \nApparently, after spending years in the majority trying to make sure \nthe Senate never did anything productive, their goals have not changed \nnow that they are in the minority.\n  But things are different now. These days, we are getting things done \nin the Senate, much to the consternation of some of my friends on the \nother side of the aisle. Despite this most recent shift on highway \nfunding, I am confident we can work together to find a workable path \nforward. It just may take a few more votes to get us there.\n  Today, though I am frustrated, I am undeterred. I am committed to \nfinding a long-term solution to our highway problems. I plan to keep \nworking with my colleagues on finding a way to get us there, \nparticularly Chairman Inhofe, whose committee deals with much of the \nhighway policy, as well as those who serve on the Finance and Ways and \nMeans Committees.\n  The highway bill should be a bipartisan effort. It used to be. \nHopefully, after we get this latest episode behind us, it will be \nagain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/18/senate-section/article/S2951-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   PROTECTING STATES' RIGHTS TO PROMOTE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY ACT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Finally, Mr. President, I would also like to briefly talk \nabout legislation I introduced earlier this year, the Protecting \nStates' Rights to Promote American Energy Security Act, which \nreinforces States' already effective regulatory practices relating to \nhydraulic fracturing.\n  This important piece of legislation recognizes States' demonstrated \nability to properly address hydraulic fracturing and allows them to \ncontinue regulating on this issue. Importantly, this legislation does \nnot prevent the Bureau of Land Management from promulgating baseline \nstandards where none exist.\n  As background, for over 60 years, States have safely and successfully \nregulated hydraulic fracturing in a way that protects the environment. \nWhen I was in the oil business back in the early 1970s, hydraulic \nfracturing was being used then, although it has been brought clearly \ninto a much more safe and responsible way since. Even the Obama \nadministration has admitted there has never been an example of harm to \nhuman health or groundwater contamination caused by hydraulic \nfracturing under existing State regulations and oversight.\n  States should be able to continue to regulate hydraulic fracturing, \nand swift passage of this bill will afford needed certainty and future \nsecurity for emerging U.S. energy development companies.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst).

Thank you, Madam President.\n  Finally, at long last, the Senate has begun its debate on the \nBipartisan Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015, a \nbipartisan and bicameral bill to renew trade promotion authority or \nTPA. As one of the authors of this legislation, I am glad we have \ngotten to this point and look forward to a spirited and fulsome debate \non the floor.\n  This legislation has been in the works for a long time. As we all \nknow, the previous iteration of TPA expired in 2007. The original \nversion was originally enacted in 2002. In other words, it has been 13 \nyears since Congress seriously considered legislation to renew trade \npromotion authority. I think it is safe to say that at least for those \nwho focus on trade policy, the debate and discussion surrounding what \nwould go into the next TPA bill has been going on that entire time.\n  For me, while I have long been a supporter of free trade and TPA, the \nreal work on this bill began in earnest in the spring of 2013. I worked \nfor the better part of a year with former Chairman Max Baucus and Dave \nCamp on legislation to renew TPA for a 21st century economy. We \nintroduced our bill--which, in many ways, formed the basis for the \nlegislation we are debating now--in January of last year.\n  This year, when I became chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I \nsought to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make \nimprovements to the bill in order to broaden its support. Most notably, \nI worked closely with my colleagues on the Finance Committee and with \nchairman Paul Ryan of the House Ways and Means Committee to craft an \nimproved TPA bill. Senator Wyden and I work well together, and we were \nable to bring this bill to fruition. I think we were successful.\n  Indeed, we were able to build upon the efforts of last Congress to \nmake important changes that will enhance Congress's role in crafting \nour trade policy and improve overall transparency and accountability. \nWe introduced our bill on April 16, and on April 22, the Finance \nCommittee reported\n\n[[Page S2952]]\n\nthe bill along with a few other important trade bills you may have \nheard about.\n  The vote on our TPA bill was 20 to 6. The last time the Senate \nFinance Committee reported a TPA bill on the Senate floor was 1988. \nWhile we passed other TPA bills in the nearly three decades since that \ntime, this is the first to go through regular order, including a full \ncommittee process and original consideration on the floor.\n  I want to thank my colleagues, in both the House and the Senate, who \nhave worked with me to get us to this point, especially Senator Wyden \nand others on the Democratic side as well and certainly everybody on \nthe Republican side. The fact that we are now on the floor debating \nthis bill is, in and of itself, a milestone. In fact, I would call it \nhistoric, but let's not fool ourselves. We still have a long way to go.\n  Let's talk about the bill for just a moment. I would like to begin by \naddressing the most basic question: What is TPA or trade promotion \nauthority? Put simply, TPA is the most important tool Congress has to \nadvance our Nation's trade agenda. Specifically, TPA represents a \ncompact between the Senate, the House, and the administration. Under \nthis arrangement, the administration agrees to pursue objectives \nspecified by Congress and agrees to consult with Congress as it \nnegotiates trade agreements. In return, both the House and Senate agree \nto allow for time-specific consideration of trade agreements without \namendments. This ensures that Congress leads the way in setting our \nNation's trade agenda while giving our trade negotiators in the \nadministration the tools necessary to reach high-standard trade \nagreements.\n  Why is this compact so important? There are a number of reasons, but \nfor now I will just focus on two. First, the TPA compact ensures that \nCongress has a voice in setting trade priorities before a trade \nagreement is finalized. By setting clear negotiating objectives in a \nTPA bill, Congress is able to specify what a potential trade agreement \nmust contain in order to gain passage.\n  Second, the compact allows our trade negotiators to deliver on an \nagreement. As our negotiators work with our trading partners on trade \nagreements, they need to be able to give assurance that the deal they \nsign will be the one Congress votes on. They cannot do that without \nTPA. In a sense, without TPA, our trading partners are negotiating not \nonly with the professionals at USTR but also with all 535 Members of \nCongress, whose views and priorities may be unknown or unknowable. \nUnder this scenario, our partners will not put their best efforts on \nthe table because many will have no guarantees that the agreement they \nreach will remain intact once it goes through Congress. In short, TPA \nis essential for both the conclusion and passage of strong trade \nagreements.\n  I would like to take a few minutes to talk about some of the \nspecifics of our bill. First of all, our TPA bill updates the \ncongressional negotiating objectives to focus trade agreements on \nsetting fair rules and tearing down barriers to trade. In fact, the TPA \nbill we are now debating now contains the clearest articulation of \ncongressional trade priorities in our Nation's history, including \nnearly 150 ambitious, high-standard negotiating objectives, most of \nthem designed to break down barriers that American exporters face in \nthe 21st century economy.\n  Under the bill, future trade agreements must include strong \ninternational rules to counter unfair trade practices, including those \nrelated to currency, digital piracy, cross-border data flows, cyber \ntheft of trade secrets, localization barriers, nonscientific sanitary \nand phytosanitary practices, state-owned enterprises, and labor and \nenvironmental policies.\n  Our bill also requires that U.S. trade agreements reflect a standard \nof intellectual property rights protection similar to that found in \nU.S. law. We also call for an end to the theft of U.S. intellectual \nproperty by foreign governments, including piracy and the theft of \ntrade secrets and for the elimination of measures that require U.S. \ncompanies to locate their intellectual property abroad in return for \nmarket access.\n  Finally, the TPA bill expands congressional engagement in ongoing and \nfuture negotiations by ensuring that Members can review proposals and \ndiscuss them with our trade negotiators. The bill also creates new \ncongressional oversight mechanisms to ensure that the administration--\nwhichever administration it is--closely adheres to the objectives set \nby Congress, including a new procedure that Congress can employ if our \ntrade negotiators fail to consult or make progress toward meeting the \nnegotiating objectives. As you can see, this bill addresses the needs \nof our modern economy, and it fully takes into account the concerns \nexpressed by Members of Congress and the American public about the \ntrade negotiating process.\n  The legislation before us also contains the Finance Committee's bill \nto reauthorize trade adjustment assistance or TAA. I think I have made \nit pretty clear that I am not TAA's biggest fan. I oppose the program \nin general and voted against the TAA bill in committee, but from the \noutset of this process, it was clear to us on the Republican side that \nwe would have to swallow hard and allow TAA to pass in order to get TPA \nacross the finish line. Toward that end, we joined the two bills \ntogether on the floor.\n  In short, this is a good bill and one that Members of both parties \nshould be able to support.\n  As I mentioned, the vote in the Finance Committee in favor of TPA was \n20 to 6. I hope we will get a similar bipartisan result on the floor. I \nthink we can.\n  To conclude, I just want to make it clear that I am not naive. I am \nwell aware not everyone agrees with me on these issues. There are \nsome--including a few of our colleagues in the Senate--who oppose what \nwe are trying to do with this legislation. They oppose TPA and \nvirtually all free-trade agreements. In essence, though they usually \ndeny it, they oppose trade in general.\n  Of course, I respect the views of my colleagues on these matters as \nwell as any others on which we happen to disagree, but let's be clear \nabout a few things. When you oppose TPA and trade agreements, you stand \nagainst the creation of new, higher paying jobs for American workers. \nYou stand against American farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, \nentrepreneurs, and the workers they employ who need access to foreign \nmarkets, and you stand against the advancement of American values and \ninterests on the world stage.\n  I will have more to say on the floor about these issues in the coming \ndays about how TPA and trade agreements can help small businesses \nagriculture and how important our trade policies are to our national \nsecurity. I plan to do all I can to make the case that U.S. trade with \nforeign countries is a good thing and that this legislation represents \nour best opportunity to advance a trade agenda that works for America.\n  For now, I will just say once again that while I am pleased--very \npleased, in fact--that we made it this far on TPA, I will not be \nsatisfied until we have a bill on the President's desk--a President who \nis behind this bill, strongly supportive of it, and has encouraged us \nevery step of the way.\n  As I have stated, we need to have a fair and open debate on these \nissues. I am committed to hearing arguments, considering amendments, \nand demonstrating how a functioning Senate is supposed to operate. I \nhope my colleagues will join me in that type of discussion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, first, let me thank Chairman Hatch for \nour partnership over these many months, and let me be clear at the \noutset that I agree with much of what Chairman Hatch has said. What I \nwould like to start with is what I think is the bedrock principle of \nthis debate about trade and put it all straightforward and upfront; \nthat is, this is about trade done right. This is not the trade policy \nof the 1990s. This is not the NAFTA playbook. It is not even the 2002 \nTPA package. I realize the Presiding Officer was not in the Senate at \nthat time. After my opening remarks, I am going to start outlining the \n30 progressive changes in the 2015 TPA package that were not in the \n2002 program to show how different this trade policy will be.\n  The point of what I have started with--this focus on trade done \nright--is to drive home the potential for more good-paying jobs for our \nworkers. This\n\n[[Page S2953]]\n\nwould be true in Oregon, Utah, Iowa, and across the land. In my State, \none out of five jobs revolves around exports. The export jobs often pay \nbetter than do the nontrade jobs.\n  The reason I bring this up is I do not think there is any more \npressing economic issue in our country than finding ways to increase \nwages for Americans and particularly the middle class and those who \naspire to be middle class. The facts demonstrate clearly that the \nexport jobs often pay better than do the nonexport jobs. The reason \nthat is the case is because there is often a very large value-added \ncomponent. There is increased productivity. The fact is, when we grow \nthings in Iowa or Oregon or any other part of the country and make \nthings in America and we add value to them, then we can ship them \nsomewhere.\n  What the Department of Commerce has found in a number of their \nanalyses is that those export-related jobs often pay better than do the \nnonexport jobs.\n  The reason I am starting with this is that this is particularly \nrelevant given the potential market that is out there for the people of \nOregon, Iowa, and every other part of our country. The analysis shows \nthat by 2025, there are going to be about 1 billion middle-class \nconsumers in the developing world--1 billion people with a significant \namount of disposable income. I think they want to buy the Oregon brand, \nthey want to buy the American brand. They are going to be interested in \nbuying our computers. They are going to want to buy our wine and \nagricultural products. They are going to buy our helicopters. They are \ngoing to buy our planes. They are going to buy a whole host of \nproducts. The question is, Are Americans going to reap the fruit of \nthose export opportunities? That, fundamentally, is what this is all \nabout with respect to exports and particularly employment \nopportunities.\n  The reality is that our markets are basically open, but a lot of the \ncountries that are part of the region we are looking at for the first \nagreement--what is called the Trans-Pacific Partnership--have markets \nthat are much more closed. They have double- and triple-digit tariffs. \nI suspect the Presiding Officer is very concerned about the double- and \ntriple-digit tariffs on agricultural commodities. Certainly, the people \nof Oregon are very concerned about the consequences of those huge \ntariffs on our agricultural goods.\n  So, as we start this discussion, right at the center is this focus on \nwhat I call trade done right and my view that trade done right can \ncreate an enormous array of economic opportunities for hard-working \nmiddle-class Americans who deserve to have us come up with policies \nthat shape a better future for them rather than the alternative.\n  Make no mistake about the alternative. If we walk off the field, \nChina comes onto the field and China says: Fine; we are happy to write \nthe rules.\n  To me--I am going to outline this--what Chairman Hatch and I and \nothers have produced is a policy that will force standards up as \nopposed to much of what critics say about past trade policies, that \nthey drive--it is a race to the bottom, that it drives standards down. \nThis is a piece of legislation which is going to drive up standards.\n  With that, I am going to start outlining the differences between the \n2015 TPA package and the 2002 TPA package. I am going to start with the \nrequirement for labor, the environment, and affordable medicines.\n  In 2002, there was no requirement for trading partners' laws to \ncomply with core international labor standards. Let me repeat that. In \n2002--more than a dozen years ago--there was no requirement for trading \npartners' laws to comply with core international labor standards. Under \nthe package Chairman Hatch and our colleagues and I on the Finance \nCommittee have produced, trading partners must adopt and maintain core \ninternational labor standards, and there are trade sanctions if they do \nnot comply. It could not be more different--the rules from 2002 TPA and \nthe rules for 2015 under what Chairman Hatch and I and others on the \nFinance Committee insisted on.\n  Let's talk about the environment. I mentioned labor first. Let's talk \nabout the environment. In 2002, there was no requirement for trading \npartners' laws to comply with common multilateral environmental \nagreements. In 2015, under the bipartisan Finance package, trading \npartners must adopt and maintain common multilateral environmental \nagreements, and there are trade sanctions if they do not comply. Again, \n2002 and 2015--the differences could not be more stark with respect to \nenvironmental protection.\n  With respect to affordable medicines, in 2002, there were no \nprovisions balancing intellectual property protections to ensure access \nto medicines for developing countries. In 2015, there are directives \nfor trade agreements to promote access to medicine and foster \ninnovation.\n  I do want to yield to the distinguished majority leader, but I wanted \nto begin this debate--particularly when Chairman Hatch is on the \nfloor--by highlighting the differences between 2002 and 2015, \nparticularly in areas so important to the American people, such as \nlabor, environmental protection, and access to medicines.\n  I know we all want to hear from the distinguished majority leader.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I thank my good friend from Oregon, \nand I congratulate both the Senator from Oregon and the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, Senator Hatch, for moving this important legislation \nforward.\n  Thursday's vote to open this debate on trade was very important for \nour country. It brought middle-class families one step closer to the \nincreased American exports and American trade jobs our economy needs. \nIt took a lot of work to get us this far. It is going to take a lot \nmore of that kind of work to bring these American jobs over the finish \nline. Cooperation from both sides of the aisle will be critical to \ndoing so. For instance, we were ready to be in session on Friday to get \nmore of our work done on trade and allow Senators from both parties the \nchance to offer amendments. All the unnecessary delaying and \nfilibustering we have seen has left us with less time for debate and \namendments on this bill--less time for debate and amendments on this \nbill. It cost the Senate over a week in lost time.\n  We have been hearing some interesting suggestions from our friends \nabout their level of cooperation over on the minority side. I would \ncertainly agree that putting these words into action would be very good \nnews for our country. This week, our colleagues will have the perfect \nopportunity to prove they are serious. They will have a chance to turn \nthe page completely from the far left's strategy of wasting time on \ntrade for its own sake, on an issue we all know is President Obama's \ntop domestic legislative priority.\n  I want to be very clear. The Senate will finish its work on trade \nthis week. We will remain in session as long as it takes to do so. I \nknow we became used to hearing these types of statements in the past, \nbut Senators should know that I am quite serious. I would advise \nagainst making any sort of travel arrangements until the path forward \nbecomes clear. It is also my intention this week to address the \nhighways issue and to responsibly extend the expiring provisions of \nFISA. The quickest way to get there would be to cooperate across the \naisle so we can pass the trade bill in a thoughtful but efficient \nmanner. I know Members on both sides are going to want a chance to \noffer amendments to the bill. They should offer amendments. I am for \nthat. I encourage them to do so, both Republicans and Democrats. Now is \nthe time for Senators from both parties to offer those amendments and \nwork with the bill managers to set up the vote.\n  This is where our Democratic friends' rhetoric about working \ncooperatively in the minority will be put to the test. The more our \ncolleagues across the aisle try to throw sand in the gears this week, \nthe less opportunity Members--including Members of their own party--\nwill have for amendments. So I hope they will not do that.\n  We have a lot to get accomplished. We have 1 less week to do so. That \nis why I would encourage Members of both parties to bring their \namendments to the bill managers and work to get them pending. Let's \nprocess amendments from both sides--both sides--and then let's pass \nthis bill so we can boost American jobs and exports by knocking down \nunfair barriers to the things we make and grow right here in America.\n\n[[Page S2954]]\n\n  Let me be clear again. This week, we will finish the trade promotion \nauthority bill. We will act on a highway extension and we will act on \nFISA before we leave for the Memorial Day recess.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Whole yields time?\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I appreciate the majority leader's \ncomments. I know Senator Sessions will be speaking in a moment.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Sessions \nsucceed me after I speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I would remind the majority leader that \nthe last time he used the term, ``We shouldn't waste our time on \ntrade,'' meaning not that we shouldn't pass this trade agreement--of \ncourse he supports that--but that we should not spend so much time on \ntrade--the last time, 13 years ago, when Congress debated a trade \nissue, it led to much smaller trade agreements; most immediately, the \nCentral America Free Trade Agreement. That was the one President Bush \nmost wanted to negotiate at that time, if I recall. That debate lasted \nfor 3 weeks. I am not suggesting this debate last 3 weeks, but I am \nsuggesting that to say we are wasting our time on trade, on a long \ndebate, on a thorough debate with a number of amendments, is a bit of a \nreach.\n  I would add that this trade agreement, this fast-track, speaks to, \nultimately, at least 60 percent of the world's GDP; first, the Trans-\nPacific Partnership, which is pretty much already negotiated, even \nthough the USTR will not let much of this trade agreement actually see \nthe light of day prior to voting on fast-track; and, second, once \nTTIP--the United States-European Union agreement--is brought to the \nSenate and House for approval, that will mean 60 percent of the world's \nGDP will be included.\n  So to say we can only debate this for 3 days and squeeze the number \nof amendments, when I know that at least a dozen Senators, at least a \ndozen more, probably like a dozen and a half on the Democratic side \nalone--I know a number of Republicans have amendments too--want to \noffer amendments, want them debated on, and want them voted on.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1242\n\n  So the first amendment that I believe we will vote on tonight is my \namendment on trade adjustment assistance. Everyone acknowledges--from \nthose who oppose TPA and oppose TPP to its most vehement cheerleaders, \nthe Wall Street Journal editorial board, a number of conservative think \ntanks, and a number of free-trade advocates--that trade agreements \nresult in winners and losers because they bring dislocation in the \neconomy. We can debate whether the winners outweigh the losers--I don't \nthink they do. I think the losers outweigh the winners in what happens \nin trade.\n  I know that the wealthiest 5 percent in this country, by and large, \ngain from these trade agreements, but the broad middle and below \ntypically lose from these trade agreements. I know what they have done \nto my State. I know what they have done to the Presiding Officer's \nState, and I know what they have done especially to manufacturing.\n  What is not debatable is some industries are going to get hurt, some \ncommunities will be hollowed out, some worker jobs will be lost. We \nknow that. We owe it to workers who are going to have their lives \nupended, through no fault of their own, to do everything we can to ease \nthe transition.\n  Think about that. We make a decision--President Obama asks us to pass \nthis, the Republican leadership asks us to pass this, and the Senate \nRepublican leadership in the House, joining President Obama--to pass \nthis. So the decisions we make here--the President of the United States \nand Members of Congress--will cost people their jobs. We know that \nwhether you are for TPA or not.\n  We know some people will lose their jobs because of these trade \nagreements. We owe it to them, to those workers who have lost jobs, to \nthose communities that experience devastation, small towns that have \nseen plants close. That creates devastation in those towns. We owe it \nto provide training and assistance to help those communities, to help \nthose workers get back on their feet.\n  That is why I am calling on all my colleagues--regardless of how you \nfeel about the Trans-Pacific Partnership, regardless of how you are \ngoing to vote on fast-track--to support this amendment, which restores \ntrade adjustment assistance funding levels to $575 million a year. This \nis the same level that was included in the bipartisan TAA bill in 2011. \nOne-quarter of current Senate Republicans--sitting Senate Republicans, \none-quarter of them--voted for that higher number.\n  This amendment is fully paid for. I know some of you think that $450 \nmillion, the amount included in the underlying bill, is sufficient, but \nit is not. The truth is that $450 million likely will not be enough. In \n2009 and 2010, TAA cost $685 million each year.\n  If you take the average of funding levels for the 3 years when \nprogram eligibility was nearly the same as the one we are considering \ntoday, TAA expenditures averaged $571 million a year. Put on top of \nthat what has happened with the South Korea trade agreement--\npredictions of job growth, almost identical numbers, except it was job \nloss--that means more people eligible for TAA. Put on top of that the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership.\n  We know there will be winners and losers. The losers need help. Add \nthat to the dollar figures we need for Trade adjustment assistance. TAA \nhelps workers retrain for new jobs so they can compete. We have clear \nevidence that TAA works. It helps workers develop the skills they need \nto find work and stay employed.\n  If we are going to compete, we need to invest in these workers to \nmake sure they are ready to meet that global competition.\n  Right now, this body considers fast-track authority for trade \nagreements that encompass 60 percent of the world's economy. Now is \nexactly the wrong time to underinvest in training workers. If we don't \nsupport my amendment, that is what we are doing. Make no mistake, if \nyou go home after voting no on this dollar figure, of putting it back \nto where this Congress voted on it only 4 years ago, you are leaving \nworkers behind. You are underinvesting in workers. You are showing that \nthese workers who lose their jobs because of South Korea, these workers \nwho lose their jobs because of NAFTA, CAFTA or what has happened with \nPNTR or the South Korea trade agreement, you are saying to those \nworkers: Sorry. We don't have enough money to take care of you--even \nthough it was our actions in the House, the Senate, and this President \nwho caused those workers to lose their jobs.\n  This is the same level that, in 2011, 70 Senators supported, \nincluding 14 current Republican Senators who sit in this body today. In \n2011, 307 Members of the House of Representatives also supported the \ndollar figure that this amendment calls for. I ask my colleagues, \nincluding the nearly one-quarter--the fully one-quarter of Senate \nRepublicans who supported it at this level--to support it again today. \nIf we are going to pursue aggressive trade promotion, an aggressive \ntrade promotion agenda, we owe it to our workers, we owe it to our \nbusinesses, we owe it to our communities to make sure they are ready \nfor the competition that is about to come their way.\n  We have a moral obligation to help the families whose livelihoods \nwill be yanked out from under them, not from something they did wrong, \nnot from a decision they made but from a decision we in this body made \nto change the rules.\n  We know that will happen. We saw it with NAFTA. We saw it with CAFTA. \nWe are seeing it with Korea. We know we will see it again with TPP.\n  There is no question that potential new trade agreements we are \nconsidering will create economic loss. There is no question that \nAmericans will lose jobs. There is no question. Nobody disputes that.\n  Are we not to take care of those workers who lose their jobs? Again, \nit wasn't their decision. It was our decision, in this body, to vote \nfor these trade agreements and then not to fund those workers' \ncomebacks, not to help those workers get back on their feet, not to \nretrain those workers who lost their jobs because of what we did in \nthis body. Talk about a moral issue.\n  It is our duty to look out for those workers who end up on the losing \nend\n\n[[Page S2955]]\n\nof our defined trade policy. That is why I ask my colleagues to join me \nin supporting trade adjustment assistance today at levels that this \nCongress overwhelmingly agreed to in a bipartisan manner 4 years ago.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Ohio for \nallowing me to speak, for suggesting I speak next, which was my \nunderstanding I would be able to do.\n  We have good people on both sides of this issue, but Senator Brown is \nan advocate, and I think he has made some good points with regard to \nthe questions facing America.\n  Our colleagues earlier said this is a trade deal done right. Well, in \na way that seems to say: don't pay attention to previous trade deals \nthat haven't done so well.\n  We have a number of people who live in the business world, who trade \ninternationally regularly, and they say this is not a good trade deal, \nand it will not work. We also hear it said frequently that we want \nincreased wages for Americans by everybody on both sides of this issue.\n  But the proponents of the legislation--if you watch carefully what \nthey have been saying--they are only saying it will only increase wages \nin export industries, not across the economy. And we know that in this \nNation our exports amount to only 13 percent of GDP, which is the \nlowest in the developed world. We don't have a lot of exports. Perhaps, \nif we export more, maybe wages will go up a little bit, but if we \nimport more in other industries in the 87 percent, we might see a \ndecline in wages and jobs.\n  So what are the facts? More exports are good, but if increased \nimports dwarf increased exports, it is not so good as a result of this \nagreement, especially when we have had virtually a six-year-record \ntrade deficit in March and one of the worst quarters in years--the \nfirst quarter of this year--in importing more than we export.\n  So the Korea agreement didn't live up to the promises we had for it. \nI supported it. I voted for it. But will this one be any better? Don't \nwe need to know?\n  So I asked five questions of the President more than 10 days ago.\n  First, regarding jobs and wages. On net, will TPP increase the total \nnumber of manufacturing jobs in the United States, generally, or reduce \nthem and auto manufacturing jobs, specifically.\n  Will hourly wages for U.S. workers go up or down? Don't you have that \ninformation? Shouldn't that be shared with us before we vote?\n  Regarding trade deficits, I ask: Will TPP reduce or increase our \ncumulative trade deficit with TPP countries overall?\n  And with the big, new members, it will be significantly impacted--\nJapan and Vietnam, specifically.\n  Regarding China, could TPP member countries add new countries--\nincluding China--to the agreement without future congressional \napproval?\n  Some have tried to say it can't be done. You have to go down in the \nsecret room here, read it, and you are very limited in what you can \nfind out. But as I have read the agreement, I don't think there is any \ndoubt that under WTO rules which will be adopted, new members can be \nadded without a vote of Congress.\n  Regarding the phrase, the ``living agreement'' that is in this deal, \nthe fact that the agreement itself said this is unprecedented. It is \nthe first time we have ever had language like ``living agreement'' in a \ntrade deal.\n  What does that mean? Can the agreement be changed after adoption \nwithout congressional action? It appears so.\n  So I have asked, Mr. President, make this living agreement language--\nit is not much--public, and let's discuss and analyze just what it \nmeans. Does it mean the President can meet with other countries, even \nvote against a change in trade policy or an agreement with them, lose \nthe vote and have law of Congress overridden or us be in violation of \nthe agreement, subject to sanctions by the Commission or international \nbody.\n  And will the President state, explicitly, and accept language that \nwould mean that rules regarding immigration would not be changed? I \nhope we can do that.\n  I will just say I see my colleague and admired chairman of the \nFinance Committee on the floor. He has been willing to meet with my \nstaff, talk respectfully about these issues, and consider how to \nwrestle through them. I hope we can make some progress, but I am \nconcerned we might not make sufficient progress.\n  We need to think about these things. It can no longer be denied that \nwages for American workers have been flat or even falling for decades. \nOne analysis says that real hourly wages today are lower than they were \nin 1973. At the same time, the share of Americans actually working--the \npercentage of Americans in their working years who are actually \nworking--has steadily declined to its lowest level in four decades.\n  The middle class is shrinking. I wish it were not so.\n  CNN recently summarized the results of a Pew study which found:\n\n       Most states saw median incomes fall between 2000 and 2013, \n     an ominous sign for the well-being of the middle class. . . .\n\n  That is really a catastrophe. So in 13 years we have seen a steady \ndecline in wages for the middle class.\n  A separate Pew Research Center study shows that the share of adults \nin middle-income households has fallen from 61 percent in 1970 to 51 \npercent in 2013. The erosion over the past four decades has been sure \nand steady. That is the Pew research.\n  They continue:\n\n       If past trends continue to hold, there is little reason to \n     believe the recovery from the Great Recession will eventually \n     lead to a rebound in the share of adults in middle-income \n     households.\n\n  In other words, they are going to be below a middle-income level. And \nthat is not good. Don't we, colleagues, have a responsibility to \nhonestly say: What is causing this?\n  We have had Democratic Presidents and Republican Presidents during \nthis time. Trends are occurring out there. Some of them may be \ndifficult to overcome. But don't we need to talk about it more \ncomprehensively?\n  Pew further finds that while middle-income families--who are the \nmajority of Americans by far--earned 62 percent of the Nation's \nhousehold income in 1970, today they earn only 44 percent of the \nNation's household income. So the sad fact is that the middle class is \ngetting smaller. This has enormous implications not just economically \nbut socially. The size and strength of a middle class impacts the \nhealth of a community and a nation in many ways. What are we here for \nin the Senate if not to address, consider, and deal with these kinds of \nissues? We need to ask some tough questions about why the middle class \nis shrinking and why pay isn't rising.\n  I have no doubt that bigger government, more regulations, more taxes, \nour huge $18 trillion debt and the interest we pay on it, and, lately, \nObamaCare are important factors in weakening American economic growth \nand the wages of Americans. I truly believe those are significant \nfactors. But is that all there is? I am afraid there is more. It \nappears there are two other factors of significance that are not being \nsufficiently recognized or seriously discussed by any of our political, \ncorporate, and academic leaders, or the media establishment. So it is \ntime for us to begin a vigorous analysis of our conduct of trade. I \nbelieve that is one of the factors that may be impacting the wages and \nincome of Americans.\n  Over a number of years, I have pointed out that I believe immigration \nactions are also containing the growth of wages, as economic studies \nrepeatedly show. But what about trade? Do our policies like the Trans-\nPacific Partnership concede too much to our mercantilist competitor \nallies? These are good countries--Japan, Vietnam. We want to see \nVietnam develop and move into the world orbit. There are other \ncountries, but those are the two big ones that would be most impacted \nby this agreement.\n  We already have trade agreements with Canada, Mexico, Australia, \nChile, and others. What about those that have a different philosophy on \ntrade than we do--the mercantilist ideas? Do their actions over the \nyears establish that they have developed trade and nontrade barrier \nsystems that provide their workers and manufacturers substantial \nadvantages in the world marketplace? Have they figured out how to \nutilize other barriers--other than just\n\n[[Page S2956]]\n\ntariffs--to advantage their manufacturers and jobs?\n  It is astounding to me how little serious discussion there has been \non these issues.\n  For some trade advocates, even bad trade deals are good. Truly, this \nis so. Many advocates are quite open in their belief that as long as \nthe consumer gets a lower price for their product, there should be no \nconcern if American plants close, workers are laid off, and wages fall. \nThey say that in their writings. The politicians don't say it; they \nhave to answer to the people. Many of the theorists for open borders \nand utterly free trade say that often. So I fear we have almost an \nobsession with trade agreements and that this is so strong that many \nTPP advocates don't concern themselves with anything but that we admit \nmore cheaper goods, that lower prices are good for consumers.\n  That we are all consumers, there can be no doubt. That is a valuable \nthing, for consumers to have products at lower prices. I don't dispute \nthat. I know some do, but I don't. But is any trade agreement good \nbecause it creates more low-cost imports, especially if we are \ncompeting against partners who know how to cheat the system and gain \nmanipulative advantage and we don't stand up and try to correct that?\n  Are trade deficits, which are at all-time-high levels, immaterial? \nSome say trade deficits don't make much of a difference. They do. Is \nthe continuing shuttering of American manufacturing of no concern? I \nthink it is of great concern. Fundamentally, can America be strong \nwithout a manufacturing base? Can we be secure without a steel \nindustry, which is getting hammered through unfair trade and dumping \nand other actions by our trading competitors?\n  At bottom, we must ask whether our aggressive trading partners, using \na mercantilist philosophy, may be gaining unfair advantage over the \nAmerican manufacturing base and workers in America.\n  These nations--good nations, good allies--are not religious about \nfree trade. In general, while they assert their desire for expanded \nfree trade, their actual policies seek fewer U.S. exports to them using \nnontariff as well as tariff barriers, and our trade competitors use \ncurrency manipulation, subsidies, and other actions to expand their \nexports to us. Their goal is naturally to seek full employment in their \ncountries while exporting their unemployment to our country.\n  This refusal by many to acknowledge the mercantilist policies of our \ntrading competitors has gone, it seems to me, from promoting healthy \ntrading relationships, to some sort of ideology, even to the nature--I \nhave said, and others have as well--of a religion. If you just knock \ndown all trade barriers, allow our competitors to use whatever tactics \nthey want to use, accept any product that comes in that is cheaper, \nsomehow we will have world peace, cancer will be cured, and the economy \nwill boom. But forgive me if I am not willing to buy into that.\n  Cheaper products are good, is what our promoters say. That is all you \nneed to know. Don't ask too many questions about facts. You are going \nto get cheaper products. That is the only thing that counts.\n  Well, I don't dismiss the advantage of cheaper products. It is a \nserious issue. This issue deserves everybody's serious discussion. But \nI have to tell you, I am having my doubts. I have voted for other trade \nagreements, and I am uneasy about this.\n  Conservatism is not an ideology; it is, as my friend Bob Tyrrell at \nthe American Spectator likes to say, a cast of mind. It lives in the \nreal world. And certainly the real world is not working so well for \nMiddle America today. It is not. Their financial status continues to \ndecline.\n  The conservative thing to do at this point in time is to avoid any \ndramatic and sudden changes that destabilize families and communities \nfurther, to not accelerate the problem that exists. And let's dig in \ndeeply to the questions I ask: Will wages go up? Will trade deficits be \nreduced?\n  By the way, the Korea Free Trade Agreement didn't work so well. We \nwere promised a number of things. President Obama promised the Korea \nFree Trade Agreement would increase U.S. goods exported by $10 billion \nto $11 billion. However, since the deal was ratified several years ago, \nour exports have risen only $0.8 billion--less than $1 billion--while \nKorean exports to the United States increased by more than $12 billion, \nwidening our trade gap substantially, almost doubling it. I am just \ntelling you that is what was promised, and the reality didn't match the \npromises. So is it any wonder the American people are uneasy about \nthese agreements? And I think all of us should be. We should look to be \nmore careful about them.\n  Capital is mobile. People can move money and invest anywhere in the \nworld almost with the click of a computer button. But many times \nworkers are not mobile like that. So when a company closes its plant in \nthe United States and shifts production to a lower wage country, the \ncompany may make more money, but the workers in their communities, who \ncannot move overseas, suddenly don't have jobs, and they are hurt.\n  Of course we can't stop globalization in this economy. We can't \nreverse the effects of trade. But we can work for trade agreements that \ncreate a more level playing field against our good but mercantilist, \naggressive trading partners who look for advantages every day and who \nlust after access to the American marketplace. That is what they want, \nbut we don't have to give that access unless they treat our products \nwith respect and allow access to their marketplaces.\n  So many in our country have an inflexible ideology that the United \nStates and the American people should allow for the completely \nunrestricted movement of goods and labor into the United States, even \nwhen our trading partners manipulate rules for their advantage. Those \ntruest believers are most adamant about passing this fast-track \nlegislation as fast as possible, with the least discussion possible. \nBut the United States is a country, colleagues, not an economy, and a \ncountry's job is first and foremost to protect its citizens from \nmilitary attacks and also from unfair trade policies that threaten our \neconomic well-being.\n  Any trade agreement we enter into should have a mutually beneficial \nimpact on all parties, not just our country but other countries that \nenter into the agreement. It should be mutually beneficial. That is \nwhat contracts do every day. It must not continue or further the \ndecline of manufacturing in the United States. It should seek to end \ntrade unfairness and to increase, not reduce, wages in the United \nStates.\n  We cannot afford to lose a single job nowadays to unfair competition \nor unfair trade agreements. We are experiencing a decline in wages, a \ndecline in employment. We need to fight for every single job. And that \nmeans fair trade--you open your markets before you demand that we open \nours. They haven't done so, while we have maintained open markets here.\n  But the fast-track procedures ensure that any trade deal--which is \nyet unseen--can pass through Congress with a minimum of actual scrutiny \nafter years of soaring trade deficits. Shouldn't we apply more scrutiny \nto trade agreements, not less? Are we afraid to ask tough questions?\n  Take the issue of currency manipulation. This President has refused \nto confront this practice that provides a clear advantage for certain \nforeign competitors. His negotiations have refused to put any \nprovisions in the Trans-Pacific Partnership that address this issue. \nAnd if Congress were to force it in, I am not sure he would even then \nenforce it.\n  The people pushing for this trade agreement, my colleagues have to \nknow, don't want to confront the currency manipulation. They think it \nis all right. They do not think it is a problem. It reduces the price \nof imports, so we should be thankful, they say. And under fast-track, \nthere will be nothing we can do to amend or stop it.\n  Finally, the reality is that this fast-track legislation is a \nsignificant vote. No fast-track deal, once passed, has ever been \nblocked. So if we want to confront currency manipulation and other \nunfair practices, our best bet is to have trade bills come before \nCongress through the regular order--not as a fast-track deal. Then \nCongress can properly exercise its responsibilities that have been \ndelegated to us under the Constitution of the United States.\n\n[[Page S2957]]\n\n  I appreciate the able leaders of the committee who are advancing this \nlegislation. I respect them and many of the arguments they have made. \nThere is much value to them. But I am uneasy about where we are going \ntoday. I think we need to spend more time analyzing the actual impact--\nnot the theoretical impact--of trade agreements--the actual results of \nour ability to penetrate the foreign markets. If we do that, maybe we \ncan figure a way to actually improve the financial condition of \nmainstream America.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, before he leaves the floor, I just wish \nto respond to a couple of the points made by our colleague from \nAlabama, because he brings up issues that Chairman Hatch and I talked a \ngreat deal about during the discussion of this proposal. I would just \nlike to respond very specifically to some of the concerns raised by the \nSenator, my friend from Alabama.\n  My friend from Alabama said there would be no scrutiny--those were \nhis words--of this particular agreement, and that it would be passed \nthrough as quickly as possible without any discussions.\n  Now, that certainly is an area where I have been very concerned. \nChairman Hatch has been concerned that there hasn't been enough \ndiscussion in the past. So Chairman Hatch and I have changed this, and \nI want to be very clear what is going to happen now.\n  First, for a full 60 days before the President of the United States \nsigns an agreement--starting with TPP, the Trans-Pacific Partnership--\nit would have to be made public for those full 60 days before the \nPresident signs it. Then after that, there would be close to 2 \nadditional months when the American people would have the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership Agreement, or any other, in their hands before anyone casts \na vote on an actual agreement on the floor of the Senate or in the \nother body, in the House of Representatives.\n  So as to this idea that my friend from Alabama has said, that there \nwouldn't be any scrutiny of anything, we are starting to get a little \nflack that it would be out there for too long before people started \nvoting. But what this----\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WYDEN. If I could just finish my statement.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. OK.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I was happy to listen to my colleague.\n  What this means is the people of Alabama, Iowa, Oregon, and \neverywhere else could come to one of our townhall meetings, have the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership Agreement in our lap, and ask questions of \ntheir elected representatives about a trade agreement for close to 4 \nmonths before it was voted on here or in the other body.\n  I am going to have to leave for a meeting to talk again about how we \nare going to see if we can find some common ground, but I do want to \naddress one other point that my colleague made, and that deals with \nthis question of middle-class wages.\n  My colleague and I agree completely that middle-class people are \nhurting. There is no question about it. We have millions of middle-\nclass people in this country walking an economic tightrope, balancing \ntheir food bill against their fuel bill and their fuel bill against \ntheir housing bill--no question about that.\n  The difference of opinion here, between two Senators who enjoy each \nother's company, is that my colleague from Alabama says the principal \nproblem is trade--that trade is the reason for this. Respectfully, the \ndata from the Department of Commerce shows that export jobs--which is \nthe focus of this bill and the focus of trade done right--pay better \nthan do the nontrade jobs because they have a value-added kind of \nbenefit to them. That is why--and I note for my friend from Alabama, \nwho cares a great deal about the steel industry--the steel industry \nsent a letter to Chairman Hatch and me saying they were for this. The \nAmerican steel industry sent a letter to Chairman Hatch and me saying \nthey were for this because they know this is connected to producing \nmore high-skilled, high-wage jobs, particularly in manufacturing, where \nmy State is a leader.\n  So the question then becomes this: What are the big challenges? \nCertainly, technology is one, and globalization is one. Chairman Hatch \nand I have talked about flawed tax policy. I think it is particularly \nominous that the tax breaks go for shipping jobs overseas rather than \nrewarding the manufacturers and those who produce what I call ``red, \nwhite, and blue'' jobs.\n  But during the time that I have here on the floor, I am going to be \ntalking about the differences between this trade promotion act proposal \nand the last one of 2002. Nothing could illustrate the differences more \nthan the new requirements for transparency and opportunity for the \nAmerican people to weigh in. The facts are that, as a result of what \nChairman Hatch and the Finance Committee have put together, the \nAmerican people, before a vote is cast--before a vote is cast on a \ntrade agreement here on the floor of the Senate or on the floor of the \nother body, the American people are going to have those trade \nagreements in their hands for pretty close to 4 months.\n  If my colleague wants to ask a question, I am happy to yield my time \nto him.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank Senator Wyden. He is so \nprincipled, and I know his heart is right on all these issues. But \nthere are some disagreements.\n  I do think the Senator gives a little more time between the actual \nagreement being adopted and its passage, which is preferable. But the \ntruth is that none of our fast-track agreements have ever been \ndefeated. There seems to be a majority in both Houses that would vote \nfor that, and once it is here, it is up or down. There is no other \ndeal. We can't have any amendments and little input from rank-and-file \nSenators, although the Finance Committee chairman and a few others get \nsome enhanced powers under this agreement--not the average Senator.\n  So it is not the kind of--if we pass the fast-track, I think with 60 \nvotes, I think we are on a path to adopt an agreement, if history is \ntrue.\n  I noticed again my colleague said it would enhance salaries in export \njob areas. That might be so. Hopefully, we would have some increase in \nexports. In Korea, we had about a $1 billion increase or a little less, \ninstead of 10. But it was a little increase. So maybe that would help a \nfew jobs and a few salaries.\n  But what about the others, the imports that are coming in, imports \nthat are coming in competing with American manufacturing in whole \nmassive areas of the economy? Isn't that likely to close some \nfactories? Isn't it likely to put downward pressure on wages? I think \nso.\n  Finally, I think the steel industry and some others are saying they \ncannot support this trade deal unless we do something about nontariff \nbarriers, currency being one of them. That is what people have told me: \nIf there isn't a fix on currency, we can't go forward with a deal.\n  So there is no full-fledged support, that I am aware of, from the \nsteel industry for the agreement as it is likely to pass, which is not \ngoing to include any currency fix with teeth in it, I am afraid. Then, \nfinally, my concern about not having an adequate debate is less. We \nhave to get into some of these constitutional issues--the ability of \ntwo-thirds of the members of this so-called new commission, this \ntransnational commission that will be established, who can add new \nmembers without our approval. We have to talk about that some.\n  But I asked five questions. I would ask them to Senator Hatch.\n  What would it do to wages? What does the living agreement mean? Does \nit override American law? What about trade deficits and other issues?\n  I think those are the issues that are not being discussed that need \nto be.\n  So again, with the greatest respect, I thank my colleagues for the \nhard work they have put into this. There is no committee that has more \nto do around here than the Finance Committee. I understand their \ninterest in this. I am raising questions. I don't pretend to know all \nthe answers. But I do think the American people are concerned about it, \nand we should be sure that what we do advances the interests of Middle \nAmerica as well as corporate America.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S2958]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I have been very interested in the \ndebate, especially between the distinguished Senator from Alabama and \nthe distinguished Senator from Oregon.\n  I have to say that it is very interesting that almost every business \nin this country wants this bill. Let me just start with mentioning that \nall the chairs of the President's Council of Economic Advisers under \nPresidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, \nWilliam Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama have all said:\n\n       We believe that agreements to foster greater international \n     trade are in our national economic and security interests, \n     and support a renewal of Trade Promotion Authority.\n\n  This is from Alan Greenspan, Michael Boskin, R. Glenn Hubbard, Ben \nBernanke, Austan Goolsbee, Charles Schultze, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, N. \nGregory Mankiw, Edward B. Lazear, Alan B. Krueger, Martin Feldstein, \nMartin Baily, Harvey S. Rosen, and Christina D. Romer, just to mention \na few.\n  They say, in a letter to Senator McConnell and Harry Reid, and to the \nleaders in the House, John Boehner and Nancy Pelosi that virtually \nevery chamber of commerce in the country has come behind this bill. To \nread one paragraph:\n\n       TPA is a longstanding and proven partnership between \n     Congress and the President that enables Congress to set \n     negotiating objectives and requires the executive branch to \n     consult extensively with legislators during negotiations. We \n     urge you to act on this essential legislation. . . .\n\n  I think these chambers of commerce know what is best for business. I \nthink they know what is best for the economy. In fact, U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce President Thomas J. Donohue issued the following statement \nhailing the introduction of the ``Bipartisan Congressional Trade \nPriorities and Accountability Act of 2015, which will renew Trade \nPromotion Authority.''\n  These are people who take these things seriously. Take the Business \nRoundtable:\n\n       Washington--Business Roundtable, representing CEOs of U.S. \n     companies from every sector of the economy, today commended \n     Senators Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Ron Wyden (D-OR) and \n     Representative Paul Ryan (R-WI) for their introduction of a \n     bipartisan bill to update and renew Trade Promotion Authority \n     (TPA). Approval of legislation to modernize TPA is a top \n     priority for Business Roundtable.\n\n  We can go on and on. Jim Greenwood of the Biotechnology Industry \nOrganization has come out in favor of it. Even Gabe Horwitz of the \nThird Way has come out in favor of it. Tom Linebarger of the Business \nRoundtable has come out in favor. Thomas Donohue, as I said, has come \nout in favor of it. David Thomas of Trade Benefits America has come out \nfor this. Matthew Shay of the National Retail Federation says: We urge \nCongress to quickly pass TPA legislation. Peter Allgeier, from the \nCoalition of Service Industries, has come out for it.\n  If we start to look at businesses throughout the country, they don't \nseem to be a bit concerned with some of the issues that have been \nraised by my friend from Alabama because we have covered them in this \nbill.\n  Think about it. The tech companies--these are America's moviemakers, \nsoftware developers, computer manufacturers, the people who drive \nAmerica's innovation--understand that promoting American trade requires \nprotecting American intellectual property. ``That's the only way to \nkeep our competitive edge in the 21st century. And that's exactly what \nTPA will do.'' That is quoting them. TPA lays out almost 150 \nnegotiating objectives for the administration to pursue in trade deals.\n\n  Chris Dodd, the head of the Motion Picture Association of America, \npraised TPA.\n  Microsoft's general counsel, Brad Smith came out and said:\n\n       Passage of renewed TPA, with its updated objectives for \n     digital trade, is critical for America to be able to pursue \n     its interests. And passage is important for Microsoft and our \n     network of more than 400,000 partners--the majority of which \n     are small businesses--to compete in the global economy.\n\n  Chris Padilla, the vice president of IBM, also spoke in favor: ``TPA \nis a critical step in preserving the transformative role of data, and \nin strengthening America's economy and competitiveness.''\n  Victoria Espinell, CEO of BSA, the software alliance, said: ``This \nlegislation will help ensure that pending trade agreements include \nnecessary rules to promote cross-border data flows.''\n  Gary Shapiro, CEO of the Consumer Electronics Association, said: \n``TPA takes a modern approach to trade agreements to ensure a robust \ndigital economy and growth of the Internet,'' which are ``vital to \nAmerican innovation.''\n  Dean Garfield, CEO of the Information Technology Industry Council, \nsaid: ``Tech's message to Congress is simple: supporting TPA will \npromote job creation and propel us forward in building a strong 21st \ncentury economy.''\n  John Neuffer, CEO of the Semiconductor Industry Association, said: \n``TPA represents a much-needed shot in the arm for free trade, which is \ncritical to the U.S. semiconductor industry, to American jobs, and to \nour economy.''\n  We are talking about real jobs here. We are talking about a potential \nto raise the average pay by as much as 18 percent.\n  Carl Guardino, CEO of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, said: \n``Our businesses rely on a robust export market and this bill will go a \nlong way in empowering the U.S. and enabling U.S. companies to remain \ncompetitive across the globe.''\n  Mark McCarthy, vice president of the Software & Information Industry \nAssociation, said: ``TPA legislation is crucial for finalizing \nagreements that will set the template for 21st Century trade and for \nprotecting the global digital leadership of the United States.''\n  Scott Belcher, CEO of the Telecommunications Industry Association \nsaid: ``The passage of Trade Promotion Authority legislation is \ncritical to increasing the competitiveness of U.S. companies overseas, \nparticularly in the information and communications industry, and to \nensuring continued job growth at home.''\n  So tech has spoken out--in one voice, really--to support TPA as \nessential to innovation and competitiveness. We can put our heads in \nthe sand and act as if this is not important, but it is extremely \nimportant.\n  Then, you get into agriculture. Agricultural exports support over 1 \nmillion U.S. jobs, both on and off the farm. Fiscal years 2010 to 2014 \nrepresented the strongest 5 years in U.S. history for agricultural \nexports, with sales totaling $675 billion. They are expecting grow once \nwe get fair trade rules with the countries we are currently negotiating \nwith.\n  By the way, when we are talking about the 11 nations of the TPP \nnegotiations we are undergoing, one of the countries we are talking \nabout is Japan. We have had trouble breaking down trade barriers with \nJapan for years. We now have a Prime Minister over there who is willing \nto work with us and seize the advantage--not just for Japan but for the \nregion as well.\n  If we do not pass this TPA bill, we are just throwing the China the \nAsia-Pacific. They are already making strides in that area that would \nnot be happening if we had this trade agreement already. I might add \nthat there is the new innovative bank that they have started. At first, \nthere were only a few countries that wanted to join it. Now it is over \n60, as I understand it. Upwards of 60 countries have now jumped on \nboard, including some of the major countries in this negotiation. We \nare going to just stand here and act as if this is not happening and \nthat our interests in free trade are not important unless we get \neverything we want, which, ironically, we basically get in these \nagreements.\n  U.S. producers rely on and prosper from access to foreign markets. \nCurrently, we export half of U.S. wheat, milled rice, and soybean \nproduction; 70 percent of walnut and pistachio production; more than 75 \npercent of cotton production; 40 percent of grape production; 20 \npercent of cherry production; 20 percent of apple production; 20 \npercent of poultry and pork production; and 10 percent of beef \nproduction.\n  Today, only a relatively small percentage of U.S. companies export, \nyet 95 percent of the world's consumers live outside of the United \nStates. What are we going to do--ignore these facts and not acknowledge \nthat we need to pass this bill?\n\n[[Page S2959]]\n\n  We need to get real about trade. Trade agreements are the most \neffective way to eliminate foreign tariffs, unscientific regulatory \nbarriers, and bureaucratic administrative procedures designed to block \ntrade.\n  I could go on and on. Today there are some 400 trade agreements, and \nwe have only been party to a small fraction. That is because we have \nnot had trade promotion authority. Are we going to sit back and put our \nheads in the sand and act as if this were not important?\n  The manufacturers are rallying behind this bill throughout the \ncountry. They said this:\n       Manufacturers need TPA and new market-opening trade \n     agreements now more than ever.\n  That was said by National Association of Manufacturers vice chair for \ninternational economic policy and Emerson chairman and CEO David Farr.\n  He adds:\n       Trade is increasingly critical for the bottom lines of \n     businesses of all sizes, but U.S. exports face higher tariffs \n     and more barriers abroad than nearly any other major economy. \n     Manufacturers need TPA to restore U.S. leadership in striking \n     new trade deals that will knock down barriers so that \n     manufacturers can improve their access to world's consumers.\n  The National Association of Manufacturers is the largest \nmanufacturing association in the United States. They are begging us to \ndo this. American manufacturers want TPA. What are we going to do--bury \nour head in the sand and say that is not so? It is time for us to wake \nup and realize we have to get in the real world.\n  This agreement has been well thought through. Is it perfect? No, \nnothing is perfect around here. But it goes a long way toward resolving \nour problems, creating more jobs in America, more opportunities in \nAmerica, more income in America, and more economic stability in \nAmerica. Without it, my gosh, what are we going to be? Become just a \nnation that does not participate, when we have the capacity to \nparticipate all over the world. This is an important step that we are \ntalking about here and we need to take it.\n  Let me take a few more moments--I notice the distinguished Senator is \nhere to bring up his amendment. Let me take a few minutes and respond \nto my colleagues' concerns about provisions contained in the Trans-\nPacific Partnership or TPP.\n  Specifically, there are some who have said that TPP contains an \nunprecedented, ``living agreement'' provision that would allow parties \nto amend the agreement after it is adopted and, in the process, change \nU.S. law without Congress's approval. Let me state this as clearly as \npossible. These assertions are 100-percent false. No trade agreements--\npast, present or future--can change U.S. law without the consent of \nCongress. This is not even a close question.\n  No reasonable interpretation of our Constitution, our laws or our \ntrade agreements lends credence to that interpretation. Of course, I \nknow that my counter-assertions by themselves will not be enough to \nconvince people they are wrong on this issue. So let's delve into this \na bit further.\n  True enough, TPP, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, reportedly includes \na provision to create a forum along the joint working groups to help \nparties evaluate whether the agreement is being implemented as intended \nand to provide a way to discuss new issues as they arise. But guess \nwhat. Most U.S. free-trade agreements contain similar provisions. This \nis not new or unprecedented. This is standard for every modern trade \nagreement. My friend from Alabama raised the Korea agreement. It has \nonly been in existence since 2012. We have not seen it fully \nimplemented yet, and it is not fully implemented.\n  For example, the U.S.-South Korea Free Trade Agreement has a ``joint \ncommittee,'' and CAFTA-DR has a ``free trade commission,'' both of \nwhich perform the same functions as have been reported for the TPP \ncommission.\n  These agreements specify that these bodies can oversee operations of \nthe agreement. However, nothing in the text of either agreement gives \neither committee the power to change U.S. law--nothing whatsoever. The \nsame is true of the commission that is reportedly part of TPP. In \naddition, TPP will almost undoubtedly include a process for amending \nthe agreement. This, too, is standard procedure for modern trade \nagreements. That is a good thing.\n  These provisions, which once again are included in all of our \nexisting trade agreements, help ensure that the United States can \nprotect its interests when new issues arise. Most importantly, they \ncontain a backstop to protect our country's sovereignty.\n  For example, in our free-trade agreement with South Korea, the \nrelevant provision states that ``an amendment shall enter into force \nafter the parties exchange written notification certifying that they \nhave completed their respective legal requirements and procedures.''\n  In NAFTA, the section describing the amendment process states: ``When \nso agreed and approved in accordance with the applicable legal \nprocedures of each party, a modification or addition shall constitute \nan integral part of this agreement.''\n  Of course, in the United States, the applicable legal procedure for \namending a free-trade agreement and for any and all changes to U.S. law \nincludes approval by Congress. In other words, no free-trade \nagreement--again, that is past, present or future--to which the United \nStates is a party can be amended without Congress's approval.\n  Once again, these ``living agreement'' provisions are standard \npractice for free-trade agreements. For the most part, they have not \nbeen remotely controversial, up until now, I guess. In fact, one of our \ncolleagues, who has been very vocal on this issue and has even filed at \nleast one amendment to our TPA bill on this matter, voted in favor of \nfree-trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama, all of \nwhich included provisions very similar to those that are reportedly \npart of TPP. It is not just I who am saying this.\n  I have a memo sent to my staff from the nonpartisan Congressional \nResearch Service that reiterates these points.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a copy of this memo, immediately following my remarks.\n  Madam President, this is U.S. Government 101. Under our system, only \nCongress can change the law. I am certainly not oblivious to the fact a \nnumber of my colleagues--both here in the Senate and in the House of \nRepresentatives--deeply distrust our current President. I am hardly a \nshrinking violet when it comes to criticizing President Obama--and even \nhis predecessors--and his propensity for overreach. I have been very \ncritical of this administration's effort to expand executive power, and \nI will continue to be. But no one should channel distrust of President \nObama into opposition to the TPA bill. If anything, the opposite is \ntrue.\n  Our bill contains numerous provisions solidifying the principle that \nU.S. law cannot be changed without Congress's consent. Under our bill, \nno secretive provisions of a trade agreement can be withheld from \nCongress and still enter into force.\n  Furthermore, the bill goes further than any previous version of TPA \nin ensuring transparency and accountability in both the trade \nnegotiating process and the approval procedures.\n  In short, Madam President, if you are suspicious of executive \nauthority but still want to support free trade, you should support our \nTPA bill. Once again, there is simply no reason to be concerned about \n``living agreement'' provisions in the TPP or any other trade \nagreement. Our Constitution, our laws, our trade agreements, and, of \ncourse, our TPA bill all ensure that when it comes to the U.S. trade \npolicy, Congress has the final say.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Congressional Research Service,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 12, 2015.\n\n\n                               memorandum\n\n     To: U.S. Senate Committee on Finance, Attention: Everett \n         Eissenstat.\n     From: Daniel T. Shedd, Legislative Attorney, 7-8441; Brandon \n         J. Murrill, Legislative Attorney, 7-8440.\n     Subject: Amendment of Free Trade Agreements and Role of \n         Congress.\n\n       This memorandum responds to your request regarding whether \n     the President, acting alone, can change U.S. domestic law by \n     negotiating an amendment to an existing free trade agreement \n     (FTA). In order for an\n\n[[Page S2960]]\n\n     amendment to an existing FTA to affect domestic law, Congress \n     would have to implement that change through legislation. \n     Because of the expedited nature of this request, this \n     memorandum does not represent an exhaustive analysis of FTAs \n     and the processes established to amend those FTAs.\n       Under the Constitution, the President has the authority to \n     negotiate agreements with foreign countries. However, the \n     Constitution on also identifies Congress as the branch with \n     responsibility to regulate commerce with foreign nations. \n     Therefore, although the President can negotiate FTAs and \n     amendments to FTAs, in order for those agreements to have \n     controlling effect in U.S. domestic law, Congress must enact \n     legislation approving the agreement and providing for the \n     implementation of its requirements, as necessary. For FTAs, \n     the implementing legislation is often enacted through \n     procedures established by Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), \n     often referred to as ``fast track'' authority. If any \n     agreement, or any amendment to an agreement, requires a \n     change in U.S. law in order for the United States to come \n     into compliance with the agreement, Congress would have to \n     pass legislation for there to be any change to domestic law.\n       U.S. FTAs often contain provisions allowing for their \n     amendment. For example, the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement \n     (KORUS) provides: ``The Parties may agree, in writing, to \n     amend this Agreement . . .'' However, it is important to note \n     that FTAs also contain provisions that establish that the \n     domestic legal procedures of each country that is a party to \n     the agreement must be followed in order for the amendment to \n     take effect. Again, the text from KORUS is illustrative: ``An \n     amendment shall enter into force after the Parties exchange \n     written notifications certifying that they have completed \n     their respective applicable legal requirements and procedures \n     . . .'' Other FTAs contain similar provisions providing that \n     an amendment to an agreement will only have legal force if it \n     is approved through the necessary legal procedures of each \n     country that is a party to the agreement. Furthermore, even \n     absent these provisions in FTAs, because FTAs are not viewed \n     as self-executing agreements, an amendment to an FTA would \n     not change domestic law unless Congress enacted a statute to \n     that effect.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, we are a little bit behind and our \ncolleagues have been very patient.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Peters be able to speak briefly \nabout one of his constituents who had a tragic death, followed by our \ncolleague, Senator Lankford from Oklahoma. I ask unanimous consent that \nthose Senators be allowed to speak in that order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                       Remembering Rachel Jacobs\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I rise today with a heavy heart and with \ngreat sadness to commemorate the life of Rachel Jacobs. Rachel was \ntragically killed in last week's Amtrak train crash.\n  This morning, my wife Colleen and I joined hundreds of mourners who \nattended her funeral as she was laid to rest in Metro Detroit. Rachel \nwas only 39 years old when her life was so tragically cut short. She \nhad a life filled with love, with accomplishment, and with promise. She \nwas the beloved daughter of my dear friends Gilda and John Jacobs. \nRachel was a wife, the mother of a 2-year-old son, and the CEO of an \neducation startup in Philadelphia. While she worked in Philadelphia and \nlived in New York City, this is a profound loss for the Detroit area, \nwhere she grew up but which she never left behind.\n  Rachel was the cofounder of Detroit Nation, an organization to engage \nformer residents of the Detroit area in cities and communities around \nour great country. Rachel helped to connect people and motivated her \nfriends. She took part in Detroit Homecoming, an event held last fall \nto engage accomplished leaders across the United States who grew up in \nthe Metro Detroit area and now want to give back to the community they \nstill love and call home.\n  Rachel was a leader in this important work--work that will now need \nto be carried on by those whom she inspired. I am heartbroken for her \nmany friends and deeply saddened by this tragic loss for the Metro \nDetroit area.\n  My heart goes out to her young son Jacob, her husband Todd, her \nwonderful parents Gilda and John, her sister Jessica, and her entire \nfamily as they struggle with this painful loss.\n  As parents, we want to give everything to our children. We want to \ngive them a stable home and a loving family. We want to give them a \ngreat education and a bright future. But the one thing we cannot give \nor promise them is a long life. That is in God's hands, and now Rachel \nis as well.\n  Madam President, we have suffered an incredible loss with the passing \nof Rachel Jacobs. We have lost a brilliant businesswoman, an active \ncommunity leader, and a loving mother, wife, sister, and daughter. May \nher memory be a blessing.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1237, as Modified\n\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that my \namendment No. 1237 be modified with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 4, between lines 21 and 22, insert the following:\n       (13) to take into account conditions relating to religious \n     freedom of any party to negotiations for a trade agreement \n     with the United States.\n\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, I also ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Vitter be added as a cosponsor to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, trade agreements are about a set of \nvalues and beliefs. Do we believe the American workers and American \nproducts can compete with the rest of the world and provide answers and \nproducts the world needs? It is an overwhelming yes. When we trade, we \nnot only exchange goods, we exchange ideas and values. Our greatest \nexport is our American value--the dignity of each person, hard work, \ninnovation, and liberty. That is what we send around the world. It has \nthe greatest impact.\n  What we wrote into our Declaration of Independence is not just an \nAmerican value statement; we believe it is a statement about every \nperson. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men, not just \nmen and women within the United States but that all people worldwide \nare created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable \nrights, and among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of \nhappiness.\n  Governments were created to protect the rights given to us by God. We \nbelieve every person should have the protection of government to live \ntheir faith, not the compulsion of government to practice any one faith \nor to be forced to reject all faith altogether. That is one of the \nreasons Americans are disturbed by the trend in our courts, our \nmilitary, and our public conversation. It is not the task of government \nto purge religious conversation from public life; it is the task of \ngovernment to protect the rights of every person to live their faith \nand to guard those who choose not to have any faith at all.\n  Thomas Jefferson, in one of the pinnacle works of his life, the \nVirginia Statute for Religious Freedom, states:\n\n       Almighty God hath created the mind free, and manifested his \n     supreme will that free it shall remain by making it \n     altogether insusceptible of restraint; that all attempts to \n     influence it by temporal punishments, or burthens, or by \n     civil incapacitations, tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy \n     and meanness.\n\n  With that backdrop, I worked for 2 years with my colleagues to place \nlanguage into the negotiating language of this trade bill to push our \nnegotiators to consider religious liberty in their negotiations. I have \nbeen told over and over again that we don't talk about religious \nfreedom in our trade negotiations. I have just asked, why not? We \nshould encourage trade with another country when that country \nacknowledges our basic value of the dignity of every person to live \ntheir own faith.\n  Our Nation is not just an economy; our Nation is a set of ideas and \nvalues. We believe each person has value and worth. It benefits every \nperson from each nation in the trade agreement if we lead with our \nvalues and not sell out for a dollar people who have been in bondage as \na prisoner of conscience for years.\n  The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom recently\n\n[[Page S2961]]\n\nrecommended that the United States should ``ensure that human rights \nand religious freedom are pursued consistently and publicly at every \nlevel of the U.S.-Vietnam relationship, including in the context of \ndiscussions relating to military, trade, or economic and security \nassistance, such as Vietnam's participation in the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership, as well as in programs that address Internet freedom and \ncivil society development, among others.''\n  When people have freedom of conscience and faith, they are also \nbetter trading partners. Their country is stable, their families are \nstable, and their economy will grow.\n  With that, I encourage this body to do something new. Let's start \nexporting the values we hold dear, not to compel other nations to have \nour faith but to have other nations recognize the power of the freedom \nof religion within their own borders.\n  I have a simple amendment to the trade promotion authority asking the \ntrade negotiators to take into account conditions relating to religious \nfreedom of any party to negotiations for a trade agreement with the \nUnited States. It is not complicated. It is a simple encouragement, and \nit is a step toward us exporting our value.\n  I ask for the support of this body as we consider our greatest \nexport--freedom.\n  With that, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n         Agriculture in Rural America and Government Regulation\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, the Presiding Officer comes from a State \nvery similar to mine, and what I was going to say is that when you do--\nin fact, our State has twice as many cattle as it has people--you begin \nto understand the importance of agriculture to our Nation's economy and \nthe communities that comprise our State. In rural Kansas, as it would \nbe in rural Iowa, agriculture is our economic lifeblood.\n  One of the primary reasons I sought public office was my belief in \nrural America and that it needed a strong voice in Washington \nadvocating on behalf of that part of the country. Since the time I was \nfirst elected to Congress, I believe that has only become even more \nimportant.\n  People involved in farming and ranching endure challenges that no \nother industry, no other profession faces. They are at the mercy of \nMother Nature and rely on favorable weather to produce a crop. The \nsevere drought that has plagued parts of Kansas for a long number of \nyears and is once again crippling this year's wheat crop is evidence of \nthe unique challenges.\n  Farmers and ranchers also operate in a global marketplace that \noftentimes is distorted by high foreign subsidies and tariffs. American \nfarmers are the most efficient producers in the world. Too often, \nhowever, our farmers cannot be afforded the opportunity to compete on a \nlevel playing field.\n  Unfortunately, agriculture is also under assault from the Obama \nadministration. Overregulation by the EPA, the Army Corps of Engineers, \nand the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service threatens the livelihood of \nfarmers and ranchers in my State, which in turn threatens the viability \nof family businesses that line main streets in rural towns across our \nState.\n  To better understand the damage caused by foolish overregulation, \nconsider waters of the United States. Despite the overwhelming outcry \nthat the Obama administration received from American producers--from \nagriculture and other businesses--after proposing the potentially \nharmful regulation, the administration has continued their march \nforward toward finalizing that rule. The regulation is a troublesome \nexpansion of Federal control over the Nation's waters. The Obama \nadministration has continued to repeat the mantra that the rule is only \nintended to clarify the scope of the Clean Water Act, but we all know \nbetter. Not only has the rule failed to provide clarity or certainty, \nit also seeks to expand the EPA's jurisdiction to include thousands of \nnew miles of streams, rivers, and even dry ditches.\n  Where I come from, the term ``navigable waters,'' which is what the \nstatute says, means something on which you can float a boat. We don't \nhave many of those waters in the State of Kansas. Yet, this \nadministration seems to believe they have the right to enforce those \nburdensome regulations on land that is far removed from what is \ntraditionally considered navigable waters.\n  People in rural Kansas also faced increased regulation from the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service. As my colleagues will recall, I led a debate \nearlier this year to delist the lesser prairie chicken from the \nendangered species list. The bird's listing is creating havoc and \nuncertainty in Kansas, where its habitat is located.\n  Wind energy projects have been abandoned, oil-and-gas production has \nslowed, and farmers and ranchers are faced with uncertainty regarding \nnew restrictions as to what they can do on their privately owned land.\n  Those of us from Kansas know that we need the return of rainfall and \nmoisture and that will increase the habitat and therefore increase the \npopulation of the lesser prairie chicken, not burdensome Federal \nregulations that hinder the rural economy.\n  While the lesser prairie chicken regulation is directly harming the \nwestern part of Kansas, the administration's recent proposal to list \nthe long-eared bat as a threatened species will do the same in our \nState's eastern communities.\n  We often speak about the ever-increasing average age of farmers in \nthe country and the need to encourage more young people to stay on the \nfarm and to return from college to the farm. I could not agree more \nwith this goal. I believe a key component in achieving this objective \nis to make certain our Nation's policies and regulations make farming \nand ranching an attractive venture for our children and grandchildren. \nUnfortunately, the regulations we have seen from this administration \ntoo often make farming and ranching much less attractive, much less \nprofitable, and young people have made the conclusion that the battle \ncannot be won.\n  I am deeply concerned about the impact of this administration's \nregulatory scheme and the effect that scheme will have on farmers and \nranchers, but there remains reason for us to be optimistic about the \nfuture of American agriculture. We are faced with a growing rural \npopulation who is hungry for high-quality, nutritious food products \ngrown by American farmers. We must continue to work toward reducing \nforeign barriers to make certain that people from around the globe have \naffordable access to U.S.-grown products. We must continue to invest in \npolicies that lift up rural America, not hold it back.\n  I am the chairman of the agriculture subcommittee, and I am working \nto make certain that Congress is doing its part to support farmers and \nranchers. American policies should aim to keep rural America strong by \nway of implementation of the farm bill, preserving and protecting crop \ninsurance, investing in agriculture research, and supporting rural \ndevelopment.\n  I often tell my colleagues here in Washington about the special way \nof life in Kansas and the opportunities that special way of life \ncontinues to provide. The strength of rural Kansas is a key component \nto what makes our State a great place to live, work, and raise \nfamilies. The future of communities in rural America depends upon the \neconomic viability of our farmers and ranchers, and it is time to make \ncertain that Federal policies and regulatory decisions coming out of \nWashington, DC, reflect this critical importance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. DAINES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Daines pertaining to the introduction of S. 1361 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DAINES. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S2962]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Wasteful Spending\n\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I am here on the floor almost every \nMonday, and this is the 11th time I have been on the floor over the \nlast 3 months or so to speak about the waste of the week. We are trying \nto identify those areas of fraud and abuse and waste of taxpayers' \nmoney so we can take reasonable steps, hopefully soon in the Congress, \nto end this misuse of taxpayers' funds. Then we can either return it \nback to the taxpayers or sometimes use the funds to offset other \nspending that may be necessary to make for a more efficient government. \nThe taxpayers deserve to have their dollars they send here, after a lot \nof hard work, treated carefully. We continue to expose areas, and the \nOffice of the Inspector General of the Office of Management and Budget \nand nonpartisan committees are looking at ways to identify misuse of \nthose funds.\n  One of the areas we haven't spoken about but will today are the \nbenefits for higher education. Many of these are well intended and many \nof them are used effectively. For example, there is a lifetime learning \ncredit for graduate courses and other classes. There is the Hope credit \nfor undergraduate expenses. There is the American opportunity tax \ncredit, which temporarily replaced the Hope credit, but that is set to \nexpire. There are a raft of confusing proposals that are designed to \nhelp people who want to work through their education and get tax \ncredits for the expenses they pay. So this is well intended. However, \nwhat has happened is that it has become a confusing mess as to how \nthese are applied and how they are used.\n  The Treasury inspector general for tax administration determined that \nthe IRS paid out billions of dollars in potentially erroneous education \ntax credits to more than 3.6 million taxpayers. So Congress has passed \na law. They have adjusted the Tax Code to give credits and benefits to \nthose who are going to school to get a graduate education or to get \ntheir postsecondary education. This is a worthwhile use, in most cases, \nbut it has been deemed by Congress to be so and made part of the Tax \nCode. Yet the inspector general who looks at all this has said it has \nbecome a ripe area for fraud, waste, and abuse, as well as some honest \nmistakes.\n  I wish to repeat that again. The IRS paid out billions of dollars in \nerroneous education tax credits to more than 3.6 million taxpayers \nseeking these credits. Now, some say, What do you mean? What are some \nof the mistakes? Students who weren't eligible for the benefit got the \nbenefit. Institutions that received the benefits were ineligible to \nreceive the benefits for a number of reasons.\n  In most cases, higher education institutions send out returns known \nas 1098-Ts to taxpayers who pay for tuition. These forms help taxpayers \nand the IRS determine if students qualify for the education tax \nbenefits, including by indicating whether the student is enrolled more \nthan half time or is a graduate student. In other words, they must show \nthat the student qualifies for the tax benefit. They found out that \nmany don't qualify but nevertheless receive those benefits.\n  The inspector general reports that 2 million taxpayers did not submit \nthe form or have the form--the 1098-T paperwork--to indicate they had \nactually paid the tuition. Of these almost 40,000 taxpayers, some \nreceived credits for students who are under the age of 14. These tax \ncredits are for postsecondary education. There may be a couple of \ngenius kids out there who are enrolled in college at the age of 14 or \nunder, but I don't think there are very many, if any under the age of \n14 or over the age of 65.\n  Additionally, tax credits were awarded improperly to over 2,100 \nincarcerated people.\n  How do we correct this? Well, there is a pretty basic idea I wish to \npropose. Many of us are familiar with the letters we receive back when \nwe make a charitable contribution, and most of us know that if that \ncontribution is over $250, the IRS wants to know that we have proof \nthat we have actually made that charitable contribution. So our tax \npreparers always ask: Do you have a receipt? Do you have the letter \nback from the Boy Scouts or your church or wherever you give the money? \nDo you have that available for when we might happen to need it if the \nIRS requires it when they are looking into that?\n  So what we are proposing is simply a requirement that taxpayers \nshould claim a tuition tax credit, have proof that they have actually \nreceived the credit and are eligible to receive the credit. That proof \nis the 1098-T form. We are proposing to simply require that taxpayers \nhold a valid 1098-T or some form of substantiation in their possession \nwhen they fill out their tax returns and claim tuition deductions.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that this very simple \nrequirement would save $576 million over the next 10 years. We have \nalready proven we can save billions by better management of taxpayers' \nmoney and now we are going to add another $576 million to this. As my \ncolleagues see, we are on the way to $100 billion of savings through \nsome very basic and simple modifications and changes in our Tax Code \nand in our procedures in terms of how we run this government.\n  Next week, we will be sharing again the fraud and waste of the week, \nbut Congress now has a pool of funds that are misused and a way in \nwhich we can either, as I said, offset needed spending programs or \nreturn that money to the taxpayers or not have them send it in in the \nfirst place.\n  It is a dysfunctional government that can't better manage taxpayers' \nfunds. If we are going to maintain credibility and the support of our \ntaxpayers for what we do that is right, we better stop and pay \nattention and look and change and modify the abuse that is taking place \nand bring it to an end. We need to demonstrate that we are looking out \ncarefully at the use of taxpayers' dollars.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1242\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nSenators be added as cosponsors to the Brown amendment: Stabenow, \nKlobuchar, Baldwin, Schumer, Blumenthal, Whitehouse, Udall, Sanders, \nWarren, Manchin, Markey, Reed, Franken, and Heinrich.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. The support for this amendment is broad and deep. The \nsupport for this funding level reached 300-some House Members 4 years \nago and 70 Senators--including, obviously, a number in each party--4 \nyears ago when we decided to support this number. So this funding level \nof $575 million is bipartisan. It was established 4 years ago.\n  Some say that $450 million--the amount included in the underlying \nbill--is enough to operate the program and that we should not bring the \nfunding level back to the $575 million. The fact is that we do not \nreally know. What we do know is that TAA--the trade adjustment \nassistance, the money we provide to workers to be retrained after they \nhave lost a job because of a decision President Obama and the Congress \nmade to pass a trade agreement, which always produces winners and \nlosers--free trade supporters and free trade opponents all agree and \neven cheerleaders as passionate as the Wall Street Journal, as strongly \nsupportive as they are of these free-trade agreements, even they \nacknowledge there are winners and there are losers. The losers are \nthose people who lost their jobs in Indiana, Ohio, Utah, and all over \nthe country because of decisions we made in this body. They are not \ndecisions they made to not show up to work, not decisions they made to\n\n[[Page S2963]]\n\nnot do their work well; they are decisions we made in this Congress and \nPresident Obama made at the White House to push these trade agreements, \nresulting in dislocation, so some workers lose their jobs. That is why \nit is a moral issue that we provide adequate funding for training for \nthese workers.\n  I mentioned the years 2009, 2010--it cost $685 million each year. Of \ncourse, those are years during the great recession. But if you take the \naverage of funding levels for the 3 years when program eligibility was \nnearly the same as it is now, TAA expenditures were about $571 million \na year. That is roughly the figure we are choosing for our amendment, \nthe number the President asked for in his budget originally.\n  TAA works. Seventy-six percent of participants who completed training \nin fiscal year 2013 received a degree or an industry-recognized \ncredential. Seventy-five percent of workers who exited the program \nfound employment within 6 months. Of those workers who became employed, \nover 90 percent were still employed at the end of the year. So we know \ntrade adjustment assistance works.\n  This reduction of $125 million a year, in other words, is simply cuts \nfor the sake of cuts.\n  It helps workers retrain for new jobs so they can compete in the \nglobal economy. We know that even though the economy is better today \nthan when President Obama took office or it is better today then it was \nin 2010 before we did the RECOVERY Act or it is better today than it \nwas that year when we did the auto rescue that helped the Presiding \nOfficer's State of Indiana and my State of Ohio and the whole national \neconomy so much--we do know that since that time, we have had the South \nKorea trade agreement, and the President and supporters of that \npromised 70,000 increased jobs. We have actually lost 70,000 jobs \ninstead because of a swelling trade deficit with South Korea. We have \nthe Trans-Pacific Partnership. Even its supporters acknowledge there \nwill be workers who lose their jobs--they believe a net gain, but \nnonetheless numbers of workers will lose their jobs and will need \nretraining.\n  So that conservative number of only $450 million, when it is clear we \nneed the larger number of $575 million--the same level President Obama \nincluded in his budget; the same level that 70 Senators--a number in \neach party--and 300-plus Members of the House supported. I ask my \ncolleagues to support it again today.\n  Again, it was not the choice of these workers to lose their jobs; it \nwas the choice of this institution to pass a trade agreement that \nresults in some workers losing their jobs. We all acknowledge that on \nboth sides. That is why this amendment is so important to adopt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds \nmore.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, look, significantly increasing funding \nlevels for TAA may very well make TAA much harder to pass both here and \nin the House of Representatives. It is a program that is not supported \nby a great number of us. That being the case, I hope my colleagues will \njoin me in voting no on this amendment.\n  We have put together a bill that literally has brought together both \nsides as well as we possibly could. Hopefully, we will vote no on this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to Brown amendment \nNo. 1242.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes \nfor the adoption of this amendment, the amendment, as modified, is \nagreed to.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for up to 20 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, April 18, 2012, was not the first time \nI spoke on the Senate floor on the dangers of carbon pollution, but it \nwas the first in the weekly series that brings me here today with my \nincreasingly dog-eared sign.\n  Opponents of responsible climate action do best in the dark, so I \nknew if anything was going to change around here, we would need to \nshine some light on the facts, on the science, and on the sophisticated \nscheme of denial being conducted by the polluters.\n  I decided to come to the floor every week the Senate is in session to \nput at least my little light to work, and today I do so for the 100th \ntime, and I thank very much my colleagues who have taken time from \ntheir extremely busy schedules to be here, particularly my colleagues \nfrom the House, Jim Langevin and David Cicilline, who traveled all the \nway across the building.\n  I am not a lone voice on this subject. Many colleagues have been \nspeaking out, particularly our ranking member on the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, Senator Boxer. Senator Markey has been speaking \nout on the climate longer than I have been in the Senate. Senators \nSchumer, Nelson, Blumenthal, Schatz, King, and Baldwin have each joined \nme to speak about the effects of carbon pollution on their home States \nand economies. Senator Manchin and I--from different perspectives--\nspoke here about our shared belief that climate change is real and must \nbe addressed. More than 30 fellow Democrats held the floor overnight to \nbring attention to climate change under the leadership of Senator \nSchatz. Our Democratic leader, Senator Reid, has pressed the Senate to \nface up to this challenge, and thousands of people in Rhode Island and \nacross the country have shown their support.\n  Sometimes people ask me: How do you keep coming up with new ideas? It \nis easy. There are at least 100 reasons to act on climate. Hundreds of \nAmericans have sent me their reasons through my Web site, Facebook, and \nTwitter using the hashtag ``100Reasons.'' I will highlight some of \ntheir reasons in this speech.\n  What is my No. 1 reason? Easy. Rhode Island. The consequences of \ncarbon pollution for my Ocean State are undeniable. The tide gauge at \nNaval Station Newport is up nearly 10 inches since the 1930s. The water \nin Narragansett Bay is 3 to 4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer in the winter \nthan just 50 years ago.\n  Lori from West Kingston, RI, said that is her top reason too. ``We \nstand to lose the best part of Rhode Island,'' she wrote, ``the 400 \nmiles of coastline, which will be severely impacted, environmentally \nand economically.''\n  Even Kentucky's Department of Fish and Wildlife has warned--get \nthis--that sea level rise and increased storms along our eastern \nseaboard could get so bad that it would trigger ``unprecedented'' \npopulation migration from our east coasts to Kentucky. That is serious.\n  Winston Churchill talked about ``sharp agate points upon which the \nponderous balance of destiny turns.'' What if we now stand at a hinge \nof history? Will we awaken to the duty and responsibility of our time \nor will we sleepwalk through it? That is the test we face.\n  I have laid out in these speeches the mounting effects of carbon \npollution all around us, and the evidence abounds. This March, for the \nfirst time in human history, the monthly average carbon dioxide in our \natmosphere exceeded 400 parts per million. The range had been 170 to \n300 parts per million for hundreds of thousands of years.\n  Mr. President, 2014 was the hottest year ever measured. Fourteen of \nthe warmest 15 years ever measured have been in this century. Our \noceans warm as they absorb more than 90 percent of the heat captured by \ngreenhouse gases. You measure their warming with a thermometer. As \nseawater warms, it expands and sea levels rise. Global average sea \nlevel rose about 1 inch from 2005 to 2013. You measure that with a \nyardstick. Ocean water absorbs roughly a quarter of all of our carbon \nemissions, making the water more acidic and upsetting the very \nchemistry of ocean life. You measure this, too, with a pH test like a \nthird grade class would use for its fish tank.\n  It is virtually universal in peer-reviewed science that carbon \npollution is causing these climate and oceanic changes. Every major \nscientific society in our country has said so. Our brightest scientists \nat NOAA and NASA are unequivocal. But time and again we hear ``I am not \na scientist'' from politicians who are refusing to acknowledge the \nevidence. We are not elected to be scientists; we are elected to listen \nto them.\n  If you don't believe scientists, how about generals? Our defense and \nintelligence leaders have repeatedly warned of the threats posed by \nclimate change to national security and international stability.\n  How about faith leaders? Religious leaders of every faith appeal to \nour moral duty to conserve God's creation and to protect those most \nvulnerable to catastrophe.\n  How about our titans of industry? Leaders such as Apple and Google, \nCoke and Pepsi, Walmart and Target, Nestle and Mars are all greening \ntheir operations and their supply chains and calling on policymakers to \nact.\n  How about constituents? I have talked with community and business \ngroups across the United States. Local officials--many of them \nRepublicans--don't have the luxury of ignoring the changes we see. \nState scientific agencies and State universities are doing much of the \nleading research on climate change.\n  If you are a Senator who is not sure climate change is real, manmade, \nand urgent, ask your home State university. Even in Kentucky. Even in \nOklahoma.\n  Flooding puts mayors in kayaks on South Florida streets. New \nHampshire and Utah ski resorts struggle with shorter and warmer \nwinters, and Alaskan villages are falling into the sea. Yet, no \nRepublican from these States yet supports serious climate legislation.\n  This resistance to plain evidence is vexing to many Americans. \nElizabeth from Riverside, RI, says her grandchildren are her top reason \nfor action. She wrote:\n\n       I fail to understand the Republican opposition to what is \n     clearly factual scientific information about climate change. \n     Are they not educated? Can they not read? Do they not have \n     children and grandchildren to be concerned about the future \n     they leave? Or is it money that clouds their vision?\n\n  The truth is that Republican cooperation in this area, which existed \nfor some time, has been shut down by the fossil fuel industry. The \npolluters have constructed a carefully built apparatus of lies propped \nup by endless dark money.\n  Dr. Riley Dunlap of Oklahoma State University calls it the \n``organized climate-denial machine.'' He found that nearly 90 percent \nof climate-denial books published between 1982 and 2010 had ties to \nconservative fossil fuel-funded think tanks such as the Heartland \nInstitute. In other words, it is a scam.\n  Dr. Robert Brulle of Drexel University has documented the intricate \npropaganda web of climate denial with over 100 organizations, from \nindustry trade organizations, to conservative think tanks, to plain old \nphony front groups. The purpose of this denial beast, to quote Dr. \nBrulle, is ``a deliberate and organized effort to misdirect the public \ndiscussion and distort the public's understanding of climate.''\n  John from Tucson, AZ, says this is his top reason to act:\n\n\n[[Page S2965]]\n\n\n       These ``merchants of doubt,'' the professional climate \n     denier campaigners, have lied to us and attacked the people \n     who can help us most; the scientists.\n\n  Sound familiar? It should because the fossil fuel industry is using a \nplaybook perfected by the tobacco industry. Big Tobacco used that \nplaybook for decades to bury the health risks of smoking. Ultimately, \nthe truth came to light. It ended in a racketeering judgment against \nthat industry.\n\n  The Supreme Court has handed the polluters a very heavy cudgel with \nits misguided Citizens United decision, allowing corporations to \nspend--or, more importantly, to threaten to spend--unlimited amounts of \nundisclosed money in our elections. More than anyone, polluters use \nthat leverage to demand obedience to their climate denial script.\n  Jan from Portland, OR, said this kind of corruption is her top reason \nto act on climate. She said: It would be beneath our dignity to ruin \nour planet just for money.\n  Jan, I hope you are right.\n  There has been progress.\n  The Senate has held votes showing that a majority believes climate \nchange is real, not a hoax, and is driven by human activity. Republican \ncolleagues such as the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, the senior Senator from Georgia, and the senior Senator from \nSouth Carolina have made comments here recognizing the need to do \nsomething. The senior Senator from Maine has a bill on non-\nCO2 emissions against the relentless pressure of the fossil \nfuel industry and its front groups. That takes real courage.\n  The President's Climate Action Plan is ending the polluters' long \nfree ride. The administration has rolled out strong fuel and energy \nefficiency standards. Its Clean Power Plan will, for the first time, \nlimit carbon emissions from powerplants. The United States heads an \nambitious international climate effort as well, even engaging China, \nnow the world's largest producer of carbon pollution.\n  Perhaps most heartening are the American people. Eighty-three percent \nof Americans, including 6 in 10 Republicans, want action to reduce \ncarbon emissions. And with young Republican voters, more than half \nwould describe a climate-denying politician as ``ignorant,'' ``out of \ntouch'' or ``crazy.''\n  With all this, I think the prospects for comprehensive climate change \nlegislation are actually pretty good. But as Albert Einstein once said, \n``politics is more difficult than physics.'' That seems literally to be \nthe case here as Citizens United political gridlock keeps us, for now, \nfrom heeding laws of nature.\n  But when the polluters' grip slips, I will be ready with legislation \nthat many Republicans can support: a fee on carbon emissions. Pricing \ncarbon corrects the market failure that lets polluters push the cost of \nair pollution on to everybody else. A carbon fee is a market-based tool \naligned with conservative free-market values. Many Republicans, at \nleast those beyond the swing of the Citizens United fossil fuel cudgel, \nhave endorsed exactly that idea.\n  Let's have a real debate about it. It is time. I will be announcing \nmy carbon fee proposal on June 10, during an event at the American \nEnterprise Institute.\n  Climate change tests us. First, it is an environmental test--a grave \none. We will be graded in that test against the implacable laws of \nscience and nature. Pope Francis has described a conversation with a \nhumble gardener who said to him:\n\n       God always forgives. Men, women, we forgive sometimes. But, \n     Father, creation never forgives.\n\n  There are no do-overs, no mulligans--not when we mess with God's laws \nof nature.\n  Behind nature's test looms a moral test. Do we let the influence of a \nfew wealthy industries compromise other people's livelihoods, even \nother people's lives, all around the planet and off into the future? It \nis morally wrong, in greed and folly, to foist that price on all those \nothers. That is why Pope Francis is bringing his moral light to bear on \nclimate change, and to quote him: ``There is a clear, definitive and \nineluctable ethical imperative to act.'' Our human morality is being \ntested.\n  Lastly, this is a test of American democracy. All democracies face \nthe problem of how well they address not just the immediate threat but \nthe looming ones. America's democracy faces an added responsibility of \nexample, of being the city on a hill. In a world of competing \nideologies, why would we want to tarnish ours?\n  This is the top reason for Ralph from Westerly, RI. He wrote:\n\n       Someday, world leaders will look back on this time that \n     something should have been done to save the planet. . . . We \n     had the chance but let it slip through our fingers.\n\n  We have all done something wrong in our lives. Some things we do that \nare wrong don't cause much harm. But there is not an oddsmaker in Vegas \nwho would bet against climate change causing a lot of harm. And some \nthings that we do wrong we get away with. But there is no way people in \nthe world won't know why this happened when that harm hits home. There \nis no way the flag we fly so proudly won't be smudged and blotted by \nour misdeeds and oversights today.\n  Think how history regards Neville Chamberlain when he misjudged the \nhinge of history in its time. At least Chamberlain's goal was noble: \npeace, peace after the bloody massacres of World War I, peace in his \ntime. Our excuse is what--on climate change? Keeping big polluting \nspecial interests happy?\n  Anybody who is paying attention knows those special interests are \nlying. Anybody paying attention knows they are influence-peddling on a \nmonumental scale. And while the polluters have done their best to hide \nthat their denial tentacles are all part of the same denial beast, \npeople all over who are paying attention have figured it out.\n  One day, there will be a reckoning. There always is.\n  If we wake up, if we get this right, if we turn that ponderous \nbalance of destiny in our time, then it can be their reckoning, and not \nall of ours. It can be their shame, not the shame of our democracy, not \nthe shame of our beloved country, not the shame of America. As we close \nin on this weekend, on Memorial Day, we will remember those who fought \nand bled and died for this great Republic. The real prospect of failing \nand putting America to shame makes it seriously time for us to wake up.\n  Mr. President, once again, I thank my colleagues for their courtesy \nin attending this 100th speech.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of the entire Democratic caucus, I \nwish to extend my accolades, my admiration for the persistence and \nintegrity of Senator Whitehouse. This is an issue that speaks well of \nhim and our entire country, and I am very proud of the work he has done \nand will continue to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I have had the \nprivilege of serving longer in this body than any other Member of the \nSenate, currently. I can count on my one hand, or probably a few \nfingers, some of the great speeches I have heard by both Republicans \nand Democrats in this body. One great speech I will never forget was \nthat of the Senator from Rhode Island. He speaks to a subject that \nevery single Vermonter would agree with, and this veteran Senator \nthanks him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, my dear friend and colleague deserves a \ngreat moment of recognition today. We are all passionate about issues \nhere in the Senate. But very few of us take to the floor each week to \nstoke the fire on a single issue and to inspire others to action. That \nis what Senator Whitehouse has done on one of the defining issues of \nour time--climate change.\n  Today's speech is the 100th such speech he has made on the floor of \nthe Senate, pleading us to take meaningful action on climate change. It \nis the 100th time he has brought that now iconic poster to the floor. \nWe can tell it is getting a little frayed. It is getting a little \ndented. It is the 100th time many of us have paused and said: ``It's \ntime to wake up.''\n  One hundred is a significant number today for many reasons. The first \nrough calculations on the impact of\n\n[[Page S2966]]\n\nhuman carbon emissions on the climate began over 100 years ago in the \nlate 19th century. For decades we have been certain of the science \nconnecting human activity to changes in the global climate. Yet these \nincremental changes in the climate did not spur us to act. As the good \nSenator from Rhode Island just said, the years of incremental change \nare over.\n  In my home State of New York, Superstorm Sandy was a wake-up call. \nThose who for years have been telling us that a changing climate and \nrising seas are figments of the imagination had to eat their words \nafter Sandy--the third significant storm to hit New York in those 2 \nyears. Those who continue to deny the real and very tangible evidence \nof climate change are like ostriches with their heads buried in the \nsand.\n  Senator Whitehouse is right, and whether he tells us it is time to \nwake up 10 times more or another 100, until we do something, he will \ncontinue to be right. I thank him for his leadership, his persistence, \nhis eloquence, and his devotion to the cause. I hope for his sake and \nfor all of our sakes that this body takes his words to heart.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I stand here as the ranking member of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. The day Senator Whitehouse got \nelected, I knew I wanted him on that committee. I think he has shown \nthrough the weeks and months and years that what he is going to do is \nvery simple, which is to come to the floor and tell the truth to the \nAmerican people about this issue and bring the facts about this issue \nto the Senate.\n  What I think is fascinating and something he and I always look at is \nthe deniers on the other side and their latest argument, which is that \n``we are not scientists.'' Well, that is obvious. And we are not, \neither. That is the reason we listen to the scientists. There is no \nscientist who is going to say something because he feels it is going to \nbenefit him or her. They are going to tell the truth. And 98, 99 \npercent of the scientists agree that what is happening in terms of \ncarbon pollution is hurting this planet and will hurt it irreversibly \nforever. Anyone in this body who doesn't listen to this, who turns away \nfrom this will be judged by history and their Maker. But that is not \ngood enough, because it is my grandkids and the grandkids of my \ncolleagues who are going to have to deal with this.\n  I will close with this. This whole notion of ``I am not a scientist'' \nis ridiculous and it is ludicrous. If one of our Republican friends \nwent to the doctor and, God forbid, the doctor said you have a serious \ncancerous tumor and you really need to have it taken care of, they are \nnot going to look at the doctor and say: Well, I don't know, I am not a \ndoctor. You might get a second opinion. That is good. In the case of \nclimate, we have 97, 98, 99 percent of scientists agreeing on this \nproblem.\n\n  You wouldn't say to your doctor: Gee, I don't know, maybe I will let \nthis cancer go because I am not a doctor and what do I know? You have \nto rely on the people who know. And I have never seen anything like \nthis. This is the tobacco company stance, when politicians cleared the \nway and tobacco businesses stood up and raised their right hand and \nsaid that nicotine was not a problem--and we know how that story \nended--too late for a lot of people who died of cancer, too late for a \nlot of people who got hooked on cigarettes.\n  We want to make sure Sheldon Whitehouse and those of us who agree \nwith him are not going to wait too long. It is not going to be too \nlate. We can actually save our families from the devastation of the \nravages of climate change.\n  So I say to Senator Whitehouse: It takes a lot of fortitude to stand \nup here in the Chamber time after time after time, and I think what he \nhas done is make a record, which is very important because he has \nreally touched on and continues to touch on all the new information. \nThat is critical, and everyone should read it because it really does \nspell it out in very direct terms.\n  It also shows the fight that Senator Whitehouse has, the belief that \nhe has that we can win this battle. I share that view. It is because, \nas Senator Whitehouse points out, a vast majority of the American \npeople, including the vast majority of Republicans out there, think if \nyou are a denier, you are losing it--that is my vernacular. They just \ndon't believe it. They can't believe it. They think there is something \nwrong with you if you are a denier. So that is what we have in our back \npocket, and right here in the Senate we have this treasure of a person, \na Senator who will continue to fight, continue to work, and I can \nassure him, as long as I am here and even when I am not, I will be \nechoing many of the things he is saying.\n  Thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

HELENS\n\n Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, today marks the 35th anniversary \nof one of the largest and most devastating volcanic eruptions in the \nhistory of our Nation--the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. Today, \nthe people of my State continue to embrace the mountain's beauty, but \nretain a profound respect for its power given the potential for a recap \nof the 1980 eruption and the devastation that it brought.\n  On the morning of May 18, 1980, small eruptions and earthquakes \nfinally culminated in a destructive eruption that changed surrounding \ngeography and rendered the neighboring ridges void of life. David \nJohnston, a scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey was conducting \nmeasurements on the mountain. At 8:32 a.m., as an earthquake brought \nmagma to St. Helens surface, Johnston sent the now infamous radio \ntransmission: ``Vancouver, Vancouver. This is it!'' Sadly, just seconds \nlater, Johnston was engulfed by the explosion and the ensuing landslide \nthat swept laterally from the mountain at speeds as high as 670 miles \nper hour. Tragically, 57 lives were lost as a result of the eruption \nand 200 homes were destroyed along with bridges, roads, and railways in \nthe vicinity. And the blast incinerated 100-year-old trees and all \nforms of plant life within the blast zone. Estimates put the total loss \nof trees at 4 billion board feet.\n  In the 35 years since the eruption, the private sector and the \nFederal Government's approach to forestry has changed significantly. \nFollowing the eruption, Congress directed the Forest Service to embark \non a new approach to forest management. In 1982, Congress created the \nMount Saint Helens National Volcanic Monument. This 110,000 acre \ndesignation has created a kind of ``biological laboratory'' at the site \nof the eruption to let nature take its course. That foresight has \nallowed ecologists to learn that forests didn't regenerate from \nclearings the way scientists had believed for almost a century. We also \nlearned the importance of leaving behind a legacy of dead trees to \nserve as homes for birds and that patches of remnant areas existed \nwhich supported sporadic groups of live trees. The learnings from this \nnatural disaster shaped the forest policy that we see throughout much \nof Washington and the country today.\n  Now, as residents in Washington and around the country are witnessing \nunusually large forest fires--the Federal Government needs to take the \nlessons learned following the Mount St. Helens eruptions and apply them \nto this new challenge. The government needs to do its part to rapidly \nprovide the emergency services communities need after large fire and \nnatural disasters. But we also need to stabilize slopes to prevent \nmudslides through investments in seismic monitoring equipment and Light \nDetection and Ranging or LiDAR. Just as we learned in the Mount St. \nHelens experiment, a great deal of wildlife thrive in the early forest \nconditions that come after a wildfire. Those areas need to be \nconsidered as managers look at what's the best for our Federal lands. \nAnd what better place to visit that conversation, than on the National \nForest that houses the ecological record of the Mount St. Helens \neruption of 35 years ago.\n  Seismic activity in the Pacific Northwest isn't just a once in a \ngeneration event, but an ever present reality in Washington State. The \neruption of Mount St. Helens provides a clear reminder of the value of \nearly earthquake monitoring and warning systems. The Pacific Northwest \nSeismic Network offers early warning systems and comprehensive seismic \nmonitoring that can warn communities up to a minute before an \nearthquake occurs, or even future volcanic eruptions. With constant \nseismic activity throughout much of Washington State, including at \nvolcanos such as Glacier Peak in the Cascades, we must continue to make \nthe vital investments in these early warning systems.\n  I look forward to taking lessons learned on Mount St. Helens and \napplying them to a new approach to forest policy. I have also called \nfor us as legislators and constituents to begin a conversation around \nwhat we want our national forests to look like over the next 50 years. \nWhat is working well, and what problems we do not want to see as we \nthink about our 21st century vision for our national forests.\n  As we reflect today on the tragic and watershed event that happened \non Mount St. Helens 35 years ago, we must work to put our forests on a \nlong-term track to successfully delivering the things we expect from \nthem--quality recreation, clean water, clean air, wildlife habitat, and \na sustainable supply of wood products.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/18/senate-section/article/S2968-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2968-S2969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO WALTON GRESHAM\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to commend Walton \nGresham of Indianola, MS, for his service and\n\n[[Page S2969]]\n\ncontributions to the State of Mississippi while serving as the 79th \npresident of the Delta Council. This important organization was formed \nin 1935 and has grown into a widely respected economic development \ngroup representing the business, professional, and agricultural \ninterests of the Mississippi Delta. I am grateful to Delta Council for \nits continuous role in meeting the economic and quality of life \nchallenges in this unique part of our country.\n  Walton Gresham's tenure as council president began soon after \nCongress enacted the Agricultural Act of 2014, and his effective \nleadership has helped Mississippi producers adapt to the new federal \nagriculture policies established by this new farm bill. Mr. Gresham has \nbeen an active leader on transportation issues in our State, and he is \nconstructively engaged as Congress prepares to consider legislation to \nreauthorize Federal spending on highway and public transportation \nprograms that are vitally important to the Mississippi Delta and its \nfuture. Mr. Gresham's dedication to confronting health care disparities \nand higher education needs in our State should also be commended. \nThrough its work with Delta Council, Mr. Gresham's family has improved \nMississippi's workforce training and readiness.\n  In addition to his role as president of Delta Council, Mr. Gresham \nhas been active in the Mississippi Propane Gas Association, the \nNational Propane Gas Association, the Petroleum Marketers Association \nof America, the Mississippi Petroleum Marketers and Convenience Stores \nAssociation, and the Mississippi Economic Council. He serves on the \nboard of directors of Planters Bank, Propane Energy Group, Delta \nTerminal, Gresham-McPherson Oil Company, DoubleQuick, and Indianola \nInsurance Agency. He is a past president of the Indianola Rotary Club \nand Indianola Country Club.\n  Walton Gresham is a respected businessman and his performance as \npresident of Delta Council will complement his well-earned reputation \nfor unselfish service to improve the quality of life for those who live \nand do business in the Mississippi Delta region. His dedication to the \nfuture of the delta and all of those who live there is sincere. I am \npleased to join the people of my State in commending Walton Gresham and \nsharing our appreciation with his wife Laura and their children Lenore \nand Elizabeth as they prepare for the 80th annual meeting of the Delta \nCouncil organizational membership, at which time, he will reflect on \nhis successful tenure before passing the torch to a new \npresident.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/18/senate-section/article/S2969-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONGRATULATING TIM WILSON\n\n Mr. KING. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Mr. \nTimothy P. Wilson on receiving the Gerda Haas Award for Excellence in \nHuman Rights Education and Leadership from the Holocaust and Human \nRights Center of Maine.\n  The Gerda Haas Award recognizes and honors individuals who \ndemonstrate excellence and initiative in human rights education and \nleadership. In the late 1970s, Gerda Haas was appointed to the Maine \nState School Board of Education and while serving on the board learned \nthat students were not being taught about the Holocaust in Maine \nschools. Gerda identified this critical educational void and took \naction to remedy it, establishing the Holocaust and Human Rights Center \nof Maine with the goal of combating prejudice and discrimination while \nencouraging individuals to reflect and act upon their ethical and moral \nresponsibilities in the modern world.\n  Tim Wilson certainly lives up to this philosophy. Over the course of \nhis vibrant life as a teacher, coach, philanthropist, consultant, \ngovernment official, husband, father, and grandfather, Tim has \ndedicated his time to serving others both at home in Maine and in the \ninternational community.\n  After graduating from Slippery Rock University and the University of \nWashington, where he was certified to teach English as a second \nlanguage, Tim served in the Peace Corps in Thailand from 1962 to 1965. \nWhen he returned to the U.S., Tim took over as the head coach of the \nDexter High School football team leading them to two Class C co-state \nchampionships and two Little Ten Conference titles. Over the course of \nhis coaching career Tim has been a mentor to hundreds, if not thousands \nof students throughout Maine advocating education and sportsmanship.\n  One of Tim's greatest legacies is his work with Seeds of Peace. This \nstudent exchange program is focused on bringing young people from \nconflict zones around the world together in order to build lasting \nrelationships and develop the skills needed to advance peace. In the \nprogram's first year, Tim managed the International Camp in Otisfield, \nME where a group of 46 Israeli, Palestinian, Egyptian, and American \nteenagers attended the camp for the inaugural season. As Seeds of Peace \ngrew to accommodate over 100 students every year, Tim worked as \ndirector of both the Seeds of Peace International Camp in Maine and the \nSeeds of Peace Center for Coexistence in Jerusalem. Currently, Tim \nserves as a special international advisor to Seeds of Peace which has \ngenerated over 5,000 international alumni and which continues to help \nyoung people work towards peace in international conflict areas.\n  Tim Wilson has worked under four Maine Governors, including myself. \nHe has served in posts such as chair of the Maine Human Rights \nCommission, State ombudsman, and associate commissioner of programming \nfor the Department of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and \nCorrections. He served as director of the State Offices of Energy, \nCommunity Services, and Civil Emergency Preparedness. He has also been \nthe director of admissions at Maine Central Institute in Pittsfield, \nthe associate headmaster at the Hyde School in Bath, ME, and the annual \nkey note speaker at Dirigo Girls State.\n  In 1997, the late King Hussein of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan \npresented Tim with a Medal of Honor. Seeds of Peace has recognized his \nefforts with a Distinguished Leadership Award and the Maine Youth \nCamping Association honored him with the Halsey Gulick Award. Tim has \nalso been honored with the Distinguished American Award by the Maine \nChapter of the National Football Foundation. Most recently, Tim \nreceived the Franklin H. Williams Award which recognizes ethnically \ndiverse returned Peace Corps Volunteers who exemplify a commitment to \ncommunity service and the Peace Corps' goal of promoting a cultural \nawareness among Americans.\n  Tim Wilson has devoted his life to promoting peace and understanding, \nto educating young people, and to empowering them to make their \ncommunities--and the world--a better place. I can think of no one more \ndeserving of the Gerda Haas Award. Tim has led a career dedicated to \nteaching the next generation of young people and he has done a truly \nspectacular job of preparing them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/18/senate-section/article/S2969-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2969-S2970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JERRY DUNFEY\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I wish to extend my best wishes \nto Jerry Dunfey on his 80th birthday this Saturday and to salute his \nlifetime of remarkable achievements as a business leader and political \nactivist.\n  Jerry is one of 12 siblings born to Catharine and Leroy Dunfey, who \nemigrated from Ireland, worked in the textile mills of Lowell, MA, and \nlater opened a small clam stand in Hampton, NH. In the years since, the \nDunfeys have gone on to become one of the grand families of Granite \nState business and politics.\n  As a teenager, Jerry went to work managing Dunfey's Restaurant at \nHampton Beach and then made his way through the University of New \nHampshire by working at the family's restaurant in Durham. He and his \nbrothers went on to operate other restaurants, acquired small inns \nacross New England, and founded Dunfey Hotels, which under subsequent \nowners became Omni Hotels.\n  In 1968, they purchased the historic Parker House hotel in Boston, \nwhere they found the archives of the 19th century Saturday Club salon, \nwhich included Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and \nOliver Wendell Holmes. Jerry Dunfey reincarnated this famous club by \nfounding what would become known as the Global Citizens Circle. Since \n1974, the circle has brought together elected officials, activists, and \nordinary citizens to debate leading issues, advocate for civil\n\n[[Page S2970]]\n\nrights, and promote peaceful change in South Africa, Northern Ireland, \nand across the globe. Under auspices of the circle, Jerry has brought \nto New Hampshire speakers ranging from Archbishop Desmond Tutu to \nAmbassador Andrew Young to Arn Chorn-Pond, a survivor of the Cambodian \nkilling fields. Hundreds of circle forums have been convened in \nBelfast, Soweto, Jerusalem, Havana, and in cities across the United \nStates.\n  Jerry and his wife Nadine Hack have a long history of engagement in \nthe U.S. civil rights movement, including a close friendship with the \nfamily of Martin Luther King, Jr. They both served on the board of the \nMartin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, read a \npsalm at Coretta Scott King's private family funeral, and were honorary \npall bearers at her larger public funeral. They also have close ties \nwith leaders of South Africa's liberation movement and were guests of \nstate at Nelson Mandela's inauguration as President in 1994.\n  For more than six decades, the large Dunfey and Kennedy families have \nbeen closely intertwined in both friendship and politics--though Ted \nKennedy used to joke that, when it came to children, ``the Dunfeys are \nsize 12 but the Kennedys are only size 9.'' Jerry was close friends \nwith John, Bobby, and Ted Kennedy, dating back to the 1950s, and John \nannounced for the Presidency in 1960 at a Dunfey hotel in Manchester. \nIn 2009, Jerry and Nadine had the singular honor of sitting in the \nfinal hour of vigil by Ted Kennedy's casket at the JFK Presidential \nLibrary.\n  Jerry Dunfey's activism in progressive politics has continued \nstrongly into the second decade of the 21st century. He and Nadine have \nhad five children and six grandchildren, and they are especially proud \nthat all three generations of their family actively campaigned for \nPresident Barack Obama. Now on the cusp of his ninth decade, Jerry is \nretired but far from retiring.\n  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said, ``Life's most persistent and \nurgent question is: What are you doing for others?'' Across a lifetime \nin public life, Jerry Dunfey has answered that question in powerful \nways: fighting for civil rights, advancing the cause of social and \neconomic justice here at home, and promoting peace and reconciliation \nacross the globe. I congratulate Jerry on his 80th birthday and send my \nbest wishes to Nadine, their children and grandchildren, and the entire \nDunfey clan. They have contributed so much to the civic life of our \nState and our country. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/18/senate-section/article/S2970-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR. NICHOLAS WOLTER\n\n Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a \nMontanan whose life's work is helping to improve the health of folks in \nmy home State and across this country.\n  As a board-certified physician in internal medicine and pulmonary \nmedicine, Dr. Nicholas Wolter has been dedicated to improving the \nhealth of folks in Montana for several decades. His distinguished \ncareer in Montana began more than 30 years ago at the Billings Clinic, \nwhere he now serves as the chief executive officer. Under his \nleadership, the Billings Clinic has become the largest health care \norganization in Montana, with more than 3,700 employees, including 350 \nphysicians and 400 inpatient nurses. Dr. Wolter is known for his \ncommitment to the people of Billings, and under his direction the \nclinic has provided more charity care than any other health care \norganization in the State and has gained a reputation nationally as a \nleader in patient safety, quality, and service.\n  For the past decade, Dr. Wolter has been one of the most influential \nvoices on Capitol Hill in helping to reform our fragmented health care \ndelivery system and championing the medical-group delivery model. His \nsuccesses can be seen in several pieces of legislation, including the \nAffordable Care Act, and have improved care for countless numbers of \npatients. Dr. Wolter's close partnership with our former colleague, \nSenator Max Baucus, resulted in Montana serving as a model for the rest \nof the Nation on how best to deliver care in the most rural parts of \nthis Nation.\n  Dr. Wolter is a former member of the board of directors of the \nAmerican Medical Group Association and the American Hospital \nAssociation. He served two terms as a Commissioner on the Medicare \nPayment Advisory Commission, advising Congress on how to improve care \nand reduce costs in the health care system. Dr. Wolter was recognized \nby the Medical Group Management Association in 2004 as the Physician \nExecutive of the Year and was named by Modern Healthcare as one of the \n100 Most Influential People in Health Care in 2010 and 2011, and by \nModern Physicians as one of the 50 Most Influential Physicians in \nHealth Care in 2011.\n  Dr. Wolter has been a tireless advocate in improving our health care \nsystem and today I am delighted to recognize him as he is being entered \ninto the American Medical Group Association's Policy Hall of \nFame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/18/senate-section/article/S2970-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/18/senate-section/article/S2970-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2970-S2971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \n  ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13047 OF MAY 20, 1997, WITH \nRESPECT TO BURMA, RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE ON MAY 15, \n                              2015--PM 17\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have \nsent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice \nstating that the national emergency with respect to Burma that was \ndeclared on May 20, 1997, is to continue in effect beyond May 20, 2015. \nThe Government of Burma has made significant progress across a number \nof important areas, including the release of over 1,300 political \nprisoners, continued progress toward a nationwide cease-fire, the \ndischarge of hundreds of child soldiers from the military, steps to \nimprove labor standards, and expanding political space for civil \nsociety to have a greater voice in shaping issues critical to Burma's \nfuture. In addition, Burma has become a signatory of the International \nAtomic Energy Agency's Additional Protocol and ratified the Biological \nWeapons Convention, significant steps towards supporting global \nnonproliferation. Despite these strides, the situation in the country \ncontinues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national \nsecurity and foreign policy of the United States.\n  Concerns persist regarding the ongoing conflict and human rights \nabuses in the country, particularly in ethnic minority areas and \nRakhine State. In addition, Burma's military operates with little \noversight from the civilian government and often acts with impunity. \nFor these reasons, I have determined that it is necessary to continue \nthe national emergency with respect to Burma.\n  Despite this action, the United States remains committed to \nsupporting and strengthening Burma's reform efforts and to continue \nworking both with the Burmese government and people to ensure that the \ndemocratic transition is sustained and irreversible.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \n                                         The White House, May 15, 2015.\n\n[[Page S2971]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/18/senate-section/article/S2971-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 6, 2015, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on May 15, 2015, during the adjournment of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the House agrees to the amendment of the Senate to the \nbill (H.R. 1191) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to ensure \nthat emergency services volunteers are not taken into account as \nemployees under the shared responsibility requirements contained in the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and agrees to the amendment \nof the Senate to the title of the bill.\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate on January 6, 2015, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on May 15, 2015, during the adjournment of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 606.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nand improve the Indian coal production tax credit; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this year marks the 10-year anniversary of \nthe Indian coal production tax credit. This is a crucial tax incentive \nthat levels the playing field for the future development of tribal coal \nresources that are currently subject to more regulatory requirements \nthan comparable development on private, State or Federal land. The \ncredit protects the economic viability of existing tribal coal mining \nprojects which support much needed tribal jobs and provide a major \nsource of non-Federal revenue for coal-producing tribes.\n  Over the past 10 years, the Indian production coal tax credit has \nproven to be an essential tool in the work of Montana tribes to achieve \nself-sufficiency, increase economic opportunity, and create good-paying \njobs for tribal members. It also has had a significant impact on \nMontana's economy as a whole.\n  In fact, in the State of Montana, the Crow tribe relies on coal \nproduction for good-paying jobs and as much as two-thirds of the Crow \nNation's annual non-Federal budget, partially funding Crow elder \nprograms, higher education for tribal youth, and other essential \nservices for the Crow's 13,000 enrolled members.\n  Current unemployment on the Crow reservation is 47 percent. It would \nbe over 80 percent if it weren't for the coal jobs. In fact, just last \nmonth, I chaired the first ever energy and jobs Senate field hearing on \nthe Crow reservation back in Montana. I heard firsthand how the tax \ncredit is creating economic opportunities for members of the Crow \ntribe. Yet the current nature of annual reauthorization has resulted in \nunnecessary uncertainty.\n  The Crow tribe, as well as all who rely on the Indian coal production \ntax credit, deserve a long-term solution that provides them with the \nsupport and certainty they desperately need. In fact, at last month's \nhearing, Crow chairman Darrin Old Coyote testified, ``There are a few \nfederal tax incentives that encourage investment and development in \nIndian country, but their utility is diminished by their short-term \nnature.''\n  For those who have spent time on the Crow reservation and throughout \nSoutheastern Montana, the economic benefits are most evident. The \nIndian coal production tax credit has served as a catalyst for creating \njobs and fostering tribal self-determination.\n  In fact, the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development \nrecently published a study of preliminary findings which analyzed the \neconomic effects of this tax provision. The study found that the Indian \ncoal production tax credit contributed 1,600 jobs across Montana and \ngenerated $107 million in royalties and tax revenue for the Crow tribe \nin 2013 alone. In addition, the tax credit stimulates $95 million in \nwages for the State of Montana. The Indian coal production tax credit, \nwhich expired at the end of 2014 after a 1-year extension, continues to \nserve the Crow tribe as an effective mechanism for economic \ndevelopment. However, it is a constant source of angst due to \nCongress's unwillingness to adopt an extension of this provision.\n  The benefits of this tax credit are evident on tribal lands, \nespecially in Montana. In fact, displayed prominently in my Washington, \nDC, office is a note from Crow chairman Old Coyote's daughter Evelyn. I \nhave it framed in my office. She wrote: ``Please keep the coal tax \ncredit going to help me and other Crow kids have a brighter future.''\n  A permanent extension provides much needed certainty to invest in \nlarge-scale energy production projects and provides a path forward for \nthe long-term prosperity of our tribal nations.\n  Today, I am introducing much needed legislation that addresses the \nproblem and gives our tribes certainty. I appreciate my colleague \nMontana Senator Jon Tester for joining me in this important effort. I \nwish to thank Montana Representative Ryan Zinke for introducing a \ncompanion bill in the House of Representatives. I also wish to thank \nthe bipartisan Senate team that includes Senators Barrasso, Moran, and \nHeitkamp for sponsoring this bill. Together, we will continue to \nadvance this legislation for the betterment of Native American tribes.\n  While there is still more to be done to better serve our tribes, the \npermanent extension of the Indian coal production tax credit is a good \nstart. I believe this vital piece of legislation will continue to bring \nmore good-paying jobs to Montana and to our Nation, and I strongly urge \nmy colleagues in the Senate to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/18/senate-section/article/S2973-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2973-S2976]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1249.

DETERRING LABOR SLOWDOWNS.\n\n       (a) Amendments to the National Labor Relations Act.--The \n     National Labor Relations Act is amended--\n       (1) in section 1 (29 U.S.C. 151), by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``International trade is one of the most important \n     components of the economy of the United States and will \n     likely continue to grow in the future. In order to remain \n     competitive in an increasingly competitive global economy, it \n     is essential that the United States possess a highly \n     efficient and reliable public and private transportation \n     network. The ports of the United States are an increasingly \n     important part of such transportation network. Experience has \n     demonstrated that frequent and periodic disruptions to \n     commerce in the maritime industry in the form of deliberate \n     and unprotected labor slowdowns at the ports of the United \n     States have led to substantial and frequent economic \n     disruption and loss, interfering with the free flow of \n     domestic and international commerce and threatening the \n     economic health of the United States, as well as its citizens \n     and businesses. Such frequent and periodic disruptions to \n     commerce in the maritime industry hurt the reputation of the \n     United States in the global economy, cause the ports of the \n     United States to lose business, and represent a serious and \n     burgeoning threat to the financial health and economic \n     stability of the United States. It is hereby declared to be \n     the policy of the United States to eliminate the causes and \n     mitigate the effects of such disruptions to commerce in the \n     maritime industry and to provide effective and prompt \n     remedies to individuals injured by such disruptions.'';\n       (2) in section 2 (29 U.S.C. 152), by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(15) The term `employee engaged in maritime employment' \n     has the meaning given the term `employee' in section 2(3) of \n     the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (33 U.S.C. \n     902(3)).\n       ``(16) The term `labor slowdown'--\n       ``(A) includes any intentional effort by employees to \n     reduce productivity or efficiency in the performance of any \n     duty of such employees; and\n       ``(B) does not include any such effort required by the good \n     faith belief of such employees that an abnormally dangerous \n     condition exists at the place of employment of such \n     employees.'';\n       (3) in section 8(b) (29 U.S.C. 158(b)), by adding at the \n     end the following:\n       ``(8) in representing, or seeking to represent, employees \n     engaged in maritime employment, to engage in a labor slowdown \n     at any time, including when a collective-bargaining agreement \n     is in effect.'';\n       (4) in section 9 (29 U.S.C. 159), by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(f) Effect of Labor Slowdowns.--If a labor organization \n     has been found, pursuant to a final order of the Board, to \n     have violated section 8(b)(8), the Board shall--\n       ``(1) revoke the exclusive recognition or certification of \n     the labor organization, which shall immediately cease to be \n     entitled to represent the employees in the bargaining unit of \n     such labor organization; or\n       ``(2) take other appropriate disciplinary action.''; and\n       (5) in section 10(l) (29 U.S.C. 160(l)), in the first \n     sentence, by striking ``or section 8(b)(7)'' and inserting \n     ``or paragraph (7) or (8) of section 8(b)''.\n       (b) Amendment to the Labor Management Relations Act, \n     1947.--Section 303 of the Labor Management Relations Act, \n     1947 (29 U.S.C. 187) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``in section 8(b)(4)'' \n     and inserting ``under paragraph (4) or (8) of section 8(b)'';\n       (2) in subsection (b), by inserting ``, including \n     reasonable attorney fees for a violation under section \n     8(b)(8) of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. \n     158(b)(8))'' before the period; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(c) In an action for damages resulting from a violation \n     of section 8(b)(8) of the National Labor Relations Act (29 \n     U.S.C. 158(b)(8)), it shall not be a defense that the injured \n     party has, in any manner, waived, or purported to waive, the \n     right of such party to pursue monetary damages relating to \n     the labor slowdown at issue--\n       ``(1) in connection with a contractual grievance alleging a \n     violation of a clause prohibiting a strike, or a similar \n     clause, in a collective-bargaining agreement; or\n       ``(2) in connection with an action for a breach of such a \n     clause under section 301.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1343.

Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer for \nallowing me to speak briefly about an amendment I am offering to the \ntrade promotion authority legislation.\n  Also, I was not here earlier because I was unavoidably detained. I \nwas on a flight to arrive at National Airport, and because of \nthunderstorms, they diverted us to Richmond, VA, where I spent about an \nhour this evening.\n  If I had been here, I would have voted yes on both the trade \nadjustment assistance legislation and also the religious freedom \nlegislation that came before this Chamber earlier this evening.\n  Again, I appreciate the opportunity to speak now about an amendment I \nam offering to the underlying legislation, the trade promotion \nauthority.\n  This amendment is regarding currency manipulation, something we have \ntalked a lot about in this Chamber over the last week. Now is the \nopportunity for us to speak with our votes on behalf of the people we \nrepresent, who believe that, yes, we should be trading with other \ncountries. In fact, I strongly believe that we should be expanding our \nexports and, therefore, I support trade-opening agreements that could \nbe negotiated under a trade promotion authority.\n  But I also believe that we need to level the playing field, so that \nwhile we are expanding trade and increasing our exports and therefore \ncreating more jobs in my home State of Ohio and around the country, at \nthe same time, we are able to tell those workers and farmers that other \ncountries are going to be required to play by the rules.\n  There are lots of issues that get addressed here in this Chamber \nregarding leveling that playing field. One is to ensure that countries \ndon't dump their products here in the United States, and we have \nlanguage in the Customs bill that deals with that, to ensure that \ncompanies can indeed seek a remedy and seek help for that.\n  We also talk about subsidized products that come to the United \nStates, to our shores, to compete unfairly. We have legislation to \naddress that as well.\n  But there are other issues that need to be addressed to ensure that, \nagain, countries are playing by the rules. One is currency \nmanipulation.\n  We are in the process now of giving our government the ability to \nnegotiate an agreement that could lower tariffs and nontariff barriers \nto our products, and that is a good thing, whether it is the agreement \nwith Asia, the so-called TPP Agreement, or the agreement in Europe, the \nso-called TTIP Agreement and others.\n  But the reality is that we are also in a situation where, regardless \nof what agreements we negotiated, many of the benefits of those \nreductions in tariffs or nontariff barriers could immediately be \ncountered by another country saying: Do you know what? I am going to \nintervene aggressively in international currency markets to lower the \nprice, to lower the cost of my currency, so that my exports, \nspecifically to United States, will be less expensive. And, by the way, \nit also affects other countries in the meantime. So relative to the \ndollar, their currency is lower, so, therefore, their exports are less \nexpensive to us, and our exports to them are more expensive.\n  When I walk the shop floors in Ohio and I talk to workers and I talk \nto management about how this affects us in Ohio, what I hear very \ndirectly is: Rob, we are all for trade. We believe we can compete. But \nwe need to be able to compete on a playing field where everybody is \nagreeing that there will be certain rules of the road.\n  There are rules of the road. The amendment that we are offering, \ndespite what some people have been saying about it and what I have seen \nwritten even today, which is inaccurate--the rules of the road are \nactually set up by the International Monetary Fund and by the World \nTrade Organization, by reference to the IMF.\n  As an example, every single country we are negotiating with right now \nwith regard to Trans-Pacific Partnership--the so-called TPP--is a \nsignatory to this International Monetary Fund and to the WTO. \nTherefore, they are obliged to live with these rules.\n  Our amendment is very simple. All it says is that these rules apply \njust as they are currently provided for by the International Monetary \nFund, and that countries, when they are negotiating with us in a trade \nagreement, need to be consistent with those obligations that they have \nundertaken and that there is an enforceability measure. In other words, \nif they don't do it, there will be some consequences. Right now, there \nis no enforcement penalty. This is one reason we continue to see in \nsome cases currency manipulation, which in turn, again, hurts our \nworkers and our farmers, who just want the chance to be able to \ncompete--and compete fairly.\n  I would also say there has been some misinformation about this \namendment out there regarding whether it would affect monetary policy. \nWe will see under this amendment that we have clarified that--not that \nit was ever a question in my mind or of others who drafted it. We \nclarified that to the extent that we have actually said: This does not \napply to monetary policy. It doesn't apply to macroeconomic policy, \ndecisions that countries make.\n  Instead, again, it takes the very specific undertakings that the IMF \nhas established for all these countries, which says: You cannot \nintervene in purchasing other currencies and doing so in a way to \nexpand your exports unfairly.\n  So I think this is a very important debate we are having with regard \nto trade promotion authority. We need to get back in the business of \nexpanding trade for our workers and our farmers.\n  The Presiding Officer's wheat farmers in Montana are looking forward \nto a chance to get into some of these markets where they have been \nessentially\n\n[[Page S3007]]\n\nclosed out because other countries have completed trade agreements \nlowering tariffs and we have not. So this will be good for the \nPresiding Officer's farmers and for the farmers in Ohio. One in every \nthree acres they plant is now planted for export. It will be good for \nour soybean farmers in Ohio, as 50 percent of their crop is exported. \nIt will be good for the workers of Ohio, as 25 percent of our \nmanufacturing jobs are now export jobs.\n  But we are losing ground because over the last 7 years, we haven't \nbeen able to knock down these barriers because we haven't had this \ntrade promotion authority, which is necessary in order to create the \nopportunity for us to export more.\n  Again, while we are doing that and using the leverage of our market \nhere in the United States of America, the largest economy, we must also \nbe sure that we are dealing with dumping, with subsidization, and, yes, \nwith currency manipulation and other aspects of trade that simply \naren't fair.\n  Recently, I received a letter signed by thousands of Ohio auto \nworkers, and they called currency manipulation ``the most critical \nbarrier in the 21st century.'' They get it. These are workers who work \nat the transmission plant in Sharonville, OH, but I see this all over \nOhio. More than 1,500 UAW workers will soon manufacture Ford's medium-\nduty truck in Avon Lake, OH. We are really excited about that. This is \nactually production that was moved from Mexico to the United States.\n  This is what they told me: We want to be able to compete. We want to \nbe able to keep our jobs here at Avon Lake, OH.\n  They said: Currency manipulation hurts American competitiveness here \nat home and export markets where we compete around the world.\n  This assembly plant's mission is to provide our customers with the \nhighest quality, and the safest, most reliable automotive products and \nservices, while also fostering continuous growth and prosperity for our \nfamilies and the surrounding communities. That is why they say that we \nmust ensure that trade policies do not undermine this progress in the \nU.S. auto industry and in U.S. manufacturing.\n  By the way, this letter was jointly signed not just by UAW members \nbut also by the plant manager and other members of management at this \ncompany. Why? Because they get it. If they are working hard, making \nconcessions, becoming more efficient to be more competitive, they are \nwilling to do it. They know they have to. They get it. We are an \ninternational marketplace now. There is global competition. But they \nwant to be darn sure that they aren't having an unfair advantage \nweighed against them because another government, as they say, cheated \non their currency.\n  Given what we are hearing from these American workers, I have \nintroduced this bipartisan amendment with Senator Stabenow, cracking \ndown on currency manipulation. I have been on the floor a number of \ntimes to talk about this. I want to be sure that we have the \nopportunity to be able to move forward with this amendment. We also \nhave a number of other cosponsors, including Senators Burr, Brown, \nGraham, Casey, Collins, Schumer, Shaheen, Heitkamp, Baldwin, Klobuchar, \nManchin, Warren, and Donnelly.\n  We are pleased that our work here is backed up--yes--by the auto \ncompanies, including GM, Chrysler, Ford, but also by U.S. Steel, Nucor \nSteel, AK Steel, and others. This very idea of enforceable currency \ndisciplines in trade has been backed up again and again. It has been \nendorsed by 60 Senators on the floor of the Senate through either votes \nor letters that they have signed and by 230 Members of the House.\n  Again, what it does is it gives teeth to the existing IMF and WTO \nrules against currency manipulation.\n  Some have said: Well, this is kind of a stretch. Why are we dealing \nwith currency manipulation in this legislation? Let me remind them that \nthe TPA bill being considered today--the one without this amendment in \nit, the one that was offered by Chairman Hatch, my friend Orrin Hatch, \nand supported by Treasury Secretary Jack Lew--so the administration--\nincludes a negotiating objective to address currency concerns.\n  So this notion that we shouldn't have this involved in the trade \nagreement--it is in the underlying TPA. The problem is it is not \nenforceable. So we say that we agree that currency manipulation is a \nbad thing because it distorts trade and it distorts free markets.\n  I am a conservative. I believe we shouldn't be encouraging \ndistortion.\n  The difference between the negotiating objective in the bill and the \none I am proposing is that ours is actually enforceable. It gives us \nthe opportunity to actually make a difference in this debate, to be \nable to ensure that countries do indeed abide by the rules they have \npromised to follow as members of the International Monetary Fund.\n  Some have said this is a poison pill for trade. I don't quite get \nthat. Again, trade promotion authority already includes currency \nmanipulation. The question is whether it should be enforceable. If we \nbelieve, as we say we do, that this is wrong, why wouldn't we want to \nhave some ability to enforce it?\n  As I said earlier, this legislation specifically excludes domestic \nmonetary policy. It is now in the text of the amendment itself, which \nis different than it was in committee.\n  So I very much appreciate being allowed to speak on this tonight. I \nappreciate the opportunity for me to offer this amendment that I have \ndrafted with Senators Stabenow and others. I look forward to talking \nmore about this issue later this week. I do believe it is important \nthat we move forward on providing the opportunity for the workers I \nrepresent, the farmers I represent, and the service providers in Ohio \nto expand their exports. It creates not just more jobs but good-paying \njobs. On average, those jobs pay 15 to 18 percent more--and better \nbenefits. That is important. America needs to get back in the business \nof expanding exports. For 7 years we haven't had that and other \ncountries have, through hundreds of trade agreements that left us out \nand lowered the barriers between their countries. That hurts us. We \nwant that market share. We don't want to lose it.\n  But, again, as we do that, let's be darned sure that we are giving \nour workers and our farmers a fair shake so they have the opportunity. \nIf they play by the rules and they work hard, they become more \nefficient, they make the concessions, and they know this is going to be \nsomething where they have the opportunity to excel, to compete, and \nultimately to help create jobs and opportunity here in this country.\n  Just as we are encouraging other countries to take on our free \nenterprise system and our values we hold so dear, we should also \nencourage them to take on these rules of fairness, including \nprohibiting the manipulation of currency that is explicitly directed at \nincreasing our costs and decreasing their costs as they send exports to \nus.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to speak tonight.\n\n\n                            Vote Explanation\n\n  I would reiterate that I support the Brown amendment No. 1242. I was \nnot able to be here for the vote because I was unavoidably detained and \nwas diverted from National Airport.\n  I also want to say that I support the Lankford amendment No. 1237, \nagain, regarding the religious freedoms and making that a part of trade \nnegotiation objectives as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/18/senate-section/article/S3007-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
