Mr. President, by now, many know the numbers. Overdose \ndeaths in Kentucky were responsible for more than 1,000 deaths in 2014 \nalone. This is a devastatingly high number, among the highest rates in \nthe Nation, but it is even more heartbreaking when you consider the \nreal-world toll substance abuse can take on friends and family members, \nnot to mention their children.\n  The trickle-down effects of opioid and heroin abuse are palpable and \nwidespread, lasting and cyclical, but there are steps we can take today \nto help families impacted by drug abuse and keep more families from \never going through it to begin with. That is why I am proud to join my \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Iowa, in introducing the Protecting \nFamilies Affected by Substance Abuse Act, which would reauthorize \ngrants to help children in foster care or at risk of being placed there \nbecause of their parents' drug habits. This is what one Kentucky group \nsaid about their experience with these grants:\n\n       The Regional Partnership Grants have been integral to the \n     implementation of Kentucky-START, which has helped more than \n     800 Kentucky families and more than 1,600 Kentucky children. \n     It's programs like these, which focus on better outcomes for \n     children and safely reuniting families, that are helping \n     combat the negative effects of the opioid, heroin, and other \n     drug epidemics facing the Commonwealth.\n\n  I am also proud of the work that is being done in the Commonwealth to \naddress the opioid crisis, particularly in rural communities. For \ninstance, the Appalachia High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Program, \nHIDTA, was recently recognized by Director Botticelli and the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy as the top program of its type for 2015. I \nrecognize all they have done in the fight against drug trafficking and \nillegal drug use. I have no doubt that without their efforts and those \nof the other leaders in the Commonwealth, the toll of the epidemic \nwould be much greater than it already is.\n  So whether it is working to support the local HIDTAs or working \ntogether with the senior Senator from Iowa and me to pass our \nlegislation to reauthorize grants for local communities, there are many \nopportunities for Senators to help ensure we respond to the drug \nepidemic wreaking havoc on our communities at home. For example, there \nare a number of other important pieces of related legislation in the \nSenate.\n  This week Senators discussed one of these bills in the Finance \nCommittee. It would allow Medicare Advantage and Part D plans to \nimplement a prescription drug abuse prevention tool similar to what is \nalready available and used in Kentucky in the Medicaid Program and in \nprivate plans. I was proud to join the junior Senator from Pennsylvania \nas a cosponsor of that bill as well.\n  Of course, there is the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, \nCARA. The junior Senators from Ohio and New Hampshire have been leading \nthe charge on that effort, and I thank the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Grassley, and the chairman of the HELP Committee, \nSenator Alexander, for working together to have the bill reported out \nof Judiciary, and it came out of the Judiciary Committee on a voice \nvote.\n  In the coming days we will be working to move that important \nbipartisan bill forward. It has garnered a great deal of support from \nboth sides of the aisle because of its provisions to expand prevention \nand educational efforts, strengthen prescription drug-monitoring \nprograms, improve treatment programs, and give law enforcement \nofficials more of the tools it needs to address this awful epidemic.\n  With bipartisan support, we can pass legislation such as CARA and the \nothers I have discussed today in order to promote healthier families \nand a healthier country.\n\n[[Page S1018]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/senate-section/article/S1018-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                     CONFIRMATION OF ROBERT CALIFF\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I start with a statement the Republican \nleader made on the Senate floor in 2007: ``I will never agree to \nretreat from our responsibility to confirm qualified judicial \nnominees.''\n  I wish to repeat: ``I will never agree to retreat from our \nresponsibility to confirm qualified judicial nominees.''\n  My Republican counterpart said that. They are his own words.\n  Fast forward 9 years to today, now. Not only is the senior Senator \nfrom Kentucky abandoning his responsibility to confirm a Supreme Court \nJustice, he is leading the entire Republican caucus to retreat from \ntheir constitutional obligation. This is unfortunate because the \nRepublican leader was right 9 years ago. As Senators, we have a \nresponsibility to uphold a number of things, but one certainly is the \nConstitution. That responsibility is clearly outlined in the oath we \ntake before we are sworn into office--right there. Every one of them \nhas done it. What are we asked to confirm, to swear to? We swear to \n``support and defend the Constitution of the United States.'' We swear \nto ``bear true faith and allegiance to the same.'' We swear to \n``faithfully discharge the duties of office.'' I wish to repeat that. \nWe swear to ``faithfully discharge the duties of office.''\n  One cannot see how Republicans can claim to uphold this oath as they \nblock the President from appointing a new Supreme Court Justice. Senate \nRepublicans are making pledges of a different sort these days. They \nhave vowed to not hold hearings--even though denying a hearings is \nunprecedented in history. They have sworn not to meet with the \nPresident--I am sorry, with his nominee and maybe even him. He has been \nwaiting for word from the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the \nRepublican leader to find out if they are willing to come and meet with \nhim in the White House. That has been going on for several days now. \nThey have sworn not to meet with the President's Supreme Court nominee, \neven though they don't know who that person might be. By refusing to \nhold confirmation hearings for President Obama's Supreme Court nominee \nor to hold a vote, they undermine the Presidency, the Constitution, and \nthe Senate.\n  Senate Republicans are known--and have been for some time now--as a \nset of human brake pads, obstructing, filibustering virtually \neverything President Obama has had on his agenda, but this raises \nobstruction to a new level never seen before in this country--the \nSupreme Court: no hearings, no vote, and yesterday even more. They even \nrefuse to meet with this man or woman who is going to be nominated--no \nmeetings, no meetings with the nominee to the Supreme Court, a person \nput forth by the President of the United States because the \nConstitution states he shall nominate. He has no discretion, he shall \nnominate.\n  By refusing to even sit or talk with any nominee, they make a mockery \nof the office to which the American people elected them.\n  Think about this. Republicans will not do their due diligence by \nspeaking with a nominee to assess his or her qualifications. Meeting \nwith the nominee is basic. Holding a hearing is routine. These things \nare common sense, so why won't Republican Senators make an effort to \nuphold their constitutional responsibilities?\n  U.S. Senators have an obligation to evaluate the Presidential \nnominations, not only for the Supreme Court but for every nomination \nthat comes forward--but especially the Supreme Court. That means \nsitting down with the nominee. That means holding hearings to learn \nabout their record and qualifications for the position, and that means \na vote.\n  The senior Senator from Texas said the same about 7 years ago. After \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor was nominated, the assistant Republican leader \ntold C-SPAN that ``my own view is that we ought to come with an open \nmind and do the research and do the reading . . . and then be able to \nask the nominee about them.''\n  What he said, the senior Senator from Texas, is that his view is that \nwe ought to come with an open mind, do the research, do the reading, \nand then be able to ask the nominee about them. I agree. The Senate \nshould be able to research the background of the President's Supreme \nCourt nominee and ask any questions they may have about them. Why--\nwhy--for the first time in history, do we have this situation? Why do \nRepublicans--the Republican Senator from Texas, whom I just quoted, and \nall Republicans--refuse to even meet with a nominee?\n  I say to my Republican friends, you cannot offer advice and consent \non a nominee you have never met, never considered. It is impossible. \nMaybe Republicans are hoping the Supreme Court vacancy will just go \naway, but it will not. Maybe Senate Republicans think they will only \nendure a few weeks of negative stories--and there have been negative \nstories, of course. There are no positive stories that I am aware of \nsaying: That is great. For the first time in history you are not even \nwilling to meet with a nominee. I guess they believe the American \npeople will forget about this vacancy, but they will not.\n  Democrats are going to fight every day to ensure that this important \nnominee gets a dignified confirmation process that past Senates have \nafforded all Supreme Court nominations. I, along with every other \nMember of the Democratic caucus, will be on the floor next week, the \nweek after that, and the week after that, as long as it takes, to bring \nto the attention of America the failure of this Republican Senate to \nmeet its constitutional mandate.\n  Pretending the nominee doesn't exist will not make the Supreme Court \nvacancy go away. It will not make the President's nomination vanish. \nRather, it leaves the American people with a Senate full of Republicans \nwho, as the Republican leader said, are ``retreating from their \nresponsibilities.'' That is what the Republican leader said. Their \nobstruction of the President's Supreme Court nominee is abdication of \nthe oath my Republican colleagues took when they assumed the title of \nU.S. Senator.\n  Once again I tell my Republican friends: Don't run away from your \nresponsibilities, just do your job. Do your job.\n  Mr. President, will the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/senate-section/article/S1018-5", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of showing how \none bureaucracy, the Corps of Engineers--and to some extent the EPA \nworking with them--has already made farming very difficult and how, if \nthe waters of the United States rule goes into effect, it can be much \nworse than even what I am going to be referring to.\n  Now, I am going to quote word for word a farmer's problem from the \nIowa Farm Bureau's Spokesman dated January 27, 2016, and then I am \ngoing to make some comments on it.\n  For that reason, since I am told the next speaker is not going to \ncome until 10:15, I ask unanimous consent to continue until that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before I start quoting, this is a story \nabout a California farmer by the name of John Duarte, of Tehama County, \nCA. The title is ``One farmer's ordeal may signal agencies' actions \nunder WOTUS.''\n\n       All John Duarte did was hire a guy to plow some grazing \n     land so that he could raise wheat on 450 acres that his \n     family had purchased in California's Tehama County, north of \n     Sacramento. The land had been planted to wheat in the past. \n     The wheat market was favorable and the farmer made sure to \n     avoid some wet spots in the field, called vernal pools, which \n     are considered wetlands.\n       But that plowing, which disturbed only the top few inches \n     of soil, unleashed a firestorm from the U.S. Army Corps of \n     Engineers, the Environmental Protection Agency, and other \n     regulators against the California Farm Bureau member. The \n     regulators' actions stopped Duarte from raising wheat, tried \n     to force him to pay millions of dollars to restore the \n     wetlands in perpetuity--although there was no evidence of \n     damage--and sparked lawsuits and counter-lawsuits.\n       Duarte's experience could well turn out to be an example of \n     how the agencies will treat farmers in Iowa and all over the \n     country under the expansive Waters of the United States rule, \n     according to Duarte, his attorneys and experts at the \n     American Farm Bureau Federation.\n       ``This really shows how these agency actions can play out \n     on a specific family farm,'' Duarte said recently during a \n     press conference at the American Farm Bureau Federation \n     annual convention in Orlando. ``We aren't concerned about it \n     because John Duarte is having a bad time with the feds. We \n     are concerned because this is a very serious threat to \n     farming as we know it in America.''\n       Although the EPA and other agencies continue to say to \n     farmers that the WOTUS rule will not affect normal farming \n     practices, such as plowing, Duarte's case shows that it will, \n     said Tony Francois, an attorney with the Pacific Legal \n     Foundation, which is representing Duarte.\n       ``Anyone who is being told not to worry about the new WOTUS \n     rule, they should be thinking about this case,'' Francois \n     said. ``The very thing they are telling you not to worry \n     about is what they are suing Duarte over--just plowing.''\n       Don Parish, [American Farm Bureau Federation] senior \n     director of regulatory relations, said a big problem is the \n     wide parameters that the agencies have placed in the WOTUS \n     rule. He noted the rule is filled with vague language like \n     adjacent waters and tributaries, which are difficult to \n     clarify.\n       As broad as possible. ``They want the Waters of the United \n     States to be as broad as they can get it so it can be applied \n     to every farm in the country,'' Parish said.\n       Iowa Farm Bureau Federation and other organizations have \n     worked hard to stop the WOTUS rule, which was imposed last \n     year but has been temporarily suspended by court rulings. The \n     rule was designed to revise the definition of what is \n     considered a ``water of the United States'' and is subject to \n     Federal regulations under the Clean Water Act.\n       But instead of adding clarity, IFBF and others contend the \n     rule has only added ambiguity, leaving farmers, like Duarte, \n     facing the potential of delays, red tape and steep fines as \n     they complete normal farm operations, such as fertilizing, \n     applying crop protection chemicals or moving dirt to build \n     conservation structures.\n       Another problem, Duarte said, is that the agencies are \n     piling the WOTUS law with other laws, such as the Endangered \n     Species Act, to dictate how farmers use their own land or to \n     keep them from farming it at all.\n       ``They aren't just trying to micromanage farmers. They're \n     trying to stop farmers,'' Duarte said. ``They're trying to \n     turn our farmland into habitat preservation. They are simply \n     trying to chase us off of our land.''\n       Duarte, who operates a successful nursery that raises \n     grapevines and rootstock for nut trees, was first contacted \n     by the Corps of Engineers in late 2012. In early 2013, the \n     Corps sent a cease-and-desist letter to Duarte, ordering \n     suspension of farming operations based on alleged violations \n     of the CWA.\n       The Corps did not notify the farmer of the allegations \n     prior to issuing the letter or provide Duarte any opportunity \n     to comment on the allegations.\n       The agency, Duarte said, wrongly accused him of deep \n     ripping the soil and destroying the wetlands in the field. \n     However, he had only had the field chisel plowed and was \n     careful to avoid the depressions or vernal pools.\n       It's also important to note, Duarte said, that plowing is \n     specifically allowed under the CWA. Congress specially added \n     that provision to keep farmers from having to go through an \n     onerous permitting process for doing fieldwork, he said.\n       Deciding to Fight.\n\n  That is a headline.\n\n       Instead of capitulating to the Corps, Duarte decided to \n     fight the case in court.\n       His lawsuit was met by a countersuit from the U.S. Justice \n     Department, seeking millions of dollars in penalties. The \n     case is expected to go to trial in March.\n\n  Meaning March right around the corner.\n\n       The case, Duarte said, has raised some absurd charges by \n     the agencies. At one point, the government experts claimed \n     that the bottom of the plowed furrows were still wetlands, \n     but the ridges of the furrow had been converted to upland, he \n     said.\n       In another, an agency official claimed that Duarte had no \n     right to work the land because it had not been continuously \n     planted to wheat.\n       However, he said, the previous owner had stopped planting \n     wheat because the prices were low.\n       ``They said it was only exempt if it was part of an ongoing \n     operation,'' Duarte said. ``There is no law that says farmers \n     have to keep growing crop if there is a glut and prices are \n     in the tank. But by the Corps thinking, if you don't plant \n     wheat when it is unprofitable, you lose your right to ever \n     grow it again.''\n       Duarte also noted that when federal inspectors came out to \n     his farm, they used a backhoe to dig deep pits in the \n     wetlands. ``If you do that, you can break through the \n     impervious layer and damage the wetland, but it does not seem \n     to be a problem if you are a government regulator.''\n       To date, his family has spent some $900,000 in legal fees.\n\n  Let me say something parenthetically here. If we had to spend \n$900,000 in legal fees, the Grassleys might as well get out of farming. \nNow I want to go back to quoting, so I am going to start that paragraph \nover.\n\n       To date, his family has spent some $900,000 in legal fees. \n     That is separate from the work by the Pacific Legal \n     Foundation, which represents the clients it takes for free \n     and is supported by foundations.\n       It would have been easier, and cheaper, to comply with the \n     wishes of federal agencies and given up use of the land. Many \n     California farmers who found themselves in a similar \n     situation have done just that, Duarte said.\n\n  Another two-word headline:\n\n       Banding together.\n       However, it's important to stand and fight the agencies' \n     attempt to bend the CWA, Endangered Species Act and other \n     laws to take control of private lands. And it's important for \n     farmers to band together with Farm Bureau and other groups \n     that oppose the WOTUS rule.\n       ``We are not against the Clean Water Act or the Endangered \n     Species Act as they were intended,'' Duarte said. ``But this \n     is not how those acts are supposed to be enforced. We are \n     getting entangled in regulation, and the noose seems to be \n     tighter every year.''\n\n  I said that I would comment after I read that. For people who may be \njust listening, I just read an article that ran on the front page of \nthe Iowa Farm Bureau Spokesman. The problems illustrated by this \narticle are all occurring under current law with regard to farmers \nwanting to make a living by planting wheat in their fields. In the case \nof Mr. Duarte, government regulations from the EPA and the Corps of \nEngineers are making his life miserable with the threats of millions of \ndollars of fines.\n  As the article stated, regulators at one point tried to claim that \n``the bottom of the plowed furious were still wetlands, but the ridges \nof the furrow had been converted to upland.'' That is ridiculous. The \nEPA is out of control.\n  You might remember the fugitive dust rule of a few years ago. I don't \nthink now they are trying to push it, but the EPA was going to rule \nthat you had--when you are a farming operation, you have to keep the \ndust within your property lines. So I tried to explain to the EPA \nDirector: Do you know that only God determines when the wind blows? \nWhen you are a farmer and your soybeans are at 13 percent moisture, you \nhave about 2 or 3 days to save the whole crop and get it harvested.\n  The farmer does not control the wind. The farmer does not control \nwhen the beans are dry, ready for harvest. When you combine soybeans, \nyou\n\n[[Page S1020]]\n\nhave dust. There is no way you can keep that dust within your \nboundaries. But as Washington is an island surrounded by reality, you \ncan see the fugitive dust rule does not meet a commonsense test, and \nyou can see that what they are trying to do to Duarte does not reach a \ncommonsense test.\n  Again, referring to the newspaper article I just read, if the EPA and \nthe Corps of Engineers are going around to farmers' fields making \ndeterminations about wetlands based on tillage practices under current \nlaw, imagine what they might do if this new waters of the United States \nrule goes into effect--now being held up by the courts.\n  Just think how you would feel if your family farm had survived for \ndecades, overcoming droughts, overcoming flooding, overcoming price \ndeclines--and you can name 10 other things that a farmer has no control \nover--and then you have to put up with this nonsense. However, one day \na government regulator could show up at your farm and hit you with \nexcessive fines, and the next thing you know, your family farm is being \nauctioned off. That may sound absurd, but that is the reality of \nthreats posed by the EPA. Mr. Duarte's case is the proof.\n  We have no shortage of assurances from the EPA Administrator that the \nplain language in the WOTUS rule will not be interpreted in a way that \ninterferes with farmers. It is hard to take some assurances seriously \nwhen they are interpreting current law in such an aggressive way.\n  We have to stop the WOTUS rule so the bureaucrats don't become even \nmore powerful. The WOTUS rule is too vague and allows way too much room \nfor regulators to make their own interpretations about jurisdiction. So \nwe should all continue to fight against the WOTUS rule and all other \nactions the EPA is taking that are ridiculous actions against farmers.\n  We have checks and balances in government. The Congress tried three \ntimes to stop the WOTUS rule. Senator Barrasso tried to pass \nlegislation taking away the authority or modifying the authority. That \ngot about 57 votes but not 60 votes, so that could not move forward. \nThe junior Senator from Iowa, my friend Senator Ernst, got a \ncongressional veto through, a resolution of disapproval, with 52 votes. \nIt went to the President. He vetoed it. So we did not override it that \nway. Then, of course, we tried an amendment on the appropriations bill, \nbut we could not get that into the appropriations bill before \nChristmas. So we have tried three things. But thank God the courts have \nheld up WOTUS through the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. So \ntemporarily, at least, waters of the United States can't move ahead.\n  This brings back something that is very current right now: Why should \nwe be concerned about who the next person on the Supreme Court is going \nto be? Because we have a President who said: I have a pen and a phone, \nand if Congress won't act, I will.\n  This sort of executive action by the EPA and the Corps of Engineers \nis kind of an example of the WOTUS rules, kind of an example of what we \nget out of this President. The President packed the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals, which reviews these regulations, so they are going to have a \nfriendly judge who says that whatever these bureaucrats do that may \neven be illegal or unconstitutional, they can get away with it.\n  Then, if that goes to the Supreme Court--we had an example just \nrecently, about 1 week or so before Scalia died--a 5-to-4 ruling \nholding up some other ridiculous EPA rules.\n  Everybody wonders why everyone around here is saying they are \nconcerned about who is going to be on the Supreme Court. It's because \nof these 5-to-4 decisions. We're concerned about the role of the \nSupreme Court in our constitutional system. The American people deserve \nto have their voices heard before the Court becomes drastically more \nliberal. I bet the Presiding Officer has people come to his town \nmeetings, as I do, and say: Why don't you impeach those Justices, \nbecause they are making law, instead of interpreting law as the \nConstitution requires?'' Well, you can't impeach a Justice for that. \nBut this does raise something very basic: What is the role of the \nSupreme Court in our constitutional system? It hasn't been debated in \nPresidential elections for I don't know how long. There is a chance for \nthis to be debated in the Presidential election and maybe lay out very \nclearly where Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders is coming from on one \nhand, or where our Republican nominee, whoever that is going to be, is \ncoming from and what type of people they are going to put on the Court.\n  I have about 30 seconds, and I will be done.\n  We are presented with an opportunity, here. The American people have \nan opportunity to debate about the proper role for a Supreme Court \nJustice. The American people can decide whether they want another \nJustice who just decides cases based on what they feel in their \n``heart,'' and who buys into this notion of a ``living Constitution,'' \nor whether they want a man or woman who believes the text means what it \nsays on the Supreme Court.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds).

Mr. President, I rise this morning to address a huge \nproblem that is happening in every one of our States and in all of our \ncommunities and to talk about a bill that is meant to be helpful in \nthis area. It is about the huge problem we have with opioid abuse, \nopioid addiction, including both prescription and heroin addiction and \nabuse. This is an epidemic that is truly unbelievable in scale. It is \naffecting people of all ages, all ethnic groups, all demographics, all \nincome classes, all geography. It is everywhere, and it is a huge \nproblem. I have heard about it in every county I have visited in my \nState. In all 67 counties of Pennsylvania, I have heard about how big \nthis problem is. In fact, more Pennsylvanians will die this year from \nheroin overdoses and the misuse of opioid painkillers than from the flu \nor homicides.\n  I wanted to learn more about this, so last fall I convened a hearing \nof the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Health Care, which I chair. \nSenator Casey joined me in that hearing at Allegheny General Hospital \nin Pittsburgh, where we had this, to learn more to understand about the \nnature and scale of this huge opioid addiction problem and what we \nmight do about it. I was surprised when I got to the room. It was a \nhuge auditorium, and it was standing room only. The room was completely \npacked with people because this epidemic is affecting virtually every \nfamily. It affects almost all of us at some level and in some way. It \nis tearing families apart. It is taking the lives of people who are in \nthe prime of their lives. It is a huge problem.\n  The hearing was very helpful in illuminating some aspects of the \nnature of the problem. We had medical professionals who are dealing \nwith the treatment, and we had people who are suffering from addiction. \nA recovering addict who has put her life back together told a very \ncompelling story about what she went through. We had people in law \nenforcement. So we had a lot of testimony with different perspectives.\n  One of the things I took away is that there are at least three \ncategories of ways we can help try to deal with this huge scourge. One \nis the problem of the overprescription of narcotics, the \noverprescription of painkillers, opioids, which are chemically very \nsimilar to heroin. A lot of people begin their addiction with these \nprescriptions, and then when they can no longer obtain or afford the \nprescription opioids, they move on to nonprescription forms, such as \nheroin, and it usually goes downhill very dramatically from there. So \nreducing overprescription has to help. There are ways to deal with \nthat. A second is to reduce the diversion of these opioids when they \nare being prescribed. My legislation really does focus on that. The \nthird is, we need better treatment and we need better outreach. We need \nbetter ways of treating people. We need to treat the addiction, but \nalso, many people find themselves addicted after they develop a mental \nhealth problem that is an underlying problem that contributes to the \naddiction. We have to do a better job identifying and helping people \nwith mental health problems.\n\n[[Page S1021]]\n\n  We have many aspects to this challenge that arises from this terrible \nepidemic, but let me focus in on one aspect of this, the \noverprescription and the diversion of prescription narcotics.\n  The Government Accountability Office estimated that in 1 year alone, \nthere were 170,000 Medicare beneficiary enrollees engaged in doctor \nshopping. Doctor shopping is the process whereby a person goes to \nmultiple doctors, gets multiple prescriptions for perhaps the same \nopioid--maybe oxycodone or some other kind of painkiller--then goes to \nmultiple pharmacies to get them all filled and ends up walking out of \nthe pharmacy with a huge quantity of these very powerful, very \naddictive opioids, which they then sell on the black market. It is a \nvery valuable commodity on the black market. The GAO found that there \nwas one beneficiary who visited 89 different doctors in a single year, \nall for the same kind of prescriptions. There is another beneficiary \nwho received prescriptions for 1,289 hydrocodone pills. That is a 490-\nday supply. You are not supposed to get more than a 30-day supply.\n  The inspector general found that a midwestern pharmacy billed \nMedicare for reimbursement of over 1,000 prescriptions for each of just \n2 beneficiaries--1,000 prescriptions per beneficiary--and one physician \nordered all the prescriptions for one of those beneficiaries.\n  Last April, the DEA indicted two doctors in Mobile, AL, who were \nwriting prescriptions for massive amounts of pain pills that were then \nfilled at the pharmacy next door to the pain clinic they also owned.\n  The examples go on and on. This is fraud. Let's be clear that that is \nwhat it is. This is fraud. This is people who are systemically abusing \nthese programs so they can obtain commercial-scale quantities of a very \nvaluable narcotic, which is also very dangerous and very addictive, \nbecause it can be lucrative. Why is it lucrative? In part, because the \nAmerican taxpayer pays for their supply. That is how outrageous this \nis. People are getting multiple prescriptions, going to multiple \npharmacies, and when the prescription is filled at all of these \npharmacies on these multiple occasions, the bill is submitted to \nMedicare, and Medicare reimburses.\n  Think about this. We have this criminal enterprise where the supply \nof narcotics is being paid for by taxpayers, and then the people who \nfraudulently obtain these drugs go out and sell them in what I am sure \nis a very lucrative arrangement. This is beyond outrageous; It is the \ndescription of the obviously fraudulent.\n  There is another category of people who end up with multiple \nprescriptions and it is completely innocent. There is no criminal \nintent whatsoever, no criminal activity. It is especially elderly \npeople who have multiple illnesses and they have different doctors who \ntreat them. In many cases, there is not a good coordination of the care \nfor those patients. There is nobody coordinating what all of the \ndoctors are doing, so doctors separately and--if it weren't for what \nother doctors are doing--appropriately give a prescription for a \npowerful narcotic. They don't know there is another doctor doing the \nsame thing. This patient unwittingly ends up with an excessive quantity \nof these opioids, which dramatically increases the risk that the \npatient will become addicted and will suffer any number of very harmful \nconsequences.\n\n  So we have the fraudulent cases of excessive prescriptions and then \nwe have the innocent cases, but both are problems. The legislation I \nhave introduced addresses both problems. First, I want to thank the \ncosponsors, the coauthor of the bill. Senator Sherrod Brown from Ohio \nis the lead Democrat on this bill. It is a bipartisan bill. Senator \nPortman and Senator Kaine have also been very helpful. They are \noriginal cosponsors of the bill. It is called Stopping Medication Abuse \nand Protecting Seniors Act. We now have 25 cosponsors.\n  We had a very constructive hearing last week in the Senate Finance \nCommittee about this legislation, this approach. Senator Hatch said he \nhopes the bill will move very soon. I hope the bill will move very \nsoon. It is very important.\n  Here is what it does. When Medicare discovers that a beneficiary is \nobtaining multiple prescriptions well beyond what any individual should \nappropriately have, then Medicare would have the authority to require \nthat person to get their prescriptions in the future from one doctor \nand get it filled at one pharmacy. It is called lock-in because you are \nlocked in to a single doctor and you are locked in to a single \npharmacy. In one step, that would go a very long way to making it very \ndifficult to commit this kind of fraud or to accidentally obtain more \nprescriptions than you ought to have.\n  This procedure is not a new concept. It already exists in Medicaid. \nIt is used every day in Medicaid to protect innocent people from \nexcessive prescriptions and to protect taxpayers from fraudulent abuse. \nIt is done by private carriers all the time. Private health insurance \ncarriers use this lock-in mechanism when they discover excessive \nprescriptions being written. It is designed in a way--as these other \nprograms are, the private and Medicaid--so that no one who legitimately \nneeds a prescription--because there are legitimate prescriptions for \nopioids and for narcotics. No one who has a legitimate need will have \nan access problem. People will still be able to obtain exactly what \nthey need. The lock-in applies only to a narrow category of controlled \nsubstances, schedule II controlled substances, which is what we think \nis appropriate.\n  I think this is going to be very helpful. It is going to help opioid-\naddicted seniors be identified as such so they can get the treatment \nthey need. It is going to stop the diversion of these powerful \nnarcotics. It is going to save taxpayers money. CBO estimates that $79 \nmillion over 10 years will be saved by bringing an end to these illegal \nprescriptions. And it is going to reduce the quantity of these terribly \npowerful drugs on the streets.\n  This legislation has very broad bipartisan support. Just last weekend \nthe National Governors Association came out fully in favor of adding a \nlock-in provision for Medicare. We had nearly identical language passed \nin a bill in the House as part of the 21st-century cures legislation, \nwhich passed overwhelmingly. The support includes the President of the \nUnited States. His budget has repeatedly asked Congress to give \nMedicare this authority. CMS's Acting Administrator, Andy Slavitt, just \nrecently, before our committee, said this legislation makes ``every bit \nof sense in the world.'' We have the support of the CDC Director; the \nWhite House drug czar; Pew Charitable Trusts; Physicians for \nResponsible Opioid Prescribing; many law enforcement groups; senior \ngroups, such as the Medicare Rights Center. This is a list of just some \nwho support this legislation.\n  This is really just common sense. We already have this capability in \nMedicaid. We already have this capability in private health insurance. \nIt is long past due that Medicare have the ability to protect seniors \nfrom accidental excessive prescriptions but also to prevent people from \ncommitting fraud, which we know is happening on a very large scale \ntoday.\n  I am not aware of any opposition to this. We have broad bipartisan \nsupport. I am hoping we can get this passed very soon, certainly in the \nnext week or so. The House will certainly pass this, as it already has \nas part of the 21st-century cures legislation, and we can get this to \nthe President and get this signed into law and start to help save lives \nand save taxpayers money at the same time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on December 2, 2015, 14 innocent souls in \nSan Bernardino were gunned down in a violent act of terrorism, and it \ninvolved one of these, an iPhone. This item has become ubiquitous, and \na lot of us carry them around in our pocket. Yet almost 3 months later, \nlaw enforcement has not been able to fully access the iPhone--the one \nused by the terrorists in gunning down these 14 people. The information \non this particular iPhone could shed some light on how he planned the \nattack with his wife and would obviously give authorities an \nopportunity to see if others were involved in the attack. The contacts \nin that\n\n[[Page S1022]]\n\niPhone could indicate whether there were other terrorists in the United \nStates or abroad who helped them in that attack. Yet 3 months after \nthese murders, the FBI cannot access the contents of the iPhone because \na security feature on the iPhone potentially erases its contents after \n10 incorrect passwords are entered. The maker of the iPhone, Apple, \nsays it would need to develop new software--software that it claims \ndoes not exist today--in order to disable that feature.\n  If this security feature were to be disabled by Apple, the FBI could \nuse what it calls ``brute force attack,'' which is the ability to run \ndifferent combinations of numbers through the iPhone in milliseconds, \nto try to assess the different password combinations in order to gain \naccess to the iPhone, but they still don't have access even though the \ncourt is involved.\n  Last week a Federal magistrate judge ordered Apple to provide \nreasonable technical assistance to the FBI in order to provide access \nto the perpetrator's iPhone. Apple opposes this order, given the \nconcerns that technology developed to intentionally weaken its security \nfeatures could be abused if it is in the wrong hands. In other words, \nthere would not be the privacy concern. They claim it would put \nsmartphone users' data and privacy at risk. It is a legitimate \nargument. They also view the Federal magistrate judge's order as an \nexample of government overreach.\n  Well, in response the Department of Justice filed a motion in \ndistrict court to compel Apple to comply with the magistrate judge's \norder, and because of the complicated nature of the issues of national \nsecurity, individual privacy, which we value, and First Amendment \nquestions involved, there will no doubt be prolonged litigation that \nmay ultimately have to be resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I certainly understand the risk to Americans' privacy, as expressed \nby Apple and other technology companies, but I don't want to run the \nrisk of letting the trail go so cold on this terrorist attack--and \npotentially other similar cases--that we lose this valuable information \nall because this is winding itself through months and years in the \ncourts. In other words, we need to know what was behind this attack. \nEverybody recognizes that this was a terrorist attack. We need to \nobtain this information in order to get to the bottom of it and root \nout and see if there are other terrorists in the country planning to do \nthe same thing so we can protect our people and our national security. \nThere has to be a way that the FBI can get the information it needs \nfrom the terrorist's iPhone in a manner that continues to protect \nAmerican smartphone users.\n  Now, surely common sense can prevail here. This is why this Senator \nurges Apple and the FBI to work together in order to resolve the \nstalemate.\n  Let me go back over this again. We have a dead terrorist. He and his \nwife killed 14 Americans. We have that dead terrorist's iPhone, and we \nhave a Federal judge's order that says we have the right to get that \ninformation in order to protect the Nation and its people. It is just \nlike if we had this terrorist, dead or alive, and we needed to get an \norder to invade that person's privacy to get into their home and get \nevidence to protect the Nation from other terrorist attacks. There \nwould certainly be no objection to that. The judge's order would be the \nprotector of that privacy. This is a similar situation, except the FBI \nhas an iPhone and they still can't get the information in it.\n  What if this terrorist were not an American citizen and this \nterrorist were illegally in the United States? Would the same standard \napply? I think Apple would say yes. We can draw up the different \nscenarios, but the bottom line is we are going to have to protect our \npeople. That is why this Senator urges Apple and the FBI to work \ntogether in order to resolve the stalemate. I understand that \nconsideration must be given as far as the protection of privacy in \npeople's iPhones. We have always found a way to balance our cherished \nright to privacy and our cherished right of securing ourselves and our \nnational security, and that is what is needed in this case. The safety \nand security of our fellow Americans depend on it. Otherwise, when the \nnext terrorist strikes--51 percent of Americans who have been surveyed \ntoday say they feel the government needs access to this information to \nprotect against future attacks. If the next attack happens and \ninformation is on an iPhone, that 51 percent will soar and it will be \nvery clear that the American people support the protection of our \nnational security.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday the minority leader came to \nthe floor to disparage the work of the Senate Judiciary Committee and \nalso disparage the work of the Senate as a whole. And, of course, as he \ndoes from time to time, he launched into a personal attack against me. \nNow, that is OK. I don't intend to return the favor. I love Senator \nReid. I don't want to talk about the nuclear option and the tremendous \ndamage that did to the Senate, not to mention the years and years that \nDemocratic Senators had to endure his leadership without even being \nable to offer an amendment. There is at least one Democratic Senator, \nwho was defeated in the last election, who never got a chance to get a \nvote on an amendment during the entire 6 years he was in the Senate.\n  We all know that is how some people act when they don't get their own \nway, but childish tantrums are not appropriate for the Senate. I think \nif my friend Senator Biden had been in the Chamber yesterday, he would \nhave said--as we have heard him say so many times--``that is a bunch of \nmalarkey.''\n  I didn't come to the floor today to talk about the minority leader. \nHowever, I did want to follow up on my remarks from earlier this week \non the Biden rules. Now, in fairness, Senator Biden didn't just make \nthese rules up out of thin air. His speech, back in 1992, went into \ngreat historical detail on the history and practice of vacancies in \nPresidential election years. He discussed how the Senate handled these \nvacancies and how Presidents have handled and should handle them. Based \non that history and a dose of good common sense, Senator Biden laid out \nthe rules that govern Supreme Court vacancies arising during a \nPresidential election year, and of course, he delivered his remarks \nwhen we had a divided government, as we have today, in 1992.\n  Now, the Biden rules are very clear. My friend from Delaware did a \nwonderful job of laying out the history and providing many of the sound \nreasons for these Biden rules, and they boil down to a couple \nfundamental points. First, the President should exercise restraint and \n``not name a nominee until after the November election is completed.'' \nAs I said on Monday, President Lincoln is a pretty good role model for \nthis practice. Stated differently, the President should let the people \ndecide. But if the President chooses not to follow President Lincoln's \nmodel but instead, as Chairman Biden has said, ``goes the way of \nFillmore and Johnson and presses an election-year nomination,'' then \nthe Senate shouldn't consider the nomination and shouldn't hold \nhearings. It doesn't matter ``how good a person is nominated by the \nPresident.'' Stated plainly, it is the principle, not the person, that \nmatters.\n  Now, as I said on Monday, Vice President Biden is an honorable man \nand he is loyal. Those of us who know him well know this is very true, \nso I wasn't surprised on Monday evening when he released a short \nstatement defending his remarks and of course, as you might expect, \ndefending the President's decision to press forward with a nominee. \nUnder the Constitution, the President can do that. Like I predicted on \nMonday, Vice President Biden is a loyal No. 2, but the Vice President \nhad the difficult task of explaining today why all the arguments he \nmade so cogently in 1992 aren't really his view.\n  It was a tough sell, and Vice President Biden did his best Monday \nevening, but I must say that I think Chairman Biden would view Vice \nPresident Biden's comments the same way he viewed the minority leader's \ncomments yesterday. He would call it like he sees it and as we have so \noften heard him say: It is just a bunch of malarkey. Here is part of \nwhat Vice President\n\n[[Page S1023]]\n\nBiden said on Monday. It is a fairly long quote.\n\n  ``Some critics say that one excerpt of a speech is evidence that I do \nnot support filling a Supreme Court vacancy during an election year. \nThis is not an accurate description of my views on the subject. In the \nsame speech critics are pointing to today, I urge the Senate and the \nWhite House to overcome partisan differences and work together to \nensure the Court function as the Founding Fathers intended.''\n  That doesn't sound consistent with all of those Biden rules I shared \nwith my colleagues on Monday. So we ask: Is it really possible to \nsquare Chairman Biden's 1992 election-year statement with Vice \nPresident Biden's 2016 election-year statement? Was Chairman Biden's \n1992 statement really just all about greater cooperation between the \nSenate and the White House? When Chairman Biden said in 1992 that if a \nvacancy suddenly arises, ``action on a Supreme Court nomination must be \nput off until after the election campaign is over,'' was he simply \ncalling for more cooperation? When he called for withholding consent \n``no matter how good a person is nominated by the President,'' was he \nmerely suggesting the President and the Senate work together a little \nbit more? When he said we shouldn't hold hearings under these \ncircumstances--was that all about cooperation between the branches?\n  Since we are talking about filling Justice Scalia's seat, it seems \nappropriate to ask: How would he solve this puzzle? I suppose he would \nstart with the text. So let us begin there.\n  In 1992, did Chairman Biden discuss cooperation between the branches? \nYes, in fact, he did. So far, so good for Vice President Biden, but \nthat can't be the end of the matter because that doesn't explain the \ntwo vastly different interpretations of the same statement. Let us look \na little more closely at the text. Here is what Chairman Biden said \nabout cooperation between the branches: ``Let me start with the \nnomination process and how the process might be changed in the next \nadministration, whether it is a Democrat or a Republican.''\n  Remember, again, I emphasize that was during the 1992 election year. \nWe didn't have to search very long to unearth textual evidence \nregarding the meaning of Chairman Biden's words in 1992. Yes, he shared \nsome thoughts about how he believed the President and Senate might work \ntogether, but that cooperation was to occur ``in the next \nadministration''--in other words, after the Presidential election of \n1992, after the Senate withheld consent on any nominee ``no matter how \ngood a person is nominated by the President.''\n  So the text is clear. If you need more evidence that this is an \naccurate understanding of what the Biden rules mean, look no further \nthan a lengthy Washington Post article 1 week prior. In that interview \nhe made his views quite clear. He said: ``If someone steps down, I \nwould highly recommend the president not name someone, not send a name \nup.'' And what if the President does send someone up?--``If [the \nPresident] did send someone up, I would ask the Senate to seriously \nconsider not having a hearing on that nominee.''\n  Specifically, my friend Chairman Biden said: ``Can you imagine \ndropping a nominee after the three or four or five decisions that are \nabout to be made by the Supreme Court into that fight, into that \ncauldron in the middle of a presidential [election] year?''\n  Chairman Biden went on: ``I believe there would be no bounds of \npropriety that would be honored by either side. . . . The environment \nwithin which such a hearing would be held would be so supercharged and \nso prone to be able to be distorted.''\n  At the end of the day, the text of Chairman Biden's 1992 statement is \nvery clear. So, in 2016, when he is serving as a loyal No. 2 to this \nPresident, Vice President Biden is forced to argue that the Biden rules \nsecretly mean the exact opposite of what they say. Ironically, that is \na trick Justice Scalia taught us all to recognize and to reject on \nsight. We know we should look to the clear meaning of his text, as \nJustice Scalia taught us. This was not a one-off comment by Senator \nBiden. It was a 20,000-word floor speech forcefully laying out a \ndifficult and principled decision. It relied on historical precedent. \nIt relied upon respect for democracy. It relied on respect for the \nintegrity of the nomination process. There is no doubt what Senator \nBiden meant.\n  Of course there is a broader point, and I hope in the next several \nmonths we concentrate on his broader point. That is this. Words have \nmeaning. Text matters. Justice Scalia devoted his adult life to these \nfirst principles. Do the American people want to elect a President who \nwill nominate a Justice in the mold of Scalia to replace him? Or do \nthey want to elect a President Clinton or Sanders who will nominate a \nJustice who will move the Court in a drastically more liberal decision? \nDo they want a Justice who will look to the constitutional text when \ndrilling down on the most difficult constitutional questions or do they \nwant yet another Justice who, on those really tough cases, bases \ndecisions on ``what is in the Judge's heart,'' as then-Senator Obama \nfamously said.\n  It comes down to this. We have lost one of our great jurists. It is \nup to the American people to decide whether we will preserve his \nlegacy.\n  More importantly, do you want a Justice who follows the text of the \nConstitution? Do you want a Justice who follows the text of the law?\n  Or, do you want a Justice who makes decisions based on his or her \n``heart''? This is a debate we should have. This is a debate I hope we \nwill have. This is a debate I hope will be part of the three or four \nnational presidential debates between Nominee Clinton or Sanders on one \nside, and whomever the Republicans nominate on the other side. The \nAmerican people should have this debate. And then we should let the \nAmerican people decide.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will thank my colleague from Iowa. I \nhoped to get a chance to speak to him personally about another matter, \nbut I will call him from the floor afterward. We will get in touch. \nSenator Hatch is here. I don't want to delay the proceedings of the \nSenate, but I would like an opportunity to respond on this issue that \nwas raised by Senator Grassley.\n  Senator Grassley of Iowa is my friend. Politicians say that sometimes \nand mean it, and say it sometimes and don't mean it. I mean it. We have \nbecome friends as neighboring States and sharing a lot of plane rides \ntogether, serving on the same committee, serving in the same body for a \nnumber of years, and I respect him very much. We have different points \nof view on many things, but we found common agreement on many other \nthings. So I do respect him when I say that at the outset as I respond \nto his remarks.\n  What is this about? This is about the passing of Justice Scalia and \nwhether his seat on the Supreme Court will be filled, and if it will be \nfilled, who will do it and when. The first place for us to turn when it \ncomes to asking questions is the one document, the only document, that \nmatters, the U.S. Constitution. It is this document that we literally \nall swore to uphold and defend, every one of us, Democrat and \nRepublican. It is this document that is explicit, not making a \nsuggestion but really spelling out the responsibilities when it comes \nto a vacancy on the Supreme Court, and it is article II section 2. \nArticle II, section 2 says that the President ``shall nominate, and by \nand with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . \nJudges of the supreme Court.'' Shall.\n  It is our responsibility under this Constitution to do this. It is \namazing to me in the history of this Republic, guided by this great \ndocument, we have reached a point in the year 2016 where those simple \nwords, directions in the Constitution, are being challenged and ignored \nby the Republican majority because, you see, there has never--underline \nthe word never--been a moment in history when the Senate has refused to \nextend a hearing to a Supreme Court nominee until this moment. There \nhas never been a moment in history, never--underline that word--when \nthe Senate has refused a vote on a Supreme Court nominee.\n  I can't say never, but it is been more than 150 years since we have \nallowed a vacancy on the Supreme Court to go on for more than a year, \nas the Republicans in the Senate are determined to do here. That 150 \nyears goes back to the Civil War. So I would say to my colleague from \nIowa, you are about to\n\n[[Page S1024]]\n\nmake history if you stand by this decision. If you decide the Senate \nJudiciary Committee will not even entertain a nomination to fill the \nScalia vacancy on the Supreme Court, it will be the first time in the \nhistory of the U.S. Senate--the first. If the Senate Republican \nleadership makes the decision that even if a nominee is sent they will \nnever allow a vote, it will be the first time in the history of the \nUnited States of America. That is why this is such a definitive issue. \nThat is why the position taken by the Senate Republican majority is so \ndifferent, so unusual, and in some cases so extreme.\n  The argument is being made on the other side--listen to this \nargument. This argument is being made: Well, we are in a campaign year. \nThis is a Presidential election year. Who knows who the next President \nwill be. Let the American people choose that President and that \nPresident choose the nominee.\n  It overlooks one basic fact. Three years and three months ago, the \nAmerican people chose a President. By a margin of 5 million votes, \nBarack Obama defeated Mitt Romney for President of the United States. \nThey made their selection. Did they elect President Obama for a 3-year \nterm? Let me check the Constitution, but I think it was a 4-year term. \nOh, was it 3 years and 3 months? No. It turns out the American people \nspoke in our democracy by a margin of 5 million votes and said: Barack \nObama, you will be President of the United States until January the \n20th, 2017. Was there a rider or some exclusion that said you can't \nappoint a nominee, name a nominee to fill a vacancy on the Supreme \nCourt in the last year of your Presidency? I don't remember that. \nPerhaps that was the case in some States, but not in Illinois and, to \nbe honest, in no other State.\n\n  The President was elected for 4 years. He was given the consent and \nauthority of the American people to govern this Nation for 4 years and \nto fill the vacancies on the Supreme Court as he is directed to do by \nthe U.S. Constitution.\n  Now the Senate Republicans have come up with a different spin: No; he \nmay have been elected, but from their point of view, he wasn't given \nthe full power of office. They say Barack Obama was given something \nless than any other previous President of the United States. They say \nhe was not given the authority to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court \nin the last year of his term.\n  I would like to find the constitutional precedent for that. I invite \nmy colleagues--we have two on the floor. One is the current chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, and one is the former chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee. I invite them to show me that historical, \nconstitutional precedent that says Barack Obama, the President of the \nUnited States, really only has the authority of the office for 3 \nyears--3 years and 2 months. Beyond that, he is a lame duck President. \nGive me the authority for that.\n  What do they hang their hat on? They hang their hat on a speech made \nby Vice President Biden when he served in this body 25 years ago. Joe \nBiden is truly my friend, as he is the friend of virtually every \nSenator from both sides of the aisle. I respect him so much. I wasn't \nsurprised at all when I heard the Senator from Iowa say that he gave a \n20,000-word speech. He gave a lot of 20,000-word speeches. I saw him \ndeliver a few here, and they were a sight to behold. This one I think \nwent on for 90 minutes as then Senator Biden shared his views on \nfilling judicial vacancies and on recommendations. If we listen \nclosely, we know the Senator from Iowa said that Vice President Biden \n``recommended,'' ``should consider.'' Well, let me ask this question: \nWas there ever any time when Senator Biden was the chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee that he denied a hearing to a Supreme Court \nnominee? No. Was there ever a time as chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee when he recommended to the Senate that they deny a vote on a \nPresidential nomination to fill a Supreme Court vacancy? No. So \nwhatever his theory was that he expressed on the floor of the Senate--\nand we all express a lot of theories--Joe Biden was respectful of this \ndocument. He knew what the U.S. Constitution said.\n  I find it hard to imagine that the Republican Senators now in the \nmajority are going to walk away from this Constitution and turn their \nbacks on it. I have a lengthy statement that I ask unanimous consent be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks which goes into the question \nof why the Republican majority continues to obstruct the appointment of \njudges and people to serve in the executive branch of government under \nthis President. It has been unprecedented. They decided not just on \nthis nominee but long ago that they would not give this President the \nsame treatment, the same respect that has been given other Presidents. \nNow it has been brought front and center with this vacancy, the Scalia \nvacancy on the Supreme Court.\n  I sure disagreed with Justice Scalia on a lot of things, but I do not \nargue with Judge Posner of the Seventh Circuit in my State when he said \nthat Justice Scalia was a major force in terms of thinking on the \nSupreme Court. And what really undergirded the philosophy of Justice \nScalia was what he called originalism. Some people mocked it, and some \npeople just flat out disagreed with it. But he said time and again: \nRead the Constitution and read the precise wording of the Constitution. \nI saw different things in those words than he did, but that was his \nNorth Star when it came to Supreme Court decisions.\n  Well, if he read article II, section 2, which says the President \n``shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, \nshall appoint . . . Judges of the supreme Court''--there is little \ndoubt--no doubt--in those words. And if he relied on the precedent of \nthe United States, the history of the United States that the U.S. \nSenate has never denied a hearing to a Presidential nominee until this \nmoment in history, has never refused a vote on a nominee until this \nmoment in history, then he would realize that what is being done here \nis unprecedented and uncalled for.\n  If my Republican colleagues now in the majority--54 votes strong \nagainst 46 on the Democratic side--really disagree with the President's \nchoice, his nominee, whoever it may be, they have an option. There is a \nconstitutional option. The constitutional option is to hold a hearing, \ndo the background check which is done, and then vote, and if you \ndisapprove of that nominee, vote no. That is the regular order and the \nregular course of events. That is the constitutional way to approach \nthis.\n  But they have gone even further. Senator McConnell said two days ago \nhe would not only give the President's nominee no hearing and no vote, \nhe refuses to even meet with that person, whoever it may be. Those are \nthe lengths they will go to to avoid facing the constitutional \nresponsibility that every Senator has.\n  Senators can quote Vice President Joe Biden's speeches of 25 years \nago as long as they want. They can read his words over and over again, \nbut the fact is he never stopped a hearing, he never stopped a vote, \nand he honored the Constitution. The wording of the Constitution didn't \ngo on for 20,000 words. It is just a handful of words that we have \nsworn to uphold and defend before we can become U.S. Senators.\n  History will not look kindly on this political decision by the \nRepublican majority. History will not give them a pass. History will \nask time and again: How could you ignore the Constitution? How could \nyou ignore your responsibility under the Constitution? Why won't you do \nyour job, a job you were elected to do to fill this vacancy? Is a \ntemporary political victory worth this--to turn your back on the \nConstitution and the history of this country? I don't think it is.\n  I hope that when the Republican Senators go home and meet with their \nconstituents over this weekend and in the days ahead, they will have \nsecond thoughts. When the President sends a nominee, I hope they will \nabide by the Constitution, be respectful of this document and \nrespectful of this President, and give his nominee the same due \nconsideration that has been given to Supreme Court nominees throughout \nhistory.\n  Justice Anthony Kennedy became a Justice on the Supreme Court when a \nDemocratic-controlled Senate gave him a vote--a hearing, and then a \nvote in a Presidential election year much like this one. A lameduck, \noutgoing President appointed Justice Kennedy.\n\n[[Page S1025]]\n\nA Democratic Senate did not refuse to meet with him, did not refuse to \nhave a hearing, did not refuse a vote, but said: We will abide by the \nConstitution. For that outgoing President, he had the full authority of \noffice. President Barack Obama deserves nothing less. And we as \nSenators have a responsibility under this Constitution, regardless of \nwhat speech was made 25 years ago, to pay close attention to these \nwords and to do our constitutional duty.\n  When the Senate majority leader said that he would not give any \nconsideration to any Supreme Court nominee named by the President--no \nvote, no hearing, not even a courtesy meeting--it set a new low for the \nSenate. Throughout our Nation's history, no pending Supreme Court \nnominee who sought a hearing has been denied one. Some nominees were \nconfirmed so quickly after their nomination that a hearing was not \nscheduled, and one nominee withdrew before her scheduled hearing could \ntake place, but the Senate has never before refused a hearing to a \npending nominee. Similarly, every pending nominee for an open Supreme \nCourt vacancy has been voted upon by Senators. Some nominees were \nconfirmed on the floor, some were rejected on the floor, some nominees \nwere renominated before they got their vote, and some only received a \nvote on whether to be reported or discharged out of committee, but all \nof them got a vote. Yet the Senate majority leader has announced that \nPresident Obama's next nominee will get no hearing, no vote, not even a \nmeeting.\n  The President is obligated by Article II, section 2 of the \nConstitution to send a nominee to the Senate. That is the process the \nFounding Fathers established. There is nothing in the Constitution that \nprovides for this process to be abandoned in an election year. Just as \nthe President and Senate must do their jobs in times of war and \neconomic depression, they must do their jobs in election years.\n  The reality is that Republicans simply want to keep the Supreme Court \nseat vacant in the hopes that their presidential nominee will get to \nfill it. It is a purely political calculation. But Presidential \npolitics do not trump the Constitution.\n  The Republican leader should do what past Republican leaders like \nSenator Everett Dirksen of Illinois did when a Supreme Court vacancy \narose in the election year of 1968--roll up his sleeves and get to \nwork.\n  Senate Republicans have come up with a number of excuses for shirking \ntheir constitutional responsibilities. But the bottom line is that \nthere is no excuse for the Senate to fail to do its job.\n  The President made clear yesterday that he is taking his \nconstitutional responsibility seriously. He wrote a piece in the \nwebsite SCOTUSblog explaining the careful, deliberative process he is \nundertaking to choose a nominee. The President said he will select a \nperson who has outstanding qualifications, a commitment to impartial \njustice, a deep respect for the role of the judiciary, and a life \nexperience that shows integrity and good judgment.\n  The President is doing his job, as the Constitution requires. Senate \nRepublicans must stop the pattern of obstruction that they have shown \nwith so many of President Obama's nominees and do their job, too. Once \nthe President selects a Supreme Court nominee, Senators should meet \nwith the nominee, give him or her a fair hearing, schedule a vote, and \nfill the vacancy on our Nation's highest Court.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nRepublican Obstruction of President Obama's Nominees, February 23, 2016\n\n       Senate Republicans have announced they will obstruct \n     President Obama's forthcoming nominee to the Supreme Court \n     without even considering the nominee's merits, simply because \n     Republicans do not want President Obama to make the \n     nomination.\n       This is far from the first time that Republicans have \n     engaged in unreasonable obstruction of nominations made by \n     President Obama. According to statistics from the \n     Congressional Research Service as reported in a Jan. 5, 2016 \n     Politico article, ``the Senate in 2015 confirmed the lowest \n     number of civilian nominations--including judges and \n     diplomatic ambassadors--for the first session of a Congress \n     in nearly 30 years.'' Only 173 civilian nominees were \n     confirmed last year.\n       Other examples of Republican obstruction of nominations \n     include the following:\n       Judicial nominations:\n       D.C. Circuit: In 2013, Republicans announced they would \n     oppose any person President Obama nominated to fill three \n     vacancies in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, simply \n     because they did not want Obama to fill those vacancies. The \n     President nominated three unquestionably qualified people -- \n     Patricia Millett, Nina Pillard, and Robert Wilkins, and twice \n     Senate Republicans opposed cloture votes on Millett's \n     nomination. This prompted Senator Reid to change Senate rules \n     to lower the cloture vote threshold for lower court nominees \n     to 50, and subsequently the three D.C. Circuit nominees were \n     confirmed.\n       Obstruction in the current Republican Senate: Last year, \n     Senate Republicans matched the record for confirming the \n     fewest number of judicial nominees in more than half a \n     century, with 11 for the entire year. Overall, in the current \n     Congress Republicans have only allowed 16 judges to be \n     confirmed, compared to 68 judges that were confirmed by the \n     Democratic-controlled Senate in the last two years of George \n     W. Bush's administration. There are 17 non-controversial \n     judicial nominees pending on the Senate executive calendar, \n     all of whom were reported out of committee by unanimous voice \n     vote. Currently there are 81 judicial vacancies, including 31 \n     judicial emergencies.\n       National security nominations:\n       Attorney General Loretta Lynch had to wait 165 days after \n     her nomination to be confirmed by the Republican Senate in \n     April 2015. This was far longer than other recent Attorney \n     General nominees had to wait for a confirmation vote. By \n     comparison, the Democratic Senate confirmed Michael Mukasey \n     in 53 days in 2007.\n       Treasury Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Crimes: \n     Adam Szubin was nominated on April 20, 2015 for this \n     position, which involves tracking and blocking financing to \n     terror groups like ISIS. Banking Chairman Shelby described \n     Szubin as ``eminently qualified'' for the position, but he \n     has still not received a floor vote in over 10 months.\n       Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness: \n     Brad Carson was nominated on July 8, 2015 for this position, \n     which is responsible for ensuring our military is ready to \n     face threats around the world. He is waiting for a hearing.\n       Secretary of the Army: Eric Fanning was nominated on Sept. \n     21, 2015 for this position, which involves overseeing U.S. \n     Army personnel, strategy, and readiness around the world. He \n     waited four months just to get a hearing, and now he is \n     waiting to receive a Committee vote.\n       General Counsel, Defense Department: Jennifer O'Connor was \n     nominated on Sept. 21, 2015 for this position, but she is \n     waiting for a hearing.\n       Under Secretary for the Navy: Janine Davidson was nominated \n     on Sept. 21 for the #2 position in the Navy, but she is still \n     awaiting confirmation.\n       Foreign policy nominations\n       Ambassadors and foreign policy positions: Only 59 \n     ambassador or other key foreign policy positions have been \n     confirmed in this Congress with an average confirmation wait \n     of six months. For comparison, during the 110th Congress \n     (2007-08) when George W. Bush was President and the Democrats \n     controlled the Senate, more than 120 nominees for key foreign \n     policy positions were confirmed with an average confirmation \n     wait of under three months.\n       Of the seven State Department nominees confirmed a few \n     weeks ago, three were nominated in 2014 or earlier. These \n     include Brian Egan (Legal Advisor, first nominated in 2014), \n     John Estrada (Trinidad and Tobago, first nominated in 2013), \n     and Azita Raji (Sweden, first nominated in 2014).\n       Ambassador to Mexico: Roberta Jacobson, a career nominee, \n     was nominated as ambassador to Mexico on June 2, 2015 but she \n     is still awaiting confirmation.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, before I begin, let me note that I have \nbeen very concerned about the tenor of the debate. I am very upset that \nyesterday my dear friend, the minority leader, yesterday attacked my \nother dear friend, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nGrassley, by calling him inept as a committee chairman. There is no \nreason for that kind of language on the floor, even if it were true, \nwhich it is not, and I think the minority leader knows it is not true.\n  Senator Grassley is one of the most effective, hard-working, decent \nSenators in the U.S. Senate. He is not an attorney, and yet he has run \nthe Judiciary Committee as well as any chairman that I recall in my 40 \nyears here. Everybody knows he treats people fairly. So I hope we can \nget rid of that kind of language and start treating people with decency \nand with regard. We differ widely with the Democrats on this issue and \non other issues, but we are not slandering them. If a Republican \nbehaved similarly, I would stand up to him. It just shouldn't happen.\n  On Tuesday, I rose to honor the memory of the late Justice Antonin\n\n[[Page S1026]]\n\nScalia, whom I knew quite well. With his passing, the Nation lost one \nof its greatest Supreme Court Justices ever to have served, and I lost \na dear friend.\n  Today, I rise to make the case that the next President should chose \nthe nominee to replace Justice Scalia. As we embark on this debate, our \nfirst task should be to situate properly the Senate's role in seating \nmembers of the judiciary as well as the reasons for the role. In doing \nso, let me invoke an approach that Justice Scalia himself employed to \nmake the same point.\n  In addressing audiences, the late Justice often asked: What part of \nour Constitution was most important in protecting the liberties of the \npeople? Invariably, audiences would provide answers such as protections \nfor the freedom of speech, the freedom of religion, the right to keep \nand bear arms, the right of the people to be secure in their persons, \nhouses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures, \nand the like.\n  Justice Scalia, like the vast majority of Americans, agreed that \nthese protections are obviously important. I certainly do, too. \nNevertheless, he always made one crucial observation: Even the most \nrepressive dictatorships, such as the Soviet Union and North Korea, \ntypically have provisions akin to our Bill of Rights in their \nConstitutions. Simply enshrining these basic rights in constitutional \ntext does not ensure their protection.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to complete my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Our Nation's Founders knew, in the sage words of James \nMadison in Federalist 47, that ``[t]he accumulation of all powers, \nlegislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands . . . may \njustly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.'' They bestowed \nupon us the blessing of the Constitution that creates a Federal \nGovernment with limited and enumerated powers, with those powers \ndiffused and balanced between three coequal branches of government.\n  The Federal judiciary occupies a unique station in this \nconstitutional architecture. In deciding cases and controversies, it \nis, in the seminal words of Marbury v. Madison, ``emphatically the \nprovince and the duty of the judicial department to say what the law \nis.'' Unelected and armed with life tenure and salary protection, \njudges thereby have the power to hold the political branches to \naccount.\n\n  This power is the source of much of the Constitution's great \nbrilliance in its ability to restrain transient political majorities \nfrom exceeding the authority granted to government by the sovereign \npeople; however, it is also the source of one of the great potential \npitfalls of our system of government, in which five lawyers can \nsubstitute their personal policy preferences to the legitimate \njudgments of the executive and legislative branches, thereby usurping \nthe powers of the self-governing people.\n  This tension between the stark necessity of judicial independence to \npreserve limited government under the Constitution and the dangers of \nan unaccountable judiciary shirking its duty to say what the law is--\nand instead saying what it thinks the law should be--makes the judicial \nselection process vitally important. Hewing to a careful process \nenvisioned by the Framers that vests the Executive and legislature with \ncritical but distinct roles is the means by which we can maintain the \nintegrity of the judicial branch.\n  The appointments clause delineates these distinct roles for the \nPresident and the Senate in the appointment property. Article II, \nsection 2 provides that the President ``shall nominate, and by and with \nthe Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges of the \nsupreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States.'' By \ncreating two separate roles in the confirmation process, the executive \nbranch to nominate and the legislative branch to provide its advice and \nconsent, the Framers were creating rival interests.\n  Alexander Hamilton cogently explained the various rationales for this \nparticular allocation of appointment powers in Federalist 76. Following \nthe example of the Massachusetts Constitution, the Framers vested the \nresponsibility for nominations in one officer, the President, to ensure \naccountability and impartiality in selecting nominees and to guard \nagainst corruption, impropriety or imprudence that characterized the \nappointment process in many of the States. By concentrating the power \nof nomination in one person, the Framers sought to create \naccountability or in Hamilton's words a ``livelier sense of duty and a \nmore exact regard to reputation.''\n  That said, the Framers expressly rejected the notion of vesting an \nunchecked appointment power in the President alone. By requiring the \nPresident to submit his nominee for the Senate's approval, the Founders \nsought to forestall any potential abuse of the nomination power. \nHamilton argued that the requirement of advice and consent would serve \nas ``an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the President \nand would tend greatly to prevent the appointment of unfit characters \nfrom State prejudice, from family connection, from personal attachment, \nor from a view to popularity.''\n  While the practice of the early Republic confirmed that the Chief \nExecutive enjoys plenary authority over nominations, history also shows \nthat the Senate equally possesses the plenary authority to withhold its \nconsent the nominee for any reason. Nothing in the text of the \nappointment clause appears to limit the Senate's considerations. Just \nas the President has an unfettered right to veto legislation, the \nSenate enjoys complete and final discretion in whether to approve or \neven consider a nomination.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have taken up the mantra \nthat we must ``do our job'' with respect to the current vacancy, and so \nwe must. But our job, despite what the Democrats are saying, is not to \nfollow a particular path found nowhere in the Constitution. Rather, it \nis to determine the most appropriate way to fulfill our advice and \nconsent role for this particular vacancy. The Senate would not be doing \nits job if we followed a process that is not appropriate for the \nsituation before us today.\n  Indeed, withholding consent can be just as valid an exercise of our \nrole as granting it, and deferring the confirmation process for a \nparticular vacancy may be the most appropriate and responsible exercise \nof the advice and consent role entrusted to us. It all depends on the \ncircumstances.\n  Consider these precedents. The Senate has never confirmed a nominee \nto a Supreme Court vacancy that opened up this late in a term-limited \nPresident's time in office. It is only the third vacancy in nearly a \ncentury to occur after the American people had already started voting \nin a Presidential election, and in both the previous two instances--in \n1956 and in 1968--the Senate did not confirm the nominee until the \nfollowing year after the election had occurred.\n  It has been more than three-quarters of a century since a Supreme \nCourt Justice has been nominated and confirmed in a Presidential \nelection year, and the only time the Senate has ever confirmed a \nnominee to fill a Supreme Court vacancy created after voting began in a \nPresidential election year was in 1916. That vacancy arose only because \nChief Justice Charles Evans Hughes resigned his seat on the Court to \nrun against incumbent President Woodrow Wilson.\n  The cautiousness with which Senators in times past have approached \nelection-year vacancies is only amplified by present circumstances. As \nmy colleagues in the minority are fond of saying, elections have \nconsequences, and the election of 2014 certainly had tremendous \nconsequences.\n  In the last election, the American people went to the polls to \nregister their opposition to the wide range of illegal and \nunconstitutional actions of the Obama administration, including: its \nunilateral cancellation of duly enacted law, such as with illegal \nimmigration; its regulation contrary to the plain text of the law, such \nas with the Clean Power Plan; its willingness to ignore its statutory \nobligations without meaningful justification, such as with the \nPresident's decision to release the top five Taliban leaders in U.S. \ncustody without notifying Congress beforehand as required by Federal \nlaw; its efforts to stretch what lawful authorities the executive \nbranch does possess beyond all recognition, such as with its mass\n\n[[Page S1027]]\n\nclemency effort for drug offenders; and its attempt to bypass the \nSenate's role in the confirmation process, one of nearly two dozen \ntimes the Obama administration has lost 9 to 0 before the Supreme \nCourt.\n  The American people elected our Republican Senate majority in large \npart to check the overreach of President Obama, and given how crucial \nthe courts have proven in holding this administration accountable to \nthe Constitution and the law, the Senate has every reason to approach \nlifetime appointments cautiously and deliberately, especially \nappointments to the highest Court in the land.\n  Moreover, leaving Justice Scalia's seat vacant until after the \nelection would hardly result in a constitutional crisis. An even number \nof Justices has never inhibited the Supreme Court from functioning. An \nabsence of this length would be far from unprecedented, as the Court \nhas adapted to vacancies that lasted for more than 2 years in its \nhistory and as recently as 1970 accommodated a vacancy of more than a \nyear thanks to liberal obstruction of two candidates nominated by a \nRepublican President. Famously, when Justice Robert Jackson took a \nyear-long leave of absence to serve as chief prosecutor at the \nNuremburg war crimes tribunal, Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote to him \nand advised him that having a temporary eight-member Court as a result \nof his prolonged absence did not ``sacrifice a single interest of \nimportance.''\n  Moreover, the recusal process oftentimes requires the Court to \nconsider various cases with a reduced number of Justices, including \nrecent high-profile cases such as Arizona v. United States in 2012 and \nFisher v. University of Texas in 2013. Consider that Justice Kagan, due \nto her service as Solicitor General, had to recuse herself in 38 cases. \nIn these situations the Court has well-established rule for dealing \nwith its cases, including 4-to-4 splits. At its discretion, the Court \nhas the authority to hold cases over or reargue them when a new Justice \nis confirmed.\n  Indeed, the vast majority of Supreme Court decisions are unanimous, \nnearly so, or are split along nonideological lines. Only a relatively \nsmall minority of cases--typically less than 20 percent--are decided 5-\nto-4, and even fewer divide along predictable ideological lines. In the \nunlikely event that a tie should occur, as has occurred in only 2 of 38 \nof Justice Kagan's recusals, the ruling of the lower court is simply \nupheld. Put simply, the absence of one of the nine Justices on the \nCourt is far from calamitous, but a hastily made appointment could be.\n  If the particular circumstances we face today counsel in favor of \nwaiting until after the election, why would we act otherwise simply \nbecause the other party tells us to do so?\n  The minority leader made this same point in 2005 when he flatly \nrejected the claim that the Senate must always give nominees an up-or-\ndown vote. In fact, he said that the very idea would be, in his own \nwords, ``rewriting the Constitution and reinventing reality.''\n  He said: ``The duties of the United States Senate are set forth in \nthe Constitution of the United States. Nowhere in that document does it \nsay that the Senate has a duty to give Presidential nominees a vote. It \nsays that appointments shall be made with the advice and consent of the \nSenate. That is very different than saying that every nominee receives \na vote.''\n  Yesterday, I was stunned to hear numerous Democrats contradict the \nminority leader on this point. For example, the minority whip said that \nthe ``clear language of the Constitution'' requires an up-or-down \nconfirmation vote. That claim is obviously wrong on its face, since the \nConstitution says no such thing. By the minority leader's 2005 \nstandard, these Democrats today are ``rewriting the Constitution and \nreinventing reality.'' Perhaps they received different sets of talking \npoints.\n  This claim by the minority whip and others that the Constitution \nrequires an up-or-down vote is baffling for another reason. Between \n2003 and 2007 the minority whip voted 25 times to filibuster Republican \njudicial nominees. In other words, he voted 25 times to deprive \njudicial nominees of an up-or-down confirmation vote that he now says \nthe Constitution's clear language requires.\n  Many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have also \nrepeatedly observed that deferring the confirmation process until the \nnext President takes office would be unprecedented. This point escapes \nme as well. The filibusters used to defeat Republican judicial nominees \nwere also unprecedented, yet many Democrats voted for them anyway. \nWhile past practice matters, the ultimate question is not whether this \nhas happened before but whether it is an appropriate step to take now.\n  The Senate's job is to decide how best to carry out its duty of \nadvice and consent in the situation before us. Thankfully, we are not \nwithout guidance in making that judgment. I think back to 1992, a \nPresidential election year not unlike this one, in which different \nparties controlled the White House and the Senate. My friend, then-\nJudiciary Committee Chairman and now-Vice President Joe Biden, came to \nthis very floor on June 25, 1992, and delivered what he said was the \nlongest speech in his then 19 years in this body. He evaluated the \nstate of the confirmation process, suggested reforms for the future, \nand made a specific recommendation. He said that if a Supreme Court \nvacancy occurred in that Presidential election year, President George \nH.W. Bush ``should consider following the practice of a majority of \npredecessors and not--and not--name a nominee until after the November \nelection is completed.''\n  If the President did choose a Supreme Court nominee, Chairman Biden \nsaid: ``The Senate Judiciary Committee should seriously consider not \nscheduling confirmation hearings on the nomination until after the \npolitical campaign season is over.'' While Vice President Biden might \nfeel differently about that today, that is what he said then as \nchairman of the committee.\n  In other words, deferring the confirmation process until the next \nPresident was in office was the most appropriate way for the Senate to \nfulfill its advice and consent role. Then-Chairman Biden listed several \nfactors that led him to this recommendation, and every one of these \nfactors exists today.\n  First, he noted that an appointment process in 1992 would take place \nin divided government. Different parties also control the White House \nand Senate today.\n  Second, he said that Presidents had recently made controversial \nSupreme Court appointments, noting that those nominees received a \nsignificant number of negative votes in the Senate. Again, the same is \ntrue today. President Obama's appointments of Sonia Sotomayor and Elena \nKagan, for example, are both among the top five most opposed Supreme \nCourt appointees in history.\n  Third, then-Chairman Biden noted that the Presidential election \nprocess had already begun. Once again, that is the case today. That is \nthe case today, with voters in numerous States having already cast \nballots.\n  Fourth, Chairman Biden said that the confirmation process itself had \nbecome increasingly divisive. This criterion strikes me as ironic, \ngiven its source. After all, Senate Democrats are responsible for \nprovoking the so-called confirmation wars with the political and \nideological inquisition used to defeat the Supreme Court nomination of \nRobert Bork and the despicable smear tactics used against the \nnomination of Clarence Thomas.\n  Senate Democrats have also been responsible for every major \nescalation in judicial confirmations since 1992.\n  Within 2 weeks of President George W. Bush's inauguration, the Senate \nDemocratic leader vowed to use ``whatever means necessary'' to defeat \nundesirable judicial nominees.\n  A few months later, Senate Democrats organized a retreat with the \ngoal, as the New York Times described it, of changing the ground rules \nfor the confirmation process.\n  In January 2002, former Democratic Congressman, appeals court judge, \nand White House Counsel Abner Mikva urged Senate Democrats not to \nconsider any Supreme Court nominees during President Bush's first term.\n  In 2003, Democrats began for the first time to use the filibuster to \ndefeat judicial nominees who otherwise would have been confirmed.\n  In July 2007, Senator Charles Schumer--another friend of mine--said \nin a speech to the American Constitution Society that the Senate should \nnot confirm a Supreme Court nominee during President Bush's final 18 \nmonths in\n\n[[Page S1028]]\n\noffice except in what he called ``extraordinary circumstances.''\n  When then-Chairman Biden said in 1992 that the state of the \nconfirmation process should defer consideration of any Supreme Court \nnominees, no judicial nominee had been defeated by a filibuster in \nnearly 25 years. During President George W. Bush's tenure alone, \nDemocrats led 20 filibusters that ultimately defeated five appeals \ncourt nominees.\n  More to the point, in 2006, then-Senators Biden, Clinton, Reid, \nLeahy, Schumer, Durbin, and Obama voted to filibuster the Supreme Court \nnomination of Samuel Alito. President Obama did say last week that he \nnow regrets voting to filibuster the Alito nomination, although it took \nhim 3,670 days to reach that conclusion. He told me that last night at \nthe White House in a private conversation we had, and I accept his \nstatement. I like the President personally, but the record does not \nsupport the other side's audacious claims.\n  Finally, after the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals--a \ncourt that many of us consider nearly as important as the Supreme \nCourt, given its role in regulatory oversight--rightfully invalidated \nseveral key actions of the Obama administration, Democrats openly \nsought to fill that court with compliant judges in order to obtain more \nfavorable decisions. The President's allies in this body, in their own \nwords, ``focus[ed] very intently on the D.C. Circuit'' to ``switch the \nmajority'' and were willing to ``fill up the D.C. Circuit one way or \nanother.''\n  In the rush to eliminate any possible judicial obstacle to the \nadministration's overreaching agenda, Senate Democrats in 2013 used a \nparliamentary maneuver--the so-called nuclear option--to abolish the \nvery nomination filibusters they had used so aggressively, but with one \ntelling exception: They left alone the possibility of filibustering a \nSupreme Court nomination. Having done so, they must continue to believe \nthe Senate's advice and consent role allows denying any confirmation \nvote to a Supreme Court nominee.\n  I am disappointed and, frankly, a little baffled at the response so \nfar of my Democratic colleagues. Now-Vice President Biden and President \nObama himself have both said that he was speaking in 1992 about a \n``hypothetical vacancy.'' Of course he was, and his purpose in doing so \nwas to outline what the President and Senate should do if that \nhypothetical vacancy materialized. Well, that vacancy is no longer \nhypothetical; it is very real. Yet the Vice President now says the \nSenate should not take his advice after all.\n\n  Vice President Biden has also said that his words from 1992 are being \ntaken out of context. We have all faced the inconvenient truth of our \npast words--especially in these areas--and the go-to objection is often \nabout context.\n  I have two suggestions. First, my colleagues should read then-\nChairman Biden's speech for themselves. It takes up 10 full pages in \nthe Congressional Record, so there is as much context as anyone could \npossibly want to consider. A second option is to consider how the media \nhad described that speech. One CBS news story, for example, has the \nheadline: ``Joe Biden Once Took GOP's Position on Supreme Court \nVacancy.'' Perhaps they, too, are contextually challenged.\n  This is what the Washington Post said about the speech: ``But Biden's \nremarks were especially pointed, voluminous and relevant to the current \nsituation. Embedded in the roughly 20,000 words he delivered on the \nSenate floor that day were rebuttals to virtually every point Democrats \nhave brought forth in the past week to argue for the consideration of \nObama's nominee.''\n  The constant refrain of Senate Democrats and their media allies over \nthe past few days is that the Senate should just ``do its job.'' Of \ncourse, what they really mean is that the Senate should do what they \nwant the Senate to do. Then-Chairman Biden believed in 1992 that the \nSenate would be doing its job by deferring the confirmation process for \na Supreme Court nominee. Senate Democrats presumably believed the \nSenate was doing its job by denying confirmation votes to judicial \nnominees under President George W. Bush. The minority leader presumably \nbelieved the Senate would be doing its job by not voting on nominations \nsince, as he said in 2005, the Constitution does not require it to do \nso. And I can only assume that the senior Senator from New York \nbelieved the Senate would be doing its job if it followed his 2007 \nrecommendation and refused to consider Supreme Court nominees in a \nPresident's final 18 months.\n  Perhaps the most audacious claim trafficked by the other side of the \naisle over the past few days is, as the senior Senator from New York \nhas said, ``It doesn't matter what anybody said in the past,'' or, as \nPresident Obama put it, ``Senators say stuff all the time.''\n  In response, consider this point: Benjamin Franklin wrote in 1789 \nthat ``in this world, nothing can be said to be certain except death \nand taxes.'' I would like to add one more thing to that list: It is \nequally certain that if a Supreme Court Justice beloved by the left \npassed away in the final year of a Republican President's tenure, a \nDemocratic-controlled Senate would not only refuse to consider any \nnominee of the lame-duck President but would also extensively cite \nthen-Chairman Biden's 1992 speech and other such clear statements for \nsupport. No one should have any doubt about that.\n  Indeed, my friends on the other side seem to have fallen into the \ntrap identified by Justice Scalia in his opinion in the Noel Canning \ncase in which he warned that ``individual Senators may have little \ninterest in opposing Presidential encroachment on legislative \nprerogatives, especially when the encroacher is a President who is the \nleader of their own party.''\n  Before I conclude, I cannot let pass the disturbing comments \nyesterday by my friend the minority leader about Judiciary Committee \nChairman Chuck Grassley. I have served with Senator Grassley for nearly \n25 years on the Finance Committee and for 35 years on the Judiciary \nCommittee. If there is anybody in this body who knows his own mind and \nmakes his own decisions, it is Chuck Grassley.\n  I was flabbergasted by the minority leader's statement that Chairman \nGrassley has allowed the majority leader to ``run roughshod'' over him. \nIf the minority leader's case for committee action depends on grasping \nat such unwarranted and unjustified personal attacks, then he has \nsimply exposed the weakness of his own position.\n  Under Chairman Grassley's leadership, the Judiciary Committee has \nreported 21 bipartisan bills. Five of them have become law--the same \nnumber as during the entire 113th Congress under Democratic leadership. \nThis record contrasts quite favorably to the senior Senator from \nNevada's abysmal record in the last Congress as majority leader, in \nwhich the Senate set a record for bills that bypassed committee \nconsideration and voted on only 15 amendments in all of 2014.\n  I know there are different opinions about whether or how to address \nfilling the vacancy left by Justice Scalia's death, and I appreciate \nthat. And I appreciate that Senators and others feel strongly about \nthese issues. Nevertheless, it is absolutely disingenuous for the \nminority leader, who today demands the same up-or-down confirmation \nvote he 25 times tried to prevent for Republican nominees, to suggest \nthat Chairman Grassley is doing anything other than what he believes is \nright. Senator Grassley is one of the great Senators here. He is \ntotally honest, and we all know it. He speaks his mind, and we all know \nthat, too.\n  I have served longer on the Judiciary Committee than any other \ncurrent Member of this body. During these past four decades, including \nduring my more than 8 years as chairman of the committee, I have \nstrived to develop a record of true fairness toward the nominations \nmade by Presidents of each party. I have absolutely no doubt that my \ntreatment of this vacancy fits squarely within this record of fairness.\n  The bottom line is simple: The Constitution obliges the Senate to \ntake its role seriously as a check on the President in the \nconsideration of lifetime appointments to the Federal courts, \nespecially the Supreme Court. With voting already underway to replace \nour lame-duck President, delaying consideration of a nomination until \nafter the election comports not only with historical practice but also \nwith the prescriptions of key Democrats in the Senate and the White \nHouse over many years. By protecting the integrity of the Supreme Court \nfrom this environment, Senate Republicans are unquestionably doing the \njob the Constitution charges\n\n[[Page S1029]]\n\nus to do. We can have differences, no question about it, but the Senate \nRepublicans are acting responsibly.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, next week the Supreme Court is going to \nhear oral arguments in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt. This is a \ncase that could not mean more to a woman's ability to exercise her \nconstitutionally protected health care rights. As this case now moves \nforward, I want to take a few minutes today to explain how much is at \nstake and why it is so critical that Texas's extreme anti-abortion law \nbe treated as exactly what it is: unconstitutional.\n  Madam President, in Texas and across the country, extreme rightwing \nconservatives continue to try and turn back the clock on American \nwomen. Just yesterday, the Fifth Circuit allowed a Louisiana law to go \ninto effect. That law would leave women with only one health center \nwhere they can exercise their reproductive rights.\n  This debate is frustrating, it is disappointing, and, frankly, it is \nappalling that in the 21st century--43 years since the historic ruling \nin Roe v. Wade--we even have to have a discussion about whether a woman \nhas the right to make her own decisions about her own body. But one \nthing that has always kept me going is seeing that when their health \nand their rights and their opportunities are at stake, women stand up \nand make it clear why reproductive freedom is so important.\n  As we have fought back against Texas's extreme anti-abortion law, \nwomen have explained that because they were able to plan when they had \nchildren, they were able to escape abusive relationships. They have \ntold us that because they had control over their own bodies, they were \nable to break cycles of poverty generations long and give back to their \ncommunities. They have shared their experiences of making the \nextraordinarily difficult decision to end a pregnancy out of medical \nnecessity. These are powerful stories about the difference self-\ndetermination makes for women. These stories are possible because of \nconstitutional rights affirmed in Roe v. Wade and protected in Planned \nParenthood v. Casey.\n  If Texas's extreme anti-abortion law stands, three-quarters of \nclinics in the State are expected to shut down--three-quarters of them. \nAs a result, 900,000 women of childbearing age in Texas will have to \ndrive as far as 300 miles round trip just to get the care they need. \nAnd women in States with laws like Texas will face similar barriers.\n  I believe strongly that a right means nothing without the ability to \nexercise that right. Laws like those in Texas and Louisiana, which are \ndriven by extreme conservative efforts to undermine women's access to \ncare, are, without question, getting in between women and their \nconstitutional rights, especially the rights of women who cannot afford \nto take off work and drive hundreds of miles when they need health \ncare.\n  Put simply: Texas's extreme anti-abortion law and laws like it across \nthe country threaten women's lives. These laws are intended to take \nwomen back to the days before Roe v. Wade when women had less control \nover their bodies and their futures.\n  As a mother, as a grandmother, and as a U.S. Senator, I know that is \nabsolutely the wrong direction for our country. Our daughters and \ngranddaughters should have more opportunity and stronger rights, not \nless. That is why 163 Democratic and Independent Members of the House \nand Senate urged the Supreme Court in an amicus brief to stand up for \nwomen's constitutionally protected health care rights. And it is the \nreason that even some of our Republican colleagues are focused on doing \neverything they can to undermine the Supreme Court.\n  My Democratic colleagues and I are focused on how much the Court's \ndecision in this case will mean for women now and for generations to \ncome. So instead of trying to obstruct justice, we are urging the \nSupreme Court to ensure justice by upholding settled law. For women, \nbeing able to exercise their constitutionally protected reproductive \nrights means health, it means freedom, and it means opportunity. We \ncannot and we should not go backward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/senate-section/article/S1029-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1029-S1030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL CHILDREN'S DENTAL HEALTH MONTH\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I rise today to recognize February as \nNational Children's Dental Health Month. Since 1981, this month has \nafforded us the opportunity to acknowledge the importance of children's \ndental health, recognize the significant strides we have made and the \nwork that remains to be done, and renew our commitment to ensuring all \nchildren in our country have access to affordable and comprehensive \ndental services. To echo former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, \n``there is no health without oral health.''\n  Despite being largely preventable, tooth decay is the single most \nchronic health condition among children and adolescents in the United \nStates. It is 5 times more common than asthma and 20 times more common \nthan diabetes. Nearly half, 44 percent, of the children in the United \nStates will have at least one cavity by the time they start \nkindergarten. Children with cavities in their primary or ``baby'' teeth \nare three times more likely to develop cavities in their permanent \nadult teeth, and the early loss of baby teeth can make it harder for \npermanent teeth to grow in properly.\n  Left untreated, tooth decay can not only destroy a child's teeth, but \nalso can have a debilitating impact on his or her health and quality of \nlife. Tooth and gum pain can impede a child's healthy development, \nincluding the ability to learn, play, and eat nutritious foods. Recent \nstudies have shown that children with poor oral health are nearly three \ntimes more likely to miss school due to dental pain, and children \nreporting recent toothaches are four times more likely to have a lower \ngrade point average than their peers without dental pain.\n  Tooth decay and oral health problems also disproportionately affect \nchildren from low-income families and minority communities. According \nto the National Institutes of Health, approximately 80 percent of \nchildhood dental disease is concentrated in 25 percent of the \npopulation. These children and families often face inordinately high \nbarriers to receiving essential oral health care, and, simply put, the \nconsequences can be devastating.\n  Madam President, many have heard me speak before about the tragic \nloss of Deamonte Driver, a 12-year-old Prince George's County resident. \nIn 2007, Deamonte's death was particularly heartbreaking because it was \nentirely preventable. What started out as a toothache turned into a \nsevere brain infection that could have been prevented by an $80 \nextraction. After multiple surgeries and a lengthy hospital stay, \nsadly, Deamonte passed away--9 years ago today. So today we mark the \nninth anniversary of his tragic death.\n  Since the tragic death of Deamonte in 2007, we have made significant \nprogress in improving access to pediatric dental care in the country. \nFor example, in 2009, Congress reauthorized the Children's Health \nInsurance Program--CHIP--with an important addition: a guaranteed \npediatric dental benefit. Today, CHIP provides affordable comprehensive \nhealth coverage, including dental coverage, to more than 8 million \nchildren. Thanks to CHIP, we now have the highest number of children in \nhistory with medical and dental coverage. In addition, in 2010, \nCongress included pediatric dental services in the set of essential \nhealth benefits established under the Affordable Care Act.\n  I am very proud my State of Maryland has been recognized as a \nnational leader in pediatric dental health coverage. In a 2011 Pew \nCenter report, ``The State of Children's Dental Health,'' Maryland \nearned an A and was the only State to meet seven of the eight policy \nbenchmarks for addressing children's dental health needs.\n  In addition, in the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, every qualified \nhealth plan now includes pediatric dental coverage, so families do not \nhave to pay a separate premium for dental coverage for their children \nand do not have a separate deductible or out-of-\n\n[[Page S1030]]\n\npocket limit for pediatric dental services.\n  However, Madam President, more work remains to be done. For example, \naccording to a recent report by the Department of Health and Human \nServices Office of Inspector General, three out of four children \ncovered by Medicaid did not receive all required dental services over a \nrecent 2-year period, with one in every four failing to see a dentist \nat all. This is simply unacceptable. We must act to ensure that all \nAmerican children have access to comprehensive oral health care.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort. Tragically, our \nhealth care system was not there for Deamonte. Today, on the ninth \nanniversary of his death, let us honor his memory and pledge to do \nbetter for the children in our country by working together to build on \nthe significant strides we have made over the past 9 years, and to \nensure that all children have access to affordable and comprehensive \npediatric dental services.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/senate-section/article/S1030-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1030-S1031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SENATE ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, notwithstanding our occasional dustups \nand kerfuffles and disagreements that we have in the Senate--and that \nis not a bad thing--the Senate is supposed to be a place where \ndifferences of opinion and different points of view are debated, voted \non, and played out here on the floor of the Senate in an attempt to \nachieve consensus on a bipartisan basis and make legislative progress \nfor the American people.\n  I have to say that since 2015, under new leadership, this Chamber has \nbeen marked by a spirit of hard work, bipartisanship, and \naccomplishment. I am sure we have all been frustrated by the things we \ncannot accomplish because, frankly, there is no consensus, but that \nshouldn't deter us from working together where we can to make progress \nfor the American people. So I am frankly proud of what the Senate has \ndone, again on a bipartisan basis.\n  I think one of the greatest frustrations under the previous \nleadership was that even if you were a Member of the majority party, \nyou could not get amendments on legislation. You could not get votes on \namendments. So you were basically shut out of the process, not just if \nyou were in the minority but including when you were in the majority. \nThat is a little hard to explain to your constituents back home. \nIndeed, I think that is one reason we saw some races for the Senate \nturn around the way they did in 2014.\n  The truth is that under new leadership we have proved we can work \ntogether on the issues that matter most to the people of our country. \nThat is not to say there will not be some partisan differences. There \nis a reason people choose to be Republicans or Democrats. But my \nexperience has been that most of the time we agree on the goal, just \nnot on the means to achieve the goal.\n  While bipartisanship is important, leadership really does matter, and \nI think we have seen what a difference it can make in the 114th \nCongress--since the last election in 2014. I will mention just a couple \nof examples.\n  One is the first major overhaul to education reform since No Child \nLeft Behind. We also passed a major long-term Transportation bill. I \nknow it seems like a small thing in isolation, but it really does make \na difference to fast-growing States such as mine--Texas--to be able to \nplan ahead when it comes to maintaining and operating our \ntransportation infrastructure. Frankly, it saves taxpayer money when \nyou can plan on the long haul rather than in a series of starts and \nstops.\n  A subject that is near and dear to my heart is the first major help \nwe have been able to provide to victims of human trafficking in 25 \nyears. Because of a resource deficit at the local level, a lot of big-\nhearted people who wanted to help simply didn't have the resources to \ndo it--simple things such as rescuing people who are victims of human \ntrafficking and providing them a safe place to stay. Now, as a result \nof the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, we are going to be able \nto provide through a victim's compensation fund up to $60 million a \nyear to help provide grants for housing, for rescue, and for victims of \nhuman trafficking.\n  It is true there are some differences between the political parties, \nand that shouldn't be a matter for panic. We shouldn't say: Well, I \nguess we can't do anything since we can't do this one thing. It is \ncertainly true with respect to the recent passing of Supreme Court \nJustice Antonin Scalia.\n  It is clear that we have reached a major point of disagreement or I \nguess you could look at it this way: We actually are agreeing with the \nposition that Vice President Biden took when he was chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. We are now agreeing with the position that \nwas taken by then-Senate Democratic leader Reid, and we are agreeing \nwith the position that was taken in 2007 by Senator Chuck Schumer, a \nMember of the senior Senate leadership of the Democratic Party.\n  I mentioned these yesterday. I will just go over them really quickly \nagain. Surely, our Democratic friends don't think that Republicans, \nwhen we are in the majority, ought to be constrained by different rules \nthan apply to them. That does not make any sense at all. How foolish we \nwould be, in the majority, to say that this is the way that Democrats \nview the rules and that we are going to apply a different set of rules \nto ourselves.\n  This is what Senator Reid said in 2005. He said:\n\n       The duties of the Senate are set forth in the U.S. \n     Constitution. Nowhere in that document does it say the Senate \n     has a duty to give Presidential appointees a vote.\n\n  That is a fact. Senator Reid is correct. The President proposes a \nnominee, and the Senate either grants or withholds consent under the \nterms of the Constitution itself. But of course, that is what Senator \nReid was suggesting back when George W. Bush was President of the \nUnited States--that the Senate was under no obligation to even give \nthose nominees a vote.\n  Then, more recently, there is Senator Schumer, who I know is really \nstirred up about our intention not to process a nominee this year and \nto have a referendum as a result of this Presidential election on who \nmakes that appointment--perhaps for the next 30 years. That is how long \nJustice Scalia served on the Supreme Court of the United States. But \nhere is Senator Chuck Schumer, the senior Senator from New York. This \nwas 18 months before President George W. Bush left office--18 months, \nor a year and a half, before he left office.\n  Senator Schumer said: For the rest of this President's term, we \n``should reverse the presumption of confirmation.'' In other words, he \nwas saying there was a presumption against confirming. He said he would \nrecommend to his colleagues that we should ``not confirm a Supreme \nCourt nominee except in extraordinary circumstances.''\n  Then, of course, more recently a little research was done into the \nrecord of Vice President Biden when he was Chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee back in 1992. He said: The Senate Judiciary \nCommittee should seriously consider not scheduling confirmation \nhearings on the nomination until after the political campaign season is \nover. Action on a Supreme Court nomination must be put off until after \nthe election campaign is over.\n  So it strikes me as rather hypocritical for our Democratic friends to \nsay that these were the rules when George W. Bush was in office or when \nhis father, George Herbert Walker Bush, was in office, in the case of \n1992, but now that President Obama is in office, a different set of \nrules ought to apply.\n  It would be completely hypocritical of them to say that. But this is \na matter of disagreement. There is no debate about that. But it does \nnot mean that just because we are divided along party lines on this \nmatter that there are other things we cannot do together. I think our \nfriends across the aisle would agree that there is a lot of important \nwork that we can and should do together.\n  The chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, along \nwith the ranking member from Washington, has worked diligently on \nenergy legislation that we are currently considering. It is legislation \nthat would update and modernize our country's energy infrastructure for \nthe 21st century. We still need to find a way forward to deal with this \nlegislation. I\n\n[[Page S1031]]\n\nknow this is an opinion that many members on the Energy Committee and \nin this Chamber share on a bipartisan basis.\n  There is another piece of legislation that has strong bipartisan \nsupport that was voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nunanimously, called the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, known \nas CARA. This legislation is in response to the growing opioid abuse \nepidemic that affects our Nation, an epidemic that has claimed the \nlives of tens of thousands of Americans each year, along with the \nconcomitant scourge of cheap heroin coming across our borders from \nMexico, because when people can't get the prescription drugs--the \nopioids--then too many of them revert to cheaper heroin with disastrous \nconsequences.\n  I know that on a bipartisan basis the junior Senators from New \nHampshire and Ohio have particularly led on this on my side of the \naisle. But they have worked with the junior Senator from Rhode Island, \nMr. Whitehouse, and the senior Senator from Minnesota, Ms. Klobuchar, \nto make this a top priority. So we are going to have a chance to show \nvery soon that we are committed to actually getting important \nlegislation, such as the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, \npassed by this Chamber.\n  This week also, the senior Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, who is \nthe ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and I introduced \nlegislation called the Justice for All Reauthorization Act. That bill \nwould provide important resources to victims of domestic violence, and \nit would target resources on the rape kit backlog, which is, just \nfrankly, an embarrassment to our criminal justice system.\n  It has been estimated that there are as many as 400,000 rape kits; \nthat is, forensic evidence taken after a sexual assault that would, if \ntested, reveal the identity of the attacker through DNA testing.\n  There is just no excuse not to test those rape kits, which are part \nof that backlog. We know that many of the assailants in these cases are \nserial abusers, and many times we can stop someone before they attack \nagain, if we will just test those kits. There is about $120 million \neach year that Congress appropriates for the Debbie Smith Act. Debbie \nSmith is the person for whom this legislation is named--and quite \nappropriately so. She has been a champion of eliminating that rape kit \nbacklog. That is a large part of what the Justice for All \nReauthorization Act would help us do.\n  So I would ask our friends across the aisle, while they come out on \nthe floor or give press conferences and express mock horror at the fact \nthat Republicans in the majority now would apply the same standards \nthat they advocated for when they were in the majority, to tone down \nthe rhetoric and avoid the hypocrisy that seems so apparent when they \nargue for different standards today than they advocated in the past. \nThat is nothing more, nothing less than hypocritical.\n  What is out of line is when you have personal attacks against the \nMembers of the Senate, particularly the chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. The minority leader, the Democratic leader, made a \npersonal attack against the chairman of the Judiciary Committee right \nhere on the Senate floor just yesterday. What he said was so far from \nthe truth that it is not even worth repeating.\n  But what I would like to make clear is that Chairman Grassley, the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, has made a big impression on this \nChamber and on the legislation that we have passed. I mentioned the \nCARA Act that passed out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously. \nSenator Grassley has a decades-long dedication to serving the people of \nIowa in this body.\n  So I don't know how the Democratic leader can come out and personally \nattack a colleague who has done an outstanding job as chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, while basically what we are embracing is what he \nhimself argued for in 2005. How does that work?\n  Well, I would say the Democratic leader does not have a lot of firm \nground to stand on when it comes to judicial nominations. I would like \nto remind my colleagues that the Democratic leader, just a few short \nyears ago, took the position that there were no fixed rules when it \ncomes to judicial nominations. Then, in 2014, he simply tore up the \nrule book by invoking the so-called nuclear option, breaking the rules \nto change the rules on judicial nominations, as he attempted--\nsuccessfully, I will say--to pack the District of Columbia Court of \nAppeals by breaking the rules of the Senate in order to pack the \nDistrict of Columbia Court of Appeals, which many have said is the \nsecond most important court in the Nation.\n  So I hope he will take into consideration his prior actions, which \nare far more disruptive and poisoned the well of this institution more \nthan anything we are talking about doing now, especially when we are \nagreeing with him, at least on this point.\n  But most of all, I would hope that we can conduct our debates in a \ncivil and a dignified fashion. People watch what we do and we say here. \nWhen people come out here and make hypocritical attacks, I don't think \nit reflects very well on the person making that attack, and I don't \nthink it reflects well on the Senate as a body. It is certainly not a \ngood example for our young people or other people who might be looking \nat how we conduct ourselves as they think: Well, that is the way we air \nour differences. Then certainly they can be forgiven for thinking: \nWell, maybe that is the way I ought to conduct myself. That is not the \nmessage we should be conveying.\n  Well, we can continue to do a lot of good work here on a bipartisan \nbasis in the Senate this year. It is true that we do have a major \ndifference of opinion when it comes to filling the vacancy left by the \nuntimely death of Justice Scalia. But it is true that we are only \napplying the rules that were advocated for by the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, now Vice President Biden, in 1992, and by minority \nleader Reid in 2005 and Senator Schumer in 2007.\n  Surely they cannot expect us to apply a different set of rules today \nthan they themselves said they would apply if the shoe were on the \nother foot. But we can still work together on other legislation, such \nas the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, such as the energy \nlegislation we are considering now, because we do have a lot of work \nleft to do, and there is a lot we can accomplish together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to speak today \non a bipartisan pipeline safety bill that will soon be considered by \nthe full Senate.\n  Last December, the Senate Commerce Committee unanimously passed \nlegislation to strengthen pipeline safety across our Nation. I have \nbeen working with my colleagues, Senator Booker, the Presiding Officer \nSenator Daines, and Senator Peters, on this bill for nearly 9 months, \nand we are proud of this bipartisan legislation.\n  Over the past several months, we have held several hearings, \nincluding one in the Presiding Officer's home State, in Billings, MO, \nlast September. Not far from Billings, in January of 2015, the Poplar \nPipeline spilled nearly 30,000 gallons of crude oil into the State's \nprecious Yellowstone River. This incident reinforced the need for a \nrobust update to our laws regarding both the pipeline system and the \ngovernment agency charged with keeping it safe.\n  Pipeline infrastructure transports vital energy resources to homes, \nbusinesses, schools, and commercial centers across the United States. \nAccording to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety \nAdministration, or PHMSA, more than 2.5 million miles of pipelines \ntraverse this country. Our bill, the SAFE PIPES Act, would increase \ncongressional oversight over pipeline safety programs at PHMSA. It \nwould also provide greater flexibility and resources to State pipeline \nsafety officials. Further, the bill would require PHMSA to reprioritize \ncongressional directives and conduct an assessment of the pipeline \nintegrity management program.\n\n[[Page S1032]]\n\n  Pipeline safety affects citizens in each and every one of our States. \nIn my home State of Nebraska, we experienced this just a couple months \nago. In January, a ruptured natural gas pipeline exploded in the Old \nMarket area of downtown Omaha. The disaster destroyed a historic \nbuilding, and it did injure several people. The SAFE PIPES Act would \nencourage the use of advanced technology for pipeline mapping and help \navoid accidents like this moving forward.\n  In California, the massive Aliso Canyon underground natural gas \nstorage facility leak posed a serious public health threat and \ndisplaced hundreds of families from their homes. The SAFE PIPES Act \nwould direct PHMSA to create crucial minimum standards for underground \nnatural gas storage facilities. It would also establish an Aliso Canyon \nworking group to ensure that similar incidents are avoided in the \nfuture. I appreciate the strong support provided by the California \nSenators, Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, who helped draft the \nworking group provisions there. They also serve as cosponsors of our \nSAFE PIPES Act.\n  The Senate must pass this robust, bipartisan legislation. We all have \na responsibility to prioritize not only the efficient permitting and \nconstruction of energy infrastructure but also the safety and the \nsecurity of our Nation's extensive pipeline network.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, John Orizotti, most famously known as \n``Pork Chop John,'' passed away on Monday in his Butte home at the age \nof 82. Montanans know John for his efforts to expand his restaurant's \nflourishing business. John bought Pork Chop John on 8 West Mercury \nStreet in 1969, when sandwiches sold for 65 cents.\n  According to his oldest son Rick Orizotti, owning the shop was \nsomething he wanted to do his whole life, and he always kept his eye on \nit. Rick said: ``He was truly very proud to be Pork Chop John. He was a \nman that really loved going to work, really worked hard.''\n  John was born in Butte on September 25, 1933. He graduated from Butte \nHigh School in 1951 and married his high school sweetheart Mary Carol \nwhen he was 21 and she was 19.\n  He worked for his father-in-law Dan Piazzola at the Better Meat \nMarket and then went on to open the Main Public Market in 1960 with \nPiazzola before buying Pork Chop John 9 years later. The restaurant has \nexpanded to a second location on 2400 Harrison Avenue, which was \nformerly a Texaco gas station. After John retired 20 years ago, two of \nhis sons, Ed and Tom Orizotti, took over the restaurant and currently \nrun Pork Chop John.\n  I remember as a kid in Montana, it was the stop you made when you \nwere on a trip. It didn't matter whether you were on a sports trip, \nband trip or a speech debate trip, you stopped at Pork Chop John's in \nButte to grab something to eat.\n  In fact, the very first stop my wife and I made after we announced \nour campaign for the U.S. Congress in Bozeman was at Pork Chop John's \nin Butte to grab a sandwich.\n  All seven of Orizotti's children have worked at the restaurant at \nsome point in their lives and the pork chop batter recipe remains a \nfamily secret to this day. The restaurant itself has been in the family \nfor 47 years.\n  John was greatly beloved by many in his community. His past employees \nand friends have nothing but wonderful things to say about him, \nincluding how he would put his whole heart into all of his endeavors. \nOthers called him gentle, caring, honest, and never having a bad word \nto say about anybody. He has probably been best described as one of the \nlegends of Butte and a ``Butte icon.''\n  John Orizotti made a lasting impact on his family, community, and \nbusiness. May his legacy of hard work and kind heart be forever honored \nand remembered.\n  Cindy and I offer our deepest condolences to the family.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the sudden passing and tragic death of \nU.S. Supreme Court Justice Scalia leaves us with a vacancy to fill on \nour country's highest Court, but it shouldn't lead us to a yearlong \npolitical standoff.\n  Article II, section 2, of the Constitution is clear: The President \nshall nominate a Supreme Court Justice with the advice and consent of \nthe Senate. It doesn't say ``may.'' It doesn't say ``maybe.'' It isn't \nfollowed by a clause which says that Senators don't have to do their \njobs in an election year. It doesn't say anything about that. And that \nis the tradition of our country, that Senators--we run for office \nwillingly, enthusiastically. We work hard to get here. We take an oath \nof office. Every couple of weeks, we get a paycheck. And some are \nsaying we simply shouldn't do our job and move forward with this \nnomination.\n  Complete refusal to consider any nominee from this President is \noutrageous. It is indefensible, and it is unprecedented in spite of \nwhat some of my colleagues would like to say. Don't take my word for \nit. Senator Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, said as recently as 2008 that ``the reality is that the \nSenate has never stopped confirming judicial nominees during the last \nfew months of a President's term.'' The country didn't elect Barack \nObama--whether you voted for him or against him--for a 3-year term or \nthree-fifths of a term; the country elected him for a 4-year term.\n  Since the Civil War, no Supreme Court vacancy has been left open for \na year. For the past century, the Senate has taken action on every \nsingle pending Supreme Court nominee.\n  I talk to people in Ohio all the time, Republicans and Democrats \nalike. I talked to a Republican today who supports Senator Rubio for \nPresident and probably votes for Republicans for President in every \nelection. He said: I just can't believe what Mitch McConnell did. I \ncan't believe my party--the people I vote for in Senate races and House \nraces--would possibly say that we are not going to have a hearing on \nthis nominee.\n  We are not even going to meet with this nominee. I mean, a number of \nSenate Republicans said: We won't even shake hands. We aren't even \nwilling to meet with a Supreme Court nominee whom the President of the \nUnited States, under the Constitution, shall appoint, whom the \nPresident of the United States submits to the U.S. Senate.\n  Let's look at what has happened in the past. In 1988, which was \nPresident Reagan's final year in office, a Democratic majority \nunanimously confirmed Justice Anthony Kennedy. That was in 1988. Again, \nPresident Reagan submitted his name in 1988. He was confirmed by a \nDemocratic Senate. In fact, the Senate has been confirming Justices in \nPresidential elections since our Nation's founding. Two of President \nWashington's nominees were confirmed during his last years in office. \nSince 1916, every pending Supreme Court nominee has either received a \nhearing or been confirmed quickly before a hearing even took place. \nThink about that. A pending Supreme Court nominee has never been denied \na hearing in the history of the United States. The only exception is \nthe nominees who were confirmed without a hearing. Yet, within hours--I \nthink only minutes, actually--within less than an hour, I believe, of \nthe announcement of\n\n[[Page S1033]]\n\nJustice Scalia's passing, the Republican leader of the Senate, the \nmajority leader of the Senate pretty much said: We are not going to do \nour job. We are not even going to have a hearing on whomever the \nPresident of the United States nominates. We are not only not going to \nhave a hearing, he then said later, I am not even going to meet with \nthat person. Imagine that.\n  So that nomination--whomever President Obama nominates--that vacancy \nwill be more than a year for sure if the Senate does nothing on this \nconfirmation. Again, the last time there was a vacancy for as long as 1 \nyear was during the Civil War. It was 150 years ago. That is because \nthere was a Civil War and the Congress wasn't very functional in those \ndays. Members were leaving the Court, leaving the Senate and House \nafter secession in 1861 and all the other things that happened.\n  We have nearly a year left in President Obama's term, about a quarter \nof the term the American people elected him to serve. That is plenty of \ntime for the Senate to carefully consider and review a nominee.\n  President Obama--and just to make it clear, he was not just elected, \nhe was elected decisively. I believe he is only the second Democrat in \nAmerican history--surely the second Democrat since the Civil War--he is \nonly the second Democrat since the Civil War to at least twice win a \nmajority of the popular vote. Only President Obama, who got more than \n50 percent of the vote twice, and President Roosevelt, who got more \nthan 50 percent of the vote, I believe, four times--they were the only \nDemocrats in 150 years who got a majority of the vote twice. President \nClinton was elected twice with a plurality. President Wilson was \nelected twice with a plurality. President Obama and President Roosevelt \nwere decisive wins. This wasn't an accidental win. This wasn't a \ncandidate put into office by a decision of the U.S. Supreme Court. This \nwas a legitimate election and a decisive win.\n  Let's look at some of those nominees. The longest nomination on \nrecord was Justice Brandeis, who I believe was the first Jewish \nAmerican to be appointed to the Supreme Court. His took 125 days. \nPresident Obama has more than 300 days left in his term.\n  If we fail to confirm a nominee, if Senate Republicans fail to do \ntheir job--they were elected. They were sworn in. They get paid. All of \nus do. We are just asking them to do their job. But if Senate \nRepublicans don't do their job, two Supreme Court terms will pass \nbefore a new Justice is appointed.\n  Yesterday I spoke with Professor Peter Shane, a constitutional law \nprofessor at Ohio State's Moritz College of Law in Columbus. Professor \nShane said that a vacancy of this unprecedented length on the Supreme \nCourt ``will compromise its ability to perform its proper \nconstitutional function'' and it will create ``prolonged uncertainty.''\n  I have heard so many Republicans in the Senate say that we do all \nthese things and create uncertainty--uncertainty in the economy, \nuncertainty in regulation, uncertainty in the consumer bureau, \nwhatever. This is the worst kind of uncertainty. It is self-afflicted, \nand it affects entirely one-third of the government, one of the three \nbranches of government. Without a full bench, justice could be further \ndelayed for Americans who fought for years to have their cases heard. \nSplit decisions--4 to 4 would leave legal questions unanswered and \nleave Americans in different parts of the country subject to different \nlaws. How do we prevent that? Do your job, I say to my colleagues in \nthe Senate.\n\n  In the past, Senator McConnell himself has agreed with a normal, \ndeliberative approach for Supreme Court nominees. He said in 2005: \n``Our job is to react to that nomination in a respectful and dignified \nway, and at the end of the process, to give that person an up-or-down \nvote as all nominees who have majority support have gotten throughout \nthe history of the country.''\n  That is what he said a decade ago.\n  Now he is saying the Senate will not even do our jobs. Again, we run \nfor these offices, we get sworn in to these offices when we win \nelections, we get paid every two weeks; we should be doing our job. I \nam not saying every Republican has to vote for the President's nominee. \nWhat we are saying is meet with them. The President will do the \nnomination. We should begin hearings. We should meet with these \nnominees individually. For every Supreme Court nomination since I have \nbeen in the Senate, I have had an hour-long meeting with each nominee, \nand we then make our decisions based on that. We have not said we are \nnot going to do our work, we are not going to do our jobs. How would \nthat make sense?\n  The only difference now is that we have a different President. Time \nand again the Democrats in the Senate have given Republican Supreme \nCourt nominees a fair hearing and the up-or-down vote they deserve. \nDuring the 7 years the Vice President chaired the Judiciary Committee, \nwhen he was a Senator here, he did his job. He oversaw the confirmation \nof three Justices who were nominated by Republican Presidents.\n  In the case of Clarence Thomas, he even allowed Justice Thomas to \nhave an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor, even though the committee \nfailed to report his nomination with a favorable recommendation. So \nwhat does that mean? That means that when Clarence Thomas was in front \nof the Judiciary Committee, a majority of members said no, they didn't \nwant to confirm him, yet they still moved his nomination to the floor. \nThey didn't filibuster. They didn't require 60 votes. They just said: A \nmajority vote wins. Thomas won. Even though Democratic leadership voted \nagainst him, Thomas won 52-48. Nobody blocked him, which they could \nhave easily done. And the Senate did its job, the same thing we are \nasking the Senate to do today.\n  Both Justice Thomas and Justice Alito were confirmed by the Senate \nwith fewer than 60 votes. That means, again, they could have blocked \nthem with a filibuster. They didn't. They allowed both of them to come \nforward. Even though they had lots of opposition, they still allowed an \nup-or-down vote. Yet this time Senate Republicans are refusing to hold \nhearings and are, in many cases, even refusing to meet with the \nnominee.\n  Do your job. You were sworn in. You ran for these offices and then \nyou were sworn in. Do your job. You get paid to do these jobs. Show up \nfor work and do your job.\n  Can we imagine how Republicans would have reacted if Democrats had \nshown Ronald Reagan this same disrespect when we considered Justice \nKennedy's nomination? I wasn't here then, but we certainly understand \nthe history of the story.\n  The consistent attempt to delegitimize a democratically elected \nPresident is politics at its worst. In 2013, the Republicans didn't \nlike the results of the 2012 election, so they shut down the \ngovernment. Three years later they still don't like the results of the \n2012 election, so they are saying: Well, forget the 2012 election, this \nis all about the 2016 election.\n  What it is really about is that the President of the United States \nwas elected in 2012 with the majority of the vote and in an electoral \ncollege landslide. He was elected for a 4-year term--not a 3-year and \n1-month term, not three-fifths of a term--a 4-year term. American \nhistory, in spite of what my colleagues like to say with their \nrevisionist history--in spite of what they like to say about \nrevisionist history, the fact is we have done this in the fourth year \nor the eighth year of many Presidents. Now they are trying to--as they \nshut down the government in response to the 2012 election of which they \ndidn't like the outcome, now they are trying to shut down the Supreme \nCourt process with a year left in this President's term. You don't shut \nthe whole system down when you don't get your way. It is a dangerous \nprecedent that undermines our democracy.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle justified this saying: We \nneed to let the people make the choice. Well, they did. They made their \nchoice in 2012 by selecting a President for a 4-year term. This is the \nfourth year of his term. There is no reason this President shouldn't \nhave the obligation and the right to nominate a candidate and send a \nname to the Senate, and there is no reason that Senators shouldn't do \ntheir jobs--have hearings, meet with the nominee, bring him to the \nfloor for a vote with a 50-vote threshold--a majority vote--and see \nwhat happens. They may vote no. If they vote no, that is a legitimate \nexercise, but if they are\n\n[[Page S1034]]\n\nnot willing to go through the process and see what might happen--see \nwhat the public judges as the right decision in whether to confirm or \nnot--they are not doing their jobs.\n  It may be asking too much when I have seen the partisanship and the \nhead-in-the-sand attitudes and the fight-this-president-at-all-costs \nviews of so many on the other side, but I expect this Senate to put \npolitics aside and give a fair hearing and an up-or-down vote to any \nqualified nominee because that is our job.\n  Simply put, we need to do our job.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst).

A natural leader, he quickly rose through the ranks, serving as \nan assistant squad leader, fire team leader, and squad leader before \nhis last assignment as a fire support sergeant.\n  Jeff exhibited outstanding leadership as a member of Troop A in the \n1-167th Cavalry of the Nebraska Army National Guard. Friends remember \nJeff as an awesome teacher and an amazing mentor. SGT Brad Jessen \nrecalls how Jeff was very soft spoken, but he always had something \nintelligent to say.\n  In civilian life, Jeff became a Kearney police officer in 2002, and \nhe later joined the Department of Veterans Affairs Police force in \nGrand Island. James Arends, who worked with him as a sergeant in the VA \nPolice Service, said, ``Jeff was the strong, silent type. He didn't \ntalk a lot, but when he did, people listened.''\n  Jeff was also a loving husband. He met his wife Jenny at a football \ngame at the University of Nebraska at Kearney. Fate brought them \ntogether, and they began a natural and a comfortable relationship that \nblossomed quickly. Jenny excelled at golf in college. Jeff would attend \nher tournaments, cheering her on as the team progressed to a winning \nseason. Then, after the final round of the 2002 NCAA Division II \nWomen's Golf Tournament, Jeff came up to Jenny on the 18th green where \nhe knelt down and proposed.\n  That same year, Jeff was promoted to sergeant and recognized for \noutstanding gunnery marksmanship. Jeff and Jenny also began discussing \ntheir future plans. Their talks became more intense when Jeff's unit, \nthe 1-167th Cavalry, was called to duty in Bosnia.\n  Jeff and Jenny wasted no time, and they were married on October 12, \n2002. Two days later, Jeff left for Bosnia. After 11 months, Jeff \nreturned home and the two settled down back in Cairo, NE.\n  A world away, the war in Iraq continued. By the fall of 2005, the \nAmerican public was hopeful that major military operations in the \nregion would be coming to an end. However, the bombing of the al-Askari \nmosque in February of 2006 ignited a Sunni-Shia civil war that plunged \nIraq deeper into violence. At that time, the American military was \noperating as a peacekeeping force, but things quickly turned deadly, \nand the coalition found themselves engaged in dramatic wartime \noperations.\n  Jeff's unit arrived in Iraq just before the al-Askari mosque bombing. \nOperating out of Balad Air Base, his unit, ``the Cav,'' was known for \ntheir ability to complete security operations in one of the most \nviolent areas of the country. The days were long, and with each mission \nthey faced imminent danger. All the while, Jeff kept his head in the \ngame and inspired his battle buddies to do the same.\n  While Jeff was gone, Jenny remained active, and she continued to \nexcel on the golf course. She won the Nebraska Women's State Amateur \nGolf Championship and qualified for the 2006 U.S. Women's Amateur Open. \nAs she continued to advance, Jenny began thinking about playing the \nsport professionally, so she wrote to Jeff, asking for his guidance and \nthoughts on this important new stage--one they would share and navigate \non their journey together.\n  Back in Iraq, Jeff headed out on patrol where conditions worsened \nwith limited visibility. Out of nowhere, Jeff's humvee hit a sinkhole \nand it flipped, landing upside down in a canal. As this was unfolding, \nJeff pushed the other soldiers out of the vehicle, all of whom survived \nthe crash. Meanwhile, Jeff was still in the humvee and critically \ninjured. SGT Brad Jessen remained at the scene, keeping Jeff alive \nuntil the medical team arrived. Jeff was quickly flown to Germany for \nemergency care.\n  Jenny was at work when the phone rang. ``There's been an accident,'' \nshe was told. ``We need you to come to Germany.''\n  It seemed like an eternity before Jenny was able to reach Jeff's side \nat the hospital in Germany. As soon as she arrived, it was clear Jeff \nwas not going to make it home. He passed away a few days later, with \nJenny at his side.\n  Jenny returned home to Nebraska, saying goodbye to Jeff one last time \nand bracing for a life without the man she loved.\n  Shortly after the funeral, a letter arrived. It was from Jeff, and \nthere was a reply to her questions about golf and their future. He had \nwritten to tell his wife to pursue her dream. He told her to find the \nfocus and dedication that she yearned for in her life. If there was \nsomething she wanted to pursue, he would support her every step of the \nway.\n  So Jenny pursued that dream. She competed for and she earned a spot \non the Ladies Professional Golf Association tour, and she played in a \nnumber of professional tournaments.\n  But as any Nebraskan can understand, ``the good life'' pulled her \nback. Today, she is the mother of three beautiful children. She still \nreads the letters from Jeff every once in a while, and Jeff is with her \nevery day in her heart.\n\n  For his service in Iraq, Jeff was awarded the Iraqi Campaign Medal, \nthe Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, and the Armed Forces Reserve \nMedal. He was also posthumously awarded the Bronze Star, the Army Good \nConduct Medal, and the Overseas Service Ribbon.\n  Jeff is survived by his widow Jenny, his father Robert, and his \nbrother Jeremy. Our Nation and all Nebraskans are forever indebted to \nhis service and sacrifice.\n  SGT Jeffrey Hansen is a hero, and I am honored to tell his story, \nlest we forget his life and the freedom he fought to defend.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/senate-section/article/S1034-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1034-S1036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I think we are all very touched and \nmoved by Senator Fischer's remarks and the thoughts of the entire body \ngo out to Sergeant Hansen's family and those he left behind.\n  I am on the floor today with no better news. We all woke up just days \nago to the news of another mass shooting, this time in Kalamazoo. \nSaturday, another community was changed forever by gun violence. We \nlive it every day in Connecticut, still mourning 20 dead first-graders \nand 6 teachers who protected them.\n  In this case, the alleged killer used a semiautomatic handgun to kill \nsix people and injure at least two others\n\n[[Page S1035]]\n\nacross three incidents between about 6 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. That \nSaturday night the shooter first shot a woman several times, leaving \nher seriously wounded. Then, next to a car dealership, he gunned down a \nfather and son. Later, he approached two cars that were parked outside \na neighboring Cracker Barrel restaurant. He opened fire there and \nkilled four.\n  I have been coming down to the floor now for almost 3 years telling \nthe stories of victims of gun violence. I am going to talk about six \ntoday. Unfortunately, the statistics tell us there are 86 every single \nday killed by guns--2,600 a month and 31,000 a year. The vast minority \nof them are due to mass shootings. Most of the individuals on this list \nare killed by virtue of suicides or by individual acts of violence--\ndomestic violence, for instance--the violence that happens in cities of \nAmerica like Hartford, New Haven, New York, and Los Angeles.\n  What is astounding to many of us is that despite these numbers--and I \nhave made this case before--which are unlike those of any other \nindustrialized country, we do absolutely nothing about it. We do \nnothing about it. We don't pass stronger gun laws. We don't strengthen \nour mental health system. We don't give more law enforcement resources. \nAll we do is just catalog the numbers of dead every single day and \nevery single month. The statistics apparently are not moving this \nplace.\n  Hopefully--my hope is the voices of these victims can give you a \nsense of who these people are. Just the trail of tragedy that is left \nbehind--researchers will tell you there are often over a dozen people \nwho experience serious levels of trauma in the wake of one person being \nkilled by guns.\n  Maybe these stories will change people's minds. Stories such as that \nof Mary Jo Nye, who was 60 years old when she was killed. She was \nenjoying a night out on the town with her former college roommate, her \nsister-in-law, Mary Lou Nye, and her friends, Barbara Hawthorne and \nJudy Brown, when all of their lives were taken by this seemingly random \nshooting.\n  Mary Jo was a retired teacher from Calhoun Community High School, \nwhere she dedicated her time and talents to students who were at risk \nof dropping out. That is not an easy job, but she put her mind to it \nand put her heart to it. One colleague commented that ``she was an \nEnglish teacher, but she was a lot more than that to the students who \ndon't come from great home lives.''\n  A friend said she was ``always reaching out to others and helping \nfamilies.'' This friend also said:\n\n       It just doesn't make sense. Mary Jo saw helping others as \n     her calling in both her professional and her personal life. \n     It's a tragedy.\n\n  Mary Lou Nye met her sister-in-law, Mary Jo, when they were in \ncollege where they were actually roommates. Mary Lou fell in love with \none of her roommate's older brothers, eventually getting married, \nmaking the roommates not only friends but also family. Mary Lou \ndedicated her time as a manager of the Michigan Secretary of State \nbranch in South Haven prior to its closing. She shared her love of \nchildren for the last 6 to 7 years working at a daycare center. A local \npastor said she always had a smile on her face and was loved by the \nkids she worked with. ``It was never about her,'' he said, ``always \nabout making sure things were right for the children.'' Her son said \nhis mom ``loved reading books and doted on her grandson,'' his 5-year-\nold, Geoffrey. She, herself, was the youngest of five children. Her \ngrandson Geoffrey will not be able to spend that time with his \ngrandmother any longer.\n  Sixty-eight-year-old Barbara Hawthorne was in the backseat of Mary Jo \nNye's car when she was killed.\n  Her family said:\n\n       Our `Auntie Barb' was easy to laugh. A generous, giving \n     person who loved her many friends and family. She was a true \n     ``hippie'' who marched for civil rights in the Deep South, \n     recycled everything that came through the house, and believed \n     in marching to your own drummer. She loved the theater and \n     live music and shared tickets to performances whenever \n     possible.\n\n  Dorothy Brown, known as Judy among her friends and neighbors, was \nalso with Mary Jo, Mary Lou, and Barbara. Neighbors remember Judy's \ngenerous and friendly spirit. She readily shared her homegrown herbs \nand always took time to share a friendly wave with her neighbors. One \nneighbor who did odd jobs for her occasionally, helping out around the \nhouse, always got a gift card from her at the end of the year. She was \ndescribed by one neighbor as ``a sweet, sweet old lady. You couldn't \nask for a better neighbor.''\n\n  Tyler Smith was 17 years old and he was with his father shopping for \na car when the shooter drove by and opened fire, killing both the \nfather and the son. Tyler had a very bright future ahead of him. He was \nenrolled in the marketing entrepreneurship program at the local tech \ncenter in addition to high school. He was, according to friends and \nfamily, studying marketing so he could help open a family business with \nhis father, sister, and his cousin.\n  The superintendent, who knew Tyler well--it means something about a \nkid if the superintendent knew this particular student well. That tells \nyou he was marked for something big. He said he ``was such a great kid. \nHe always had a smile on his face, always happy and very well liked.''\n  His father, known as Rich, was killed alongside him while they were \nshopping for a car. A family friend remembers Rich, saying, ``When Rich \nwas in your presence he automatically put you in a good mood--he had \nthis contagious laugh and he always smiled.''\n  A friend said:\n\n       Rich was always there to lighten it up and laugh it off. . \n     . . He was such a wonderful man.\n\n  Those are 6 people of the average of 86 killed every day, just in \nthat one episode in Kalamazoo. What is so sad is that when the \nshootings in Kalamazoo began that Saturday evening, a dozen other \npeople had already been killed in multiple victim incidents since the \nweekend started. Set aside all of those one-of instances of gun \nviolence. Set aside all of the suicides. Just last weekend, before \nKalamazoo happened, a dozen other people had been shot across this \ncountry in multiple victim incidents. There is no other country in the \nworld that has that level of epidemic mass gun violence.\n  I will speak at another time about why that is, but what is \nunexceptional about the United States is that the American public wants \nto do something about it. They don't accept the status quo, just as \nother countries probably wouldn't accept it either. Ninety-two percent \nof Americans are in favor of universal background checks, and we can't \neven get a debate on this on the floor of the Senate, nor in the House \nof Representatives. Democracy normally doesn't allow for 90 percent of \nAmericans to support something that their legislative body will not \neven consider.\n  Eighty-five percent of NRA Members are in favor of universal \nbackground checks. All that means is, all you have to prove is that you \nare not a criminal. You have to prove you haven't been deemed mentally \nincompetent before you can buy a gun.\n  Support for the laws that we want to debate on the floor of the \nSenate is absolutely bipartisan. Here is a chart showing background \nchecks for gun shows and private sales. Those are not universal \nbackground checks. They are just for those two particular forums. For \nthat specific proposal, Democrats support it by 88 percent, Republicans \nby nearly 80 percent; laws to prevent the mentally ill from buying \nguns, 81 percent Democrats and 79 percent of Republicans--no \ndifference.\n  There is a little bit more of a difference when you come to a Federal \ndatabase to track gun sales. You still have 55 percent of Republicans \nsupporting that. That is probably the most controversial reform which, \nto me, for the life of me, I can't figure out why it is controversial. \nA ban on assault-style weapons, you have 70 percent of Democrats but a \nmajority of Republicans as well, which tells you that the overall \nAmerican population, despite their partisan registration, supports a \nban on assault weapons, which of course wasn't that radical long ago, \nwhen it was passed in the law of this country. I will not go into this \nin detail, but, again, you look at specific provisions, and the \noverwhelming majority of the American public supports them--bans on \nsemiautomatic weapons, bans on assault weapons, bans on high-capacity \nammunition clips, bans on online sales of ammunition. Again, over and \nover again, you see an overwhelming majority of Americans supporting \nthese laws.\n  It is simply time for us to respond to the voices of 31,000 victims \nevery single\n\n[[Page S1036]]\n\nyear and do something about it. I will continue to come down to the \nfloor and share these stories, share some of these charts, share some \nof the data, in the hope that it will inspire this body to break out of \nits ice of indifference--as somebody coined the phrase before me--and \ndo something.\n  I understand we are not likely to get a vote on background checks \nbetween now and the end of the year, but there is a big bipartisan \nmental health bill we can debate on the floor before we wrap up for the \nyear. This Senator would submit to you that is not the answer for the \nepidemic of gun violence, but it would help. If you create more \ninpatient beds and more outpatient capacity, a lot of the very \ndisturbed individuals who take these demons that exist inside them and \nturn them into an act of massive violence--that mental health reform \nbill could help them. It would just be the beginning of the work we \nhave to do, but it would be a very important beginning.\n  At some point the U.S. Senate, the greatest deliberative body in the \nworld, an organization that claims to represent the will of the people, \nwill have to start paying attention to the voices of these victims and \nthe overwhelming majority of the American public who want us to honor \nthem.\n  I yield back.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in morning business on \nan issue before the American people, and that is the Supreme Court \nvacancy.\n  I rise today to express my very deep, deep disappointment in my \nRepublican colleagues for vowing to block President Obama's \nnomination--vowing to block President Obama's nominee for filling the \nvacancy on the Supreme Court.\n  Each and every Senator serving in this Chamber was elected by the \nAmerican people, and we took an oath to uphold the Constitution. In \nthis matter, the Constitution is very clear. Article II, section 2 says \nthe President ``shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent \nof the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges of the supreme Court.''\n  It doesn't say the President only has an hour and a half left. It \ndoesn't give a time limit to the President. If you are a President and \nyou have a 4-year term, you have the authority and duty to exercise \nyour obligations under the Constitution for a full 4 years, and the \nSenate has a duty to provide advice and consent. There are no waivers \nfor election years. I urge my colleagues: Do your job. Follow the \nConstitution and live up to the Constitution. The Constitution doesn't \nsay: In an election year, delay, delay, delay. The word ``delay'' \ndoesn't even appear in the Constitution, in the hope that one day you \nwill get your way.\n  Republicans have said that the Senate must wait until the people have \nspoken by electing a new President in November. The American people \nhave spoken. They elected President Obama in 2008, and they reelected \nhim in 2012. Barack Obama is our President from now until noon on \nJanuary 20, 2017. If the Founders wanted a 3-year term for the \nPresident, they would have written that in the Constitution, but they \nmandated 4 complete years.\n\n  Now the other party wants to deny the President the legitimacy and \nauthority of his office. Even George Washington had his nominee \nconsidered during a Presidential election year and had three of his \ncandidates confirmed. What was good enough for the first Congress under \nGeorge Washington should be good enough for this Congress now under \nPresident Obama.\n  President Obama and I will both be closing our offices in January of \n2017, but that doesn't mean we are done working for the American people \ntoday. There is a lot of work to be done. President Obama has the \nconstitutional duty to submit a nomination in order to fill the vacancy \nleft with Justice Scalia's passing. This duty is not suspended in an \nelection year. The Constitution is clear about the President's \nauthority. The President must fulfill his duty, and we must do our job. \nThe issue is not about Executive orders or checking Executive powers or \ninterpreting law books; it is about following the Constitution.\n\n[[Page S1037]]\n\n  I say to the Republicans on the other side of the aisle: Please do \nyour job. Your constituents elected you to this position to follow the \nConstitution. If you don't like the nominee the President has selected, \nvote no, but at least follow the process. After the President selects \nhis nominee, we then go through a courtesy process where the nominee \ncalls upon each Senator. Then there is a hearing--and maybe there are \nseveral days of hearings--and then there is a vote.\n  I am calling on the Senate to follow the process that was mandated by \nthe Constitution and mandated by our traditions. After the President \nnominates someone, let's meet with the nominee. Let's hold the hearings \nand follow the process, and then let's bring it to a vote. Over the \nlast 40 years, the average time it has taken for the Senate to act has \nbeen only 67 days from nomination to confirmation, so to say we don't \nhave enough time just doesn't work. We have 10 months, or 330 days, \nleft in this President's administration to do this job.\n  Some of my colleagues say there is precedent for this obstructionism. \nChairman Grassley, the chair of the Judiciary Committee, cited four \ntimes in our history where a President did not nominate someone to fill \na vacancy during an election year. Well, those numbers are right, but \nguess what. The vacancy occurred after the Senate had adjourned for the \nyear. None of those Presidents could have nominated a candidate because \nthe Senate wasn't in session.\n  For the past 100 years, every Supreme Court nominee has been acted \nupon. Even if they got a disapproval vote in the committee, they still \ngot a vote in the Senate.\n  In 1987, Robert Bork was voted down in the committee, but he still \ngot a vote on the floor where he was voted down.\n  In 1991, Clarence Thomas, one of the most contentious and \ncontroversial Supreme Court nominations that I ever participated in, \nwas voted on by the committee without a recommendation. He got a vote \non the floor and was approved 52 to 48.\n  Each of these candidates had their day to be evaluated. Each Senator \nhad the ability to apply their advice and consent or, in some cases, \nnonconsent. I didn't always vote yes on the nominee, but I certainly \nsupported the process that we have here. We have never denied a sitting \nPresident his duty to provide a nominee. This is of utmost importance \nto our Nation. It really is.\n  The Supreme Court is unique. It is the highest Court of the land with \nreal and lasting impacts on American lives. To obstruct a Supreme Court \nnominee for political reasons would be absolutely unprecedented. Until \nthis vacancy is filled, the Supreme Court is left with eight members \nwith the potential for tie votes. If there is a tie vote in a decision, \nthe ruling of the lower court remains as if the Supreme Court never \nheard the case. In some cases, that leaves disagreement among courts, \nleaving our laws at odds with each other.\n  If this vacancy lasts until the next President, the Supreme Court \ncould be left without eight members for two terms on the Court. Some of \nthe cases with the most impact on our history have been decided in 5-\nto-4 votes. That brings up some cases that are of particular concern to \nme.\n  What if there were a tied decision in a case and we were left stuck \nin a gridlock? The Senate knows that I am very involved with equal pay \nfor equal work. There was the famous Lilly Ledbetter case--Lilly \nLedbetter v. Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. It was decided by a 5-\nto-4 vote. She faced injustice not only at her job, but also in the \ncourts. At the urging of Justice Ginsburg, the Senate provided a \nlegislative remedy to correct that injustice. If we had a tie, we might \nnot have ever been able to resolve that issue both through the Court \nand through the Senate. This is what democracy is supposed to be.\n  There was another amazing case, which was Bush v. Gore. Everyone \nremembers the election in 2000 when we had the hanging chads in Florida \nand we really weren't sure who won the election--Al Gore or George \nBush. This is America, so banks stayed open, there were no tanks in the \nstreet, school children were able to go about learning what America was \nall about and get ready for the new century. We were moving ahead \nbecause the process moved through the courts.\n  The Bush v. Gore case was decided with a 5-to-4 vote. Can you imagine \nif we had a tied Court now? We would have a constitutional crisis, and \nwe would have a crisis over who was the legitimate President of the \nUnited States. We can't have that happen again.\n  When the voters make their decisions in November on who they want to \nhave as the next President, I hope it is clear and decisive and we \ndon't end up before the Supreme Court, but surely we need to have a \nCourt that is not going to end in a tie and that we have done our job \nto make sure that there are nine--N-I-N-E--on the Supreme Court.\n  First of all, follow the Constitution. It is in the best interest of \nour country. Do your job so we can say to the world: We are a Nation of \nlaws. We encourage people all over the world that are emerging from \nauthoritarian regimes or chaotic political situations to write a \nConstitution and live by it. Well, we wrote a Constitution, so let's \nlive by it. We need to follow what we say we were elected to do and \nthat we swore an oath to do.\n  President Obama must do his job. I urge the Republicans to do their \njob. Let's follow and live up to the Constitution. When the President \nmakes his nomination, let's open our doors so we can meet with that \nnominee. Let's hold a hearing or multiple hearings, if necessary, and \nthen let's hold a vote on the Senate floor. Let's be accountable by the \ndeeds of our vote and not simply avoid our responsibility.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Wasteful Spending\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am on the Senate floor for my 34th \nedition of ``Waste of the Week.'' As you know, I do these speeches each \nweek to highlight waste, fraud, and abuse and simple ways that we can \nsave the taxpayers' dollars from being misused.\n  Last year, in my 18th ``Waste of the Week'' speech, I detailed an \ninvestigation by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office that \ndiscovered that fraudulent applications were being accepted by \nhealthcare.gov, the government Web site for choosing ObamaCare plans. I \ndiscussed the waste, fraud, and abuse of ObamaCare subsidies that were \nbeing awarded to fraudulent applicants.\n  As part of that investigation, the Government Accountability Office \ninvestigators purposefully submitted 12 fraudulent applications. They \nwanted to test the system. They wanted to see how well the system \nworked. So they drew up 12 deliberately fraudulent applications just to \nsee what the response would be. They submitted them to healthcare.gov. \nEleven of them came back as approved. Only one application was called \nout, where someone said, ``Wait a minute, we don't have the appropriate \ninformation'' or ``we didn't do the fact-checking.'' But 11 apparently \nweren't even fact-checked.\n  The Government Accountability Office said, ``I think this might be \nthe canary in the coal mine.'' This ought to be a signal that this \nprogram is being abused; when 11 out of 12 applications come back with \na stamp for approval and the subsidies are given, you would think the \ngovernment would take notice of that and simply say, ``We have to get \nahold of this.''\n  After the investigation, after this was made public it ought to have \nbeen embarrassing to the agencies that are handling this, the Centers \nfor Medicare & Medicaid disbursement. You would think they would jump \non this. If I were heading up this agency, if I had anything to do with \nthis at all, I would either fire someone or I would put reforms in \nplace to make sure this never happened again. You would think this \nreport would have spurred some kind of action.\n  But this week, the Government Accountability Office released a new \nreport detailing how the Obama administration continues to take--and \nthis is in their words--``take passive approach to dealing with the \npotential fraud'' in the ObamaCare program. The GAO report outlines how \nhealthcare.gov is still plagued by serious operational problems that \nlead to fraud and abuse. They found that in 2014, over 4 million \nObamaCare applicants received a total of $1.7 billion in taxpayer \nsubsidies despite these unresolved documentation errors. What this \nmeans is that the healthcare.gov site is allowing people to sign up for \nand receive ObamaCare benefits without proper verification.\n  When you have had a previous investigation that said that 11 out of \n12--more than 90 percent--of the applications were stamped ``approved'' \nand subsidies were paid without verification or with faulty \nverification, you would think by now they would have cleaned this up. \nHundreds of thousands of people have been able to get their ObamaCare \napplications approved without having their eligibility verified. That \nhas become clear. As GAO investigators bluntly stated in the report, \nhealthcare.gov ``is at risk of granting eligibility to, and making \nsubsidy payments on behalf of, individuals who are ineligible to \nenroll.''\n  The GAO said that one of the biggest problems with healthcare.gov is \nthat the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, CMS, which is \nresponsible for the oversight and management of ObamaCare, did not \nresolve Social Security number inconsistencies for thousands of \napplications. When you submit your identity, you give your Social \nSecurity number. It goes to CMS. They are supposed to check it to see \nif it is a legitimate Social Security number, and if it isn't, they \nobviously cannot or should not issue the subsidy and approve the \napplication. But, instead, CMS approved subsidized coverage without \nverifying those numbers from the applicants. It potentially allows \naccess to subsidies by illegal immigrants or other ineligible \nindividuals.\n  So word gets around: Hey, you don't even need to put your Social \nSecurity number on there or you can put a false Social Security number \non there, and you are going to get the subsidy.\n  This is how your government is spending your tax dollars. It is an \noutrageous way, to pump up ObamaCare. And we keep hearing the White \nHouse touting the fact that millions are signing up for this. Of course \nthey are. Millions are signing up for this because whether they are \neligible or not, they are getting a subsidy. Who wouldn't want to get a \ncheck from the government every month? But it is done through fraud. It \nis done through waste, and it is done through something that hasn't \nbeen documented.\n  People have to realize that under ObamaCare, you have to be a citizen \nor a legal resident, fall within a certain income range. Healthcare.gov \nis supposed to verify all of this when you sign up. But the GAO found \nthat the program does not check new applications against existing \napproved applications. The resulting failure is that millions of people \nhave been approved for benefits while using the same Social Security \nnumber.\n  Here is another situation. Not only are people using false Social \nSecurity numbers on the application and they are still getting \nsubsidies, but a lot of people are using the same Social Security \nnumber. This is not the era of having mountains of paperwork stored in \nwarehouses around Washington, DC, because the agencies have been \nflooded with paper applications; this is an age of computerizing and \ndigitizing all of this information. So all you have to do is push a \nbutton to find out whether that is a legitimate Social Security number. \nI mean, how hard is it?\n  To make matters worse, we have learned that in thousands of ObamaCare \napplications, it wasn't even clear if the beneficiary was serving a \nprison sentence. The law basically says you are not eligible for \nObamacare subsidies if you are serving a prison sentence. The GAO found \nthat the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ignored many \nopportunities for reducing ObamaCare fraud. Basically, it appears that \nCMS is willing to look the other way. Maybe they were ordered to, maybe \nthey are just doing it, or maybe they are just purely incompetent. But \nthey are looking the other way as the President continues to tout the \nbenefits of this law.\n  If that isn't bad enough, GAO also found that CMS actually knew that \nmillions of applications were potentially fraudulent and still approved \nthe applications. I am not making this up. We have information provided \nby the Government Accountability Office that the Centers for Medicare & \nMedicaid Services knew about these fraudulent practices, so they \ncouldn't plead ``Well, we didn't know this was happening'' or ``This \nwas a computer glitch'' or ``We are just so overwhelmed with paperwork \nor applications that we can't handle it.'' They knew about it. They \nknew it was happening, and yet they still haven't cleared the situation \nup.\n  It really drives you up the wall--and it is no wonder the American \npeople are so unbelievably frustrated with this government and have \ndeemed that this government is simply wasting their tax dollars. It is \nthe biggest bureaucratic mess they have ever seen and they are paying \nfor it. Doesn't it just practically make you want to scream?\n  CMS told GAO ``that they currently do not plan to take any actions on \nindividuals with unresolved incarceration or Social Security number \ninconsistencies.'' Does anybody find that outrageous? We know there is \na problem. We have documented there is a problem. But they currently \nare not willing to undertake any kind of reforms or action to deal with \nthis problem.\n\n  To address this mess, I will introduce legislation that will mandate \nCMS to recoup all improperly paid subsidies. I am going to continue to \npress the agency to take action to enforce the existing requirements.\n  What does it take to get the Congress to take the steps to insist \nthat these agencies--entrusted with taxpayer\n\n[[Page S1039]]\n\nmoney carry out their programs and then not act in such a cavalier, \ndismissive way--deal with this situation? What does it take?\n  I guess what it takes is what is happening in our election process \nright now, and that is the example of the reason American people \nsaying: We have had enough and we are blazing mad, and we ought to tear \nthe place down and start all over. And this is all because this \nbehemoth of a dysfunctional government continues to rob the taxpayer of \nits hard-earned money. Yet it is not providing job opportunities for \npeople, despite all the best efforts of this administration.\n  It kind of reminds me of back when Obamacare was being debated in the \nHouse of Representatives and the then-Speaker of the House, a Democrat, \nsaid: Well, we have to pass this bill so we can find out what is in it. \nWell, Madam Speaker of the House of Representatives, we are finding out \nnot only what is in this bill, but we are also finding out we need an \nefficient, effective government enforcement of this to ensure that \nwaste, fraud, and abuse is not occurring.\n  So once again, I am down here adding to the ever-growing amount of \nmoney is been documented as waste, fraud, and abuse of. Today we stand \nat $157 billion of documented waste, fraud, and abuse, and we are just \nscratching the surface. I probably could come down here every hour of \nevery day the Senate is in session and point out another waste of \ntaxpayer money.\n  When are we going to step up to the plate and stop this charade that \nis happening here? When are we going to deal with this problem? I am \nurging my colleagues to support my efforts and other efforts to at \nleast address known documented problems of waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iran\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, tomorrow the people of Iran will go to the \npolls to elect 285 members of the Iranian Parliament, or the Majlis, \nand 88 members of the so-called Assembly of Experts, which is the body \nthat will eventually choose the successor to the current Supreme \nLeader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n  Last December, Secretary of State John Kerry cautioned that having an \nelection does not of itself make a democracy, and I think his words are \nequally fitting this week. Iran's elections, in truth, are neither free \nnor fair. Iran is not a democracy. Power brokers in Iran have already \nrigged these elections and even the results of a potential runoff in \nApril will not tell us much we don't already know about the Iranian \nregime or its foreign policy objectives in the Middle East.\n  Some observers do hope that moderate voices will make some progress \nin Iran, and I agree that is good to hope for, but I remain deeply \nskeptical. In many ways tomorrow's elections are nothing more than a \nrubberstamp because an unelected Guardian Council, which vets all \ncandidates for office, has already prevented most moderates from even \nrunning.\n  Let me explain. Aspiring candidates for Iran's national Parliament \nand the Assembly of Experts must be approved by the unelected Guardian \nCouncil before they appear on a ballot. Unless they make it through a \nmultiweek vetting process and unless they are deemed sufficiently loyal \nand conservative, these aspiring candidates will not get a chance to be \ncandidates at all. That is why the candidate list for tomorrow's \nelection has already told us more about Iran's intentions than the \nelection results will.\n  A willingness to allow reform-minded or moderate Iranians to stand \nfor election would have suggested some real hope for genuine reform for \nreal change in the Iranian regime. Sadly, the disqualification of both \nfemale and reformist candidates indicates that Iran is instead doubling \ndown on its decision to avoid long-awaited and much needed democratic \nreforms and instead will continue to isolate itself from broader \nmembership in the international community. Sixteen women applied to run \nto serve on the Assembly of Experts. They were all prohibited from \nrunning. Three thousand reform-minded candidates sought to run for the \nIranian Parliament, but only 1 percent of those 3,000 were approved. \nEven Hassan Khomeini, the grandson of Ayatollah Khomeini, who founded \nthe Islamic Republic of Iran, was rejected as a candidate for being too \nmodern. These disqualifications reflect the regime's rejection of basic \ndemocratic norms and serve as reminder of the urgency with which we \nhave to continue to scrutinize Iran's behavior.\n  Tomorrow's elections will not change Iran's aggressive behavior in \nthe region or transform the political power structure within the \nIslamic Republic of Iran, which is still dominated by Supreme Leader \nAyatollah Ali Khamenei. Despite what some may hope, the Supreme Leader \nseems unwilling to allow even a modicum of dissent inside Iran. These \nelections are likely nothing more than a guise to give the \ninternational community the impression that Iranians have a real voice \nin choosing their elected officials.\n  While we should hope for future moderation, we should expect the \nstatus quo because at its core Iran remains a revolutionary regime that \nsupports terrorism as a central tool of its national foreign policy. \nU.S. policymakers have to remain clear-eyed about that reality as we \nseek to effectively and aggressively enforce the nuclear deal and push \nback against Iranian aggression in the region.\n  I urge my colleagues, the administration, and the American people to \npay close attention not just to tomorrow's Iranian elections but to \nIran's actions in the weeks, months, and years to come.\n  I commend the administration for one action it took this week. It \nindicted four individuals who violated previously existing U.S. \nsanctions against Iran. This decision sends another important signal \nthat despite the nuclear deal, sanctions that remain on the books and \ncompanies that violate them remain a significant barrier and that \ncompanies should not rush to do business with Iran. Only by continuing \nto enforce existing sanctions, only by continuing to hold Iran to its \ncommitments in the nuclear agreement, and only by pushing back against \nIran's support for terrorist proxies, its human rights abuses, and its \nillegal ballistic missile tests will we demonstrate that we are serious \nabout holding the regime accountable for its actions. Only by viewing \nIran through the right lens--a lens of weariness and suspicion, not \ntrust--can we continue to protect our national security and the safety \nof our regional allies, especially Israel.\n  A nuclear deal with a nation like Iran does not make that regime our \nally or friend and having an election does not make a democracy, but it \ndoes make a statement.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. President, on Monday I had the privilege of serving as the first \nSenator from the State of Delaware--the first State--to ever read \nGeorge Washington's Farewell Address on the Senate floor on February \n22, the appointed day every year when we recognize Washington's \ncontributions to our country and its history by repeating his Farewell \nAddress on this floor.\n  In the more than two centuries since President Washington wrote and \ndelivered those words, I am struck by how relevant they still remain in \nwarning Americans of the dangers of partisanship, factionalism, and \ndivision. Today the constitutional order for which President Washington \nand so many of our Founding Fathers and so many Americans risked and \ndedicated their lives, and which has sustained our experiment in \ndemocracy for generations, is now threatened not by one person or by \none political party but rather by the relentless division and \ndysfunction that has come to define our current political discourse.\n\n  Just over 2 years ago, this discord led to an unprecedented shutdown \nof our whole Federal Government for 17 days. At stake today is nothing \nless than the capability of the Supreme Court of the United States to \ncontinue to function meaningfully. If we fail to reverse this \nincreasingly divisive--and, I think, dangerous--trend, we won't just be \nfacing a series of undecided legal policy\n\n[[Page S1040]]\n\nissues. We will also be looking at a direct threat to our \nconstitutional quarter--a new normal in which Supreme Court vacancies \nremain just that for months upon months or even years.\n  Sadly, the rhetorical warfare on filling the vacancy on the Court \nbegan just an hour after the world first learned of Justice Scalia's \npassing, when the majority leader issued a statement in which he ruled \nout any hearing or vote or any consideration whatsoever of a Supreme \nCourt nominee. The back and forth between our parties has grown even \nmore heated in the days since. Much has been made of what Senators of \nboth parties have said and done in response to past Supreme Court \nvacancies, but the precedent that I think matters most is what this \nChamber actually did the last time there was a Supreme Court vacancy \nduring an election year. As many of my colleagues have pointed out, the \nlast time that happened was in 1988, and that year Justice Kennedy was \nconfirmed unanimously and by a Democratic-controlled Senate.\n  Recently, some of my colleagues have also pointed to a speech that \nVice President Biden--then chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee--\ngave back in 1992, as evidence that there is some clear, strong \nprecedent for the level of obstructionism that we are seeing today. But \nthat reading of his remarks both misrepresent his remarks and obscures \nthe real facts. It is easy to take much of what we say and do here on \nthe floor of the Senate out of context. In fact, I am sure it has \nhappened to each Member of this Chamber more than once, but a full \nreading of then-Chairman Biden's full remarks shows that at the end of \nhis speech, Senator Biden promised to consider not just holding \nhearings, not just a vote but also supporting a consensus nominee. To \nquote directly:\n\n       I believe that so long as the public continues to split its \n     confidence between the branches, compromise is the \n     responsible course for both the White House and for the \n     Senate. Therefore, I stand by my position. Mr. President, if \n     the President--\n\n  Then-President Bush--\n\n     consults and cooperates with the Senate or moderates his \n     selections absent consultation, then his nominees may enjoy \n     my support as did Justices Kennedy and Souter.\n\n  So when it comes to setting Senate precedent, I think it is important \nto get the Vice President's words right, but I also think it is \nimportant to pay attention to his actions, which speak more loudly than \nhis words. His record as chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee is \nunmistakable. In case after case, he convened and held appropriate and \ntimely hearings for judges of all backgrounds and experiences when \nnominated by President Bush in an election year. Even in a deeply \ncontentious election year, he considered dozens of district and circuit \ncourt nominees all the way up until September, just 2 months before the \nPresidential election.\n  So today I echo then-Chairman Biden's 1992 request. I urge President \nObama to nominate a moderate and eminently qualified jurist by whose \nrecord should clearly, under normal circumstances, be confirmed and who \ncan become a consensus nominee in this Chamber. You don't have to look \nvery far to find a number of candidates who would easily fit this \ndescription.\n  I am not asking my Republican colleagues to commit to support such a \nnominee, but I am asking for us to be able to fulfill the \nconstitutional obligations of advice and consent that we have sworn to \nuphold. Here is just another important piece of factual record. Since \nthe formation of the Senate Judiciary Committee a century ago, every \nsingle Supreme Court nominee has received a vote, a hearing or both. \nThe only exceptions were candidates whose nominations were withdrawn \nbefore they could be considered or that proceeded directly to the floor \nfor a confirmation vote.\n  Even nominees whose confirmations were voted down by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee ultimately received a vote by the full Senate. That \nis the precedent that matters. The American people, I think, aren't \ndeeply interested in what this Senator said 2 years ago or that Senator \nsaid two decades ago. This back-and-forth, he said/she said rhetoric is \nexactly what they have sadly come to expect from this Congress, but it \nis not why they sent us here.\n  It is not just our constituents who are watching. Around the world, \nbelievers in a democratic system of government, in a system of \nseparation of powers in our constitutional framework, some of whom have \nrisked life and limb to bring democracy to their countries, are \nwatching. Those who believe democracy can't work and who advance that \nargument around the world are watching too.\n  At stake in this debate is not just a key vote on the Supreme Court \nbut, more importantly, a key indicator of whether our American \nexperiment can still function. Over the past two-plus centuries, our \nexperiment in democracy has not just survived but even thrived. But in \nrecent years, Members of Congress have been playing a risky game, \nemploying increasingly obstructionist tactics that probe the very \nboundaries of our system of government. How the Senate conducts itself \nin the weeks and perhaps even months to come, I think, will set a \nstrong precedent for how future Supreme Court vacancies will be filled \nand more importantly, about whether our constitutional order can still \nfunction. We have an opportunity to show the world that even in the \nmidst of a strikingly divisive Presidential campaign, our democratic \nsystem can still work.\n  President Washington's Farewell Address of 220 years ago warned of \nthe many threats to that full and fair experiment that is American \ndemocracy. One of the threats he highlighted most pointedly was that of \npartisanship and division. The issues facing our Senate today represent \nnothing less than a direct and serious challenge to the vibrancy of \nthat very democratic experiment for which so many suffered, struggled, \nand died.\n  It is my prayer that we will find a way forward through this \ntogether.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                            Anna Westin Act\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of National \nEating Disorders Awareness Week and bring attention to millions of \nAmericans struggling with eating disorders. It is not something we \noften talk about on this floor, but eating disorders are more common in \nour country than breast cancer and Alzheimer's and do not discriminate \nby class, race, gender or ethnicity. The all-too-sad truth is that \neating disorders take the lives of 23 Americans every day and nearly 1 \nlife every hour.\n  Our understanding of how eating disorders develop and progress is \nconstantly evolving. We know there are between--and, again, because we \ndon't have statistics except for when people die--15 and 30 million \npeople across the country struggling with an eating disorder. We know \nthat anorexia has the highest morality rate of any mental health \ndisorder. Listen to that. Of any mental health disorder that you can \nthink of, anorexia has the highest morality rate. We know that eating \ndisorders affect women 2\\1/2\\ times more than men, making this the \nimportant women's mental health issue.\n  Unfortunately, far too few of these people are getting the help they \nneed. Only 1 in 10 people with an eating disorder will receive \ntreatment for that disease, and for those who don't receive any \ntreatment, the rate of recovery sharply declines, while the likelihood \nthey will be hospitalized rises. The numbers illustrate a grim reality. \nToo many Americans are suffering in silence, unable to access a \ntreatment they need to conquer their eating disorder and to go on to \nlive healthy lives.\n  To help the millions of people suffering from eating disorders get \nthe treatment they need, I have introduced the Anna Westin Act with \nSenator Ayotte, Senator Capito, and Senator Baldwin. We are very proud \nthat this is a bipartisan bill that is supported by both Democrats and \nRepublicans. As to the fact that it is led by all women Senators, it \nmay be that our time has come, given that women are 2\\1/2\\ times more \nlikely than men to suffer from this disorder.\n  We remember in the early days when it was the women Senators who \nunited to do something about breast cancer research or when it was \nwomen Senators who said: Why are we just studying men when it comes to \nvarious drugs and various diseases and cancer? Women have different \ninteractions. Women have different problems. In\n\n[[Page S1041]]\n\nfact, these eating disorders affect women 2\\1/2\\ times more than men, \nyet, literally, hardly anything is going on with this in terms of help \nand funding. The number one mental health disorder that leads to death \nand has the highest morality rate is anorexia.\n  The bill is named in honor of Anna Westin of Chaska, MN, who was \ndiagnosed with anorexia when she was 16 years old. Her health started \ndeteriorating quickly after she completed her sophomore year at the \nUniversity of Oregon. She began suffering from liver malfunction and \ndangerously low body temperatures and blood pressure. Even though her \ncondition was urgent, Anna was told she had to wait until the insurance \ncompany certified her treatment. This ultimately delayed and severely \nlimited the treatment that she received. After struggling with the \ndisease for 5 years, she committed suicide at the age of 21.\n  My colleagues, we have a moral obligation to help people like Anna \nand families like the Westins, and we cannot afford to wait any longer. \nLast week marked 16 years since Anna's death, yet people with eating \ndisorders are still not guaranteed coverage for lifesaving residential \ntreatment by insurance companies. The bipartisan Anna Westin Act fixes \nthis problem by clarifying that the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici \nMental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act specifies that \nresidential treatment for eating disorders must be covered. We are \ntalking about when a doctor diagnoses an eating disorder and believes, \nafter trying different treatments, that there is an immediate emergency \nsituation, that there should be coverage for residential treatment, \nwhich has been found to be really helpful with eating disorders because \nit helps to change how someone is eating and what they are doing and \nhow they are interacting and how they are going on with their day-to-\nday life.\n  My friend, the late Senator from Minnesota, Paul Wellstone, fought \nhard for that Wellstone and Domenici mental health parity law. As Paul \nalways insisted, a mental health parity bill is about equality and \nfairness. It is time patients struggling with an eating disorder \nreceive that equality and fairness. It is time that so many of these \nwomen who suffer from this disease, which is much more particular to \nwomen than to men, get to receive that treatment that you get for other \nkinds of mental health disorders. This bill would ensure that patients \nlike Anna Westin aren't prevented from getting the treatment they need \nsimply because their insurance doesn't cover it. Eating disorders \nbecome life-threatening when left untreated, making early detection \nabsolutely critical. That is why this bill would also use existing \nfunds to create grant programs to train school employees, primary \nhealth professionals, and mental health and public health professionals \non how to identify eating disorders, as well as how to intervene when \nbehaviors associated with an eating disorder have been identified.\n  I think most young people today know someone who has an eating \ndisorder. I remember in college a number of young women who had eating \ndisorders, but they were hiding it. Nobody did anything about it. I \nhave no idea how they are doing now.\n  Making this investment is a no-brainer. By drawing on existing funds \nfor the training programs, this bipartisan bill is designed to have no \ncost associated with it. These commonsense and long overdue actions \nwill help give those suffering from eating disorders the tools they \nneed to overcome these diseases and prevent more tragedies like Anna's. \nWe wish that Anna was still with us. We wish that she could have \ngraduated from college, started a career, and had children of her own. \nWell, it may be too late for Anna. We know she would want us to do \neverything we can to create a world where eating disorders are \nacknowledged, are recognized, are treated, and are prevented.\n  I am so proud this bill has been out there for a few years. This is \nthe first time this last year where it has been a bipartisan bill led \nby four women Senators, two Democrats and two Republicans. The time has \ncome. With affected families in every corner of our country, I invite \nall of my colleagues to join us in support of this bipartisan bill. We \nmust act now to give the millions of Americans struggling with eating \ndisorders the help they need. Doing so will not just prevent suffering; \nit will help save lives.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for approximately 15 minutes--probably less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, at noon today a group of us on this \nside of the aisle went to the Supreme Court and stood in front of it \nand spoke about what was happening with the Republican decision to not \nproceed with the advice and consent provisions of the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  I have been a member of the Judiciary Committee for 23 years. I sat \nthrough six Supreme Court nominations. In those 23 years, as a \nnonlawyer, I really became infused with great respect for the American \nsystem of justice, for the trial courts, for the appeal courts, and for \nthe supreme courts on the State level as well as on the national level. \nI don't think there is a system of justice that affords an individual, \na company, or an organization a fairer way to proceed to litigate a \ncase than the American justice system.\n  So as I stood there and heard some of my colleagues speaking, I began \nto think of the enormity of what is happening. We all know that the \nConstitution is clear that the President's role is to nominate and the \nSenate's role is to advise and consent on the nominee, nothing less, \nnothing more. I strongly believe that we should proceed to render the \nPresident's nominee to the highest Court of the land and proceed to \nconsider that advice and consent process with a hearing in the \nJudiciary Committee. To do anything less, in my view, is to default on \nour responsibility as U.S. Senators.\n  That has been the process, no matter how controversial a nomination. \nThat has been the process even when the President and the Senate are of \ndifferent parties. And, yes, that has been the process during \nPresidential election years. That is what happened when Anthony Kennedy \nwas confirmed in the last year of President Reagan's term when \nDemocrats actually held the Senate majority. In fact, a total of 14 \nJustices have been confirmed in the final year of a President's term.\n  Now, why is this important? The Supreme Court is a coequal branch of \nour Federal Government. It is a vital part of the separation of powers. \nIt is the final arbiter of the law of the land. And one of our \nimportant jobs as Senators is to ensure that the Court has the Justices \nit needs to decide cases.\n  It is impossible to overstate the importance of a functioning Supreme \nCourt. Brown v. Board of Education desegregated our schools. Loving v. \nVirginia struck down laws that made interracial marriage illegal. Roe \nv. Wade ruled on the constitutionality of State limits on women's \naccess to reproductive health care, which has been upheld as precedent \nfor over 40 years. Bush v. Gore even decided who would move into the \nWhite House as President of the United States. More recently, the \nSupreme Court struck down limits on campaign money, nullified a key \npart of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, upheld ObamaCare, and legalized \nsame-sex marriage.\n  Now, what does a 4-to-4 Court mean? The prospect of having more than \na year--as a matter of fact, some are saying it is up to 2 years--of \ntie votes on the Court in major controversial issues would be terrible \nfor our system of justice.\n  Justice Scalia wrote about the prospect of the split Court in 2004. \nIn responding to a request to recuse himself, he declined. He said if \nhe were to recuse himself, ``the Court proceeds with eight Justices, \nraising the possibility that, by reason of a tie vote, it will find \nitself unable to resolve the significant legal issue presented by the \ncase.''\n\n[[Page S1042]]\n\n  That is Justice Scalia.\n  He continued, quoting the Court's own recusal policy: ``Even one \nunnecessary recusal impairs the functioning of the court.''\n  So that is what we are doing. We are impairing the functioning of the \nSupreme Court of the United States.\n  What the Republicans are doing will affect cases for we think at \nleast 2 years--cases left from this year and those to be heard next \nyear. If Republicans are successful in blocking a hearing and a vote on \nthe President's nominee, the Court will find itself unable to resolve \nimportant legal questions for a lengthy period of time.\n  Imagine that you are a plaintiff, someone who has been wrongly \nterminated from a business, or a business in a legal dispute, or \nimagine you are a person or a business held liable as a defendant for \nmillions of dollars in a civil case or someone who has been charged \nwith or convicted of a crime. You might spend years of your life in \nprison or even be subjected to the death penalty even though there may \nbe a legal problem with your conviction or sentence. In all of these \ninstances, as Justice Scalia pointed out, the Court ``will find itself \nunable to resolve the significant legal issue presented by the case.''\n  That will mean that individuals and businesses, as well as the \nAmerican people, will be denied the full system of justice guaranteed \nby this Constitution. Our people should not stand for this.\n  There are major issues pending before the Supreme Court. There are \nimportant measures to help stop climate change, immigration issues, \nrace in college admissions, the fundamental concept of ``one person, \none vote,'' and the ability of unions representing public employees to \nfunction. The point is this: Important issues are before the Court, or \nwill be, and there should be a full Court to hear them.\n  There is absolutely no reason--none--that the Senate should refuse to \ndo its job and conduct full and fair hearings and hold a vote on the \nnominee.\n  Just a bit of history: The Senate has not left a Supreme Court seat \nvacant for a year or longer since the middle of the Civil War. That is \na fact. It has not happened since the middle of the Civil War. That \nwould be about 1862.\n  Even as the nominations process has become more contentious, the \nSenate has still considered Supreme Court nominees in a timely manner. \nThis has happened regardless of who sat in the White House or which \nparty controlled the Congress.\n  Here are a few historic facts to consider: Since the Judiciary \nCommittee began holding hearings in 1916 for Supreme Court nominees, a \npending nominee to the Supreme Court vacancy has never been denied a \ntimely hearing--never denied a timely hearing--even in the final year \nof a President's term.\n  Since 1975, the average time between a Supreme Court nomination and a \nvote by the full Senate has been 67 days. That is about 2 months. I \nwould remind my Republican colleagues that this includes Justice \nAnthony Kennedy's confirmation, which took place in February of 1988--a \nCalifornia judge--in the final year of President Reagan's Presidency \nand before a Democratic Senate. So in the final year, a Democratic \nSenate took a Republican President's nominee, who was a Republican, and \nmade him a Justice of the United States Supreme Court.\n  This has held true even for controversial nominees. Robert Bork and \nClarence Thomas both failed to win a majority vote by the Judiciary \nCommittee, but their nominations still advanced to a full Senate vote. \nThat was even the case for Justice Thomas, a very conservative jurist, \nwho replaced Justice Thurgood Marshall, a very liberal jurist. And, \nagain, this took place in a Democratic-controlled Senate.\n  Many of my Republican colleagues have voiced their own support for a \nPresident's right to have his nominee considered. Someone I consider a \nfriend who was chairman of the Judiciary Committee during periods of my \ntenure, Senator Orrin Hatch, who voted in favor of Justice Ginsburg, \nsaid at the time--and I know this because I was sitting right there and \nheard it--he believed a President deserves some deference on Supreme \nCourt appointments. He said he would not vote against a nominee simply \nbecause he would have chosen someone else.\n  Senator Grassley, now chairman of the Judiciary Committee, made \nsimilar comments, saying Congress must not forget its advice and \nconsent responsibilities.\n  Well, those responsibilities don't cease with the death of a jurist. \nAs a matter of fact, that is the clear intent of the Constitution, that \nthe advice and consent responsibility is mandated, no matter what. So \nto refuse to hold hearings before a nominee is even announced, to me, \nis shocking, and it makes me think: To what extent is the partisanship \nin this body going when it is willing to deny the Supreme Court a vital \nmember? It will be like denying a baseball team a pitcher. They \ncouldn't conduct a game without a pitcher. And a case that has any \ncontroversy cannot be fairly held without nine Justices.\n  That is not what we were sent to Washington for. It is not how to do \nthe people's business. To deny the American people full and fair Senate \nconsideration for a Supreme Court nominee would be unprecedented in our \nhistory and further undermine faith in the Senate as an institution. I \nreally deeply believe this, and I don't know why we would let this \nhappen.\n  If Republicans follow through on this threat, the fairness of the \nprocess for the Supreme Court will forever be tarnished. The \nconsequences could reverberate for generations, and it will be a \nserious gesture against the functioning of this great democracy. So all \nwe ask is, do your job. It is why we were sent here after all.\n\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL. Thank you, Mr. President, for the recognition, and I just \nwant to say to Senator Feinstein that this Senator has listened to many \nof her remarks and very much agrees with what she said, which is that \nwe should be doing our job in terms of this Supreme Court nominee. It \nis our job to advise and consent. The Constitution says we shall advise \nand consent when we get nominations.\n  Ten years ago the Senate faced a critical task: to consider the \nnomination by President Bush of Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court. It \nwas a fierce debate. Many opposed him, and some passionately so. I will \nnot argue that it was an easy road, but it was a road that was traveled \nbecause that is our job and that is one of our most important duties.\n  At the time, the current majority leader was very clear on that duty \nthe Senate has. He said:\n\n       We stand today on the brink of a new and reckless effort by \n     a few to deny the rights of many to exercise our \n     constitutional duty to advise and consent, to give this man \n     the simple up-or-down vote he deserves. The Senate should \n     repudiate this tactic.\n\n  Justice Alito did get an up-or-down vote and was confirmed 58 to 42, \nincluding four Democrats who voted in favor.\n  The majority leader was right. We do have a duty to advise and \nconsent, and the Constitution indeed uses the word ``shall'' advise and \nconsent.\n  A President's nominee does deserve an up-or-down vote. That was true \nthen, and it true now. I do not agree with many of Justice Alito's \nviews, but I do believe that it was critical for the Senate to do its \njob.\n  Now, here we are with a new nomination to the Supreme Court by a \ndifferent President, but the majority leader seems to have changed his \nmind. We are told that no nomination of anyone by this President will \nbe considered. The current Senate majority is refusing its \nconstitutional mandate that it ``shall'' advise and consent, refusing \nto do its job for blatantly partisan and political purposes. This is \nmisguided, and it is without precedent.\n  The full Senate has always voted to fill a vacancy on every pending \nSupreme Court nominee in election years and nonelection years, every \nsingle one for the last 100 years. We can go back even further than \nthat. The Senate Judiciary Committee was created 200 years ago. \nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, the committee's usual \npractice has been to report every nominee to the full Senate, even \nthose nominees opposed by a majority of the committee. This is a \nbipartisan tradition that makes sense and that we should follow.\n  When Senator Leahy was Judiciary Committee chairman, he and Ranking \nMember Hatch did just that. Nominations--even those opposed by a \nmajority of the committee--went to the full Senate.\n\n[[Page S1043]]\n\n  In 2001, the Republican leader, Senator Lott, said that ``no matter \nwhat the vote in committee on a Supreme Court nominee, it is the \nprecedent of the Senate that the individual nominated is given a vote \nby the whole Senate.''\n  Were those Senators any less principled? I don't think so. Were those \nSenators any less passionate in their views? No, but they did their \njob. They knew how important this was to our country. They honored \nSenate tradition, and they made sure the highest Court in the land was \nnot running on empty. How did we get from there to here? If the \nmajority leader has his way, there will be no hearings, no debate, and \nno vote.\n  The confirmation of a Supreme Court Justice is critical to a \nfunctioning democracy. It has become contentious only in recent years. \nIt wasn't always so polarizing. Take, for example, Justice Scalia, whom \nwe just lost. Justice Scalia was confirmed 98 to 0. This Senator does \nnot argue that either side of the aisle is 100 percent pure, but we \nknow that a fully functioning Supreme Court is vital to ensure justice \nin our system of government, and that depends on a fully functioning \nSenate.\n  This obstruction is part of a bigger problem. We have seen before and \nwe are seeing now that the Senate is broken. The American people are \nfrustrated, fed up with political games, obstruction in the Senate, \nspecial deals for insiders, and campaigns that are being sold to the \nhighest bidder. They see this obstruction as just another example of \nhow our democracy is being taken away. In this case, the hammer doing \nthe damage is the filibuster. Instead of debate, we have gridlock. \nInstead of working together, we have obstruction. That is why I pushed \nfor rules reform in the 112th Congress and in the 113th Congress. That \nis why I continue to push no matter which party is in the majority.\n  We changed the Senate rules to allow majority votes for executive and \njudicial nominees to lower courts, but that does no good if they remain \nblocked, and that is what is happening in this Congress. The line gets \nlonger and longer of perfectly qualified nominees who are denied a \nvote--denied even to be heard. Meanwhile, the backlog grows to 17 \njudges, 3 Ambassadors, and even the top official at the Treasury \nDepartment whose job is to go after the finances of terrorists. We are \non track for the lowest number of confirmations in three decades.\n  We now have 31 judicial districts with emergency levels of backlogs. \nA year ago, we had 12. Thousands of people wait for their day in court \nbecause there is no judge to hear the case. That is justice delayed and \njustice denied.\n  Just when you think things can't get any worse--they do. A seat on \nthe Supreme Court is empty, and the majority leader is actually arguing \nthat it should stay empty for over a year.\n  I do not believe that the Constitution gives me the right to block a \nqualified nominee, no matter who is in the White House. This Senator \nsays that today and has said it many times before. Amazingly, this \nobstruction may reach all the way to the Supreme Court--not just for a \nspecific nominee, but for any nominee.\n  What we are seeing is bad going to worse, and what we are seeing is \nelection-year politics. The majority leader said that the voters should \nhave a say in who the next Supreme Court Justice is. They had their \nsay. They overwhelmingly reelected President Obama to a 4-year term--\nnot a 3-year term. There is no logical end point to the majority \nleader's position. They say no Supreme Court nominee should be \nconsidered in the President's last year. What if this were 2 months \nago? Would their views be different if it was December 2015 or October?\n  Additionally, Presidents aren't the only ones with limited terms in \noffice. A number of sitting Senators are retiring. Do their \nconstitutional duties and rights as Senators expire now as well? Of \ncourse not, and neither should a President's.\n  Nominees should be judged on their merits. They are public servants \nin the executive branch, in our courts. They serve the people in this \ncountry. They should not be judged on feelings about a President you \nmay not like. That is not governing; that is a temper tantrum.\n  Let's be very clear. A Presidential election year is no excuse. For \nexample, Justice Kennedy was confirmed unanimously in the last year of \nPresident Reagan's administration by a Democratic-controlled Senate.\n  Our democracy works with three branches of government, not just two. \nThis assault on the Supreme Court is without precedent, without cause, \nand should be without support.\n  The President will do his duty and will nominate a Supreme Court \nJustice. Any Senator has the right to say no, but the American people \nhave the right to hear why.\n  I began my speech with comments by the majority leader. But this \nreally isn't about what the majority leader said 10 years ago or what \nother majority leaders have said and what both sides say back and \nforth; it is about what the American people are saying now and what the \nConstitution has always said: Do your job. Uphold your oath. Move our \ncountry forward.\n  So I state to my colleagues: Let's get serious. Let's stop these \ndangerous games. The President's nominee, whoever that is, deserves \nconsideration. The American people deserve a government that works.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, our Nation is in the midst of a \nPresidential election in which the American people are currently \ndeciding who will be our next Commander in Chief. In my home State of \nNorth Carolina, many voters have already submitted their absentee \nballots and early voting will begin soon.\n  This election year is especially important. In addition to electing \nour next President, the American people will have an opportunity to \nhave their say in who should be our next Supreme Court Justice. This is \na rare opportunity to let people determine the composition of the \nhighest Court in the land, an institution that dramatically affects the \nlives of all of us.\n  While the stakes weren't as high in 2014 as they are today, the voice \nof the American people was still heard loud and clear nonetheless. In \n2014, the American people sent a message about their displeasure for \nthe President's disregard for our Nation's system of checks and \nbalances. The American people sent a message about their opposition to \nthe President's misuse of Executive orders to bypass the will of the \nCongress, and the American people sent a message by electing a new \nSenate majority.\n  Perhaps the memo the Nation sent to the President in 2014 is the \nreason the minority leadership is now attempting to deny the American \npeople's full voice from being heard in this election. The minority \ndoesn't want the people to decide the composition of the Supreme Court, \nso they have claimed there is a constitutional requirement for the \nSenate to give the President's Supreme Court nominee a vote.\n  That couldn't be further from the truth. Article II, section 2 of the \nConstitution makes this clear. While the President may nominate \nindividuals to the Supreme Court, the Senate holds the power to grant \nor withhold consent for those nominees. This is not difficult or unique \nin a constitutional sense. In fact, in 2005, the senior Senator from \nNevada took to this very Senate floor and this is what he declared:\n\n       The duties of the Senate are set forth in the U.S. \n     Constitution. Nowhere in that document does it say the Senate \n     has a duty to give the Presidential nominees a vote. It says \n     appointments shall be made with the advice and consent of the \n     Senate. That is very different than saying every nominee \n     receives a vote.\n\n  The Senate is doing its job by withholding consent, and that is \nexactly why the rules of the Senate provide further guidance on what \nhappens when the Senate exercises its authority not to advance a \njudicial nominee.\n  Senate rule XXXI states: ``Nominations neither confirmed nor rejected \nduring the session at which they are made shall not be acted upon at \nany succeeding session without being again made to the Senate by the \nPresident.''\n  The Constitution states and the Senate rules anticipate that the \nSenate\n\n[[Page S1044]]\n\ncan exercise its clear authority to withhold consent on any nominee \noffered by the President. It is not a novel concept that the Supreme \nCourt vacancy should not be filled during an election year.\n  We can look back to 1992, probably before these pages were even born, \nwhen Senate Judiciary Committee then-Chairman Joe Biden eloquently \nexplained the need for the Supreme Court vacancy during a Presidential \nelection cycle and that it should be addressed after the American \npeople had their say in the election.\n  Chairman Biden, now Vice President Biden, said:\n\n       The senate too, Mr. President, must consider how it would \n     respond to a Supreme Court vacancy that would occur in the \n     full throes of an election year. It is my view that if the \n     president goes the way of Presidents Fillmore and Johnson and \n     presses an election year nomination, the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee should seriously consider not scheduling \n     confirmation hearings on the nomination--until after the \n     political campaign season is over.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       And I sadly predict, Mr. President, that this is going to \n     be one of the bitterest, dirtiest presidential campaigns we \n     will have seen in modern times.\n\n  The Vice President concludes by saying:\n\n       I'm sure, Mr. President, after having uttered these words, \n     some will criticize such a decision and say that it was \n     nothing more than an attempt to save a seat on the court in \n     hopes that a Democrat will be permitted to fill it.\n       But that would not be our intention, Mr. President, if that \n     were the course we were to choose as a senate to not consider \n     holding the hearings until after the election. Instead it \n     would be our pragmatic conclusion that once the political \n     season is underway, and it is, action on a Supreme Court \n     nomination must be put off until after the election campaign \n     is over. That is what is fair to the nominee and essential to \n     the process. Otherwise, it seems to me, Mr. President, we \n     will be in deep trouble as an institution.\n\n  Vice President Biden's remarks may have been voiced in 1992, but they \nare entirely applicable in 2016. The campaign is already underway.\n  It is essential to the institution of the Senate and to the very \nhealth of our Republic not to launch our Nation into a partisan, \ndivisive confirmation battle during the very same time the American \npeople are casting their ballots to elect our next President.\n  Vice President Biden--and this is not something I have said very \noften--was absolutely right. There should be no hearings. There should \nbe no confirmation. The most pragmatic conclusion to draw in 2016 is to \nhold the Supreme Court vacancy until the American people's voices have \nbeen heard.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Remembering Officer Jason David Moszer\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I join with my colleague and senior \nSenator, Mr. Hoeven, to honor and to bear witness to a great North \nDakotan and a great officer of the Fargo Police Department, Jason \nMoszer, who lost his life in the line of duty.\n  I begin by yielding the floor to my senior Senator, Mr. Hoeven.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I join my colleague from North Dakota to \nhonor a brave young man, Jason David Moszer, who made the ultimate \nsacrifice for his community.\n  Jason Moszer was an officer since 2009 with the Fargo Police \nDepartment. He died in the line of duty 2 weeks ago today while \nresponding to a domestic violence report in Fargo, ND. It is a tragedy \nthat he was torn from his family and friends and torn from his life \nwhile protecting the lives of others. He dedicated himself to serving \nour State, and we are all grateful for his commitment to devoting his \nenergy and talents to serve as a member of the Fargo Police Department.\n  While at his funeral earlier this week, I appreciated the opportunity \nto learn more about the person Jason was and the life he lived. From \nhis youth, he led a life of continuous service--service with the \nNational Guard as a combat medic for 8 years, service in Bosnia, \nservice in Iraq, and, until his passing, service to the people of Fargo \nas a policeman. In 2012 he and fellow officer Matthew Sliders were \nawarded the Department's Silver Star Medal for pulling two children \nfrom an apartment fire.\n  Even in death he served by donating his organs to others in need. In \ndying, his organs and tissue helped save the lives of at least five \nother people. Clearly, Officer Moszer was a man committed to doing \nthings for others and, consequently, he was respected and admired by \neveryone who came into contact with him.\n  Hearing stories about the pranks he pulled, the friends he brought \ntogether, his love of camping and cooking all round out the picture of \na man who touched the lives of so many, a man who was loved by so many. \nWe owe him and those who love him a tremendous debt for their sacrifice \nbecause his family and friends paid a high price.\n  We in North Dakota pride ourselves on being a safe State, but \nincidents like this remind us we are not immune to violent crime. They \nalso remind us of the enormous debt we owe to Officer Moszer and to all \nthe men and women in law enforcement who leave home every day and go to \nwork to protect us and help make ours the wonderful State North \nDakotans are so proud of.\n  Mikey and I extend our heartfelt condolences to Officer Moszer's wife \nRachel and their children, Dillan and Jolee. It is difficult to lose a \nloved one, and, more so, to lose one so young and under such \ncircumstances. During this difficult time, we pray that the Moszers are \nable to find comfort in the love of their family and friends, the \nsupport of their community, and the warm memories they have of Jason, \nwhich they will carry for the rest of their lives. Please know that you \nwill continue to be in our thoughts and prayers.\n  One final note. Senator Heitkamp and I were at the funeral. I think \nthere were about 6,000 people at the funeral, which is a testament to \nOfficer Moszer and his life. He truly epitomizes sacrifice and service \nto others. May God bless him and his family.\n  Mr. President, I turn the floor back to my colleague, Senator \nHeitkamp.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. I thank my senior Senator from North Dakota, Mr. \nHoeven.\n  As we sat quietly in the hockey arena that Jason loved so much, we \nfelt the pain of so many, including the literally hundreds of thousands \nof North Dakotans who watched the broadcast of the funeral but also \nlistened on the radio.\n  On the evening of Wednesday, February 10, Officer Jason Moszer did \nwhat so many police officers do on a daily basis--he went toward the \ndanger to answer the call to serve and protect the citizens of Fargo, \nND. Jason and the other officers who responded to that initial call \nknew they were encountering a dangerous situation. The domestic \nviolence call that brought them there that evening had mentioned there \nmight be a firearm involved. Yet those officers did not hesitate that \nnight.\n  A short time later, shots rang out, and then those words--those words \nthat will never be forgotten by his fellow officers--were heard: \n``Officer down.''\n  Yet, even in the darkest of hours, the men and women of the Fargo \nPolice Department maintained their composure and continued the critical \nwork of securing the surrounding neighborhood and trying to bring this \ndangerous situation to a resolution.\n  Later that night the city of Fargo, the State of North Dakota, our \nneighboring community of Moorhead, ND, and certainly his home community \nof Sabin, lost one of its finest when Officer Moszer succumbed to his \ninjuries. The loss of an officer in the line of duty is something that \ndevastates an entire community--and in a small State like North Dakota \nit has taken a toll on every law enforcement officer and every resident \nthroughout our entire State.\n  I am here this evening to honor Officer Moszer, and I am here this \nevening to honor the brave men and women of the Fargo Police \nDepartment. These officers wake up every morning, and they put on a \nuniform that requires that they frequently place themselves in \ndangerous situations in order to protect and to serve the citizens of \ntheir State, their community or their tribe. Few among us know what it \nis like to make that choice.\n\n[[Page S1045]]\n\n  We have a proud history in North Dakota of law enforcement officers \nserving their State and local community with distinction. I have had \nthe privilege over the years to work with law enforcement officers in \nmy State who span the spectrum--from highway patrol to State and local \nofficers, to various Federal officers, and the tribal communities. Let \nme tell you, without any hesitation, these are some of the finest men \nand women I have ever met or worked with. The officers of the Fargo \nPolice Department have proven beyond a doubt that they are some of the \nfinest law enforcement officers in the Nation.\n  The men and women of the Fargo Police Department, led by Chief David \nTodd, performed admirably and heroically that night 2 weeks ago. The \ncourage, strength, and leadership displayed by Chief Todd during this \nincredibly difficult period has been nothing short of remarkable, and \nthose qualities have certainly spread throughout his department to each \nand every officer under his charge. Remember, these officers chose this \npath. They chose to selflessly put themselves in harm's way so they \ncould make the city of Fargo a safer place for each and every person \nwho lives there or who may by chance be passing through. They chose to \nput the needs of others before their own. They chose a more difficult \npath to tread than most of us would ever be willing to follow.\n  One of the stories we heard was from one of his best friends who \nsaid: Jason, quite honestly, would have been embarrassed by the \noutpouring. He suggested that maybe what Jason would have liked is just \nfor people to have a few beers and remember him quietly. Well, Jason's \nloss was a loss not only for the people of our State, but it was a \ntremendously devastating loss for the Fargo Police Department and the \ncommunity of Fargo. Those officers who put on that uniform each and \nevery day are a unique and very special group, a tight-knit group. Very \nfew people can understand what it takes to do the job they do.\n  Unfortunately, I have attended a number of funerals--two during my \ntime as attorney general--of officers who were killed violently in the \nline of duty. One of the most moving tributes to a fallen officer is \nwhen the radio dispatcher goes through an End of Watch Roll Call. This \nmoving and emotional moment shows that even in death, the men and women \nof the Fargo Police Department stand shoulder to shoulder with their \ncolleagues, that they will support each other the way they support the \ncity of Fargo each and every day, and that even when a colleague has \nfallen in the line of duty, they will always have his back.\n  Officer Moszer, Chief Todd, and the men and women of the Fargo Police \nDepartment, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your service \nand for your sacrifice to the people of Fargo and to the State of North \nDakota.\n  I wish to end with the End of Watch:\n\n       Edward 143 Status Check. . . . Edward 143 Status Check. . . \n     . Last Call Edward 143 Status Check.\n       Adam One Central--Edward 143 is 1042. End of Watch, \n     February 11th 2016 at 1245 hours.\n\n  Those were the final words that their comrades spoke to Officer \nMoszer and his family.\n  Without brave men and women willing to step up and willing to stand \non the wall for every one of us, we would be a much lesser society.\n  My thanks to my colleague Senator Hoeven for joining me. It is in a \ngreat North Dakota spirit that we join together as colleagues in a \nbipartisan way to say thank you and to say goodbye to a wonderful \nofficer, Officer Moszer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/senate-section/article/S1045-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1045-S1046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 F_____\n                                 \n\n                          AMERICAN HEART MONTH\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I come to the floor today in recognition of American \nHeart Month.\n  For more than 50 years, Congress has recognized February as American \nHeart Month. During this time, we have seen many advances in reducing \ncongenital heart defects, heart disease, stroke, and other forms of \ncardiovascular disease through improvements in research, education, \nprevention, and treatment.\n  Over 1 million cardiovascular disease deaths are now averted each \nyear thanks to advances in biomedical research, prevention programs, \nand the development of new drugs and therapies; yet every 15 minutes, a \nchild is born with a heart defect, and nearly 86 million adults are \nliving with some form of cardiovascular disease. Congenital heart \ndefects are the most common type of birth defect, and heart disease \nalone remains our Nation's leading cause of death.\n  For millions of families across the country, including mine, the \nimpact of heart defects and disease can be overwhelmingly painful.\n  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, parents can now afford health \ninsurance, and coverage can no longer be denied for a preexisting \ncondition. Also, insurers cannot set arbitrary lifetime or annual \nlimits on care. These protections can be lifesaving, literally, when \ndealing with congenital heart conditions.\n  And while I am so proud of what we did in health reform to improve \naccess to care, we must do more to improve quality of care--and that \nmeans finding ways to better treat and even prevent these diseases.\n  Thankfully, there is hope for patients and families across the \ncountry. Breakthroughs in research are getting us closer to \nunderstanding the risk factors and causes of these diseases. We are \ndeveloping new drugs and therapies to help those who are suffering, and \nwe are improving standards of care for those living with and managing \nthese diseases.\n  Increases in funding for the NIH and CDC in the fiscal year 2016 \nomnibus bill will support these critical efforts in prevention, \nresearch, and treatment. We provided a historic funding increase of $2 \nbillion for the NIH, and the CDC's budget was increased by nearly 5 \npercent. These increases will support leading research efforts at the \nNIH on the causes of cardiovascular diseases and possible treatments; \ncommunity prevention programs at the CDC; as well as initiatives to \ngather data and track the incidence of congenital heart disease. These \ncannot be onetime increases. We must commit to sustained long-term \ninvestments in our Federal health agencies--that means ensuring robust \nfunding increases above inflation year after year. That is why I will \nagain fight for funding equal to five percent real growth in the fiscal \nyear 2017 appropriations bills for NIH, CDC, and seven other research \nagencies that contribute to medical and scientific advancements \nconsistent with two bills I have introduced.\n  The American Cures Act would provide annual budget increases of five \npercent over inflation every year for 10 years at American's top four \nbiomedical research agencies: the National Institutes of Health; the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention; the Department of Defense \nhealth programs; and the VA's Medical and Prosthetic Research Program, \nits biomedical research arm.\n  The American Innovations Act would invest an additional $110 billion \nover 10 years in the critically important basic science research at \nAmerica's top research agencies: the National Science Foundation; the \nDepartment of Energy Office of Science; the Department of Defense \nScience and Technology Programs; the National Institute of Standards \nand Technology Scientific and Technical Research; and the NASA Science \nDirectorate.\n  We can't afford not to invest in the work these critical agencies are \ndoing. And let me tell you why.\n  A few weeks ago, I was in Peoria, IL, touring the OSF Hospital there. \nResearchers from the University of Illinois Medical School are teaming \nup with the engineering department in joint efforts to bring new \ntechnologies to medical breakthroughs. They showed me a model of an \ninfant's heart. It was an exact 3-D printed replica of an actual infant \nheart with serious congenital defects that would be operated on. The \nmodel was produced\n\n[[Page S1046]]\n\nthrough MRIs and CAT scans. This allows surgeons to look at the heart, \nopen it, and prepare for the procedures that they are about to conduct. \nIt meant less time on the heart-lung machine, and it improves the odds \nof a positive recovery. These medical breakthroughs--made possible by \nFederal, State, and private contributions--are giving millions of \nAmericans hope.\n  In early January, surgeons at Prairie Heart Institute in my hometown \nof Springfield, IL, operated on a local woman from Decatur. The doctors \nreplaced two diseased heart valves with artificial valves that were \nthreaded into position inside catheters, smaller than the width of a \npencil. This procedure is known as a double trans-catheter valve \nreplacement. This successful surgery was only the fourth of its kind in \nthe United States, and the first in the world to use the latest \ngeneration of artificial valves. The lead surgeons were from Prairie \nand Southern Illinois University School of Medicine. Had the valve not \nbeen replaced, the patient would have faced a substantially higher risk \nfor death from congestive heart failure.\n  As co-chair of the Senate NIH Caucus, and co-chair of the bipartisan, \nbicameral Congressional Heart and Stroke Coalition, I want to thank my \ncolleagues for their commitment to lifesaving research for all \nAmericans. I also want to thank the researchers, advocates, public \nhealth professionals, families, and patients for their leadership and \ntireless support for advancements in the science and treatment of heart \ndiseases.\n  There is more work to be done, but I am optimistic for breakthroughs \nin the near future.\n  Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/senate-section/article/S1046-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          PLAN TO CLOSE THE GUANTANAMO BAY DETENTION FACILITY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for years, I have consistently opposed \nefforts by Congress to restrict the Obama administration's ability to \nclose the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. The indefinite \ndetention without trial of detainees at Guantanamo contradicts our most \nbasic principles of justice, degrades our international standing, and \nharms our national security. The mere existence of this facility serves \nas a recruitment tool for terrorists, and the facility costs American \ntaxpayers more than $4 million per detainee each year--an astonishing \namount of money that could be repurposed to keep our men and women in \nuniform safe.\n  I recently received a letter from former Marine Corps Commandant \nCharles Krulak, co-signed by an additional 60 retired generals and \nadmirals that noted ``closing Guantanamo is not just a national \nsecurity imperative, it is about reestablishing the core values of who \nwe are as a nation.'' I could not agree more. I ask unanimous consent \nthat General Krulak's letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion \nof my remarks.\n  Last May, I wrote a letter to President Obama urging him to expedite \nthe transfer of cleared detainees to foreign countries and accelerate \nthe periodic review board process to determine if additional detainees \ncould be transferred. Since that time, the President has made progress \ntoward closing the Guantanamo detention facility. To date, only 91 \ndetainees remain, and top national security officials have already \ncleared 35 of those detainees for transfer to foreign countries. I am \nencouraged that the plan unveiled by the administration yesterday \nmorning calls for accelerating the review process to determine if \nadditional detainees can be transferred, as I urged, and for completing \nthat process by the fall.\n  Now that President Obama has delivered a plan, Congress must do its \npart and lift the unnecessary and counterproductive restrictions on \ntransferring detainees to the United States, so that we can finally \nshutter Guantanamo once and for all. We should all want to see \nadditional detainees finally brought to justice in our Federal court \nsystem, which has a long and proven track record in terrorism \nprosecutions--unlike the military commission system that has been \nbogged down in legal challenges and procedural hurdles.\n  The detention facility at Guantanamo Bay has been a stain on our \nnational reputation for more than 14 years. Closing Guantanamo is the \nmorally and fiscally responsible thing to do, and it is long past time \nto stop the fear-mongering so we can work together to close it down.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                February 23, 2016.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I represent a coalition of more than 60 \n     retired generals and admirals of the United States Armed \n     Forces who have for years advocated the responsible closure \n     of the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. I write to urge \n     you to give serious consideration to the recently submitted \n     Department of Defense plan to close the detention facility at \n     Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Closing Guantanamo is in our national \n     security interest, and with the submission of the DOD plan, \n     there is a unique opportunity for Congress to lift the \n     remaining restrictions on transferring detainees so that \n     Guantanamo can be closed.\n       Guantanamo continues to impose significant costs to our \n     national security. As an offshore detention facility that--\n     rightly or wrongly--represents to the world an image of \n     detainee abuse and violations of the rule of law, Guantanamo \n     undermines counterterrorism cooperation with allies and \n     unnecessarily bolsters the propaganda and recruiting \n     narratives that terrorists seek to advance. It is a travesty \n     that the trial of the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks \n     remains bogged down at Guantanamo nearly 15 years after 9/11.\n       The issue of what to do with Guantanamo is not a political \n     issue. There is near unanimous agreement from our nation's \n     top military, intelligence, and law enforcement leaders that \n     Guantanamo should be closed. Even President George W. Bush, \n     who opened Guantanamo after the 9/11 attacks, tried to close \n     it, noting that ``the detention facility had become a \n     propaganda tool for our enemies and a distraction for our \n     allies.''\n       We understand that some fear bringing even a small number \n     of detainees to the United States as part of the plan to \n     close Guantanamo. However, we are confident that those \n     detainees can be held safely and securely stateside. Hundreds \n     of terrorists are already being held in U.S. prisons--\n     including one former Guantanamo detainee who is serving a \n     life sentence. Rather than trying to invoke fear, we should \n     applaud these communities that have successfully and safely \n     detained society's worst without incident. In any event, the \n     risks of keeping Guantanamo open far outweigh any risks \n     associated with closing it.\n       In the coming days and weeks, we plan on more closely \n     studying the Department of Defense's plan to close \n     Guantanamo, and we hope you will do the same. Closing \n     Guantanamo is not just a national security imperative, it is \n     about reestablishing the core values of who we are as a \n     nation, and we believe strongly that there must be a bi-\n     partisan approach to achieving that objective.\n           Semper Fidelis,\n                                                Charles C.

The estimated value of MDE is $.689 \n     billion. The total estimated value is $1.2 billion.\n       This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy \n     and national security of the United States. Japan is one of \n     the major political and economic powers in East Asia and the \n     Western Pacific and a key partner of the United States in \n     ensuring regional peace and stability. This transaction is \n     consistent with U.S. foreign policy and national security \n     objectives and the 1960 Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and \n     Security.\n       The proposed sale of the RQ-4 will significantly enhance \n     Japan's intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) \n     capabilities and help ensure that Japan is able to continue \n     to monitor and deter regional threats. The Japan Air Self \n     Defense Force (JASDF) will have no difficulty absorbing these \n     systems into its armed forces.\n       The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not \n     alter the basic military balance in the region.\n       The principal contractor will be Northrop Grumman \n     Corporation in Rancho Bernardo, California. There are no \n     known offset agreements in connection with this potential \n     sale.\n       Implementation of this proposed sale will require the \n     assignment of contractor representatives to Japan to perform \n     contractor logistics support and to support establishment of \n     required security infrastructure.\n       There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness \n     as a result of this proposed sale.\n\n\n                         Transmittal No. 15-62\n\n  Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section \n          36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act, as amended\n\n                           Annex Item No. vii\n\n       (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:\n       1. The RQ-4 Block 30 Global Hawk hardware and software are \n     UNCLASSIFIED. The highest level of classified information \n     required for operation may be SECRET depending on the \n     classification of the imagery or Signals Intelligence \n     (SIGINT) utilized on a specific operation. The RQ-4 is \n     optimized for long range and prolonged flight endurance. It \n     is used for military intelligence, surveillance, and \n     reconnaissance. Aircraft system, sensor, and navigational \n     status are provided continuously to the ground operators \n     through a health and status downlink for mission monitoring. \n     Navigation is via inertial navigation with integrated global \n     positioning system (GPS) updates. The vehicle is capable of \n     operating from a standard paved runway. Real time missions \n     are flown under the control of a pilot in a Ground Control \n     Element (GCE). It is designed to carry a non-weapons internal \n     payload of 3,000 lbs consisting primarily of sensors and \n     avionics. The following payloads are integrated into the RQ-\n     4: Enhanced Imagery Sensor Suite that includes multi-use \n     infrared, electro-optical, ground moving target indicator, \n     and synthetic aperture radar and a space to accommodate other \n     sensors such as SIGINT. The RQ-4 will include the GCE, which \n     consists of the following components:\n       a. The Mission Control Element (MCE) is the RQ-4 Global \n     Hawk ground control station for mission planning, \n     communication management, aircraft and mission control, and \n     image processing and dissemination. It can be either fixed or \n     mobile. In addition to the shelter housing the operator \n     workstations, the MCE includes an optional 6.25 meter Ku-Band \n     antenna assembly, a Tactical Modular Interoperable Surface \n     Terminal, a 12-ton Environmental Control Unit (heating and \n     air conditioning), and two 100 kilowatt electrical \n     generators. The MCE, technical data, and documentation are \n     UNCLASSIFIED. The MCE may operate at the classified level \n     depending on the classification of the data feeds.\n       b. The Launch and Recovery Element (LRE) is a subset of the \n     MCE and can be either fixed or mobile. It provides identical \n     functionality for mission planning and air vehicle command \n     and control (C2). The launch element contains a mission \n     planning workstation and a C2 workstation. The primary \n     difference between the LRE and MCE is the lack of any wide-\n     band data links or image processing capability within the LRE \n     and navigation equipment at the LRE to provide the precision \n     required for ground operations, take-off, and landing. The \n     LRE, technical data, and documentation are UNCLASSIFIED. The \n     EISS includes infrared/electro-optical, synthetic aperture \n     radar imagery, ground moving target indicator and space to \n     accommodate optional SIGINT, Maritime, datalink, and \n     automatic identification system capabilities. The ground \n     control element includes a mission control function and a \n     launch and recovery capability.\n       c. The RQ-4 employs a quad-redundant Inertial Navigation \n     System/Global Positioning System (INS/GPS) configuration. The \n     system utilizes two different INS/GPS systems for greater \n     redundancy. The system consists of two LN-251 units and two \n     Kearfott KN-4074E INS/GPS Units. The LN-251 is a fully \n     integrated, non-dithered navigation system with an embedded \n     Selective Availability/Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM), P(Y) \n     code or Standard Positioning Service (SPS) GPS. It utilizes a \n     Fiber-Optic Gyro (FOG) and includes three independent \n     navigation solutions; blended INS/GPS, INS-only, and GPS-\n     only. The Kearfott KN-4074E features a Monolithic Ring Laser \n     Gyro (MRLG) and accelerometer. The inertial sensors are \n     tightly coupled with an embedded SAASM P(Y) code GPS. Both \n     systems employ cryptographic technology that can be \n     classified up to SECRET.\n       2. If a technology advanced adversary were to obtain \n     knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the \n     information could be used to develop countermeasures that \n     might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the \n     development of a system with similar or advanced \n     capabilities.\n       3. All defense articles and services listed in this \n     transmittal have been authorized for release and export to \n     the Government of Japan.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Defense Security\n\n\n                                           Cooperation Agency,\n\n                                  Arlington VA, February 10, 2016.\n     Hon.

That is a credit to \nhim.\n  While I may have disagreed with him on matters of law and policy, we \nare united as Americans in sharing our condolences.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/senate-section/article/S1054-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1054-S1055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, in honor of the rich cultural heritage \nof the African-American community in Maryland and in memory of all the \nfreedom fighters across the Nation, past and present, I am celebrating \nBlack History Month by reexamining what this country still needs to do \nto guarantee that African Americans are not left behind when it comes \nto the issues that matter.\n  We are living right now in a world that is fighting for change on \nmany levels, from social unrest in our cities, to expansive \ninternational crises. While the news may seem grim, there is also \ninspiration every day around the world as people come together to bring \nabout the peaceful change that they are fighting for. There are \npeaceful protests for great social change, the next generation is \nvolunteering and giving hope to their communities, and educational \nopportunities continue to grow for our youth around the world.\n  Reflecting on where we have been and where we are going, I recognize \nthe immeasurable impact that Maryland African Americans have made to \nour culture and to the fight for equal rights for all. Benjamin \nBanneker, born in Catonsville, made scientific strides to help us \nunderstand the mysteries of nature. Harriet Tubman and Reverend Josiah \nHenson each led slaves to freedom through the Underground Railroad \nrunning through Maryland, defying the law and fighting for what was \nright. Isaac Myers became a labor leader, the first president of the \nColored National Labor Union, and a cofounder of a cooperative shipyard \nand railway to provide African Americans with employment opportunities \nin Baltimore. Frederick Douglass was a dedicated and prolific civil \nrights activist and author. Explorer Matthew Henson co-discovered the \nNorth Pole and traversed the ends of the earth.\n  We certainly will never forget the esteemed Supreme Court Justice \nThurgood Marshall, the first African-American Justice on the Court, who \nprotected and fought for our rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit \nof happiness. He fought for desegregation through the law throughout \nhis long career, in particular arguing the Brown v. Board of Education \ncase in front of the Supreme Court, on behalf of African-American \nschoolchildren across the U.S.\n  We honor those who came before us by continuing to fight for justice \nand equality today. That means the right laws, and it means the right \neducation. That means fighting for economic justice, social justice, \nand criminal justice. We know that the best weapons against economic \ninjustice is a good education. That is why I am fighting for public \nschools that families can count on because the quality of education \nyour kids receive shouldn't depend on the zip code you live in. That is \nwhy I fought and continue to fight for early child care, which helps \n1.5 million children, including 19,000 in Maryland, get ready for \nschool. That is why I pushed to fund early education to help States \nimplement high quality preschool programs and Head Start programs. That \nmeans college that is affordable and accessible. It is why I am \nfighting to simplify the application for student aid and expand Pell \ngrants to make sure that students can pay for books next semester or \nrent next month. We fought for the American Opportunity Tax Credit so \nthat parents could get a tax break for sending their kids to college--\nbecause a college education is part of the American dream, not part of \na financial nightmare.\n  We look to our community and national leaders, like the NAACP, \nheadquartered in Baltimore, to continue to lead the fight for equal \nrights. We look to our strong leaders in Maryland, like Freeman \nHrabowski, the president of the University of Maryland, Baltimore \nCounty, and Representative Elijah Cummings, fighting tooth and nail \nevery day for the citizens of Maryland's Seventh Congressional \nDistrict.\n  With people like this to look up to, we are reminded of the abiding \ntruth that each of us has the power to create a better world for \nourselves and our children. So the battle is enjoined. As the great \nMartin Luther King, Jr., said, ``Change does not roll in on the wheels \nof inevitability, but comes through continuous struggle. And so we must \nstraighten our backs and work for our freedom.'' This is not about the \npast, and it is not only about the present, but it is also about the \nfuture.\n  I thank so many people and organizations around the Nation and in \nMaryland for all they do every day for our future. Remember, each of us \ncan make a difference, but together we can make change.\n  Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, as we celebrate Black History Month, we \nremember so many trailblazers. From William Flora's heroism during the \nAmerican Revolution, to Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman, Rosa \nParks and Dr. Martin Luther King, the contributions of Black Americans \nthroughout our Nation's history are great. But they are not limited to \nthe names and stories we all know--every family has their legend, their \ngroundbreaker.\n  Growing up in North Charleston, SC, my granddaddy, Artis Ware, was my \nhero. He passed away last month at the age of 94, leaving our family \nsaddened by his loss, but truly blessed by his life. I wanted to take \nthis opportunity to share what my granddaddy meant to us, and how his \nlegacy shows the true meaning of Proverbs 13:22--``A good man leaves an \ninheritance to his children's children.''\n  My granddaddy was born in 1921 in Salley, SC. He grew up picking \ncotton and left school after the third grade. He did not let the lack \nof a formal education hold him back though, and as he grew up, he moved \nto North Charleston\n\n[[Page S1055]]\n\nand eventually secured a job with the South Carolina Ports Authority.\n  As a young kid, this was the granddaddy I knew, not one that let his \ncircumstances hold him back or let his frustrations overtake his love \nfor his family. After my parents' divorce, my mom, my brother, and I \nall moved into my grandparents' house--about 800 or 900 square feet and \none bathroom. The three of us shared a bedroom--and were happy to do \nso.\n  What I remember most about my granddaddy from this time was, on so \nmany mornings, he would sit down at the kitchen table, have a cup of \ncoffee, and leaf through the newspaper. He wanted us to see him \nreading, reinforcing the importance of doing well in school. It wasn't \nuntil years later that I learned he couldn't read.\n  My cousin also loves to tell the story of how granddaddy would wake \nup to do the laundry at 4 a.m. and make sure everyone else got up and \nstarted working as well. That work ethic and dedication started to \nfunnel down through the rest of our family and showed us all the \nimportance of hard work.\n  Granddaddy's messages worked--my brother recently retired as a \ncommand sergeant major after 30 years in the Army, my cousin is a \npreacher in North Charleston, and I eventually got my own act together \nas well. My nephew, grandaddy's great-grandson, has earned his \nundergrad from Georgia Tech, his master's at Duke, and is now headed to \nmedical school at Emory.\n  That is the power of a strong role model, someone who knows there is \na better future out there for his family. In my granddaddy's lifetime, \nour family went from cotton to Congress, and I could never even pretend \nto thank him enough. He was the rock for our family--our trailblazer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/senate-section/article/S1055-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONTRIBUTIONS OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN ARMY ENGINEERS TO THE STATE OF ALASKA\n\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the immense \ncontributions of the African-American community to my State of Alaska \nand to our great Nation.\n  I want to highlight in particular a contingent of troops, members of \nthe African-American Army Engineers, who were stationed in Alaska \nduring World War II, hundreds of men who served our Nation at a time \nwhen their basic human rights were being denied, some 6 years before \nthe military was desegregated. In spite of that despicable injustice, \nthey exhibited a great love for this country, even a willingness to die \nfor this country.\n  These soldiers were stationed in Alaska among several regiments \nassigned to build the ALCAN--Alaska-Canada--Highway. For a State as big \nand diverse as Alaska, infrastructure is critically important to the \nwell-being of our communities. And in the 1940s, infrastructure \nassets--roads, bridges, ports--were few and far between. In fact, there \nwas no road linking the contiguous United States to Alaska through \nCanada. We were isolated.\n  We think of construction projects today, the many tools and machines \nour hard-working crews have at their disposal. But back then, many of \nthose technologies and advancements didn't exist, making this enormous \nundertaking all the more daunting. Worse still, the machinery that was \navailable was often given to the all-White units, leaving the African-\nAmerican servicemembers ill-equipped. Nonetheless, the men of the \nAfrican-American Army Engineers labored on under extreme weather \nconditions, creating a roughly 1,700 mile cross-continental corridor in \na mere 8 months.\n  The project, too, came at a time when our Nation was under imminent \nthreat in the Pacific, just 2 months after the attack on Pearl Harbor. \nOur country needed to get supplies and soldiers to the furthest \nstretches of U.S. territory. Without the ALCAN, Alaska would not be the \ncornerstone of our national defense in the Pacific and the Arctic, nor \nthe prosperous land of opportunity we see today.\n  For these enormous contributions and for their selfless service to \nour country, we thank the thousands of African-American servicemembers \nwho for too long were dismissed and overlooked.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/senate-section/article/S1055-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1055-S1056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DONNA MILLER\n\n Mr. HELLER.

In 1996, she graduated from nursing school and moved to Las Vegas \n3 years later. She obtained her flight nurse wings in 2001, beginning \nher career caring for others. In 2002, she helped found Life Guard \nInternational Air Ambulance, and in 2007, she reorganized it into Life \nGuard International--Flying ICU, Flying ICU. This incredible \norganization serves as a flying intensive care unit, transporting \ncritically ill and injured patients from one hospital to another that \noffers more resources in a different location.\n  Beginning in 2009, Flying ICU served as a necessary resource to the \nTonopah community, transporting all ill and injured patients from the \nNye Regional Medical Center to facilities in Las Vegas and Reno. \nUnfortunately, last fall, the Nye Regional Medical Center closed its \ndoors, leaving this rural community with a devastating lack of access \nto health care. After the medical center's closing, Ms. Miller \ncourageously decided to keep Flying ICU's Tonopah location, changing \nthe organization to an emergency medical service, which treats and \ntransports patients by plane while traveling to the closest hospital in \nLas Vegas or Reno. This service currently is the only resource in the \nregion for the critically ill and injured to receive lifesaving care.\n  Ms. Miller also took the initiative to relocate a second plane to \nTonopah and increase staff with additional critical care nurses, \nparamedics, and pilots to provide greater services to the local \ncommunity. In order to minimize the amount of time that Tonopah's \nflight crews were away from the Tonopah station, Ms. Miller organized \nadditional Flying ICU flight crews on standby at Nevada airports to \nallow patients to be further transported by the standby crew, allowing \nthe flight crew to return to the station in a timely manner. Ms. \nMiller's work on this organization is one of a kind, and I am thankful \nfor her work in saving the lives of Nevadans. Her decision to step up \nto the plate and provide the Tonopah community many medical resources \nit would otherwise be without remains invaluable for our State.\n  Today Flying ICU's services reach across the State, saving lives with \nfour aircraft, a hangar at McCarran International Airport, and \noperation bases in Las Vegas and Tonopah. The organization employs over \n50 medical and aviation professionals to help those in need. Flying \nICU's reputation of safe and quality care is well deserved.\n  In 2014, Ms. Miller was elected as the president of the Nevada Nurses \nAssociation, district Three. She has received many awards for her \nactions, including being recognized as Ambassador for Peace by the \nInternational Women's Federation for World Peace in 2014, SBA's Nevada \nWoman-Owned Business of the Year Award in 2014, the 2014 Women of \nDistinction Awards--Entrepreneur of the Year, and as one of Las Vegas's \n2015 Top 100 Women of Influence. These accolades are given only to \nthose who have done extraordinary acts to earn them, and Ms. Miller \nwithout a doubt deserves each one. Nevada is fortunate to have someone \nlike Ms. Miller representing our State. She is a shining example of \nselflessness for myself and others.\n  Ms. Miller has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to our State, \nsaving lives and providing care to Nevadans in need. Her drive to help \nthose around her is inspiring, and I thank her for all of her hard \nwork. I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in thanking Ms. \nMiller for her many contributions to our State. I wish her well as she \ncontinues her efforts to help those in need and in servicing the city \nof Tonopah and those across central Nevada.\n\n[[Page S1056]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/senate-section/article/S1056-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JENNIFER SPROUT\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate \nJennifer Sprout on her retirement after serving as CEO of the Elko Area \nChamber of Commerce for 6 years. It gives me great pleasure to \nrecognize her years of service to the city of Elko's business \ncommunity.\n  Ms. Sprout grew up in California and moved to Elko when she was 19 \nyears old. Prior to working for the chamber, she served as account \nmanager and general manager for Holiday Broadcasting of Elko. In 2009, \nMs. Sprout accepted the position of CEO at the Elko Area Chamber of \nCommerce. As CEO, she served as a powerful voice for Elko businesses, \nworking to bring awareness to issues affecting this community.\n  She also spearheaded efforts to grow outside recognition of the \nresources the city has to offer and provided opportunities for business \nleaders to come together. The city of Elko is recognized as a tourist \ndestination and economic hub for the northeastern part of Nevada, due \nin part to Ms. Sprout's hard work and unwavering dedication to growing \nthe community. To say she has had a positive impact on the city of Elko \nwould be an understatement. The strong foundation she has built \nthroughout her tenure will be felt for years to come.\n  The Elko Area Chamber of Commerce was established on April 1, 1907, \nto support the local business community and promote the city of Elko. \nToday the chamber has over 700 businesses represented through various \nmembers. This incredible organization has helped businesses through \ntimes of economic downturn and recovery to stay on their feet and \nsucceed. Through the incredible work of the Elko Area Chamber of \nCommerce, Elko's business community continues to thrive and maintain a \nhigh quality of life for residents. The city of Elko is fortunate to \nhave had someone like Ms. Sprout leading the way at this important \nchamber.\n  Ms. Sprout has demonstrated professionalism, commitment to \nexcellence, and dedication to the highest standards during her tenure \nat the Elko Area Chamber of Commerce. I am both humbled and honored by \nher service and am proud to call her a fellow Nevadan.\n  Today I ask all of my colleagues to join me in congratulating Ms. \nSprout on her retirement from the chamber and in wishing her well at \nher new position with Design Concepts. I give my deepest appreciation \nfor all that she has done for the city of Elko.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/senate-section/article/S1056-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING DR. ROBERT B. HAYLING\n\n Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the \nachievements of Dr. Robert B. Hayling, a civil rights leader in Florida \nwho passed away on December 20, 2015, at the age of 86.\n  Dr. Hayling was born in Tallahassee and graduated from Florida \nAgricultural & Mechanical College. Upon graduation, Dr. Hayling served \nin the U.S. Air Force. Dr. Hayling went on to receive his degree in \ndentistry from Meharry Medical College and became the first African-\nAmerican dentist in Florida to be elected to the local, regional, \nState, and national components of the American Dental Association.\n  Throughout his years as a community leader and civil rights activist \nin St. Augustine, Dr. Hayling faced numerous threats, hate speech, and \nbrutal violence at the hands of the Ku Klux Klan. Nevertheless, Dr. \nHayling persevered in his resolve for racial equality and is widely \nrecognized as a father of the St. Augustine civil rights movement. \nDuring a time of widespread racial divide, Dr. Hayling served as an \nadviser to the youth council of the National Association for the \nAdvancement of Colored People and as head of the St. Augustine chapter \nof the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the national \norganization of which Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was president.\n  Dr. Hayling is the recipient of various honors and awards, including \nthe Order of La Florida and the de Aviles award which honors citizens \nthat have dedicated themselves to the community of St. Augustine. Scott \nStreet in St. Augustine has been renamed Dr. Robert B. Hayling Place in \nhis honor.\n  Dr. Hayling was inducted into the Florida Civil Rights Hall of Fame \nand received a certificate of recognition by St. Augustine's mayor. \nEven his old dental office became the first civil rights museum in \nFlorida. Further, State Senator Tony Hill sponsored the Dr. Robert B. \nHayling Award of Valor, which is presented to civil rights heroes, and \na bronze plaque testifying to Dr. Hayling's contributions hangs in the \nlobby of the Florida State Capitol.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to recognize and thank Dr. \nRobert B. Hayling for his commitment, achievements, and dedication in \nadvancing the cause of racial equality and civil rights on both a \nnational and State level.\n  I offer my heartfelt condolences to the family, friends, and loved \nones of Dr. Robert B. Hayling.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/senate-section/article/S1056-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/senate-section/article/S1056-4", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/25/senate-section/article/S1056-5", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1056-S1057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:47 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 238.

A bill to establish the Indian Education Agency to \nstreamline the administration of Indian education, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about legislation \nthat will streamline and modernize the Bureau of Indian Education.\n  The Bureau of Indian Education school system includes 183 elementary \nand secondary schools, and it serves roughly 48,000 students. Part of \nthe school system falls under a cumbersome bureaucracy burdened with \nneedless red tape. This has led to staffing and administrative issues \nat these schools, as well as problems with neglect at the facilities \nthemselves. A lack of defined leadership at the Bureau of Indian \nEducation has led to schools falling through the cracks. In the past 36 \nyears, there have been 33 Bureau of Indian Education directors. \nStability and clear structure are needed.\n  Last May, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, which I chair, held \nan oversight hearing on this topic. We heard testimony from Government \nAccountability Office officials that more accountability is needed at \nthe Bureau of Indian Education to help students succeed.\n  That is why I am introducing the Reforming American Indian Standards \nof Education--or RAISE--Act. The RAISE Act separates the functions of \nthe Bureau of Indian Education from the Bureau of Indian Affairs into \nan independent agency under the Department of the Interior. This agency \nwould be led by a president-appointed and Senate-confirmed director and \ntwo assistant directors. Together, this leadership team will oversee \nthe administration of Indian Education, curriculum for the schools and \nschool-facilities management.\n  The RAISE Act will create better accountability for all. By having a \nleadership team that tribes can directly address for their school's \nneeds, Indian students attending these schools will have a greater \nvoice. The current Indian school system is managed in such a fragmented \nand complicated manner that it has failed students for many years. \nThese students are our future, and they deserve our best efforts to \naddress their educational needs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2580\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
