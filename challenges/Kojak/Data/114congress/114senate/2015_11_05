Mr. President, I remember a recent time when President \nObama tried to spin Americans on ObamaCare. The best he could muster \nthen was a condescending, sort of cringe-inducing message that likely \nturned off more people than it converted. He even said that Americans \nwho already had health insurance ``may not know that they've got a \nbetter deal now [under ObamaCare] than they did, but they do.''\n  As I said, it was condescending and cringe-inducing. It was so out of \ntouch with the priorities of America's middle class.\n  Well, it looks as though the President is going to try again today \nwith a series of regional TV interviews. He will do so with headlines \nsuch as these as a backdrop: CBS, ``Affordable Care Act not so \naffordable''; AP, ``More than half of health law's insurance co-ops are \nclosing.'' Here is a headline about the President's home State: ``Some \nObamacare marketplace prices see double-digit jump in Illinois.'' And \nhere is one about mine: ``Health co-op closes, 51,000 need new \ninsurance.'' This is on top of the massive premium increases so many \nKentuckians have faced.\n  This isn't just a Kentucky story or an Illinois story. In every \ncorner of the country, we see story after story about sharply rising \npremiums. The largest insurers in Tennessee have rates going up 36 \npercent. A large insurer in Oklahoma is raising premiums by 35 percent. \nIn Hawaii, families are looking at increases of 26 and 34 percent. It \nis easy to glaze over the numbers, but this is real money coming out of \nthe pockets of real families. This is money that could help send a \nchild to college or put Thanksgiving dinner on the table, but instead \nit will go to insurance bills made unnecessarily expensive in part \nbecause of ObamaCare's costly rules and regulations.\n  Perhaps the President will settle today for trying to convince \nAmericans that ObamaCare's Web site is at least working better than in \nyears past, but that just means it will be a little easier for middle-\nclass families to pay more for unaffordable health insurance and higher \nout-of-pocket costs. That is hardly the makings of better headlines or \nbetter outcomes for the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/05/senate-section/article/S7775-6", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, ObamaCare is working, as the New York Times \nindicated in a strong column this week showing how dramatically the \nrates of uninsurance have dropped since this bill passed. The initial \nposting of premiums doesn't tell the whole story. The law requires the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to post only the proposed \nincreases that exceed 10 percent. Many of those proposed rates have \ngone through a review process at the State level, and after that \nreview, States will reduce many of those rates. Remember, we are \ntalking only about the States that had an increase of more than 10 \npercent. Almost all the States had increases that were far less than \nthat.\n  The health reform law caps 85 percent of exchange enrollees' premiums \nas a share of their income, and because of the health law, insurance \ncompanies must spend at least 80 cents of every dollar on health \nservices. Prior to this law passing, these health insurance companies \nspent huge amounts of their money on salaries and other things that \ndidn't relate to the health of their enrollees, and now 80 percent of \nevery dollar must be spent on the enrollees. This has resulted in \nrebates totaling $9 billion paid to consumers since 2011. Eighty cents \nof every dollar is spent on\n\n[[Page S7776]]\n\nhealth services rather than administrative costs and profits.\n  Addressing insurance premium increases in the individual market was a \nkey reason we enacted the health reform bill in the first place. Before \nthe health reform law, patients were subject to premium increases, \ncancellations, denials for preexisting conditions, and arbitrary limits \non how much care insurance would cover.\n  Thanks to this health reform law, proposed premium increases are \nseeing the light of day and are subject to scrutiny, which wasn't the \nway it was before.\n  Under the health reform law, insurance companies cannot deny coverage \nor charge more because of a preexisting condition or for simply being a \nwoman. Insurance companies cannot arbitrarily cut off benefits when you \nreally need them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/05/senate-section/article/S7776-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO WADE HENDERSON\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the true test of leadership is whether one \nleaves behind the conviction that others will carry on. Yesterday Wade \nHenderson, one of the fathers of the civil rights movement, announced \nthat he will retire from the position as president and CEO of the \nLeadership Conference on Civil Rights and the Leadership Conference \nEducation Fund to make room for future leaders.\n  Wade Henderson has inspired a new generation to hold our country to \nits most sacred values: liberty and justice for all. Wade has been a \ntrue leader. For the past 20 years he has been a tireless advocate for \njustice and equality. His conviction, skill, and expertise can be found \nin every major civil rights victory over the past two decades.\n  Wade has led the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights \nthrough the successful passage of the Help America Vote Act of 2002; \nthe Voting Rights Act reauthorization of 2006; the ADA Amendments Act \nin 2008; Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act \nin 2009; Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009; Dodd-Frank Wall Street \nReform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010; and the Fair Sentencing Act \nof 2010.\n  From the passage of the hate crimes laws in the early 1990s to \nefforts to end racial profiling and pass comprehensive immigration \nreform, Wade Henderson has carried the weight and responsibility of the \nmodern civil rights movement on his shoulders.\n  As Wade transforms and transitions into the next stage of his life, I \nhave no doubt he will continue to be a champion of people of color, \nwomen, children, organized labor, persons with disabilities, seniors, \nthe LGBT community, and faith communities.\n  Today I congratulate Wade Henderson for his years of service to our \nNation and the world. I wish him continued success in all of his future \nendeavors.\n  Will the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/05/senate-section/article/S7776-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 2685, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 118, H.R. 2685, a bill \n     making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 11 \na.m. will be equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I come before the Senate to express my \nstrong support for proceeding to the fiscal year 2016 Defense \nappropriations bill. This bill provides vital funding for the men and \nwomen of our armed services at a time of serious and growing threats to \nour own national security and at a time of troubling instability and \nviolent conflicts in many countries around the world.\n  Proceeding would allow the Senate an opportunity to debate defense \nfunding in an open and transparent manner and to meet our \nconstitutional obligations. I am truly perplexed to hear some of my \ndear friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle suggest that \nthere is a Republican plan to enact only the Defense appropriations \nbill and then proceed to a continuing resolution for all of the other \nvital appropriations bills. It would be an understatement to say that \ncontinuing resolutions are certainly not the preferred option of the \nAppropriations Committee, and I say that as a proud member of that \ncommittee. Continuing resolutions create uncertainty, they lock in last \nyear's priorities, and they continue to fund programs that should be \neliminated. They are not effective ways to govern.\n  I want to be clear. Supporting an individual appropriations bill in \nno way suggests that the Senate is somehow giving up on passing the \nother 11 subcommittee appropriations bills, whether they are brought to \nthe floor individually or as an omnibus package.\n  Members of the Appropriations Committee now have working numbers as a \nresult of the budget agreement. We are working together diligently in a \nbipartisan, bicameral manner to craft a bipartisan omnibus that can be \nsupported by both Chambers.\n  Democrats and Republicans came together to pass a budget agreement \njust a few short days ago, and our ongoing negotiations prove our \nsincerity and determination to move ahead with individual bills and in \ncrafting an omnibus. We have already made great progress this year. As \nour chairman, Thad Cochran, has noted previously, this is the first \ntime in 6 years that the Appropriations Committee has approved all 12 \nof its bills. Many of those bills, due to the leadership on the \nDemocratic side of my dear friend Barbara Mikulski, and others, have \nbeen bipartisan when they were reported by our committee. I would note \nthat we completed our work despite terribly strict budget constraints \nmonths ago.\n  Now, we are in a new stage. We have a bipartisan, 2-year budget \nagreement that has provided some much needed relief to some of the \nbudget caps, while keeping us on a fiscally responsible path.\n  This is the third time the Senate has attempted to take up this vital \nappropriations bill. The last time, my Democratic friends objected \nbecause there was no bipartisan, bicameral budget agreement. In the \nabsence of such an agreement, they said they could not proceed with a \nbill. Now, I didn't agree with that rationale, but I understood it. I \ndo not understand the situation we find ourselves in today. We have a \nbudget agreement--a bipartisan, bicameral budget agreement. I do not \nunderstand why we cannot move forward with the Defense appropriations \nbill and, I hope, other bills individually and then ultimately an \nomnibus bill for those that we simply run out of time to consider this \nyear. Next year, due to this budget agreement, I hope we can bring each \nand every one of the individual appropriations bills before the Senate \nfor debate and amendment the way we used to do, and that is our goal.\n  December 11 is quickly approaching, and that is the date when the \ncurrent continuing resolution expires. We must act before then to \nensure that the Federal Government remains open. We must act to ensure \nthat vital Federal programs are funded and not operating under yet \nanother continuing resolution, which is such poor policy. That is what \nwe are trying to prevent.\n  Let's get the Defense appropriations bill approved. Then, I hope we \ncan bring up at least one or two or perhaps three other appropriations \nbills. In the meantime, we are already working on the omnibus bill.\n  As chairman of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and \nRelated Agencies Subcommittee, I have already met with my ranking \nmember, Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, and with our counterparts on \nthe House side to begin the negotiations on our bill. We are operating \nunder a very tight timeframe that will require Members to work around \nthe clock and a good-faith effort from all sides. That is what I am \nasking for today: for Members on the other side of the aisle to take \nthe majority leader, the Republican leader, at his word, to pass this \nbill--this vitally needed bill--and then to go on to a second \nindividual appropriations bill, all the while we are working in a \nbipartisan way to craft an omnibus bill.\n\n[[Page S7777]]\n\n  I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the importance of advancing \nthe fiscal year 2016 appropriations bills. Let me reiterate that it is \nsimply wrong for any of my Democratic colleagues to assume that \nproceeding to the Defense appropriations bill somehow suggests that \nthere is no interest by our leader in passing an omnibus that will \ninclude the other vital bills funding essential education, biomedical \nresearch, transportation, housing, agriculture, energy, environmental, \nand other important programs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support proceeding to this vital bill. To \nfail to do so once again, for the third time, despite the existence of \nthe budget framework that we have agreed to, and to fail to do so just \ndays before we honor our Nation's veterans would be a grave disservice \nto those who serve in our military today.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Seeing no one seeking the floor, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, for months, we have called for Senate \nDemocrats to stand and support our troops and pass the Defense \nappropriations legislation. In fact, this is the first time--the first \ntime since 2009--that all 12 appropriations bills were reported out of \ncommittee, and most with strong bipartisan support.\n  I serve on the Appropriations Committee. In fact, I serve on the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee. But today we are once again \nconsidering opening debate on the Department of Defense Appropriations \nAct of 2016, a bill that passed out of the Appropriations Committee on \nJune 11 with a very strong bipartisan vote of 27 to 3.\n  As we approach Veterans Day next week, today could mark the third \ntime that Democrats have blocked this critical legislation to fund our \ntroops. This comes at a time when our troops are actively engaged in \nmultiple theaters abroad and they need the critical support of our \nNation's growing mission overseas. But rather than passing this vital \nfunding bill, my Democratic colleagues would rather play politics and \nperpetuate the obstruction that plagues their party. The minority \nleader's constituents in Nevada deserve more. They deserve better. \nMontanans deserve more. The American people deserve more.\n  So here we are debating, for the third time, simply to proceed on \nDefense appropriations legislation and to open it up for debate. Let's \nbe clear. The way the process works is we have to have first a vote to \nbring the bill to the floor to begin deliberation. This, the greatest \ndeliberative body in the world, can't even deliberate on the Defense \nappropriations bill because our friends across the aisle are blocking \nit. It is time to open it up for debate, open it up for amendments. \nThis is the process of the Senate. The American people and the troops \ndeserve more.\n\n  It appears that the Democratic leader and his Democratic colleagues \nwould rather huddle in back rooms somewhere and concoct yet another \ndeal behind closed doors versus in full daylight in transparency on the \nSenate floor because they would rather negotiate in private than engage \nin an open and honest debate in front of the American people.\n  Unfortunately, today the Senate Democrats will put partisan politics \nahead of funding the troops. The senior Senator from New York, the \nlikely next Democratic leader, has already foretold that Democrats \nwould rather throw together another massive spending package than to \nallow open consideration of each part of the Nation's budget. No wonder \nwe are $19 trillion dollars in debt. Senator Schumer said:\n\n       We could pass a defense bill and then they could say, \n     ``Well, we'll do a [continuing resolution] on the rest of \n     it,'' violating the 50-50 deal. We need to negotiate an \n     omnibus all at once and all together.\n\n  I reject that. Montanans know firsthand the importance of supporting \nour men and women in uniform. The passage of this legislation is \ncritical to carrying out our missions in an increasingly dangerous \nworld, and it is important regarding missions we support in Montana. \nThis Defense appropriations bill protects the Montana Air National \nGuard C-130 mission by moving forward with the Avionics Modernization \nProgram, or AMP Increments 1 and 2, which are improvements from the \noriginal costly AMP program. This will ensure the C-130s at the Montana \nNational Guard will be certified to continue flying by 2020 and provide \na pathway for a full-scale avionics upgrade that addresses outdated \ncomponents. It also funds key engine modifications for those C-130s.\n  The Senate Democrats would prefer to once again obstruct regular \norder in the same fashion they did during the past few years, which \nbecame the hallmark--it became the trademark of a failed Democrat-led \nSenate majority. So as the Senate heads home for the weekend, I \nchallenge my Democratic colleagues to look at their veterans, to look \ntheir active duty troops and military families in the eye and ask \nthemselves: Did I serve these selfless men and women or the Washington \nestablishment? I think we know which one they will choose.\n  I encourage my Senate Democratic colleagues to change course. We have \na chance to change course on this upcoming vote. Vote yes on moving \nthis critical defense legislation forward.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time in a \nquorum call before the 11 a.m. vote today be charged equally against \neach side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAINES. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, at 11 o'clock the Senate is going to vote \non the Defense appropriations bill. This is a bill I have worked on \nwith Senator Cochran of Mississippi. He not only chairs the \nAppropriations Committee but the Subcommittee on Defense, which I serve \nas ranking member on as well.\n  The effort in this bill is extraordinary because it comprises \nvirtually 60 percent of the domestic discretionary spending of our \ngovernment. It, of course, deals with the Department of Defense and \nintelligence agencies. I just want to say we have worked on this on a \nbipartisan basis from the start. It has been a real pleasure to work \nwith Senator Cochran. I commend him for his leadership and his \ngentility and thank him for all of the good work he has put into this \nbill.\n  It is going to be a procedural vote that we anticipate is not going \nto allow this bill to go forward. It is not a reflection on the \nsubstance of the bill at all. Though we may disagree with one or two \nprovisions in the bill--and even as one of the authors I can say that--\nthe fact is that what we are trying to do now is position ourselves to \ncomplete the work of last week's budget agreement.\n  I think there is an understanding, at least at this moment, of how we \nwill move forward, but I say to my colleagues that we can stand behind \nthe substance of this bill. Procedurally, we may be delaying it today, \nbut ultimately it will pass and I look forward to supporting it at that \ntime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak up to \n10 minutes.\n\n[[Page S7778]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I would like to address my remarks to \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle, my Democratic colleagues. \nYesterday I spent almost a whole day working with Democratic colleagues \non a variety of proposals to try to get bipartisan results in the \nSenate. We have had more bipartisan results this year than most people \nthink, whether it is the progress we have made on No Child Left Behind \nor on the trade bill or on the doc fix or on changing the way we pay \ndoctors or on the USA Freedom Act, or on the Defense authorization \nbill. It is a long list.\n  I was working to get bipartisan results yesterday because that is \nwhat I am supposed to do as a United States Senator. I am not sent here \nto posture or to make a political point. I am sent here--given this \nprivilege--in order to create an environment where we can solve \nproblems for the benefit of the taxpayers, for the benefit of the \nAmerican people. So that is how I spent my time yesterday. I do not \nthink any other Republican spent more time than I did working with \ncolleagues on the Democratic side to do that, which is why I am \naddressing my remarks to my Democratic friends.\n  What they have proposed to do is block our moving to the \nappropriations bill for the defense of this country for the third \ntime--for the third time. There is no justification whatsoever to do \nthat. What I am saying to my friends is don't go there, because if you \ncontinue to block appropriations bills, you are going to set in motion \nan irreversible trend toward partisanship in this Senate and I am going \nto lead it. I am going to lead it.\n  Instead of spending my time working with Democrats to get bipartisan \nresults, we are going go in another direction. Now, why would I say \nthat? Because I am not here to be partisan. Let me give you the example \nof the appropriations bill that Senator Feinstein from California and I \nhave worked on. We worked on that bill in a bipartisan way. I think \neven she would say she wrote about as much of it as I did. There's a \npage full of things she thought are important for our country that are \npart of the bill. There are probably more than 75 Senators who wrote us \nletters--about half of them Democratic Senators--who wrote us letters \nsaying: These are important provisions in the Energy and Water \nAppropriations bill. Those provisions are in our bill. They are ready \nto be considered.\n  Twice, the Democrats have kept us from considering the Defense \nAppropriations bill. Today, they are going to do it again. What they \nare saying to us is that we are going to come up with any reason--any \nexcuse--not to have a normal appropriations process. The last time \nDemocrats argued: We did not have enough money. The way you deal with \nnot enough money, if that is your opinion, is you bring a bill to the \nfloor, you vote on it, you pass it if you can, you send it to the \nPresident, if the President disagrees with you, he vetoes it. It comes \nback and we negotiate and we have a compromise.\n  That is the way it works. You don't just jam something through \nbecause you have the power to stop something or the power to jam it \nthrough. That is the way you pass ObamaCare. That is the way you make \nsure the country has no respect for what we are trying to do. But that \nis what the Democrats did with appropriations this year and they got a \nresult. I am not unhappy with the result, and I voted for the budget \nagreement. But what it does is it creates additional spending for \ndefense and nondefense discretionary funding for the Energy and Water \nappropriations bill. I am pleased to see that because that money goes \nfor ports, locks, and dams. That money goes to the Office of Science so \nwe can have revolutions in manufacturing that create jobs. Money that \ncan help with our biomedical research that we need to do. There are \nimportant things we need to do, and this bill will help us do them. But \nwhy would we not begin to debate that? Why would we not let the other \nSenators debate it? All we are proposing is to begin to do some of what \nin December we should have done in June and July.\n  The majority leader knows he can't put every one of the 12 \nappropriations bill on the floor. There is not enough time left this \nyear. Why is there not enough time? Because Democrats blocked it in \nJune. They kept us from going to the bills even though this is the \nfirst time in 6 years that all 12 appropriations bills have passed the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  Why is that important? That is what we do here. Our job is to review \nthe purse, to decide what to spend--more for this lock, less for that \nproject--and keep the budget in balance when we can. That is our job. \nThey blocked it twice and they are getting ready to block it again with \na vote today.\n  I'm saying, don't go there because you are going to set in motion an \nirreversible course in this Senate, and I'm going to lead it. I am \ngoing to use whatever skills and powers I have to do that.\n  All of these Democratic provisions don't have to be in the Energy and \nWater appropriations bill. They don't have to be in any of the bills \nbecause we have the majority and you don't. So if they're going to play \nthat kind of game, we can play it too. I am not one who usually does, \nbut I am able to play. I am able to play or I wouldn't have gotten \nhere.\n  So I want to say to my friends on the other side: Don't go there. \nVote to put the bill on the floor. Vote to give us a chance to have \namendments.\n  Why would the other 70 Senators not want to have a chance to have a \nsay about the appropriations bill? Thirty of us are on the \nAppropriations Committee. We did our work. We approved the bill--in our \ncase by a vote of 26 to 4. It is a bipartisan bill. Why would we not \nput bills like that on the floor and let the other 70 Senators have \ntheir say? What are they here for if they don't want to have a say \nabout appropriations? They might as well be home watching television. \nThey should be here deciding the issues that face our country.\n  I hope my friends on both sides of the aisle can tell I am not happy \nthis morning with the direction things are taking. I don't like the \nfact that I spent all day working with Democratic colleagues to get \nbipartisan results and they come along with a tactic--for the third \ntime--that says: If we don't get everything we want, we are not going \nto have an appropriations process.\n  Well, we will see how that goes. And it will go not in a way that is \ngood for the country, not in a way that is good for the Senate, but it \nwill allow the people who have a majority in the Senate a chance to \nassert themselves and write the bills. At least we can do that.\n  There is really no reason we need to have 75 Senators' ideas about \npriorities in the Energy and Water appropriations bill if the majority \ndoesn't want to. There is no reason to have the ranking members' \nopinions in any of these appropriations bills if the majority doesn't \nwant to.\n  The way we have worked in our committee is--and I have worked with \nthe Senator from California for several years, and she is a terrific \nperson and a wonderful Senator--we work together. Now why should we \nstop that process when the bills come to the floor?\n  So through the Chair I respectfully ask my colleagues to think again. \nDon't do this. Don't send us a signal that we are never going to have \nanother normal appropriations process in the United States Senate. The \nAmerican people don't want that. We don't want that, and I can assure \nyou my friends on the other side don't want that.\n  So my hope is that one way or another the majority leader and the \nDemocratic leader have a conversation. And that the Senate comes to its \nrational senses and begins a normal appropriations process, with as \nmuch time as we have between now and the end of our time here in \nDecember. Which would be a signal to all of us that we are going to \nwork in a bipartisan way on a normal appropriations process for the \ngood of the country. And that we are not just going to try to think up \nany excuse we can not to move an appropriations bill to the floor.\n  Two years ago the majority leader simply wouldn't bring the bills to \nthe floor. This time the minority leader has blocked the bills from \ncoming to the floor. Let's get back to work. For heaven's sake, that is \nwhat we are here for. I am ready to go to work. I much prefer the way I \nworked yesterday, working with my colleagues. But I am\n\n[[Page S7779]]\n\nprepared to work in another way if that is what we need to do to get \nsome balance in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator \nfrom Tennessee for his remarks. I extend my appreciation for his strong \nleadership in developing and bringing to the floor of the Senate the \nDefense appropriations bill for fiscal year 2016.\n  Specifically, I urge the Senate to do as he suggests. Let's get this \nbill before the Senate, offer amendments if Senators have suggestions \nfor changes in the bill, and move ahead to completing action on this \nbill on time so we can predict with some certainty what our obligations \nare going to be and we can more thoughtfully with a sense of confidence \nknow that we are doing the right thing to protect the security \ninterests of our country, our citizens, and our interests around the \nworld.\n  We have before us an effort to move to the consideration of the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill for fiscal year 2016. The \nbill provides $514.1 billion in base budget funding and $58.6 billion \nin overseas contingency operations funding for the Department of \nDefense.\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee has worked on a bipartisan basis \nto write and approve 12 individual appropriations bills this year for \nthe first time since 2009. Senators should have the opportunity to \ndebate, amend, and approve the Defense appropriations bill. The \nlegislation is a bipartisan national security measure that provides the \nresources that are necessary to protect our Nation, support our \nservicemembers and their families, and meet current and future threats \nto our national security.\n  We have no greater priority than protecting our national security \ninterests here at home and abroad. I urge Senators to cooperate and \nsupport our efforts and to vote to proceed to the consideration of this \nbill. I am hopeful that the leadership can get together and work out a \ntime that is convenient and appropriate for carrying out this \nresponsibility.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending \ncloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to H.R. 2685, a bill making appropriations for the \n     Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September \n     30, 2016, and for other purposes.\n         Mitch McConnell, James M.

The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n           Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect Americans Act\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, 2 weeks ago, the Senate was unable to \nproceed to consider a very important piece of legislation called the \nStop Sanctuary Policies and Protect Americans Act. The goal of this \nlegislation is to protect our communities from criminals who violate \nour laws and who pose a danger to those communities--often minority \ncommunities themselves. The aim of this legislation is to restore law \nand order across the country by holding those accountable who are \ndefying Federal law and refusing to cooperate with the Federal \nGovernment when it comes to communicating the status of people who are \nillegally present in the country who have committed other more serious \ncrimes and refusing to honor Federal detainers.\n\n[[Page S7780]]\n\n  As we discussed the need for this bill, several of my colleagues \nhighlighted the importance of this issue, but unfortunately, we lost \nthat vote because only 54 Senators voted to proceed to the bill and \nobviously we needed 60 votes.\n  I am concerned that this debate does not focus on the people harmed \nthe most because of the status quo, and that is why I have come here to \nthe floor to talk about the larger problem of violent crime committed \nby those who are here illegally and are not being punished according to \nour laws. I also want to highlight the importance of the victims and \nfamilies across the country who are suffering because we have not taken \nthe appropriate action to stop these criminals.\n  There is one person in particular whom I wish to talk about today. My \nplan is to come to the floor and tell these stories one at a time over \nthe next few weeks.\n  This is Javier Vega, Jr., who grew up in La Feria, a small town of \nabout 7,000 people in South Texas. Javier was known by the name Harvey \nto his friends, interestingly enough, and he spent his entire life \nthinking of ways to help others before himself.\n  From a young age, he knew he wanted to serve in the military, and so \nhe volunteered for the Marine Corps and embarked on a military career \nafter graduating from La Feria High School. Harvey thrived in the \nMarine Corps. So after leaving the Marines and working day and night to \nput himself through college, he decided the next step in his public \nservice was to join the U.S. Border Patrol.\n  Harvey's mother said that he approached his work at the Border Patrol \njust like everything else he pursued in life--with diligence, \ndedication to hard work, and trying just simply to be the best he could \nbe. He was proud to help protect his fellow neighbors and serve our \ncountry, and he worked tirelessly to do so.\n  But, tragically, Harvey's service to his country was cut short. Last \nsummer he was out at one of his favorite fishing spots with his family. \nHe loved fishing. It was a family tradition, and Harvey wanted to pass \nalong his love for this pastime to his sons. Shortly after he and his \nfamily members cast their lines into the water on that Sunday \nafternoon, he was ambushed by two men who tried to rob him, and, \nheartbreakingly, the encounter turned violent.\n  Harvey's lifelong commitment to protecting those around him--\nsomething he seemed born to do--kicked in instantly. As Harvey and his \nfather, and eventually his mother, tried to fend off the attackers, \ntragically Javier ``Harvey'' Vega, Jr., was killed. His father, Javier \nsenior, was shot in the hip and still suffers from the wounds inflicted \nthat afternoon.\n  This was supposed to be another normal weekend fishing with the \nfamily. But instead, this normal weekend--or what was supposed to be a \nnormal weekend of fishing for Javier and his family--turned deadly.\n  Who were the killers? They were two illegal immigrant criminals who \nhad repeatedly violated our laws, and by that I don't mean they just \nentered the country without the appropriate visa. Both had been \ndeported multiple times but managed to repeatedly find their way back \ninto the country, even after committing a long list of crimes.\n  In fact, according to some witnesses, these two men had been \nterrorizing the community for months, committing armed robberies and \ncarjackings, and, clearly, they were capable of attacking and killing a \nhard-working father on a fishing trip with his family.\n  This is a difficult topic for some because some people would like to \nmischaracterize what we are trying to do with this legislation as \nsomehow being anti-immigrant. But indeed, legal immigrants and people \nwho live in the communities along South Texas--many of them have had \nfamily members come here from Mexico and elsewhere over the years--\nrecognize how much people who illegally enter the country and commit \nmultiple crimes can terrorize communities and victimize the very people \nwhom those who block this legislation say they want to protect.\n  I don't raise this issue or this story lightly, but the country \nshould know that for the family of Javier Vega, Jr., this is their \nreality. Illegal immigrant criminals who were deported multiple times \nattacked them and killed their son--their father, their brother, and \ntheir friend. Their lives will never be the same.\n  A number of our colleagues voted to block our ability to even \nconsider this important legislation that seeks to merely enforce \nexisting Federal law and to defund those jurisdictions that defy \nFederal law, and this is the consequence of doing nothing--people like \nJavier Vega, Jr., being victimized by criminals who violate our laws \nover and over and over, and when we catch them and they are deported, \nthey simply come back into the country and victimize more people and \nmore communities and kill people like Javier Vega, Jr.\n  The lives of the Vega family will never be the same, and I know they \ndon't want other families in Texas or elsewhere around the country to \nhave to suffer like they have suffered.\n  It doesn't seem like a lot to ask--that our Federal laws be enforced \nto protect our communities from criminals. That is all the legislation \nattempted to do. Yet there was a concerted effort across the aisle to \nfilibuster the bill and prevent us from even considering this \nlegislation, along with any suggestions our colleagues might have for \nimproving it.\n  The goal of the bill, the Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect \nAmericans Act, is not to keep legal immigrants from entering the United \nStates or to disparage law-abiding immigrants. Even the victim's \nmother, Marie, someone with justifiable, personal anger, noted that \nthis tragedy does not mean that her family is against immigration--far \nfrom it. This legislation is narrowly targeted to address the root \ncause of the tragedies like the one I have been talking about, by \ntargeting criminal illegal immigrants who repeatedly ignored the rule \nof law and who live with virtual impunity in our country and victimize \npeople like the Vega family.\n  We can't, in good faith, address immigration reform until the \nAmerican people see us doing more to enforce our existing laws. I have \nbeen here for a while, and I have heard the arguments across the aisle \nthat our colleagues would say: Well, the only thing we need to do to \nfix problems like what the Vega family experienced and otherwise is to \npass comprehensive immigration reform. But the American people simply \ndon't have enough confidence in us if we are unwilling to take the \nnecessary steps to see that the laws on the books are already \nenforced--the very laws that would protect people like Javier Vega, \nJr., and his family.\n  We have a lot of work to do to regain the public's confidence, \nbecause we can do other things that I believe we need to do to fix our \nbroken immigration system. It is imperative, it is our responsibility, \nand it is something we referred to in our oath--that we will uphold and \ndefend the laws and the Constitution of the United States. It is our \nresponsibility to make sure that local governments comply with Federal \nlaws and do not prevent the Department of Homeland Security from doing \nits job in enforcing them.\n  America's law enforcement community, including heroes like Harvey, \nput their lives on the line every day to protect our citizens. They \nwork tirelessly to try to protect our safety.\n  I hope our colleagues will come to their senses and stand up for \nthose who provide for our public safety and not contribute to a \nsituation where other families, such as the Vega family, will lose a \nloved one to the sort of career criminals whom I was referring to \nearlier who killed Javier Vega, Jr.\n  I have recently joined with Congressman Filemon Vela to send a letter \nto the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection requesting \nthat they reclassify the death of Javier Vega, Jr., as a line-of-duty \nfatality. Everybody in law enforcement knows that you are never truly \noff duty, and Javier's brave actions that fateful day back in 2014 \nshould be classified as a death occurring in the line of duty, just \nlike every other law enforcement officer.\n  I look forward to hearing back from the Commissioner on this soon. I \nam thankful to Paul Perez, president of the National Border Patrol \nCouncil in Kingsville, and to the Rio Grande Valley Union of the \nNational Border Patrol Council for helping the Vega family highlight \nthis issue.\n\n[[Page S7781]]\n\n  We have a duty to help our brave men and women in law enforcement do \ntheir job by passing this legislation and to regain some of the lost \nconfidence the American people used to have in our ability to actually \ndo our job and to keep illegal immigrant criminals and repeat offenders \noff our streets.\n\n  This issue is not going away. There are countless other stories in \nTexas and across the country, such as the story of Kate Steinle, out in \nSan Francisco, who tragically was murdered by the same sort of repeat \nillegal immigrant criminal who killed Harvey Vega.\n  There are a lot more stories to tell--a lot more stories that I hope \nwe will tell in the coming days. It is our duty as Members of Congress \nto put a stop to this, and I pledge to keep fighting on behalf of the \nVega family for legislation that will do just that.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kaine pertaining to the introduction of S. 2256 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not in a quorum call.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, do I have a limitation on speaking time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no limitation.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Waste of the Week\n\n  Madam President, this is my weekly ``Waste of the Week'' speech. It \nis time for another one.\n  Let me just say up front this involves Department of Defense \nspending. Now, I am a strong advocate. I am an Army veteran. I have \nserved on the Senate Armed Services Committee for nearly two terms. I \nam a strong advocate of a strong national defense, but it doesn't mean \nwe give a blank check to the Department of Defense. It means we have to \nscrutinize their expenditures and their engagement in spending \ntaxpayers' dollars just as carefully as we scrutinize every other \nagency. Everybody is involved in terms of finding the best and most \neffective way of using taxpayer dollars, hopefully without going into \ndebt to do so and hopefully directed to those issues of priority and \nnecessity that we have to fund. The Department of Defense of course is \none of those. Although, as I said, it doesn't mean they get a blank \ncheck.\n  I am deeply disappointed that my Democratic friends across the aisle \nhave denied us the opportunity to take up the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill, where we would have the opportunity to offer \namendments to strike money or to save money that could be used for \nessential, necessary efforts in spending by the Department of Defense.\n  Clearly every agency has to do some triage if we are ever going to \nget control of our out-of-control budget and our out-of-control plunge \ninto deficit spending year after year, with the debt ever growing. I \njust heard today that we are now at $18.5 trillion in debt, and that is \ngoing to come back to haunt us in future generations.\n  So the triage involves defining what is essential. Is this an \nessential expenditure that only the Federal Government can make? \nDefense spending falls into that category; that is, something that we \ncan't leave to the States. Secondly, there is a lot we would like to do \nthat may be necessary but is not urgent, a priority, or essential--when \nwe have the money to do it. The third category is, Why in the world are \nyou doing that in the first place? How can we define those items that \nare not necessary and take those funds and use them? Either give them \nback to the taxpayer or put them toward something that is essential \nrather than continuing to raise the funding, keeping all of the ``why \nwe are we doing this in the first place?'' stuff funded year after \nyear. We are not being given the opportunity to do that.\n  It is beyond this Senator's comprehension that, having established \nthe caps with the agreement that passed last week--which I couldn't \nvote for because it kept adding more to our debt and didn't fully \naddress the real problem of entitlement spending. But nevertheless, the \ndecision was made, and we had to pass it. Now it is simply a process of \nallocating the money within the limits of how much can be spent. That \nis what we are supposed to be able to do, of course, in committee.\n  We are also supposed to have the opportunity as Members of the Senate \nto bring forward amendments, to bring forward policy issues, to debate \non the floor, and hopefully to improve the bill, making it better, more \ncost effective, and efficient.\n  OK. Here we go--waste of the week. I think this is the 20th-something \ntime I have been on this floor during this year. Every week the Senate \nis in session, I come and do the waste of the week. This week it \naddresses, as I said, the Department of Defense. I want to highlight \nwhat a recent inspector general Department of Defense report found: \nover $40 million of overspending by the Department of Defense to build \none gas station in Afghanistan.\n  The special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction found \nthat the Department of Defense Task Force for Stability and Business \nOperations actually spent $43 million on a single natural gas fueling \nstation in Afghanistan. The station was originally projected to cost $3 \nmillion--and we will talk about how ever got to $3 million, let alone \nhow in the world this could have gotten to a total of $43 million.\n  According to the IG report, DOD spent this money ``to fund the \nconstruction and to supervise the initial operation of the station. \nSpecifically, it spent approximately $12.3 million in direct costs''--I \nguess that was building the station--``and $30 million in overhead \ncosts.''\n  We are digging in to find out what those overhead costs were, but \nsomebody came away with a pretty good profit margin just by submitting \nbills for $30 million in overhead costs which apparently were approved \nand spent and given to the contractors.\n  To make matters worse, the inspector general's office found that the \nreasons the gas station needed to be built in the first place were not \nlegitimate. They said there is zero evidence that the Department of \nDefense conducted the prior research necessary to identify potential \nobstacles before initiating this $43 million project. Wouldn't you \nthink somebody would have said: Wait a minute. What is this for? Where \nis it going to be? How much is it going to cost? Is it worth it? What \nis the projected spending? Is it going to be worth doing this? Does it \nmake any sense? The IG office said there was zero evidence in the DOD's \nresearch that there could be a potential obstacle in going forward with \nthis. One of those obstacles is Afghanistan doesn't have the pipeline \ninfrastructure to get the gas to the gas station. Another key obstacle \nis that on average it would cost more to convert a vehicle in \nAfghanistan to use compressed natural gas than the average Afghan earns \nin a single year. What all this means is that the Department of Defense \nbuilt a gas station that doesn't consistently have gas or customers, \nall for $43 million.\n  Most outrageously, the original $3 million allocated to this project \nwas over and above the international norm for building this kind of \ncompressed natural gas station. The International Energy Agency \nanalyzed global construction costs for similar fueling stations and \nfound that construction costs ranged from $200,000 to $500,000 per \nstation. It did acknowledge that in nonindustrialized countries such as \nAfghanistan, costs would be on the high-end. OK. The high-end is \n$500,000. It still raises the question, If nobody is going to use it or \nwe can't get gas to the station to put into the vehicles, why are we \ndoing this in the first place? It also raises the question, Why did it \ncost $3 million in projected construction costs when the average high-\nend is $500,000 per station in places like Afghanistan? What do you get \nfor $3 million? What they say you get for $3 million ended up costing \n$12 million, and then the final bill is $43 million. What do you get?\n\n  As you can see on this photograph, you get one of these out in the \ndesert in Afghanistan. It is a little bit blurry. There is the \nstructure. You have some pumps here. They actually did want to prove \nthat some cars use this, so there are a couple of vehicles pictured out \nthere in the desert. There is a telephone pole, I guess, out there. You \ncan\n\n[[Page S7782]]\n\nsee we are not talking about the middle of a city.\n  So that is what you get. That is what you get, folks, for $43 million \nof expenditures. This is almost beyond the pale. It is almost something \nthat you come down here and say: This can't be true. You can't make \nthis stuff up. This is an example, though, I am afraid, of a lot of \nother overspending which we are going to dive into. But this one \nexample alone illustrates that someone is making some very bad \ndecisions and that taxpayers' dollars were not, at the least, properly \nstewarded by someone.\n  American taxpayers deserve an answer to this fraud, to this waste. \nWhy did we pay $43 million to build this gas station when there was no \nresearch justifying building it in the first place? They want an \nexplanation of why this particular project was $40 million over budget, \nand even the budgeted price was significantly higher--8 to 10 times \nhigher--than the projected average cost of building something like this \nin a third-world country. Taxpayers need an explanation of how and why \nthis could have ever happened, and there needs to be a full \ninvestigation. We need and will demand answers.\n  What has been illustrated is a perfect example of why not only my \nconstituents but the American public feels that Washington can no \nlonger be trusted and that no one in Washington gets it. Well, I get \nit. I get it, and we ought to all get it. We ought to be just as \noutraged as our constituents in terms of our performance here. This is \ntotally unacceptable.\n  As has been said, this Senator is one of the biggest supporters of a \nstrong national defense as anyone standing on this Senate floor, but we \nare weakening our defense and not allocating our money to the \nessentials that we need to support our soldiers in the essential tasks \nthey have and the equipment they need. We are doing this kind of stuff, \nand it has to stop.\n  Our waste of the week is now totaling over $117 billion of identified \nwaste, and who knows what the total would be if we could comb through \nevery agency. Our former colleague Tom Coburn used to say there is a \ngood $1 trillion if added all up. I don't know if it reaches that or \nnot, but we are well on the way. We are at $117 trillion, and these are \nthe things I have identified and addressed coming to the floor this \nyear.\n  Hopefully my colleagues will pay attention. We can't get the big \nthings done. The President won't sign anything or engage in anything \nrelative to the real gorilla in the room that is going to take us down \neconomically, which are the runaway entitlements. Despite all the \nefforts, many of them bipartisan, the President has said: No, no, no, \nno, no, not on my watch.\n  The spending is continuing to go up, but the least we can do until we \nget somebody more responsible as our leader in the White House and \nuntil we have the will and courage to take on what we all know needs to \nbe done to get our fiscal house back in order--in the meantime, we can \nat least stop this egregious spending and waste of taxpayer dollars \nthrough fraud and abuse.\n  I am going to continue to do this. Next week we have lined up in our \noffice what we will do, coming down virtually every day to do this and \nnot run out of examples of how taxpayers' dollars are being wasted.\n  As you can tell, I am getting worked up about all this. Somebody \nneeds to get worked up about this because it is not happening and we \nare spending money, and the public has given up and thrown up their \nhands and said we are dysfunctional, and they are right.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Udall and Mr. Heinrich pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 2254 are printed in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Madam President, I yield to my colleague from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                          Tribute to Amy Jishi\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I rise to recognize the heroic efforts \nof Amy Jishi, a Michigander who serves as a transportation security \ninspector at Detroit Metropolitan International Airport. I just spoke \nto her a few moments ago on the phone and thanked her for her brave \nactions.\n  Recently, while leaving work at the airport Amy observed an accident \nat a traffic light. She noticed that one of the cars was leaking \ngasoline and a fire had started underneath it. Without hesitation, Amy \nselflessly placed herself in harm's way to offer assistance and to warn \nothers about the fire, and she worked to free the driver from the \nvehicle, despite a stuck door, and was able to free him shortly before \nthe car burst into flames. Afterwards, Amy told a reporter, ``When I \nsaw the accident, the only thought that went through my mind was to \nhelp them.''\n  Amy is a lifelong resident of Dearborn Heights and has worked with \nthe Transportation Security Administration in Detroit for 8 years. She \nand her TSA colleagues across the Nation work to keep the American \npeople and the traveling public safe each and every day.\n  As a member of the Senate Homeland Security committee, it is a \nprivilege to hear the stories of the men and women at the Department of \nHomeland Security who work around the clock and around the world to \nkeep our country safe. These individuals are dedicated to public \nservice and are willing to put Americans' safety and well-being above \ntheir own, and they deserve the recognition, as well as the resources \nand policies that will continue to position them for success in the \nmission they take so seriously and personally.\n  I would like to recognize Amy's selfless action, quick thinking, and \ndedication to her fellow Americans. Because of her actions, a young \ndriver was able to walk away from what would have been a terrible \ntragedy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n\n\n                           SAVE Benefits Act\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Madam President, exactly 3 weeks ago the Social Security \nAdministration made a very quiet announcement. Next year, for just the \nthird time since 1975, seniors who receive Social Security won't be \ngetting an annual cost-of-living increase.\n  Two-thirds of seniors depend on Social Security for the majority of \ntheir income. For 15 million Americans, Social Security is all that \nstands between them and poverty. But not one of these Americans--not \none--will see an extra dime next year. Millions of other Americans \nwhose benefits are pegged to Social Security--millions who receive \nveterans' benefits, disability benefits, and other monthly payments--\nwon't see an extra dime either.\n  These are tough times--but not for everyone. According to most recent \ndata from the Economic Policy Institute, CEOs at the top 350 American \ncompanies received on average a 3.9-percent pay increase last year. \nThat is a lot of money because the average CEO pay at one of the top \n350 American companies was a cool $16.3 million in 2014. On average, \nthey got more than half a million dollars each in pay raises. So CEOs \nget huge pay raises while seniors, veterans, and others who have worked \nhard--70 million of them--will get nothing. Why? It is not an accident; \nit is the result of deliberate policies set right here in Congress.\n  Social Security is supposed to be indexed to inflation so that when \nprices go up, benefits will go up, too. But Congress's formula looks at \nthe spending habits of only about a quarter of the country, and the \nformula isn't geared to what older Americans actually spend. \nProjections for costs of core goods and services, projections that \nremove the components of prices that are the most uncertain and \nerratic, show that inflation is up about 2 percent, but seniors, who \nusually get a boost on January 1, won't see an extra dime next year, \nmostly because of falling gasoline prices, which just don't mean as \nmuch to millions of seniors who don't commute to work. Meanwhile, \nseniors who are trying to cover things such as rent and exploding \nprescription drug prices are left out in the cold. It is all Federal \npolicy.\n  What about those huge CEO bonuses? They are also the consequence, in \npart,\n\n[[Page S7783]]\n\nof congressional policy. A report released just last week from the \nCenter for Effective Government and the Institute for Policy Studies \ndetails how taxpayers subsidized CEOs' huge pay packages through \nbillions of dollars in giveaways, including subsidies such as special \ntax-deferred compensation accounts and a crazy loophole that allows \ncorporations to write off obscene bonuses as a business expense.\n  Companies can make their own decisions on how much to compensate \ntheir executives, but because of the laws Congress has passed, American \ntaxpayers are forced to subsidize these multimillion-dollar pay \npackages.\n  It is time for Congress to make different choices. If we do nothing, \non January 1 more than 70 million seniors, veterans, and other \nAmericans won't get an extra dime. While Congress sits on its hands and \npretends there is nothing we can do for seniors or vets, while Congress \nclaims there just isn't any money to fix the problem, American \ntaxpayers will keep right on subsidizing billions of dollars' worth of \nbonuses for highly paid CEOs. It is a choice. Congress can spend \ntaxpayer money subsidizing billions of dollars for bonuses for \ncorporate executives or Congress can use that very same money to help \n70 million people who live on Social Security, veterans' benefits, and \ndisability payments. Congress makes the choice.\n  That is why I am here today, along with a number of my colleagues, to \nintroduce the Senior and Veterans Emergency Benefits Act. The SAVE \nBenefits Act will give seniors on Social Security, veterans, those with \ndisabilities, and others a one-time payment equivalent to an average \nincrease of 3.9 percent--the same tax-subsidized pay increase top CEOs \nreceived last year.\n  We can increase pay for seniors and vets without adding a single \npenny to the deficit simply by closing one of the many tax loopholes \nthat subsidize these giant pay packages for executives. In fact, \naccording to the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration, \nclosing this loophole will create enough revenue to help seniors and \nvets and there will still be enough money left over to help extend the \nlife of the Social Security trust fund. This should be a bipartisan \nact. Nobody wants to see seniors struggle to pay their grocery and \nutility bills. Everybody should want to extend the life of Social \nSecurity.\n  Both Democrats and Republicans have expressed contempt for this tax \nloophole. Back in 1993, Congress passed section 162(m)--a Tax Code \nprovision designed to rein in excessive corporate compensation--but the \nprovision includes so many loopholes, most corporations just get around \nthem. In fact, in 2006 Republican Senator Chuck Grassley said that \n``sophisticated folks are working with Swiss-watch-like devices to game \nthis Swiss-cheese-like rule.'' In 2009 Republican Senator John McCain \nand Democratic Senator Carl Levin introduced a bill to shut down access \nto this loophole for corporate stock options. Just last year, the \nRepublican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee included \nreform of this loophole as part of his flagship tax reform bill. So \nlet's just do it. Let's close the loophole, and let's use the money to \ngive seniors and vets the support they need.\n\n  Think about what this change would mean. That 3.9 percent is worth \nabout $581 a year, a little less than $50 a month. I know that is a \nrounding error for those top corporate executives who are pulling in an \naverage of over $16 million each. But Social Security payments average \nonly about $1,250 a month, and millions of seniors who rely on those \nchecks are barely scraping by. A $581 increase could cover almost 3 \nmonths of groceries for seniors or a year's worth of out-of-pocket \ncosts on critical prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. That \n$50 a month is worth a heck of a lot to the 70 million Americans who \nwould have just a little more in their pockets as a result of this \nbill. In fact, according to an analysis from the Economic Policy \nInstitute, that little boost could lift more than a million people out \nof poverty.\n  We all know someone who lives on Social Security--every single one of \nus. We know family members, a friend, a neighbor, people who worked \nhard all their lives and who now rely on Social Security checks to get \nby. Giving seniors a little help with their Social Security and \nstitching up these corporate tax write-offs isn't just about economics; \nit is about our values. For too long we have listened to a handful of \npowerful folks who have had one message: Cut taxes for those at the \ntop, cut rules and regulations that keep businesses honest, and let \neverybody else fight over the scraps. We have tried that approach, and \nnow we have a retirement crisis. Guaranteed pensions are gone, and \n401(k)s and IRAs have been decimated by the stock market. Fewer and \nfewer people can afford to save for the future. We tried it, and it was \na complete failure.\n  These same powerful folks will tell you there is nothing we can do to \nhelp 70 million seniors, veterans, Americans with disabilities, and \nothers who will not see an extra dime this year. They will say we can't \nafford it. They will say we can't do anything to expand Social \nSecurity. They will say we need to gut Social Security in order to save \nit. They will say all of this, exactly at the same moment that we \ncontinue to shovel billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies out the \ndoor for corporations to boost pay to their highest paid executives.\n  That is the problem. The money is there, only right now it goes to a \nhandful of CEOs because that is where the law written by Congress sends \nit. But Congress can make a different choice--a choice that reflects \nour deepest values, a choice to give a boost to 70 million Americans \nwho have earned one, a choice to lift over 1 million people out of \npoverty, and a choice to extend the life of Social Security. It is all \nabout choices--millionaire and billionaire CEOs or retires, vets, and \ndisabled Americans.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the SAVE Benefits Act. January 1 will \nbe here soon, and we need to make a choice now.\n  Madam President, I yield to my colleague from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  We spend a lot of time here on the floor of the Senate talking about \nhow our States are different. That happens in the House of \nRepresentatives where I served as well. But there is one thing that \ncertainly unites all of our States and, frankly, one thing that unites \nall of the front desks of our Senate offices, and that is this: We have \nall been flooded with phone calls from the thousands upon thousands of \nconstituents in each one of our districts who are furious that they are \ngoing to get no increase in Social Security at the beginning of next \nyear. Despite the fact that prices for virtually everything that fixed \nincome seniors are paying for are going up, they are getting absolutely \nnothing to try to compensate them for those cost of living increases.\n  We are hearing from people like Kevin in Bridgeport, who said:\n\n       Dear Senator Murphy, I am a lifelong resident of \n     Bridgeport. . . . I am 63 years old . . . living on SSDI due \n     to a rare disease of the spinal cord. . . . Since my only \n     source of income is SSDI, I am concerned about the recent \n     announcement that there is going to be no COLA increase for \n     2016. If there is anything you can do to reverse this \n     decision, millions of Americans like myself would be greatly \n     helped and greatly appreciative.\n\n  Or there is Fred from Wolcott, who said:\n\n       I understand the lower gas prices have kept the CPI lower \n     with the result [being] no [Social Security] increase in \n     2016. Many of us do not drive or drive a limited amount and \n     the lower gas prices do not place additional funds in our \n     pocket.\n       Meanwhile, the cost of beef, chicken, eggs and milk etc., \n     the things we live on have risen, and have reduced our \n     purchasing power. Many on Social Security have no other form \n     of income.\n\n  Adeline of New Fairfield, CT, says:\n\n       My husband and I were very disappointed that we did not \n     receive our cost of living raise in our check. . . . Please \n     let that be the last time. With all the medical deductibles \n     and food and clothes and taxes going up, it gets \n     discouraging. . . . We are up in age and not in the best of \n     health and because of that we are unable to get a job. \n     [Social Security is what we depend on.]\n\n  These stories can be multiplied millions of times over, and all over \nour districts. What are we going to do about it? Are we going to sit \nhere, as we do with issue after issue, and offer no response to the \nmillions of our constituents who are telling us that they are going to \nhave trouble making ends meet? Or are we going to make a\n\n[[Page S7784]]\n\nchoice? Are we going to make a choice to end an unjustifiable loophole \nthat allows corporations to hand over millions of dollars to their CEOs \nvirtually tax-free or are we going to invest in the millions of seniors \nand disabled across this country who are going to have a hard time \nliving and making ends meet if we don't make the change involved in the \npiece of legislation that we are announcing today? The SAVE Benefits \nAct is going to save the lives of seniors who without a cost of living \nincrease are going to have trouble affording medication and food. It \nreally comes at no cost to the corporations that are right now \nreceiving an unjustifiable tax benefit--one that Congress really never \nintended.\n  Congress passed and has accepted as part of our tax law for 20 years \nthis provision that doesn't allow companies to take a tax benefit for \nsalaries over $1 million. It is not surprising that companies found a \nway around that provision because it exempted performance-based pay. So \nbonuses and stock options could be handed over with full tax benefit, \nand that became the standard for compensation packages. All of a sudden \nit wasn't about salary any longer, and it became about this \nperformance-based pay.\n  You live in a world today in which there is this perverse system--the \nmore corporations pay their CEOs, the lower their tax bill is.\n  It is not going to hurt corporations to simply have to pay taxes on \nthe bonuses above $1 million that they send to their CEOs and big \nexecutives. They are going to continue paying their CEOs a lot of \nmoney. A lot of them live in Connecticut. I don't have any fear that \nthere is going to be a rapid diminution in the amount of money that \nCEOs are making, but at least those companies will pay taxes on those \nexorbitant salaries. We will be able to use that money to make sure \nthat their customers--the people who are buying the goods that these \nbig companies make--actually have the purchasing power with which to \nenter and be active in the economy.\n  I guess that is the piece of economics that I will end on here. By \nputting $50 more a month into the hands of frail, poor seniors and \ndisabled, you are providing an enormous economic benefit to the \neconomy, because all of that money is going to go into the economy.\n  Let me tell you what a senior living at or below the poverty line is \ngoing to do with $50 a month. They are going to put it into food. They \nare going to put it into medicine. They are going to put it into Main \nStreet businesses. The fact is that when you decide instead to \nsubsidize salaries of above $1 million, that money isn't going back \ninto the Main Street economy. Maybe a portion of it is, but a lot of it \nis ending up in giant accrued pensions and savings accounts or in \noffshore investments--not in the Main Street economy.\n  This is not just the right thing to do for these seniors who are \ncrying out to every single one of our offices to do something about \nthis unjustifiable lack of a COLA, but it is the right thing to do for \nthe economy at large because the money is going to find its way into \nall sorts of crevices and corners of this economy that badly need that \nkind of infusion.\n  I wish to thank Senator Warren for introducing this legislation. I \nwanted to come down to the floor to lend my voice to it and for it on \nbehalf of the hundreds and hundreds of seniors in Connecticut who are \ncontacting and calling our office asking for the Senate to do \nsomething.\n  With that, let me yield to my colleague and friend from Connecticut, \nSenator Blumenthal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I am grateful to my colleague and \nfriend from Connecticut for quoting some of the literally hundreds of \nletters that both of our offices have been receiving from Social \nSecurity recipients and also from veterans in my State. I suspect my \ncolleagues from Massachusetts have been receiving the same letters. I \nwant to thank Senator Warren for her leadership on this issue but also \nSenator Reed, who joined me some years ago in seeking to close the \nloophole that is fundamentally undermining not only the fairness but \nthe effectiveness of our Tax Code.\n  Let's understand what this loophole means to us as taxpayers. The \nperformance pay loophole means that effectively unlimited corporate tax \ndeductions are provided for executive pay. Put aside the issue of \nwhether this pay makes sense or is fair, whether you agree or disagree \nwith these gargantuan amounts. Who should pay for those extraordinary \namounts of compensation? This loophole means that you and I as \ntaxpayers are the ones who shoulder at least part of the burden. We do \nit because the money lost to the Federal Government as a result of this \ntax deduction must somehow be gained in some other way. Guess where it \ncomes from. It comes from you and me--not from those corporations that \ncan deduct it. It comes from you and me.\n  Senator Reed and I have sought over the years to close this loophole \nto make sure that the tax-deferred compensation for corporate \nexecutives and the performance pay loophole are effectively closed and \nthe Tax Code is made fair. But Senator Warren has introduced a new and \nprofoundly important element to this fight. And that is this: How \nshould we use the proceeds from closing this loophole? The answer is \nthis: In recognition of the reality that current economic burdens are \nfalling hardest on people who least can afford them--seniors, veterans, \nand families who depend entirely or in significant part on benefits \nthrough Social Security and the VA--should be given the benefit of \nclosing this loophole. Why? First of all, because it is the right thing \nto do.\n  The current measures of the cost of living fail to measure the cost \nof living for them. That is because we don't all buy the same thing. \nThe index or the formula that is used to calculate costs-of-living \nincreases fail to measure the real economic burden on certain groups, \nnamely our seniors and our veterans. You have heard very eloquently and \npowerfully from my colleagues, from Senator Warren and Senator Murphy, \nabout the impact on our Social Security recipients.\n  I am here as the ranking member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee to say that those benefits affect 25,000 veterans in \nConnecticut who receive VA compensation for a service-connected \ndisability, more than 2,000 survivors or dependent children who receive \nVA compensation, and 4.3 million veteran beneficiaries nationwide. They \nearned their benefits through their sacrifice and service to this \ncountry.\n\n  This issue is about keeping faith with our veterans and making sure \nwe leave no veteran behind. They earned those benefits through their \nservice as well as sacrifice--sometimes unimaginable sacrifice. They \nearned those benefits through injury and wounds on the battlefield, and \nthose benefits are necessary to ensure a smooth transition into \ncivilian life for service-disabled veterans and their families who \noften face enormous and staggering additional costs and a reduced \nability to work.\n  To ensure that these vital benefits correspond to the actual cost of \nfood, housing, clothing, gas, and other basic elements of daily life, \nthe VA is authorized to adjust them--adjust them for inflation--and the \nindex they use is the one that Social Security relies on as well. That \nis the connection to veterans. And that volatile formula, as I have \nsaid, too often fails to reflect the actual cost of living for this \ngroup of people, leaving millions of our veterans, as well as our \nseniors, without a realistic chance to keep pace.\n  Our disabled veterans deserve better. It is that simple. They deserve \nbetter than what is happening to them right now. They deserve real \ncompensation that recognizes rising real-world costs, escalating living \nexpenses that are painfully squeezing them, as well as our seniors, and \nthey deserve a fair raise and a fair choice.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with us. Close this loophole, make the \nTax Code fairer to all taxpayers, and also make sure our seniors and \nveterans get what they need and deserve, to live with the basic \nnecessities that are essential to them. We need to keep faith with our \nveterans and make sure the greatest Nation in the world recognizes the \ngreatest of its heroes, our veterans.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague and great friend from Hawaii, \nSenator Hirono.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n[[Page S7785]]\n\n  \n\n  Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, last month the Social Security \nAdministration announced some disappointing news. For only the third \ntime in 40 years Social Security beneficiaries will not receive a cost-\nof-living or COLA increase in January 2016.\n  In Hawaii, one out of four seniors relies on Social Security as their \nonly source of income. They are struggling to keep a roof over their \nheads, pay for medicine, and buy groceries--basic necessities. Many \nHawaii seniors have told me their stories about how costs for essential \ngoods keep rising while the Social Security checks do not.\n  Meanwhile, by contrast--and we heard this from my esteemed colleague \nthe Senator from Massachusetts--the CEOs of the wealthiest companies in \nAmerica are doing great. The average CEO at America's top 350 companies \nsaw a raise of 3.9 percent just last year. Since the economic recovery \nof 2009, these CEOs have seen their pay increase by a whopping 54.3 \npercent. I have nothing against hard-working people, including CEOs, \ngetting a raise. If CEOs came up with a good idea and they are managing \na successful company, that is great for them, their companies, and one \nhopes for the company's employees, but did you know taxpayers are \npartly footing the bill for CEO pay raises?\n  The Tax Code today has a ``performance pay'' loophole that provides \ntax subsidies for high-level corporate executive compensation packages. \nThat is why I am proud to join Senator Warren and others in introducing \nthe SAVE Benefits Act. Our bill would provide a modest cost-of-living \nincrease next year, the same 3.9 percent increase our Nation's top CEOs \nreceived this year. This would mean an average payment increase of \nabout $580 for our seniors. This is money that makes a huge difference \nto all of our seniors. This one-time COLA payment would also apply to \nveterans' benefits--as my colleague Richard Blumenthal just focused \nupon--Federal disability insurance, and equivalent State or local \nretirement programs. To pay for this one-time COLA, our bill would \nclose the tax giveaways to the wealthiest CEOs. Closing the performance \npay loophole is a bipartisan idea, even supported by the former chair \nof the House Committee on Ways and Means in his tax reform proposal.\n  In the long run, we should also modernize the formula Social Security \nuses to calculate COLAs each year, and that is why I introduced the \nProtecting and Preserving Social Security Act, which would base COLAs \non a more accurate formula of what seniors actually buy, the Consumer \nPrice Index for the Elderly or CPI-E. The CPI-E gives more weight to \nitems seniors actually buy, such as medicine, housing, and home energy \ncosts rather than electronics or clothing that younger workers buy more \nof. My bill would pay for the CPI-E by requiring millionaires and \nbillionaires to pay the same rate into the Social Security trust fund \nthat everybody else pays year-round. Otherwise, under the current law, \nonce workers earn more than $118,500 in the year, they stop paying the \npayroll taxes that support the Social Security trust fund.\n  I was on the Senate floor last month and shared the story of one of \nmy constituents from with Wahiawa, and it bears repeating. She wrote to \nme recently and said:\n\n       I find it incredible that there are people who actually \n     believe that Social Security is too generous. The average \n     Social Security benefit is a whopping $14,000 a year, and \n     we've only seen an average 2 percent COLA over the past five \n     years. I can assure you my health care costs have far \n     exceeded that tiny increase.\n\n  Congress needs to listen to seniors like her and act to provide this \nmodest one-time increase to help seniors make ends meet in 2016 and to \nchange the way COLA is calculated. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nletting seniors in Hawaii and seniors all across the country have this \none-time boost to their Social Security payments.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the SAVE Benefits Act as well as \nthe Protecting and Preserving Social Security Act.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Markey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Hawaii for her \neloquent statement on this very important issue, and I thank the \nSenator from Massachusetts Senator Warren for once again, as usual, \nputting her finger right on the heart of a huge issue in our country.\n  We have seniors, veterans, and SSI recipients across our country who \nwill receive zero this year in terms of an increase in their benefits \nthat they have so rightly earned by their service to our country. What \nSenator Warren is essentially saying is, Who really built this country? \nWho made this great country the place that we live in today? The truth \nis grandma and grandpa built this country. Grandma and grandpa got up \nevery single day, went to work, built this incredible economy, and now \nthat they are in retirement, grandma and grandpa are being told for the \nnext year they don't get a raise. They don't get anything. They don't \nget a cost-of-living adjustment. They don't get any increase at all. \nThey built this country. The veterans who are seniors, they protected \nthis country. The veterans who are disabled, they built this country, \nthey protected this country.\n  What Senator Warren has done so accurately is essentially point out \nthat there was a big loophole in our laws, and that loophole is a \ncorporate compensation loophole that allows unlimited corporate \ndeductions for executive performance pay.\n  What have we learned over the last 20 years in America? The rich are \ngetting richer, but the people at the bottom are not. All this bill \nsays, quite simply, is, Let's have the raise go to the seniors for 1 \nyear. Let's have the raise go to grandma and grandpa. Let's give them a \nreward for the incredible benefits that have been flowing \ndisproportionately to the upper 1 percentile. Let's give them the 3.9-\npercent raise. Let's give them the kind of comfort and thanks they \ndeserve for all of their hard work.\n  What happens too often in Congress is that grandma and grandpa just \nget forgotten. There is a constant debate over whether grandma and \ngrandpa are getting too much in Medicare, too much in Medicaid, and too \nmuch in Social Security benefits. ``We must solve that problem,'' say \ntoo many people here and around the country.\n  No, grandma and grandpa are not the problem. By their hard work every \nsingle day for their entire lives, by getting up, going to work, and \ncreating these great families who make us the greatest country on the \nplanet, they are the ones who created this incredible wealth that we \nhave in our society.\n  I think we all owe an enormous debt of gratitude to Senator Warren \nbecause she has found a quite brilliant way to frame this debate on the \nSenate floor and for our country because it really does force us to all \nstep back and ask the question of who contributed the most to our \ncountry over the last generation--a small handful of people at the top \nor everyone in the country who got up every single day who are the \npeople we now call grandma and grandpa. I don't think we should be \nshortchanging them. I think Senator Warren's bill is the right way to \nsolve that problem in order to make sure they get what they deserve. I \nthank Senator Warren for her great leadership on this issue.\n  I yield to the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I want to speak on the MILCON-VA bill. \nWe have 1 minute. We are going to take a giant leap of faith that the \nmajority is going to do the right thing by our veterans and by this \ncountry. I will vote to proceed on this bill with the hope that Members \nof this body are finally ready to honor our commitment we made to the \nveterans of this country.\n  As everyone knows, for most of the year, the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee was crafting appropriations bills that fit under disastrous \nspending caps put forward by the majority's budget resolution. As a \nmember of the VA appropriations subcommittee, I was especially \nconcerned that because of the budget resolution, we were underfunding \nthe VA by over $850 million. This shortchange to our veterans would \nhave been a disgrace.\n  Back in May when I introduced an amendment in the committee to \nprovide an additional $857 million to the VA--$857 million the VA needs \nto do its job--every Republican on the Appropriations Committee voted \nagainst my\n\n[[Page S7786]]\n\namendment. I find it troubling that there are some so quick to send our \ntroops into harm's way but neglect them when they return from war. That \nis exactly what happened, and we saw an appropriations bill that \nunderfunded veterans health.\n  The good news is that under the budget agreement we voted on this \nlast week, that Senators in this body supported, we are going to fix \nthe problem. It is now time to show the American people that we can \ngovern responsibly by standing up for our veterans.\n\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I know of no further debate on the \nmotion to proceed to H.R. 2029.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from South Carolina (Mr. Graham), the Senator from Kansas (Mr. \nMoran), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio), and the Senator from \nLouisiana (Mr. Vitter).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

For the purposes of this Act, the term \n     ``congressional defense committees'' means the Committees on \n     Armed Services of the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate, the Subcommittee on Military Construction and \n     Veterans Affairs of the Committee on Appropriations of the \n     Senate, and the Subcommittee on Military Construction and \n     Veterans Affairs of the Committee on Appropriations of the \n     House of Representatives.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                         Supporting Our Troops\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Well, amazingly enough, our colleagues across the \naisle just voted to proceed to an individual appropriations bill. We \nhave been trying to do this for months. Finally, they have approved \ngoing to an appropriations bill. This should not be breaking news, \ngoodness gracious, but it is newsworthy because of what has been going \non around here for the last 2 or 3 months. Democrats have repeatedly \nblocked the Senate from even debating individual appropriations bills. \nThey never had a good excuse, of course, and the excuses kept changing \nas each previous excuse got debunked, but nevertheless they kept it up \nmonth after month after month. Well, finally that seems to have changed \ntoday. Maybe we can assume that this is the end of the filibuster \nsummer, in November, a partisan season of obstructionist Democratic \nfilibustering in which they have blockaded government funding bills \nentirely--all of them. Nearly every one of those bills was bipartisan.\n  Our Democratic friends, as they voted for them in committee, would \nsend out press releases praising the bills, and then when they got out \nhere on the floor, they all blocked them. They said no to funding for \nbridges and infrastructure. They said no to funding for energy \nconservation and clean water. They said no to funding for absolutely \nanything at all, especially for our troops.\n  You know, it is particularly jarring when you consider some of the \nthings written recently by President Obama's own Defense Secretary in \nan op-ed entitled ``U.S. Military Needs Budget Certainty in Uncertain \nTimes.'' Here is what this Obama administration Cabinet Secretary said:\n\n       While Washington struggles to get its house in order, the \n     challenges around the world continue. China continues its \n     dubious and destabilizing land-reclamation activities in the \n     South China Sea. Islamic State continues its barbarous \n     campaign. Russia continues to violate the sovereignty of \n     Ukraine and pour gasoline on the Syrian conflict. In this \n     uncertain security environment, the U.S. military needs to be \n     agile and dynamic.\n\n  This is the Defense Secretary of the President's administration.\n\n       What it has now is a straitjacket. At the Defense \n     Department, we are forced to make hasty reductions when \n     choices should be considered carefully and strategically.\n\n  This is President Obama's Defense Secretary talking about the \nnecessity for these bills that are being blocked by his own party.\n  Here is the way he continues in his op-ed. He said:\n\n       I appeal to Congress to act on a long-term budget deal--\n\n  We did that--\n\n     that will let the American troops and their families know we \n     have the commitment and the resources to see them succeed, \n     and send a global message that the United States will \n     continue to plan and build for the finest fighting force the \n     world has ever known.\n\n  This is the Secretary of Defense in the Democratic administration. \nSounds like he is lecturing the guys on the other side here who are the \nobstacle.\n  In spite of these pleas from the Secretary of Defense, we are still \nunable to get on a defense appropriations bill. One Member of the other \nside said that funding our troops was wasting the Senate's time--\nwasting the Senate's time.\n  We have seen them all filibustered repeatedly. They just did so again \nthis morning. At a time when a vast number of threats face our country, \nas Secretary Ash Carter alluded to, our colleagues across the aisle \nactually voted to filibuster the bill that funds our troops and our \nmilitary one more time. Democrats filibustered for months on end to \nhold hostage the men and women who voluntarily put themselves in harm's \nway, for reasons that shifted constantly and had little to do with our \ntroops.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would ask the distinguished majority \nleader whether he finds it ironic--and perhaps he has a better word \nthan ``ironic'' to describe the situation we find ourselves in--that \nthree separate times the Democrats have filibustered the funding that \nprovides the resources to our troops to fight our Nation's battles and \nkeep us safe, but then a few short days before Veterans Day, they \ndecide to allow us to finally get on a veterans and military \nconstruction bill. I would hope it is not because they had second \nthoughts about going home on Wednesday and giving patriotic speeches \nabout their support for our troops and military but then realizing what \na spot they have put themselves in. I wonder if the majority leader \nshares my view that that is at least ironic, and perhaps ``cynical'' \nwould be a more appropriate description.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes, I would say to my colleague from Texas, they were \nafraid to feel the heat next Wednesday on Veterans Day, having stopped \na veterans appropriations bill. Frankly, I hope they still feel a \nlittle heat on stopping the Defense bill because the vast number of \nveterans in our country don't just care about their own well-being \nafter they served, they care about the well-being of those who are \nstill serving.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for one additional \nquestion?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would ask the majority leader, having \nbeen through what we have been through here in just this last week in \nestablishing spending caps for this year and next in this bipartisan \nand bicameral Budget Act, if he can think of any possible rationale for \nthe Democrats filibustering the Defense appropriations bill, when, in \nfact, those spending caps are subject to a law which the President has \nnow signed into law, and which were the subject of this bipartisan, \nbicameral agreement that passed just last week.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Well, you know, as each obstacle has been removed, as \neach reason for filibustering these bills earlier is removed, they come \nup with a new one. We obviously last week agreed on how much we were \ngoing to spend, so the question of spending has been removed. The \n302(b) allocations were completed yesterday. Our friends on the other \nside said they were happy with them. They are running out of excuses, \nbut the end result is the same: They are still not allowing us to go \nforward on the Defense bill.\n  I would say to my friend and colleague from Texas that I heard these \nconspiracy theories that we had some trick to play here. I made it \nclear not only to my counterpart the Democratic leader but to other \nDemocratic Senators that there is no nefarious scheme. We thought, all \nobjections having been removed, the appropriate thing to do would be to \ntry--by pursuing regular order, try to pass some of the appropriations \nbills, given the limited amount of time we have left. Yet they kept on \ndoing the same thing with the exception of the veterans bill. It is a \nmystery.\n  The level of dysfunction the other side seems to be promoting is bad \nfor the institution and bad for the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n[[Page S7795]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. CORNYN. If the Senator will yield for a question, I ask the \ndistinguished majority leader if it is still true that in order to \naccomplish this delusional scheme that our friends across the aisle \nhave somehow dreamed up as a way to block this funding for our troops, \neven if that were true--which it is not, as you have pointed out--isn't \nit still true for an appropriations bill to become law it requires the \nsignature of the President of the United States? So it would literally \nbe impossible to do what they have dreamed up in their delusional state \nwhen they are accusing us of this sort of a scheme and plan, which is \nabsolutely false.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes, my friend from Texas is entirely right. There \nwould be no way--consistent with the Constitution that James Madison \nwrote--that they would in the end not have some considerable sway over \nhow this episode ends.\n  What I think it says, more than anything, is how committed to \ndysfunction our friends on the other side are--dysfunction for the sake \nof dysfunction. The American people are sick and tired of that. They \nwant to see us do our work like adults, serious adults taking the \nresponsibility we have been given by our constituents to do our very \nbest for this country.\n  This is the same party on the other side that I remember lecturing \neveryone else about the dangers of the filibuster. Apparently they \nweren't very serious because it is obviously their new best friend now. \nThis is the same party we remember bashing legislative ``hostage-\ntaking,'' but apparently they weren't serious about that either because \nthey basically have become experts.\n  Look, the Democrats may never be able to fully remove the stain of \nthis filibuster summer gridlock gambit from their party's reputation, \nbut they can work with us now to finally start turning the page.\n  I ask my friends on the other side: When are we going to get back to \nnormal if not now? When, if not now, when we have agreed to all of the \ncontentious parts of the appropriations process. Every excuse has been \nwiped away. We have settled our own budget agreement. We have agreed on \ntopline budget numbers. We have settled on subcommittee allocations, \nand we have just proceeded to an individual appropriations bill at long \nlast.\n  It is time for the appropriations process to finally be allowed to \nmove forward, time for the Senate to finally be able to get back to \nregular order. It is time for each of us to get back to work, not just \nbecause it is the right thing for our country, not just because it is \nthe right thing for the brave men and women who are voluntarily putting \nthemselves in harm's way, but it is the best way for Senators of both \nparties to have the most say in the process, for the American people to \nbe best represented, with their Members debating each appropriations \nbill on the floor with the opportunity for amendments to be offered.\n  A lot of work went into developing these appropriations bills--the \noccupant of the chair is on that committee. Most passed the committee \nwith bipartisan support. That was certainly true of the Defense \nappropriations bill. It passed out of the Appropriations Committee 27 \nto 3. It was similarly true of the appropriations bill that funds \nveterans, which passed the committee with bipartisan support. That is \nthe bill we just voted to proceed to.\n  It would support veterans by funding the health care and the benefits \nthey rely on. It would support military families by funding the \nhousing, schools, and health care facilities that serve them. It would \nprovide support for women's health, for medical research, for veterans \nsuffering from traumatic brain injury. It would do a lot of good in \nmany of our home States too. In my State it would provide funding for \ndesign work at a new VA medical center in Louisville, a special \noperations headquarters at Fort Campbell, and an educational facility \nat Fort Knox.\n  The bill would do right by our veterans. We should pass it. With \ncontinued cooperation, we can pass it by Veterans Day. Then the \nappropriations process can continue after we pass this bill. It is \nobvious why we started with a Defense appropriations bill first. While \nthis morning's filibuster was deeply regrettable, to say the least, we \nhave the option to reconsider that bill and we will. We are going to \nkeep working to ensure its passage.\n  Look, as we approach Veterans Day, I ask my colleagues to consider \nthis. We have an all-volunteer force in this country. The young men and \nwomen who sign up to defend our Nation don't ask for a lot, but our \nNation certainly asks a lot of them. These mothers and brothers and \nfriends and neighbors aren't legislative poker chips, and helping them \nisn't a ``waste of the Senate's time.'' These are Americans who deserve \nour support. Let's put the past in the past and unite to finally give \nit to them. Both parties did so in committee a few months ago and both \nparties could do so now.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Getting the Business of the Country Done\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I had the pleasure of listening to the \nRepublican leader's speech a few minutes ago. I understand he has two-\nthirds of his caucus who voted against the budget agreement and he has \nto kind of play to his audience. I think the words he used were: We are \nthe party of dysfunction.\n  All you have to do is read the newspaper to find out that is not the \ncase. The fact is, it has been shown time and time again in recent \nyears the party that is not working is the Republican Party. There is \nno more evidence of that when you see who is running for President. All \nyou have to do is look and see what happened in recent weeks in the \nHouse of Representatives, where the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives, when asked a week before he resigned: How do you put \nup with those people over there, and he said: If you are around garbage \nlong enough, you can't smell it.\n  So let's not talk about us being the party of dysfunction.\n  The Republican leader has complained about delay. I don't know what \nkind of glasses he is wearing, we were ready to negotiate in June. We \nkept saying that over and over again. Right now we don't have anything \nwe can move forward on. Let's sit down and talk. They refused to talk \ntime and time again. We asked for consent agreements. They refused to \ndo that.\n  Time was marching on. The debt ceiling was fast approaching where, if \nwe had not advanced that, this country would have basically shut down \nand it would have had a dramatic negative effect on the world economy.\n  Please, I say to my Republican colleagues, don't talk about delay. We \nhaven't delayed anything. These bills that are going to be in the form \nof an omnibus, they should have been done one at a time, but you \ncouldn't do it because they were spending everything for defense and \nnothing for nondefense. So with the budget agreement, as we have said, \nwe wanted to make sure sequestration was taken care of--and it was. \nDrastic cuts in sequestration are gone for 2 years. We wanted to make \nsure if there was any increase in defense the middle class got equal \nparity, and they did. We are satisfied where we are, but the time for \ncasting blame is gone and my friend the Republican leader should stop \ntrying to blame it on us. We didn't do it. We are not the party of \ndysfunction.\n  From the very beginning we sought funding levels that were fair to \nthe middle class and to the military. The military is going to get \ntheir money. Everybody knows that. The Presiding Officer knows it. \nEverybody knows it, but it is not a bad deal that the middle class also \ngets enough to take care of them. Republicans seem compelled, as they \ndid this morning, to once again fund one part of the government they \nlike--the Pentagon--without doing anything for the needs of the rest of \nthe country: the middle class, those people here at home.\n  We can give a speech just as patriotic as my Republican friend. We \nbelieve in the military. They have made great sacrifices for all of us, \nbut we don't need to give great speeches about how patriotic we are. \nWhat we need to do is get the business of the country done, and that \nhas not happened. Hopefully,\n\n[[Page S7796]]\n\nwith this step forward and being on this Military Construction and \nVeterans Affairs appropriations bill, we can do that.\n  Democrats opposed the motion to invoke cloture on the Defense bill \nthis morning because Republicans again were compelled to do everything \nthey could for the Pentagon and ignore the rest of the country, but \nthis afternoon we have been willing to move ahead the Military \nConstruction and Veterans Affairs bill. It is the right thing to do. \nThat bill has both defense and domestic matters contained in it. It is \na noncontroversial bill, and it will give us an opportunity to start \nthe appropriations process. It doesn't seem fair to us that we would \nrush forward and do the Defense bill, which is more than 50 percent of \nall the money this country spends in a year--more than 50 percent of \nthe discretionary spending that we have to appropriate.\n  Now we have a December 11 deadline and we have to fund all the \ngovernment to avoid a shutdown. So I hope we are considering this \nMilitary Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill. The \nAppropriations Committee will be working together to put together \nfunding--likely in an omnibus--for the rest of the government. Dealing \nwith the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill \nis a small step to rebuild trust and experience in working together.\n  Democrats are willing partners to carry out the budget agreement \nCongress passed last week, but we will continue to fight for the needs \nof the middle class while we continue to fight and make sure the \nmilitary is taken care of and also continue to fight poison pill \nriders.\n  Mr. President, we have a number of people on the floor. Is anyone \nseeking recognition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n              Unanimous Consent Request--S. 552 and S. 966\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \nask the Senate to take up and pass two bipartisan no-cost bills that \nwill help small businesses with one of their most urgent needs; that \nis, access to credit. Specifically, I am referring to Senator Risch's \nbill to enhance the SBA support for startup firms, which is called the \nSmall Business Investment Company Capital Act, and the bill I have \nsponsored with Senator Isakson, the Commercial Real Estate and Economic \nDevelopment Act, which is also known as the CREED Act.\n  Both of these bills have broad bipartisan support. In April, almost 6 \nmonths ago, the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship \nvoted unanimously to pass both of these bills. I had introduced the \nCREED Act with my friend from Georgia Senator Isakson to reinstate a \nnew version of a successful no-cost program at the SBA known as 504 \nrefinancing. That program had expired before many of the small \nbusinesses that needed help could benefit. Congress had created this \nrefinancing program during the financial crisis when small business \nlending was frozen. As real estate values declined, many small \nbusinesses, even those that were performing well and were current on \ntheir mortgage payments, were unable to refinance their loans through \ntraditional methods. Small businesses with equity in their properties \nwere often unable to access that equity for additional operating \ncapital.\n\n  That 504 refinancing program worked. For the short time that it was \nactive, SBA and its loan partners were able to help a lot of those \nsmall businesses. More than 2,300 small firms refinanced $5 billion of \nsmall business debt. Unfortunately, the program expired in September of \n2012, even though there was still significant demand for this type of \nfinancing. In fact, on the last day this program was authorized, more \nthan 400 businesses from around the country applied.\n  There is still a significant demand for this lending today. We keep \nhearing from small businesses that they would benefit greatly from this \ntype of financing. In particular, it would help the many small \nbusinesses who are paying too much in interest because they took out \ntheir loans during the recession. As one lender in New Hampshire said:\n\n       During the crisis, businesses took whatever financing they \n     could get. The banks wouldn't commit to long terms. Today the \n     rates are much better, [so businesses holding those loans are \n     paying too much].\n\n  Now, while the economy is better and lending to small businesses is \nstarting to recover, many banks today either cannot or will not \nrefinance or renew an existing commercial real estate loan on terms as \nbeneficial as the 504 refinancing loan could.\n  We know there is real need for this program. We have heard it from \nsmall businesses, and we have heard it from groups that work directly \nwith small businesses. I have a chart here that shows a number of those \ngroups we have heard from. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the \nAmerican Bankers Association support the legislation. The National \nAssociation of Development Companies; the National Small Business \nAssociation; the Consumer Bankers Association; the Small Business \nMajority; Women Impacting Public Policy, which does so much to support \nwomen-owned businesses; the Association of Women's Business Centers; \nand then we have a whole list of those development companies that \nsupport this legislation. I won't read through those development \ncompanies, but these are all organizations and businesses that want to \nsee us start this program again because they have small businesses that \nneed this lending.\n  I have a number of letters here that I will just hold up and show. We \nhave a whole packet of letters, and I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record these letters.\n       There being no objection, the material was ordered to be \n     printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                          GSDC\n\n                                                     Aug. 4, 2015.\n     Hon. Jeanne Shaheen,\n     Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ranking Member Shaheen: Thank you for introducing S. \n     966, the Commercial Real Estate and Economic Development Act \n     of 2015 (CREED Act). This bill is important to small \n     businesses in New Hampshire and across the country. It would \n     re-instate the 504 Refi program, a two-year initiative that \n     permitted refinancing of existing commercial real estate debt \n     using the Small Business Administration (SBA) 504 loan \n     program.\n       We also want to thank the Members of the Senate Committee \n     on Small Business & Entrepreneurship for voting unanimously \n     to pass the bill out of Committee on April 23, 2015. That was \n     three months ago, and we are counting on the full Senate to \n     pass the bill because it is an important source of financing \n     for small businesses. We need to get it up and running again \n     as soon as possible.\n       The biggest impact of the SBA 504 Refi program is to allow \n     small businesses access to equity in their business real \n     estate thereby allowing the bank and SBA 504 to consolidate \n     shorter term, higher interest rate loans. This directly \n     benefits the small business by 1) lowering interest payments \n     and monthly payments, 2) locking in low rate mortgage \n     payments for 20 years, 3) freeing up working assets (Accounts \n     Receivable, Inventory, FF, fixtures, and \n     equipment) allowing the business access to working capital to \n     support business growth and the hiring of new employees.\n       The SBA 504 Refi program is only available to existing \n     businesses that are financially viable with experienced \n     management and all loan payments current. This is not a \n     bailout for big businesses on the brink of collapse but \n     rather a credit enhancement for small businesses with equity \n     in real estate that banks are not willing to leverage without \n     the assistance of the SBA 504 Refinance program. The small \n     business owner is savvy enough to realize the significant \n     benefit of the program and is willing to pay the small fees \n     to cover all costs, if they only had the opportunity.\n       Below are three specific examples of small businesses that \n     benefited from the SBA 504 Refi program.\n       1. A building supply company headquartered in Merrimack, \n     NH, that was significantly impacted by the recession with \n     sales decreasing over 30% from 2007 to 2010. The business's \n     $1,000,000 LOC (line of credit) was demanded by the bank with \n     payment due in full in less than 6 months. The SBA 504 \n     Refinance program allowed the business to access the equity \n     in their real estate by taking out a new 90% LTV mortgage \n     (50% new bank, 40% SBA) providing 1) sufficient funds to pay \n     off the $1,000,000 LOC, 2) convert short term working capital \n     with higher interest rate to long term lower interest debt \n     with a fixed rate, and 3) free up access to new working \n     capital. The new bank provided a new $250,000 LOC and a new \n     $200,000 term loan.\n       2. A manufacturing company that provides drilling and \n     routing services to high-tech industries located primarily \n     throughout the northeastern United States and has its \n     headquarters located in a 9,620 SF manufacturing facility in \n     an Industrial Park in Salem, NH. The company's original $575M \n     mortgage required monthly P payments of $4,500 (priced \n     @5.65%) and the SBA 504 Refi program refinanced their \n     mortgage and reduced monthly mortgage payments to \n     approximately $3,950 creating an annual savings of\n\n[[Page S7797]]\n\n     over $6,600. The interest rate on the new mortgage was also \n     decreased to 4.25% with the assistance of the SBA 504 \n     Refinance program. This 504 Refi transaction allowed the Bank \n     to reduce its mortgage exposure to the customer by $250M, \n     which in turn allowed the Bank to consolidate three term \n     loans and provide a single $460M term loan, creating an \n     additional $3,000 yearly savings at a lower interest rate. \n     Finally, debt consolidation and SBA 504 refinance allowed the \n     Bank to grant the customer a new $50M RLOC for working \n     capital needs to keep the customer operating during the slow \n     winter months.\n       3. A grocery store located in Littleton, NH. The store \n     carries a full line of grocery store products as well as \n     natural, organic and locally produced goods. With the \n     assistance of the SBA 504 Refi program the business was able \n     to access equity in their real estate and consolidate eight \n     short term mortgages and equipment terms loans totaling \n     $3,231,000 reducing payments by $114,000 per year. With this \n     annual savings the business was able to add long term \n     financial stability to costs and free up working capital to \n     allow the business to hire new employees. This business has \n     seen steady growth and is planning to expand in 2015.\n       There are more small businesses that could use this \n     financing. Please urge the Senate to pass this bill.\n           Thank you,\n\n                                               Scott Gardiner,\n\n                           Executive Vice President, Granite State\n     Economic Development Corp.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, Aug. 19, 2015.\n     Hon. Jeanne Shaheen,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Johnny Isakson,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Shaheen and Isakson: The U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce, the world's largest business federation \n     representing the interests of more than three million \n     businesses of all sizes, sectors, and regions, as well as \n     state and local chambers and industry associations, and \n     dedicated to promoting, protecting, and defending America's \n     free enterprise system, supports S. 966, the ``Commercial \n     Real Estate and Economic Development Act of 2015,'' (CREED \n     Act) which would help provide small business owners with much \n     needed access to capital when attempting to refinance their \n     commercial real estate loans.\n       Many small business owners are challenged to refinance real \n     estate loans structured as balloon payments and \n     collateralized by devalued assets when the loan matures. Even \n     though the small business borrower may be current on their \n     payments, the financial institution experiencing tightened \n     lending standards and increased oversight by examiners may \n     not have a choice but to either force the business into \n     foreclosure, or take a loss by writing down the loan.\n       S. 966 would help small businesses and financial \n     institutions overcome these hurdles by allowing small \n     businesses to refinance eligible debt with a Small Business \n     Administration 504 loan, at no expense to taxpayers.\n       More than ninety-six percent of the Chamber's members are \n     small businesses with fewer than one hundred employees. The \n     Chamber thanks you for introducing S. 966, the CREED Act, and \n     looks forward to working with you on its passage.\n           Sincerely,\n     R. Bruce Josten.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   Sept. 25, 2015.\n     Sen. Bob Casey,\n     393 Russell Senate Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Sen. Pat Toomey,\n     248 Russell Senate Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Casey and Senator Toomey: On behalf of \n     Northeastern Economic Development Co. in Pennsylvania, I \n     write to share my enthusiasm for S. 966, the CREED Act. This \n     bill was unanimously voted out of the Senate Committee on \n     Small Business and Entrepreneurship in April and has been \n     waiting to be passed by the full Senate for more than three \n     months. The bill is bi-partisan and has zero cost.\n       I urge you to push for quick consideration of this bill in \n     the Senate and vote in favor it so that Pennsylvania small \n     businesses, and small businesses everywhere, can once again \n     have access to this valuable program.\n       The CREED Act will reinstitute a program that permits \n     conventional loans to be refinanced with the SBA's 504 loan \n     program. When this refinancing was in place from mid-2011 to \n     September 2012, more than 2,300 small business owners were \n     able to refinance existing equipment or owner-occupied real \n     estate debt. During this economically challenging time, these \n     entrepreneurs refinanced $5 billion of their own capital to \n     reinvest in their business and create jobs. One of the states \n     to use this program the most was Pennsylvania--roughly $68 \n     million in loans went to small businesses that refinanced \n     existing loans on essential fixed assets.\n       While large businesses have equal access to capital as they \n     did before the recession, small businesses still have a tight \n     credit market. This valuable refinancing tool is needed to \n     help America's 28 million small businesses grow. The demand \n     is certainly there--over 400 businesses applied to the \n     refinancing program on its final day, but were left out from \n     participating when it closed. With interest rates at historic \n     lows, reinstituting the refinancing program will give small \n     business owners a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to lock in a \n     fixed-rate refinanced loan and be able to use those savings \n     to reinvest and grow their businesses, We hope with your \n     leadership, this program will be available to them again.\n       Thank you in advance for your support of S.966, the CREED \n     Act, and for your continued support of small businesses.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Stephen Ursich,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                CSRA Business,\n\n                                                    Oct. 26, 2015.\n     Sen. Johnny Isakson,\n     131 Russell Senate Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Isakson, We the non-profit SBA Certified \n     Development Companies in the State of Georgia, are jointly \n     writing you this letter to thank you for your support and co-\n     sponsorship of S.966 (the CREED Act) and to ask you to assist \n     in the passage of the bill that is expected to be introduced \n     on the floor of the Senate in the coming days. We as a group \n     unanimously support this legislation which is a badly needed \n     rule change to the SBA-504 loan program that we all operate \n     in our various communities which would allow small business \n     owners throughout our state to tap into the equity in their \n     buildings and refinance debt at our current low historical \n     rates.\n       This bill was unanimously voted out of the Senate Committee \n     on Small Business and Entrepreneurship in April and has been \n     waiting to be passed by the full Senate for more than four \n     months. As you well know, the bill is bipartisan and has zero \n     cost to the taxpayers.\n       As one of the lead cosponsors of this bill, you understand \n     the benefits it will provide to small businesses. The CREED \n     Act will reinstitute a program that permits conventional \n     mortgages and other loans to be refinanced with the SBA's 504 \n     loan program if a small business owner can demonstrate \n     sufficient equity and cash flow exists. When this refinancing \n     was in place from mid-2011 to September 2012, more than 2,300 \n     small business owners were able to refinance their owner-\n     occupied business real estate debt.\n       While large businesses have equal access to capital as they \n     did before the recession, small businesses still have a tight \n     credit market. This valuable refinancing tool is needed to \n     help America's 28 million small businesses grow. The demand \n     is certainly there--over 900 businesses applied to the \n     refinancing program on the final day it was in place. With \n     interest rates at historic lows, reinstituting the \n     refinancing program will give small business owners the same \n     opportunity consumers have had--to refinance into a low \n     fixed-rate loan and be able to use those savings to reinvest \n     and grow their businesses. We hope with your leadership, this \n     program will be available to them again.\n       It is our understanding that some have suggested that this \n     program be held to accounting standards outside of the \n     current federal budgeting procedure. The process of how the \n     budget is managed is a contentious one and one that should \n     not hold this bill hostage. That issue should be handled \n     through the Senate Budget Committee and not a bipartisan bill \n     that gives small businesses an opportunity to grow.\n       We know the performance of the loans that were refinanced \n     during the downturn while program was in place, have \n     outperformed OMB projections and the regular default rates on \n     standard SBA loans. SBA implemented credit safeguards by \n     making the program available only to businesses who have been \n     in business two or more years and by not allowing business to \n     refinance debt that has been past due in the year prior to \n     application.\n       We appreciate your leadership on S.966, the CREED Act, and \n     ask for your assistance in its passage in the Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                     Randy Griffin, President,\n\n                                   CSRA Business Lending, Augusta,\n                                        On Behalf of the Attached.\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. The support for this bill is so broad, as indicated by \nthis chart and as indicated by these letters, because the need is so \ngreat. There is no reason we shouldn't take up and pass this bill. It \nhas been approved by the committee--the small business committee. It \nhas broad bipartisan support. It is cosponsored by Senators Fischer, \nAyotte, Coons, Cantwell, Hirono, Franken, and Casey. I thank them for \ntheir support, and I thank the small business committee for its work.\n  Mr. President, like so many of the important bills that go through \nthe Senate, this bill has been paired, as I said earlier, by the \nchairman of the small business committee, Senator Vitter, with another \nno-cost small business bill which is authored by Senator Risch from \nIdaho. That bill, along with the CREED Act, will provide no-cost \nsolutions that will help small businesses in this country get the \ncredit they need to fuel our growth.\n  Again, both of these bills passed unanimously out of the small \nbusiness committee. I believe the time has come\n\n[[Page S7798]]\n\nto pass them in the Senate. They have been held up for too long.\n  At this time I want to yield to my colleague, who is going to talk \nabout the hold problem we have been facing on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I would like to be recognized to ask my \ncolleague from New Hampshire a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, it has been more than 4 years since the \nSenate overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan resolution ending the ability \nof Senators to place secret holds as a way to block passage of \nlegislation and confirmations of nominees. The resolution--which I \nworked on with our colleague from Iowa Senator Grassley for more than a \ndecade, and Senator McCaskill joined in these efforts--overwhelmingly \npassed the Senate by a 92-to-4 vote. Under the resolution, Senators who \nobject to requests to pass legislation by unanimous consent are \nsupposed to record their opposition by sending notice to the cloakroom \nand to the Secretary of the Senate, notifying colleagues of their \nobjection. The objection is then listed in the Senate Calendar on a \npage--I took today's with the title ``Notice of Intent to Object to \nProceeding.''\n  Mr. President, if you look at the page in the Senate Calendar where \nholds on bills are supposed to be listed, right now you will find a \nsingle entry on the page. It concerns a public hold that I placed on \nthe intelligence authorization legislation last July. I wish I could \nsay the reason that only one objection to a unanimous consent request \nis listed in the Senate Calendar is that my objection is the only hold \nplaced on a bill in the past few months.\n  Regrettably, that does not seem to be the case. For example, my \ncolleague from New Hampshire has been talking about her bill, known as \nthe CREED Act, S. 966. It was hotlined back on June 18 to determine if \nany Senator objected to passing that bill by unanimous consent. An \nobjection was made after the bill was hotlined back in June, but the \nobjecting Senator was not publicly identified as the timely objection \nwas made. My understanding is that Senator Shaheen and her staff \nsubsequently learned that multiple Senators had objected to passing her \nbill by unanimous consent, but not one of those Senators made their \nobjection public through the notice requirements that were part of the \nbipartisan resolution.\n  I think it is important to note that Senator Shaheen's CREED Act was \ndetermined to have no cost to Federal taxpayers. It is funded entirely \nby fees paid by the borrowers and lenders under the SBA 504 Loan \nProgram. It strikes me as a very good bill that would benefit America's \neconomy.\n  I gather there are some Senators who might not agree about the value \nof the program, which, of course, is their right as Senators. But if \nthey object to passing a bill, Senators ought to be publicly \naccountable. That is how we voted--92 to 4. They shouldn't be able to \nhide opposition behind anonymous objection. Senator Grassley and I and \nSenator McCaskill and others have said: Look, public business has got \nto be done in public. So Senator Grassley and I have publicly announced \nour holds by putting statements in the Congressional Record, and I \ndon't think that Western civilization has exactly been harmed as a \nresult of this kind of transparency and accountability.\n  I would like to ask my colleague Senator Shaheen, given her interest \nin living up to both the letter and the spirit of the bipartisan \nresolution, whether it is her intent to state a unanimous consent \nrequest at this time to ensure the kind of transparency and \naccountability that was envisioned in the bipartisan resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I thank my colleague from Oregon for pointing out the \nfact that people who want to hold up legislation that has broad \nbipartisan support are supposed to make themselves publicly known. It \ntook us months to figure out who was actually holding up this bill. So \nI do intend to ask unanimous consent to move the bill forward. I \nappreciate the Senator pointing out the change we have agreed to as a \nSenate in how we handle those holds and that the people holding up the \nlegislation should be public so the public understands who is objecting \nand has a chance to weigh in with the people who are objecting.\n  Mr. President, with that said, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 104, S. \n552, and Calendar No. 107, S. 966, en bloc; that the bills be read a \nthird time and passed; and that the motions to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I want to \naddress the unanimous consent request, and I am delighted to continue \nthe ongoing conversation we have been having about this for many months \nnow with the minority staff on the small business committee and with \nthe office of the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  I might preface my comments by observing that I used to own and \noperate my own small business. I helped launch a little community bank \nin eastern Pennsylvania, western New Jersey. I have some firsthand \npersonal experience both as a small business borrower and as a small \nbusiness lender, and that experience informs my judgment about this and \nother things.\n  I should also point out that this is a unanimous consent request to \nconsider two bills together en bloc. I have made it clear that I have \nno objection to S. 552, but I do have some concerns about S. 966 that I \nwant to address.\n  Let me be clear about what this does. This legislation would \nreactivate an expired program that requires taxpayers to guarantee \ncertain loans. By the way, taxpayers are already on the hook for over \n$3 trillion of loans we force them to guarantee through many different \nprograms. This would bring back to life another taxpayer loan guarantee \nprogram. It does it by specifically requiring taxpayers to guarantee \nloans that would refinance existing debt.\n  So this particular legislation that we are considering today is about \nthe refinancing of existing debt. It is not taking on new debt for the \npurpose of expanding an existing business or something like that; it is \nrefinancing existing debt.\n  As the Senator observed, this would sort of reincarnate a program \nthat was launched in 2010. This was launched in 2010 because we were \nstill in the very early days of recovering from a severe financial \ncrisis. It was designed intentionally to be temporary--to require \ntaxpayers to finance these loans for small businesses but only for this \n2-year period. And that is what happened.\n  Here are my problems with this. I have two problems. One is the cost \nthis imposes on taxpayers. I have heard it described as a no-cost \nprogram on several occasions. That is absolutely not true. The fact is \nthat no small business goes through the hassle of applying for and \nparticipating in this program unless it can get the loan at a lower \nrate than what is generally available from banks. That difference \nbetween this taxpayer-subsidized lower rate and a market rate is the \ncost to the taxpayers. You don't have to take my word for it; that is \nwhat the Congressional Budget Office said. I will say more on that in a \nmoment. In addition, the parent program that provides similar types of \nloans has lost $300 million for taxpayers over just the last several \nyears. How is that no cost?\n  The second concern I have is that there is no job requirement \nwhatsoever in this particular legislation, unlike the existing \nprogram--the parent program, if you will, the 504 program that never \nsuspended. That has an explicit job requirement for additional taxpayer \nliabilities. This one doesn't. It explicitly exempts the business \nborrowing this money from having to create or even retain so much as a \nsingle job.\n  So I would like to modify the unanimous consent request, and my \nmodification does three things: No. 1, it allows the resumption of the \nprogram. That is the first thing it does. It allows this program to \nresume, which is the intention of the Senator from New Hampshire, I \nbelieve. But what it also does, after 1 year of resumption, is require \nthat we begin to have some taxpayer protections on this. Specifically,\n\n[[Page S7799]]\n\nthe form that would take would be to require the Office of Management \nand Budget to certify that the program doesn't cost money on a fair \nvalue basis. The fair value basis is taking into account the fact that \nnot all credits are equal. For instance, the corner pizza shop is not \nas creditworthy as the Treasury of the United States of America. So a \ntrue cost of a loan differs between that which you would extend to the \nTreasury of the United States of America and the local pizza shop. If \nyou don't have a differential between those two, then someone is \ngetting the wrong rate. And if you lend to the pizza shop at the same \nrate you lend to the Federal Government, you are surely not being \ncompensated adequately for the risk you are taking.\n\n  So this methodology, the fair value methodology, is the same one we \nuse when we quantify the cost of the TARP program, when we quantify the \ncost of GSE guarantees, and when we quantify IMF liabilities. That is \nwhat I am suggesting we use.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has weighed in with their views on \nfair value accounting, and they said:\n\n       When the government extends credit, the associated market \n     risk of those obligations is effectively passed along to \n     taxpayers, who, as investors, would view that risk as having \n     a cost. Therefore, the fair-value approach offers a more \n     comprehensive estimate of federal costs.\n\n  That is the second thing we do. First, we extend the program and \nallow it to resume. Secondly, we impose fair value, which is to say an \nhonest assessment of the true cost to taxpayers. Finally, my suggestion \nis that we enact the very same jobs test that the parent legislation--\nthe alternative, similar legislation, the 504 program--requires, and \nthat is, for every $65,000 of new risk that taxpayers are being forced \nto take, let's at least make sure we are creating or retaining at least \none job. Think about the alternative. Someone could go out and \nrefinance an existing loan at a lower rate because the government--the \ntaxpayers--is subsidizing the rate. They could use the savings to buy \nautomation equipment and actually eliminate jobs. How could that make \nany sense at all?\n  My modification would restore the program, would provide some \nprotection to taxpayers, and would require job creation in the process.\n  I ask that the Senator modify her request, that the bills be passed \nen bloc, and that my amendment to S. 966, which is at the desk, be \nagreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator so modify?\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Reserving the right to object to the modification, let \nme point out that Senator Toomey's objection to this bill is not only \nwrong, it is inconsistent. The Senator is not objecting to Senator \nRisch's bill, S. 552, which is also being considered today. He not \nseeking to amend it, even though it would increase small business \nassistance and also require taxpayer guarantee.\n  We have also recently passed bills that increase small business \nassistance, including Senator Vitter's disaster legislation and an \nincrease to the cap for the SBA 7(a) Loan Program. The fact is that the \namendment Senator Toomey is proposing is really not a compromise. Let \nme take a few minutes to explain why.\n  This amendment would essentially gut the pre-legislation, the 504 \nrefinancing program, and it would prevent it from ever helping small \nbusinesses.\n  I appreciate Senator Toomey's experience as a small business owner. \nMy husband and I started out our married life as small business owners. \nWe had a family business. It did very well by us. I learned a lot about \nthe challenges facing small business. One of the major ones is access \nto credit.\n  What Senator Toomey is talking about would single out this \nlegislation and gut the intent of this legislation, and that is not \nwhat small businesses need.\n  I want to read a letter that we received from nine lenders--the \nnonprofit SBA certified development companies in the State of Georgia \nthat worked with this program--about their assessment of what Senator \nToomey is proposing. They say:\n\n       It is our understanding that some have suggested that this \n     program be held to accounting standards outside of the \n     current federal budgeting procedure. The process of how the \n     budget is managed is a contentious one and one that should \n     not hold this bill hostage. . . . We know the performance of \n     the loans that were refinanced during the downturn while \n     [the] program was in place have outperformed OMB projections \n     and the regular default rates on standard SBA loans. SBA \n     implemented credit safeguards by making the program available \n     only to businesses who have been in business two or more \n     years and by not allowing businesses to refinance debt that \n     has been past due in the year prior to the application.\n\n  That is the end of the quote from the letter, and it was submitted as \npart of the package of letters I submitted earlier.\n  What Senator Toomey's proposal would do is single out this program \nand make it subject to a budget standard that would artificially raise \nthe cost of programs meant to help small businesses, farmers, students, \nand so many others get access to credit.\n  I understand the Senator from Pennsylvania wanting to change budget \nrules for credit programs. Certainly, if he has a concern about that, \nhe should try to do that. I am happy to have that debate. But this \nisn't the right place to do it. We shouldn't be holding small \nbusinesses hostage.\n  The Budget Committee recently started a series of hearings on budget \nreforms, and I think that is the right venue for this discussion.\n  I would point out that Senator Enzi, who chairs the Budget Committee, \nvoted for this legislation. He was part of the vote in the Small \nBusiness Committee that passed this legislation.\n  I would also like to note that the CREED Act, as passed by the \ncommittee, was supported by a number of organizations from the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n  I will quote again from one of the letters we received from one of \nthose lenders from Pennsylvania, NEDCO. They said:\n\n       I write to share my enthusiasm for the CREED Act. . . . I \n     urge you to push for quick consideration of this bill in the \n     Senate and vote in favor of it so that Pennsylvania small \n     businesses, and small businesses everywhere, can once again \n     have access to this valuable program. . . . While large \n     businesses have equal access to capital as they did before \n     the recession, small businesses still have a tight credit \n     market. . . . With interest rates at historic lows, \n     reinstituting the refinancing program will give small \n     business owners a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to lock in a \n     fixed-rate refinanced loan and be able to use those savings \n     to reinvest and grow their businesses.\n\n  The letter goes on. That is just one lender. Across Pennsylvania, the \nprogram had a big impact while it was up and running. In fact, \nPennsylvania was the 12th most active State, with more than $64 million \nin loans and more than 1,700 jobs supported in about the 18 months of \nthe program.\n  We did amend the bill in the Small Business Committee to address some \nof the concerns from Republican Members about its budget implications. \nThose changes have been made. They have been vetted by our committee. \nBut now, after months of delay, Senator Toomey has proposed an \namendment that is not a good-faith effort at compromise, from my \nperspective, that would effectively prevent the program from ever \nhelping small businesses that we need to help.\n  For all of these reasons, I object, and I would again ask unanimous \nconsent to take up and pass both bills as reported by the committee of \njurisdiction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). Objection is heard to the \nmodification.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I am a \nlittle surprised and disappointed to be accused of not operating in \ngood faith when I attempted to reach a compromise by allowing one of \nthese two bills to go exactly as the proponent advocated.\n  I would be happy to extend fair value accounting treatment to the \nRisch bill as well. The Senator from New Hampshire is concerned about \nconsistency. Let's consistently apply honest accounting for the risks \nwe are imposing on taxpayers. And to think that is not an appropriate \nconversation to have at a time when we are asking taxpayers to take new \nrisks--I don't know what better time there could be, especially after \nwe have saddled taxpayers with over $3 trillion of guarantees that they \nhave been obligated to already.\n  If somehow my modifications would make it impossible to make the \nloans,\n\n[[Page S7800]]\n\nthat should tell us something about this program. In other words, if we \nsay that they can't proceed with a loan if a fair and honest \naccounting, as prescribed by CBO, shows it to be in a loss, then \napparently they are concerned about the program being at a loss--as \nwell they should be since the most closely related program has lost \nhundreds of millions of dollars for taxpayers.\n  So I think this is exactly the time to have this conversation. We \nhave been having this conversation for months with the Senator from New \nHampshire's staff and the small business committee's minority staff. If \nwe can reach an agreement on this, as I said before, I am happy to \nallow this program to resume, but it should be done in a way that it \nactually creates jobs and actually does provide some protection to \ntaxpayers. So since we can't agree to that today, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I understand Senator Toomey has objected \nto my unanimous consent request, but I do think it is important to \npoint out that in fact the amendment he has proposed would essentially \nundermine the program. That is why I say that is not an amendment that \nis a real effort to improve the bill. In fact, it is not being offered \non any other of these kinds of programs--didn't offer it on Senator \nVitter's legislation, on increasing the SBA 7(a) program cap.\n  If that is a conversation he wants to have as a member of the Budget \nCommittee and for the Budget Committee to start talking about that, \nthat is very appropriate, but that should not undermine the efforts of \nsmall businesses to get the lending they need. In fact, this is a \nprogram that has a history. It has a history that shows that it has a \nlower default rate than other SBA loan programs. In Pennsylvania alone, \nit created 1,700 jobs during the time it was in effect.\n  So I think there is the possibility to get to some agreement, even \nthough we have already made some reforms to this bill in committee, but \nI don't think gutting the program in a way that makes it ineffective is \nthe way to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, I thank the senior Senator from \nNew Hampshire for her advocacy for small business. We work together on \na number of different small business issues dealing with capital, and I \nappreciate her advocacy. Her partnership has helped us in Michigan on \nsome very important things on which I hope we are going to be able to \nmove forward, so I thank her.\n\n\n                          Affordable Care Act\n\n  Mr. President, I want to speak today about the importance of having \naccess to quality, affordable health care. The Affordable Care Act has \nfixed a lot of what has been wrong with our broken health care system \nin the past. We no longer have to be afraid of someone in our family \ngetting sick and being dropped from our insurance plan. Being a woman \nis no longer viewed as a preexisting condition. Young people are able \nto stay on their parents' plan while they are looking for a job with \nfull health benefits. That has certainly affected people in my family, \nas I am sure everyone in the Chamber and certainly those across the \ncountry have felt this, as they are supporting young people who are \nmoving from high school or college and looking for a job. And we are \nslowing the growth of health insurance premiums. And, as we have this \nfirst week of open enrollment and Americans are heading to \nhealthcare.gov to sign up and get covered, we know we now have 17.6 \nmillion more Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act who know \nthat if the kids get sick tonight, they will be able to make sure they \ncan go to a doctor and get the health care they need. If they \nthemselves get sick, they won't just be relying on emergency rooms, \nwhich are the most expensive way to get regular health care. They will \nhave the peace of mind of knowing they are covered if there is cancer \ndiscovered or if there is an accident or something else happens in \ntheir family.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control, the number of people \nwho are uninsured has fallen to 9.2 percent. I would like to see that \nstill lower, but the good news is that it is half of what it was just 2 \nyears ago. So in 2 years we have seen the number of people without \nhealth insurance cut in half --I think that is good news--even before \nthe opening of the marketplace and State exchanges.\n\n  Thanks to the ACA, the rate of uninsured children dropped to 6 \npercent last year, which is the lowest in history. We have the lowest \nnumber of children who are now in a situation where they don't have \nhealth care coverage. Unfortunately, just as Americans are reviewing \ntheir options right now during the open enrollment period, Republicans \nare looking to pull the rug out from under these children and their \nfamilies.\n  A few weeks ago Republicans in the House passed what is called a \nbudget reconciliation bill that essentially, bottom line, guts the \nAffordable Care Act, removing major provisions that help families get \naccess to quality affordable health care coverage. According to the \nnonpartisan budget office, the bill on the whole ``would increase \npremiums . . . by roughly 20 percent above what would be expected under \ncurrent law'' and cause 16 million people of the 17.6 to lose health \ninsurance. Why in the world would we want to pass this bill? I don't \nknow why in the world the House wanted to pass this bill, but why in \nthe world would we want to pass a bill that will roughly increase \npremiums by 20 percent above what they otherwise would be and knock 16 \nmillion people off their health insurance? Unfortunately, we are going \nto have that bill in front of us very shortly. I hope we are all going \nto vote no.\n  Of those who lose insurance, up to 20 percent of them--over 3 \nmillion--are children. After achieving the lowest rates of uninsured \nchildren in history, we are going to have in front of us a bill that \nwould require elimination of 3 million children from being able to get \nhealth insurance.\n  The bill also eliminates the Prevention and Public Health Fund. As \nthey say, we know that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of care. \nIt is much better to focus on healthy outcomes, to focus on reducing \nobesity, diabetes, heart disease, strokes, and all of those things that \nallow us on the front end to do prevention and public health and \nwellness rather than picking up the pieces. It would eliminate that \nthought.\n  In Michigan these funds have been used to help prevent tobacco use \nand to promote awareness of the importance of children getting \nimmunized against debilitating and deadly diseases, to name just a few \nthings. Critically important, the House bill strips funding for Planned \nParenthood. The budget office again estimates that up to 25 percent--\none out of four--people currently being served by clinics for \npreventive health care would face reduced access to care. It makes \nabsolutely no sense to roll back preventive health care for women, to \nroll back prevention that allows us to create opportunities for people \nwith information and tools they need to be healthy rather than getting \ndiseases down the road. Certainly, it makes no sense to raise premiums \nby 20 percent or to see 16 million people lose their health care.\n  I hope when that budget reconciliation bill comes before the Senate \nthat we will say no and allow millions of Americans to continue to have \nthe peace of mind of knowing they will have access to the medical care \nthey need for themselves and their families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                            F-35 Procurement\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the current \nplan to procure around 2,500 F-35s for our men and women in uniform.\n  Recently, I understand the chairman of the Armed Services Committee \ncalled upon Congress to cut the number of F-35s our Armed Forces will \nproduce. Usually, I fully agree with the chairman's astute assessment \nof national security matters. In fact, I think he is a terrific \nchairman. In particular, I applaud his vital work in drawing attention \nto this administration's lack of effective strategies to eliminate the \ncurrent threats posed by the Taliban, Al Qaeda, and the so-called \nIslamic State.\n\n[[Page S7801]]\n\n  Nevertheless, I must respectfully disagree with his call to reduce \nthe number of F-35s to be acquired by our Nation's military. In doing \nso, I reiterate my full support for the existing program of record, \nwhich calls for the procurement of 1,763 F-35s for the Air Force, 420 \nfor the Marines, and 260 for the Navy.\n  As we assess the question of F-35 procurement, we should remember how \nthe Department of Defense determined the number of aircraft it would \npurchase in the first place. I can assure you, this decision was \nneither hasty nor taken lightly. The Pentagon based its estimates on a \nthorough review of our Nation's airpower readiness and the capabilities \nneeded to deter and defeat future threats to our national security. The \nDepartment's procurement request doesn't reflect an arbitrary estimate \nbut the number of F-35s needed to keep our Nation safe.\n  If we reduce the number of F-35s to be acquired by the military, we \nhamstring our own ability to defend ourselves against America's \nenemies. Despite the formidable war-winning capabilities of the F-35, \nthis weapon system cannot be in more than one place at once. One F-35 \naircraft cannot simultaneously deter Russian aggression in Eastern \nEurope, patrol free waters in the South China Sea, target the Islamic \nState of the Middle East, and provide critical air support for our \nallies in Afghanistan. With every aircraft we cut, we are spreading our \ndefenses thin, putting our national security at risk, and limiting the \nability of our men and women in uniform to complete their mission.\n  Now is the worst time imaginable to limit production of the F-35. Not \nonly does the quantity and magnitude of threats facing our Nation \ncontinue to increase, so does the number of locations from which these \nthreats emanate. Moreover, when the Department of Defense made the \ninitial assessment for F-35 procurement, we did not face the \nexponential growth of threats which continue to metastasize under the \nObama administration's failed foreign policy. In this sense, the \nmilitary's request to procure just under 2,500 aircraft is not only \nreasonable but actually highly conservative.\n  As some of my colleagues discuss reducing the number of F-35s we \nprovide to our Nation's military, they should remember to consider the \neconomies of scale. With every single aircraft we cut, the individual \ncost of each F-35 actually increases, but if we keep current \nprocurement levels the same, the price of each aircraft remains the \nsame. We should be actively looking for ways to lower costs, not raise \nthem.\n  Thanks to the hard work and dedication of the F-35 Joint Program \nOffice, its program executive officer, Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, and \nits industry partners, we are finding ways to drive down costs and make \nthe F-35 more affordable. They are doing a terrific job. In fact, the \npricetag for the F-35 in our country is actually decreasing. Currently, \neach aircraft costs roughly $104 million to produce, but with the \nprojected purchase of over 3,500 jet fighters worldwide, I believe that \nprice will continue to fall.\n  At full production, the price of the F-35 will be comparable to the \ncost of new versions of the aircraft it is designed to replace; namely, \nthe F-16 and the F/A-18, which raises another question. Why is it vital \nto replace our aging aircraft with the F-35? Why don't we just purchase \nnew and improved versions of aircraft which are already in the fleet? \nThe answer is simple. No matter how many improvements and modifications \nwe make to the design of the A-10, F-16, and F/A-18 aircraft, they will \nnever be stealth aircraft, nor will they ever match the capabilities of \na fifth-generation jet fighter.\n  Stealth technology is absolutely critical to the future of our Armed \nForces. Stealth fighters are the only aircraft capable of penetrating \nairspace protected by advanced area denial anti-aircraft systems. Both \nRussia and China are developing these advanced anti-aircraft systems, \nand both nations appear willing to sell their technology to potential \nadversaries, including Iran. Because of Russia's propensity to \nproliferate weapon systems to rogue regimes and China's startling \nadvancement in technology to include the J-31 stealth aircraft and the \nPL-15 air-to-air missile, it is all but inevitable that our forces will \nroutinely encounter these sophisticated systems in both the near- and \nthe long-term. Because stealth technology is the most effective means \nof defeating these anti-aircraft systems, we hold a solemn duty to our \nservicemembers to provide them with the superior capabilities of the F-\n35.\n  I will not deny that the F-35 has had its fair share of problems. Its \ndevelopment program was not well-planned, and along the way there were \nabundant technical hurdles, cost overruns, and program execution \nconcerns, but as is the case in the development of any breakthrough \ntechnology, setbacks are not only probable, they are expected. What \nmatters now is how we react to these setbacks to make the program a \nsuccess.\n  We have now rounded the corner and are on the cusp of fielding the \nmost remarkable strike aircraft ever developed. The F-35 will help our \nNation reclaim its technological edge at a critical time. Our enemies \nhave been working tirelessly to match our military might, and they have \nmade significant progress in achieving parity with our current \ntechnology systems, but the F-35 will widen the technological gap once \nagain. Its superior capabilities will put us far ahead of our \nadversaries, and we can stay one step ahead by keeping procurement \nnumbers for the F-35 at their current levels.\n  In all of my years of public service, the F-35 is the most impressive \nweapon system I have ever seen. I am convinced this platform will give \nour Air Force, Navy, and Marine aviators the military advantage they \nneed to protect us against tyranny, deter our foes, and protect our \ncherished liberties for years to come. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis program, including the military's initial procurement request.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering H.R. 2029.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Which is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The MILCON-VA appropriations bill.\n\n\n               Department of Defense Appropriations Bill\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we are now considering the MILCON-VA \nappropriations bill. Obviously, anything we do for our veterans is \nsomething that is laudable to all of us, but earlier a very interesting \nvote took place in the U.S. Senate, when the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill which funds the appropriations for the Department \nof Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other \npurposes, et cetera--in other words, the Defense appropriations bill \nwhich provides for the training, the equipment, the pay, the medical \ncare, all of those vital necessities for the men and women who are \nserving in the military--a sufficient number of my colleagues, I \nbelieve all but one on the other side of the aisle, decided to vote \nagainst moving to that legislation.\n  I want the record to be clear, all but one of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle, as I understand it, voted against moving to \nthe legislation which provides the funding for the defense of this \nNation and the men and women who serve it--items that are vitally \nimportant to the men and women who are serving, items such as military \npersonnel. The committee recommends $3 billion for pay allowances and \nother personnel costs for Active Reserve and Guard troops activated for \nduty in Afghanistan and other contingencies, counterterrorism \npartnership funds, a money provision that recommends $300 million for \nthe Ukrainians who are now being dismantled by Vladimir Putin. The \ncommittee, as I mentioned, recommends money for pay allowances and \nother personnel costs for Active, Reserve, and Guard troops activated \nfor duty in Afghanistan and other contingency operations. The \nrecommendation includes funding for subsistence, permanent change of \nstation, travel, and special pays, including imminent danger pay, \nfamily separation allowance, and hardship duty pay.\n\n  I will have some other selections, but I think the American people \nought to know what my colleagues on the other\n\n[[Page S7802]]\n\nside of the aisle just voted against. They voted against paying \nallowances and personnel costs for the Active, Reserve, and Guard \ntroops activated for duty in Afghanistan, including funding for \nsubsistence, permanent change of station, travel, and special pays, \nincluding imminent danger pay. We won't fund the men and women serving \nin imminent danger. We decided not to fund them. That is amazing--truly \namazing.\n  One of the programs in here is the Counterterrorism Partnership Fund. \nThere is item after item listed here. These appropriations are for the \nmen and women in the armed services. These appropriations include their \npay, their benefits, their weapons, and their means to carry out their \nduties in dangerous times.\n  Other programs in here include countering violent extremism online, \nthe European Reassurance Initiative, and, as I mentioned, Ukraine and \ncounterterrorism. All of these provisions are contained in probably \nwhat is the most important obligation that we have. I don't know of a \ngreater obligation that we have to the American people and the security \nof the Nation. If there is any doubt about what is going on in the \nworld, one might just want to look back at what happened in the last \ncouple of days--the loss of a Russian airliner under very suspicious \ncircumstances, the continued pouring of weapons and capabilities into \nSyria by the Russians and Iranians, and the continued gains made by \nISIS in many parts of the world, including even as far away as parts of \nAfrica and Afghanistan.\n  Do any of my colleagues know of the strategy that the United States \nhas to address these issues? They can't because there is none. But here \nwe are doing our duty--our constitutional obligation--to provide for \nthe men and women who are serving and defending this Nation. And for \nobscure reasons--perhaps the Democrats, my colleagues and friends on \nthe other side of the aisle, will come to the floor and explain why \nthey would not go to a piece of legislation that protects this Nation \nand the men and women who serve it.\n  I am sure that in about 6 days--I believe it is--on November 11, \nVeterans Day, every one of my colleagues, like me, will go and be part \nof the celebration of the men and women who served and sacrificed.\n  What do you have to say about the men and women who are now serving? \nWhat you just did was to vote to not fund, train, equip, and defend \nthese men and women, and without this, their lives are in greater \ndanger. So don't go back and say that you are doing everything you can \nto defend this Nation. You are not.\n  Right now we have a very turbulent political situation in America. We \nhave people who are now leading in the polls and perhaps have never \nheld public office. The approval rating of Congress is at 12 percent or \nlower, and sometimes I hear some of my colleagues wonder why we are \nheld in such low esteem. If we can't even fund the men and women in the \nmilitary and take care of their needs, who in the world will we take \ncare of?\n  I believe the Republican leader voted in a way so that we can \nreconsider the vote. We need to reconsider the vote. We need to vote, \nand we need to be on record that we have done our barest of duties--our \nfundamental duty as elected officials, which is to ensure the security \nof this Nation.\n  Right now my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who voted not \nto move forward with this legislation have a lot of explaining to do on \nVeterans Day--a lot of explaining to do as to why they wouldn't take up \nthe legislation that takes care of their change of station, their pay, \ntheir benefits, and takes care of their health care. It is all in this \nlegislation, and yet my colleagues, for reasons which I do not \nunderstand, did not vote to take up this legislation.\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: Where are your \npriorities? Where are they? Is it somehow to gridlock this legislation \nbecause you want a certain piece of legislation brought up instead of \nthis one? Is it for some other obscure reason or is it because you \ndon't give a damn?\n  This is an embarrassing time for me in this body, when we have enough \nSenators to prevent us from taking up what are our barest minimal \nrequirements of our obligations, which are to provide for the defense \nof this Nation and the men and women who serve it. It is foolish, \ncynical, and dangerous to hold defense legislation hostage until every \none of their political demands is met simply because of that.\n  Veterans Day is 1 week away. I urge my Democratic colleagues to stop \ntreating our national defense as a tool for extracting political \nleverage. Let's return to the bipartisan tradition of providing for the \ncommon defense. That is what the men and women serving in the military \ndeserve and require from us, it is what Americans expect from us, and \nit is what the Constitution demands of us.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Transportation Authorization bill\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, it is always a pleasure to spend these \nlate afternoons--sometimes Thursday afternoons--when the current \nPresiding Officer gets stuck presiding, when I come to the floor to \ntalk, yet again, about funding--paying for--these roads and highways, \nbridges and transit systems that we use. I thank the Chair for being \nhere. As I look around, sometimes we have more than a few folks on the \nfloor, but I think a lot of people are headed for home on Thursday \nafternoon when we have no more votes.\n  Looking back over the last several days, there are actually a couple \nof things to feel good about. Last week we passed very important \nlegislation improving the strength of our cyber defenses and our \nability to fend off some of the 24/7 attacks that are being visited on \nfinancial institutions, on our military, on colleges and universities, \non research operations, and on businesses in our country. I am very \nproud of the bipartisan work we did on cyber security, information \nsharing, and some of the new technologies that are being deployed to \nhelp fend off attacks from the bad guys around the world. I felt very \ngood about that.\n  Not everybody likes the 2-year budget agreement that has been worked \nout in rough form. But I like to say about a friend, when you ask him \nhow he is doing, he says: Compared to what? The idea of living from \nweek to week, not knowing if we are going to have to shut down the \ngovernment, continuing to spend enormous amounts of human time and \ncapital getting ready for a shutdown and hoping it won't happen but \npreparing for the worst and having to do that month after month--I \nthink we have, for the most part, said we are not going to do that for \nthe next 2 years. Whether one likes every morsel or portion of the \nbudget deal, I think we can pretty much all say: Compared to what? \nWell, it is better than the path we were on.\n  Today, as we prepare to take up over the next couple of weeks \ntransportation policy for our country and transportation funding to \nfund that policy, there is the late-breaking news this morning from the \nHouse of Representatives that they have taken a very modest \ntransportation bill including authorization--it is probably a two-part \ndeal where we actually authorize transportation policy and then we try \nto figure out how to pay for it.\n  Too often in the past we have decided to pay for it by bailing out \nthe transportation trust fund. The legislation we passed and I voted \nagainst here in the Senate last month on transportation--during the \nlast Congress I chaired the Senate subcommittee on transportation \ninfrastructure. I am I think the No. 2 Democrat on the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. I am a former Governor. I spent 8 years as \nGovernor in my own State of Delaware. We focused on transportation \ninfrastructure. I chaired the National Governors Association for a \nyear. So I have looked at these issues nationally as well as a \nGovernor.\n  But if we look at the authorization bill--again, that is one of the \ntwo parts of our legislation, to authorize programs. A lot of what we \ndid in the Senate, coupled with what they did in the House, was pretty \ndarn good. I was very proud of it. I want to give shout-outs to some of \nmy colleagues, including Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe.\n\n[[Page S7803]]\n\nI don't always think of them as two people who work well together, but \non transportation and infrastructure, they do. They provide very good \nleadership, and they were good enough to let the rest of us join in. I \nthink we had a good policy or set of policies that we can be proud of. \nI will just run through a couple of them here, using of this chart.\n  I have made a big focus on freight transportation. It is not just \npeople who use roads, highways, bridges, and transit to get places, but \nwe move an enormous amount of freight in this country. We move it on \nbarges--actually, I don't know how many people think of that--or ships. \nWe move a fair amount on airplanes. We move a fair amount on trains. We \nalso move a great deal of our freight by roads, highways, and bridges.\n  The legislation we passed out of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee on I believe a unanimous vote makes good progress on the \nfreight transportation side, trying to make our roads, highways, and \nbridges more reliable, more affordable, and more efficient. That is \ngood.\n  The legislation we passed out of committee, which I think is mirrored \nin the House Transportation bill, is that we prioritized bridge safety. \nI think something like one out of every four bridges in our country, \ndeemed so by people a lot smarter than me, are not safe. So in our \nlegislation, we focused on bridge safety and we focused on large \nfacilities, large projects of national importance--not little projects \nbut big ones of national importance, regional importance.\n  The Transportation authorization legislation from the House and from \nthe Senate also increases baseline funding and funding for public \ntransportation. And it focuses on clean air funding toward the most \ndangerous diesel emissions to increase the bang for the buck, if you \nwill. If you ever go by road projects, highway or bridge projects and \ntransit projects, you will often see this yellow equipment that is \nalmost always powered by diesel, and they put out--those vehicles put \nout a lot of pollution. We provide some money here in the authorization \nlegislation to say that can't be good for us. It can't be good for the \npeople who work around there and live around there. Let's see if we \ncan't get some reduction in those emissions.\n  The other thing I liked about our authorization bill is research \ngrants that go to States to see if we can't find a better alternative \nto user fees, which we have historically traditionally used, and to \neventually replace the gas tax or something that makes more sense. It \ncould be something called a road user charge, it could be tolling in \nconjunction with public-private partnerships, but just to look at the \nalternatives to user fees like the gas tax and diesel tax, which has \nnot been raised for 22 years.\n  Let's see what we have next. The last time we raised the user fees in \nthis country--part of me wishes I could be doing this speech surrounded \nby former Presidents who have supported the use of user fees. I think \nwe go back a long time, actually, when I was a little kid, before the \nPresiding Officer was born. Dwight Eisenhower, the President who \nbrought us the State highway system, was an advocate of user fees. \nSince then we have had other Presidents--let me think of another \nPresident who thought that was a--Bill Clinton thought user fees were \nappropriate. I want to say George Herbert Walker Bush might have been \none who thought that things that are worth having--that folks who use \nour roads, highways, and bridges ought to pay for it. I think there \nmight have been one more. Ronald Reagan supported that notion as well. \nSo in a bipartisan way, Democrats and Republicans have said for a long \ntime that if we really want to have a better transportation system, we \nhave to pay for it.\n  The idea is that folks who use that system and the businesses that \nuse that transportation system have some responsibility to pay for it. \nThat has been the way we have done it for a long time. Maybe someday, \nwhen we have the ability to do these vehicle-miles-traveled deals, \nwhere we don't have to worry about privacy concerns, figure out how \nmany miles every car, truck, van in the country travels and be able to \nassess a user fee--I don't know if we are going to be able to do it. We \nhave been trying for a long time. Maybe somebody will be able to do it, \nbut concerns have been raised about doing that as well.\n  Anyway, since 1993, what has been happening? Maintenance costs \ncontinue to rise. We raised the gas tax in 1993 to 18.3 cents per \ngallon. We raised the Federal tax on diesel to I think 24.3 cents. What \nhas happened in the last 22 years, believe it or not, is the cost of \nconcrete has gone up a lot. The cost of asphalt has gone up a lot. The \ncost of steel and the cost of labor has gone up a lot. And the gas tax \nand the diesel tax have stayed right where they were 22 years ago.\n  The gas tax has lost almost 40 percent of its purchasing power--18.3 \ncents in 1993 is today worth about a dime. I think the 24.3 cent diesel \ntax is now worth somewhere between 10 and 15 cents. We have done \nnothing about it. We have not even been willing to consider indexing \nthese user fees to the rate of inflation.\n  Has the highway trust fund eroded? Not everybody knows we have a \nhighway or transportation trust fund. We do. Not everybody understands \nit is largely fed by user fees. Not everybody understands that when we \nrun out of money in the transportation trust fund, we have to--if we \nare going to still build roads, highways, bridges, and transit systems, \nwe have to do something about it. What we oftentimes do is we move \nmoney from the general fund for our country and move that money over to \nfill up the transportation trust fund or the highway fund. When we run \nout of money in the general fund, we go around the world with a tin cup \nin hand and borrow money from all kinds of people, including the \nChinese. We say: We would like to borrow some money from you, and, by \nthe way, we don't want you to be mucking around in the South China Sea \nand all those other places where I used to fly around. We don't want \nyou to be inflating your currency. We don't want you to be dumping your \nstuff on the American markets.\n  And the Chinese say: Well, we thought you wanted to borrow money, so \nget off our backs.\n  We don't want to be in that situation.\n  There is a growing need for road repair, as I mentioned earlier. One \nout of four bridges is bad. Two out of every 10 miles of highway \nsurfaces are not good.\n  We have vehicles that are more fuel efficient. That is a good thing. \nWe adopted CAFE legislation, and Senator Feinstein was good enough to \nlet some of us help her write that. But probably over the next 10 years \nor so we are going to continue to require more energy-efficient \nvehicles.\n  There has been a reduction in the annual miles driven. A lot of the \nmillennial generation don't want to have a car. I remember as a kid \ngrowing up--maybe the Presiding Officer growing up couldn't wait to \nhave and drive a car. That sure was my generation.\n  We have an aging system that needs to be addressed. In the face of \ncongressional inaction, what have we done to pay for our transportation \nsystem? Well, we use budget gimmicks. We are pretty good at pension \nsmoothing. Our pensions must be pretty smooth, because we have used \nthat. We have used unrelated offsets to pay for some. Say, for example, \nmonies that go to TSA to supposedly provide for safer travel in our \nairlines and airways, we are going to use that money instead to go into \ntransportation--money that should be used to strengthen our ability to \nmonitor traffic coming across our borders, a lot of vehicular traffic, \na lot of trade. We are going to raise those Customs fees, but we are \nnot going to use it to build up our defenses along our border and other \nstuff that probably has no relationship with transportation. That is \nwhat we have done--gimmicks.\n  It is not an easy thing to think about, but these are some numbers \nthat we ought to look at. We bailed out the transportation trust fund \nin 2008 to the tune of $8 billion. We bailed it out again in 2009, $7 \nbillion; the next year, 2010, almost $20 billion; 2013, over $6 \nbillion; and we really got into the bailout business in 2014, $23 \nbillion; and for the current year, 2015, $10 billion. Add it all up, it \nis about $75 billion in bailouts. We moved money from the general fund. \nThat means we don't have money to spend on other things that are \nlegitimate needs in our country, and we are using it to pay for things \nthat ought to be actually paid for by\n\n[[Page S7804]]\n\nthe folks and businesses that use our roads, highways, and bridges.\n  Now, a lot of people are saying to me: Why should we raise the user \nfrees? Why should we raise the gas tax or the diesel tax? Because it is \nfair. The notion that people and businesses that use these roads and \nhighways and bridges ought to pay for them, to me, that seems fair. \nFrankly, it seemed fair in this country for about 60 years. We seem to \nhave gotten away from that. We need to get back to that.\n  Here are a couple of questions--or the same question asked several \ntimes. Why raise the gas tax and fix the trust fund? This is $324. What \nis that number? That is how much the average driver in this country \nspends a year in vehicle repairs, such as replacement of tires, axles, \nwheel rims--you name it. I have seen it actually as high as $500, but \nwe will take the low range of $324. We pay for it one way or the other, \nand that is how much we spend on average in vehicle repair.\n  Again, the same question: Why raise the gas tax and fix the trust \nfund? The number 42 shows up. That is because that is how many hours a \nyear we spend sitting in traffic. These are not my numbers. Every year \nTexas A updates this number, and they say that in Washington, DC, and \nup the road from where Senator Coons and I live, in New York City, \nwhere some of our family members live, or Denver or LA, it is about 82 \nhours per year sitting in traffic, wasting gas, and putting out harmful \nemissions.\n  This is the number of billions of gallons of gas we waste just \nsitting in traffic every year--2.9 billion gallons of gas a year. That \nis a lot.\n  I don't know if it is the last poster that we have, but it is not a \nbad one to close on. One of the major roles of government is to provide \na nurturing environment for job creation and job preservation. It is \nnot the main role of government, but a major role of government is to \nprovide a nurturing environment for job creation and preservation. We \ndon't create jobs. Senators, Governors, and county executives don't \ncreate jobs, no matter how talented they are. Presidents don't create \njobs. What we do is create a nurturing environment to help support job \ncreation and job growth. What does that include? A world-class \nworkforce, young people and not-so-young people coming out of colleges \nand universities who can read, write, think, and use math and \ntechnology, and who have a good work ethic--public safety and rule of \nlaw, affordable energy, affordable health care, access to foreign \nmarkets, and also the ability to move goods and products from place to \nplace in this country and through our export markets.\n  McKinsey has a piece of their operation that does consulting and it \nis called McKinsey Global Institute. They have done a little bit of \nthinking and calculating to see if we actually made robust \ninvestments--not just little investments, not just creeping from year \nto year borrowing money from the general fund but actually making \nrobust investments.\n  What would it do? We are talking about $150 to $180 billion of annual \ninvestments from all sources--State, local, and Federal--and to do this \nfor 15 to 20 years. What would it do in terms of employment and GDP? \nHere is what it would do. Those kinds of investments in our \ntransportation system would raise GDP anywhere from 1.4 to 1.8 percent \nper year. In addition to that, it would add almost 2 million jobs. Half \nof those jobs would be men and women going to work building highways, \nroads, bridges, and transit systems. We would have a more efficient \neconomy--an economy to move products and goods more effectively, more \nefficiently, and more productively.\n  We say thanks very much to the McKinsey Global Institute. If we did \nthis, a lot of people would be put to work building our roads, \nhighways, bridges, and transit systems. They haven't been working much \nbecause we have underfunded transportation investment now for years at \nthe local, State, and Federal levels. If we had funded it in a more \nappropriate and robust way, then a lot of people who have been on the \nsidelines who are either unemployed or underemployed would be doing \nsomething productive with their lives and at the same time strengthen \nour economy.\n  I see my colleague has been waiting patiently for me to finish. I \nwill close with these words. Someone said to me: How do you feel that \nthe House seems to have come up with a little bit more money?\n  We are not sure what the pay-fors are that they are using. Somehow we \nfound some magic money in the Federal Reserve, and I hope it is \nlegitimate. I hope there are no unintended consequences that we are \naware of, but we will find out about that over the next several days, I \nhope. I am not outraged.\n  I was, frankly, outraged by what we passed here a month or so ago--so \ngrossly underfunded, 3 years of not very thoughtful funding. What we \nhear from the House is that it is more robust, and I am happy to take a \nlook at that. But it is not a user fee approach. It basically doesn't \nsay: OK, those who use our highways, roads, and bridges ought to pay \nfor those. We strayed from that. It is sort of a grab bag from places \nthat have nothing to do with transportation. We are going to use that \nmoney, and it is only for a short while. We will be back in the soup \nagain in 4 or 5 years.\n  This Senator thinks we can do better than that. It is not just me who \nis disappointed. People are disappointed, but we will live to fight \nagain another day. It is too bad that we didn't take advantage of this \nday and seize the day.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, it is my desire to address the Senate \nabout a particular serious problem that faces us. I ask unanimous \nconsent that I be granted 7 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Guantanamo Bay Detention Facilities\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today regarding President Obama's \nmost recent, egregious attempt to close the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base \ndetention facilities and relocate enemy combatants, i.e., terrorists, \nto the United States.\n  Who are we talking about here when we say enemy combatants with \nregard to our national security and the problems that this may pose? We \nstill have some high-level terrorists at Gitmo. It reminds me of the \nfive terrorists that we let out sometime ago in exchange for a Sgt. \nBergdahl. These are high-level terrorists. Khalid Shaikh Mohammed we \nknow is the mastermind of 9/11. Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, the USS Cole \nbomber. I was a member of the Intelligence Committee when that \nhappened, and I was concerned that we didn't connect the dots with \nregards to our national security and our national safety. That \ncertainly was the case. We have Hambali, who is the Bali bomber. We \nhave four coconspirators with Khalid with regards to 9/11--Ramzi bin \nal-Shibh, Mustafa Ahmed al Hawsawi, Abd al Aziz Ali, and Walid bin \nAttash.\n  These are folks that are still determined to do great harm to the \nUnited States. I don't think they changed their minds.\n  The President's determined effort to close Gitmo began his first days \nin office when he signed Executive Order 13492, requiring the close of \nGitmo within 1 year. Fortunately, for the security of the United \nStates, the Congress stood up to this Executive order and stopped it, \nand the President's attempt to close Gitmo was also met by strong \nobjections from all across the country, even in his home State of \nIllinois. Illinois turned its back on a plan to transfer detainees to a \nstate-run prison, the Thompson Correctional Facility.\n  More importantly, the Congress laid down its first marker on \nprohibiting the President from transferring or releasing detainees to \nthe United States through the Supplemental Appropriations Act passed in \nJune of 2009. Every year since then--7 years--the Congress has \nmaintained this prohibition.\n  This year's National Defense Authorization Act continues to enforce \nthe will of the American people and the Congress. Yet just yesterday \nthe President's Press Secretary announced blithely that the President \nis not bound by Congress--and I would include the American people--and \nthe President will do what he wants to do by another Executive order if \nhe determines that is the best approach.\n  National Security Advisor Susan Rice has just been quoted as saying: \n``I\n\n[[Page S7805]]\n\ncan't say with certainty that we're 100 percent going to get there, but \nI can tell you we're going to die trying.'' That is a pretty bold \nstatement.\n  What the President wants to do doesn't equate with national security. \nI think he wants to fulfill his campaign promise and preserve his \nalleged legacy and simply close Gitmo, not taking a hard look at what \nmay take place.\n  Now I have gone head-to-head with this administration on many issues \nbut none are as close to my strong belief and commitment to protect the \nUnited States, the people of Kansas, and all Americans. It does not \nmake sense to locate terrorists at Fort Leavenworth, KS, which is the \nintellectual center of the Army, and to pose a threat to that \ncommunity. I have often said that the first obligation of any Member of \nCongress is to protect our national security. Allowing Gitmo terrorists \nto set foot in the United States is in direct violation, in my view, of \nthat commitment, and we should not stand for this President or any \nfuture President to threaten our security by Executive order.\n  It is regrettable that I have to be here making this speech at all in \nresponse to the administration and the news that suddenly appears in \nthe Nation's press that there were people visiting Colorado, Fort \nLeavenworth, and Charleston, SC.\n  In September, in response to the administration's visit to Kansas, I \nplaced a hold on the administration's nominee to serve as Secretary of \nthe Army. I don't like doing this. I have no personal bias whatsoever \nwith regard to this person politically or the ability to do the job. I \ndid so with purpose and respect. I articulated this to the Army. I \narticulated this to my good friend and colleague John McHugh, who was \nthe Secretary of Army, to the Department of Defense and the Secretary \nof Defense. During my conversations I was reminded that the \nadministration could not implement any parts of this study without \nexplicit authorization from Congress. So if and when a study is \nproduced--if there is a plan, and we don't know if there is a plan--the \nadministration would come before Congress to ask for that authority and \nthe money. Guess what; no money can be spent on that. So it seems to me \nthat is already a violation.\n  The administration's threat to act by Executive order yesterday \nspeaks to the exact opposite of the understanding that I have. Congress \nhas listened to the American people and done what is necessary to \nuphold national security and prohibit this administration from behaving \nin an unleashed fashion.\n  I know the President is resolute. He reminded us of that fact by \nsigning 223 Executive orders during his Presidency. It is not so much \nthe number of Executive orders but Executive orders that are in direct \nviolation or in opposition to the intent of the Congress.\n  I just don't think this should be determined by ignoring the Congress \nand simply issuing an Executive order. That is not the way to go. It \njust raises all this dust in opposition, and people like me come to the \nfloor extremely worried about what this could bring.\n  I remember before 9/11, when I made the statement that the oceans no \nlonger protected us. Our threat level remains high today. The threat of \nISIS grows, stability in Syria continues to erode, Russia is advancing \nin the Middle East, and Iran continues to churn its nuclear reactors.\n  We cannot, it seems to me, we must not act politically. We must not \ntake action simply because of ``legacy'' and a political campaign \npromise. Instead, we must act conscientiously. The only conscientious \nway forward on this issue is to maintain detention at Guantanamo Bay. \nTo do otherwise would be a violation of U.S. law, not to mention a \nbull's-eye on Fort Leavenworth, where we have the intellectual center \nof the Army and the Army Command and General Staff College. That is not \nwise. That does not make any sense.\n  Let me say that there is another issue the President has brought up, \nand that is the issue of recruitment. We hear this from people who \nhonestly believe that if we close Gitmo, somehow it will take away the \nincentive for various terrorist groups to recruit other terrorists from \nthis country and all across Europe, all around the world, saying: Oh my \ngoodness, we have terrorists at Gitmo, and when will the United States \nclose that so that we can close our recruiting?\n  If we have terrorists located in the United States, it seems to me \nthat the recruiting would simply be this: All right, Gitmo is closed, \nbut we have our brothers at Fort Leavenworth, we have our brothers in \nCharleston, and we have our brothers in Colorado. What do you think \nwould happen with regard to what they would do in response to that, not \nonly to recruit people but to act? This goes back to the welfare of all \nAmericans, not to mention those in Colorado, Kansas, and South \nCarolina. This is a bad idea--a very bad idea.\n  I hope those of us in the Congress will maintain our vigilance and \nmake sure that no money will ever be authorized or appropriated with \nregard to taking terrorists from Gitmo and locating them in the United \nStates. We must not do it. It is the wrong decision. It is a bad \ndecision. I don't know why the President is so stubborn about it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                      National Apprenticeship Week\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise today to shine a spotlight on \napprentices, one of our Nation's oldest forms of education and still \none of the smartest investments we can make as a nation. The week we \nare in the middle of right now--this very week--is National \nApprenticeship Week. I am honored to be joined today by Senator \nFranken, who will also be making remarks in support of the value of \napprenticeships.\n  In this body, we often discuss the importance, the value of expanding \nearly childhood education, strengthening our public schools, and making \ncollege more affordable. Indeed, these investments are critical, but \nlet's not forget about what I call the other 4-year degree. It is a \ndegree that guarantees you a well-paying job and a career path after \ngraduation. It is a degree that gives you experience that employers \ndemand and teaches you skills that last a lifetime. It is a degree that \nprovides a paycheck even while you are still in school. And it is a \ndegree that leaves you debt-free. But where is the catch? Well, you \nmight have to wake up early every day. You might have to work on nights \nand weekends. You will definitely have to complete thousands of hours \nof hands-on on-the-job training and 4, 5, or more years of work in your \ntrade. In many apprenticeship programs, if you miss even a few days of \nwork, that is it, you are done. On-the-job training, years of work \nexperience, and a limited number of absences does not sound like a \ntypical college curriculum, and it is not. It is an apprenticeship.\n  Broadly defined, apprenticeships are programs that train workers in \nhighly skilled occupations by providing instruction and on-the-job \ntraining. After apprentices complete their programs, they receive \njourneyman papers and are set up for a job with the employer, the \nunion, or the association that sponsored the program. These programs \nare long, challenging, and competitive. An appropriate question at the \noutset is, Do they work?\n  Well, ask Ed Woodrum, an instructor at the Carpenters Joint \nApprenticeship Center in New Castle, DE. Ed tells the story of Scotty. \nScotty is a Delawarean who was literally living on the streets, \ndestitute, who was blessed to land an opportunity through the Challenge \nProgram, a not-for-profit rehabilitation and skills organization in \nWilmington which I know well and have always supported and have enjoyed \nseeing the impact of their work, both the materials they introduce and \nthe impacts on the lives of the young men and women they train.\n  The Carpenters have a partnership with the Challenge Program, and \nthrough that relationship Scotty began working as an apprentice with \nthe Carpenters. Fast-forward to today, years later, and Scotty is still \na journeyman with the Carpenters. He recently got engaged, he owns a \ncar, and he is living in a townhouse in Wilmington. So do \napprenticeship programs work? In Scotty's case, it transformed his \nlife.\n  If you want to know if they really work, ask Jim Maravelias with \nLaborers Local 199, also from Delaware. The laborers apprenticeship \nprogram requires 4,000 hours in the field and at least five core \nclasses in heavy construction, although most apprentices take over a \ndozen classes in that time. Jim has seen his laborers journey men and \nwomen go on to leadership and\n\n[[Page S7806]]\n\nmanagement roles in construction as foremen or shop stewards or \nbusiness agents. Jim knows how important apprenticeships are not only \nfor the construction industry but for the lives and futures of the \nDelawareans who are so deeply affected positively by their \napprenticeship experience. As Jim puts it, through these apprentices, \n``we offer them a career, not just a job.''\n  So do apprenticeship programs work? Ask Tony Papili, my friend from \nthe Glasgow area who runs the Plumbers and Pipefitters Local 74. Fresh \nout of college with a traditional bachelors's degree, Pip went back to \nschool as an apprentice. Today Pip know from firsthand experience how \nvaluable apprenticeship programs are, which is why Local 74 trains \nfitters, plumbers, HVAC service technicians, welders, and instrument \ntechnicians. Local 74's program is no cakewalk. Once an applicant is \naccepted, they are committed to 5 years of night classes, on top of the \n8,500 hours they will spend in the field learning their trade before \nbecoming a journeyman.\n  Apprenticeship programs are not just difficult, they are competitive \ntoo. Take the program at the IBEW 313 in New Castle, DE, of which Doug \nDrummond is one of the leaders and a trustee. The IBEW's apprenticeship \nprogram is the largest in Delaware today with 120 active apprentices. \nEach year, 313's apprenticeship program has 2,500 applicants competing \nfor just 1 of 24 open spots. That is a 1-percent acceptance rate.\n  The fitters, the electricians, and the carpenters in these programs \nare just some of the 1,100 Delawareans actively working through \napprenticeship programs with lots of different businesses, unions, and \norganizations. Last year, my home State saw 119 apprentices complete \ntheir programs and get their journeyman papers. So far, 109 have gotten \ntheir papers this year, and we want to see these numbers continue to \nsteadily rise.\n  Right now, across the entire country, over 440,000 aspiring \njourneymen are working through apprenticeship programs, knowing that if \nthey put in the time and effort, they will earn an opportunity to \nunlock a steady, high-paying job. On average, the starting salary for \nan apprentice is $50,000, which is several thousand dollars more than \nthe average starting salary for a college graduate with a bachelor's \ndegree, and typically there is no debt for an apprentice.\n  The benefits of apprenticeship programs are sustainable. Over the \ncourse of their career, American workers who complete an apprenticeship \nprogram can expect to earn $300,000 more than their peers who don't go \nthrough a comparable program. If that is not the ticket to the middle \nclass, I don't what is.\n  I want to commend today the 150,000 employers across this whole \ncountry who host apprentices, who partner with apprenticeship programs. \nBusinesses are not doing it as a public service; they are investing in \napprenticeships because they typically get $1.50 in return for every $1 \nthey invest. Tony Papili and the members of Local 74 pay for their own \napprenticeship program out of pocket. They take money that would \notherwise go to a pay raise or their benefits and put it back into the \nprogram. The electricians at Local 313 put in over 1 million hours of \nwork a year, and for every hour they work, they put 55 cents back into \ntheir apprenticeship program. These are significant investments. More \nimportantly, they are smart investments that are helping to fill a much \nneeded gap in the American workforce with high-quality, high-paying \njobs and by helping train workers for skilled trades and the vital \nmanufacturing jobs of this century.\n  Strengthening America's 21st-century workforce is essential to the \ncompetitiveness of our economy in the world today and to the continued \nrevitalization of our manufacturing sector. That is why it is one of \nthe four core pillars of the Manufacturing Jobs for America Initiative, \nwhich includes a number of additional proposals to strengthen career \ndevelopment and on-the-job training programs.\n  Last year's reauthorization of the Workforce Innovation and \nOpportunity Act, which was a real win for job-training programs across \nthe country, included five different policy ideas, many of them \nbipartisan, which came from the Manufacturing Jobs for America \nInitiative. I would like to see this momentum continue by making a \nsustained commitment to expanding apprenticeship programs.\n  The thousands of hours of on-the-job experience produce journeymen \nwith a keen understanding of the techniques and the tools they need to \ndo their jobs, and it makes them safer, more skilled, and more \nproductive employees. Employers know this too. Electrical contractors \nin Delaware are hiring journeyman straight out of the IBEW's \napprenticeship program because they know they are well trained, well \nequipped, and ready to work. Same for the pipefitters.\n  Pip said he is training apprentices to be ``smarter and better \nskilled than the last generation,'' but he adds, ``I don't think people \nrealize what we do to train these young men and women to become \njourneymen in the field.'' Pip is right. That is why after I get off \nthe 5 o'clock train I am taking home to Wilmington tonight, my first \nstop will be a trade and apprenticeship open house at Delcastle High \nSchool.\n  I urge my colleagues to learn about the apprenticeship programs in \nyour States. Go and visit employers who depend on apprentices and talk \nto your constituents who have gone through these programs. I know you \nwill be impressed.\n  Too often we define ``education'' too narrowly here. We talk about \neducation as a ticket to the middle class, but we often don't include \napprenticeship programs. That has to change. Apprenticeship programs \nwork.\n  Ed Woodrum with the Carpenters sees it as simple math. He describes \napprenticeship programs as ``opportunity plus resources plus support \nwhich equals changed lives.'' Ed is right.\n  That is why I am so proud to join Senator Franken in cosponsoring \nSenator Murray's bipartisan resolution honoring the inaugural National \nApprenticeship Week this week. I am also proud to join President Obama \nand Delaware's own Vice President Joe Biden in support of their goal to \ndouble the number of apprenticeships in 5 years--a goal all of us \nshould share. I especially want to recognize and thank the Vice \nPresident for his effective and long leadership in reviewing our \nNation's job-training programs and finding ways to meaningfully improve \nthem.\n  I commend the administration's efforts to expand access to registered \napprenticeships to make it easier for apprentices to turn their \nexperience into college credit. Besides apprenticeships, there are very \nfew other Federal programs we know that are estimated to return $27 in \neconomic productivity for every dollar we invest. Budgets are tight \ntoday, and we are all looking for smart, cost-effective investments \nthat create jobs and that can help revitalize manufacturing. That is \nwhy apprenticeship programs deserve our continued support.\n  Before I yield the floor, I want to thank my colleague Senator \nFranken for his passionate, engaged, and sustained leadership on making \nsure that community colleges and apprenticeship programs work for the \nworking men and women of this country and help create new opportunities \nfor manufacturing jobs that are high-skill, high-wage, and high-quality \nfor folks all over this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I would like to return the kind words of \nmy colleague from Delaware and thank him for his leadership in this \nwhole field of manufacturing and filling the skills gap that we see all \nover this country and getting young people and getting people in \nmidcareer trained up to do jobs that manufacturers and people in the IT \nindustry and other industries need to fill.\n  I rise today to recognize the very first week of November as the very \nfirst ever National Apprenticeship Week. I want to talk a little bit \nabout the benefits of apprenticeship training programs, about what I \nhear in my State of Minnesota, and about my bill, the Community College \nto Career Fund Act, which would expand apprenticeship training programs \nthrough partnerships between employers and community and technical \ncolleges.\n  When I travel around my State--and I am sure the Presiding Officer \nhears\n\n[[Page S7807]]\n\nthis in Louisiana as well--I hear over and over again that employers \nare desperate to hire good people with the right skills for jobs that \npay well.\n  Today there are over 6,500 open manufacturing jobs in my State. And \nother sectors such as IT, health care--and mechanics for the aerospace \nindustry, for airplanes--these sectors in our economy are experiencing \nsimilar problems. They cannot find workers with the necessary training \nand the right skills to fit jobs that are there. These jobs are there. \nThis is what is called the skills gap. I am sure that my friend, the \nPresiding Officer from Louisiana, sees the skills gap in his State as \nwell.\n  One Minnesota employer, Kimberly Arrigoni of Haberman Machine in \nOakdale, MN, put it this way:\n\n       For my company specifically it no longer is a capacity \n     issue because of equipment, but one with people. We are \n     limited in what we can produce and ship out the door. . . . \n     Imagine what this very ripple effect is causing my state and \n     our country as a whole.\n\n  She is right, by the way. I visited Haberman Machine, and it is a \nvery good precision machine tooling company. It is a family-owned \nbusiness, and it is great. They have jobs they want to fill, but people \naren't being trained up fast enough.\n  There are many registered apprenticeship programs nationwide in more \nthan 1,000 occupations that prepare workers with the skills they need \nfor tomorrow's jobs, yet they don't get the support they need. I have a \nbill that would address that and provide that support. My bill, the \nCommunity College to Career Fund Act, would encourage apprenticeship \ntraining programs by supporting public-private partnerships among \ncommunities, technical colleges, and businesses. These partnerships \ncreate job-training programs that provide direct hiring opportunities \nfor students, and they give businesses the trained workforce they \ndesperately need at little or no cost to the student. Programs such as \nthe one supported by my bill will help employers fill available jobs, \nthey will help students get those jobs and graduate with very little or \nno college debt, and they help our economy stay competitive globally. \nThis is a win, win, win.\n  Labor Secretary Tom Perez has described apprenticeship programs as \ncollege ``without the debt'' or ``earn while you learn.''\n  In Minnesota we have many great examples of such programs. I want to \ntalk a little bit about one of them.\n  Erick Ajax is the co-owner of EJ Ajax Metalforming Solutions in \nFridley, MN. This is the third generation of Ajaxes. It was Ajax and \nSon, but the son, I think, is too old to be called a son anymore. Erick \nis third generation.\n  They make 70 percent of North America's appliance hinges. His company \nhas over 70 employees--one for every percent, evidently, of our \nappliance industry. Half of his employees were trained, hired, and had \ntheir college tuitions fully paid through his earn while you learn \nregistered apprenticeship program. To do this, Erick partnered with \nlocal community and technical colleges to find and train students, \nincluding veterans, women, first-generation Americans, and ex-\noffenders.\n  I went to his factory floor, and he introduced me to an ex-offender \nwho had been working there at EJ Ajax for 6 years. He just bought his \nfirst home because of a training program he had taken that had been \nmade available through a community technical college.\n  For all of these categories I am talking about, I met first-\ngeneration Americans who have great middle-class jobs, got their \ntraining, and received degrees. There was a veteran who has his \nbachelor's degree now, paid for by Erick, by the company. These are \nfull-time, high-paying, solid, middle-class jobs.\n  Because Erick fully covered college tuition for his employees, some \nof his veteran employees were able to transfer their GI bill benefits \nto their spouses and their children to help pay for them to go to \ncollege. This is a great answer to our college affordability, our \nvexing college affordability problem that we all talk about. Erick \nAjax's employees are evidence that apprenticeship training programs \nwork. They increase their career opportunities, they provide businesses \nwith skilled workers, they generate higher paying jobs, and they help \nour competitiveness globally.\n  Did you know that individuals who have completed registered \napprenticeship programs earn, on average, a starting salary of $50,000 \na year and $300,000 more over their careers than their peers who did \nnot participate in registered apprenticeship programs? In fact, the \napprenticeships can be the start of a pathway to business leadership \npositions.\n  Take Martin Senn, who is Swiss. Martin is the CEO of the Zurich \nInsurance Group, a Swiss company with offices around the world. The \nlast I checked, it was one of the Fortune 500 companies--well, \nactually, in the Fortune 200 companies in 2012. I don't know exactly \nwhere it is now, but Martin is CEO of a huge company. Like many Swiss \nexecutives, he is a believer in apprenticeship programs.\n  When he was asked why Swiss executives choose to implement \napprenticeship programs in the United States, he said: ``I started my \ncareer as an apprentice and know first-hand how powerful such a program \ncan be in inspiring young people to achieve their full potential.''\n  From apprentice to CEO, I would like to see more of these success \ncompanies involving U.S. companies here at home. Not all apprentices \nare going to become CEOs, but apprenticeship programs--their training \nprograms--are providing a proven path for workers to enter the middle \nclass and for business owners to develop a high-skilled workforce to \nfill today's available jobs.\n  So as we recognize the first ever National Apprenticeship Week, I \ninvite my colleagues to take a close look at my Community College to \nCareer Fund Act. Let's expand the apprenticeship training model so we \ncan better serve the needs of our students seeking good-paying jobs and \nof our businesses looking for qualified employees.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Export-Import Bank\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, finally we see the light at the end of \nthe tunnel, and it is not a train. It is, in fact, the eventual and \nnecessary passage of the Ex-Im reauthorization bill.\n  As you know, last week the Ex-Im bill passed the House by a vote that \nwas 72 percent in favor. We have been told for months and months as we \ndebate the Ex-Im Bank that this bill could not possibly pass the House \nas a stand-alone bill. Remarkably, when that myth was put to the test, \nwe found out that not just 51 percent, but 72 percent of the House \nsupports reauthorization of the Ex-Im bill.\n  Last night we faced another challenge for the Ex-Im bill which was, \nin fact, a series of amendments on the Ex-Im portion of the \nTransportation bill. Once again, we exceeded expectations by having \nsupermajorities on almost--in fact, all of these amendments suffering \ndefeat at a very wide margin. So now what we know is we have a bill \nthat continues to have broad-based support and continues to represent \nthe necessary steps that need to be taken to reauthorize and reopen the \nEx-Im Bank.\n  Let's just recount history. The Export-Import Bank has been closed \nfor over 3 months, preventing needed support for small business across \nthe country. Many of those small businesses--guess where they are? They \nare in States such as North Dakota. A lot of people, such as my \ncolleague from Washington State who has come on the floor--I think \neverybody understands the significance of exports to States on the \nPacific Rim and understands that story, but I don't think anyone really \nthinks about the Ex-Im Bank in conjunction with places such as North \nDakota. So I wish to take a few moments today to talk about small \nbusiness, to talk about the people who have been dramatically affected \nby the closure of the Ex-Im Bank and why it is so important that we \nunderstand, appreciate, and not have a long-term history that does not \nmove the Ex-Im Bank forward.\n\n[[Page S7808]]\n\n  Let's start out by talking about the 5,800 small businesses around \nthe country that depend on the Export-Import Bank to finance export \ndeals and how many of them right now have no support as this issue has \nlanguished in the Senate. I think we all know that small business makes \nup a large percentage of that economic opportunity in the United \nStates. That is true in North Dakota and true to a greater extent \nbecause probably 95 percent of all employers in North Dakota qualify as \nsmall businesses. For many of these businesses, if they do not have \nhelp exporting their products, that help, which the Export-Import Bank \nprovides, they can't grow. With more than 95 percent of all consumers \nin the world living outside the United States, if businesses in the \nUnited States do not export, if they are not competitive, we will lose \neconomically.\n\n  Several of my colleagues have been on the floor talking about \nmanufacturing and talking about economic opportunity. At the end of the \nday this is about small business, but it is also about the jobs that \nsmall business create. So we have seen companies such as GE and Boeing, \nwhich use, interestingly enough, 16 suppliers in North Dakota that are \ndependent on the work GE and Boeing does--and their necessary reaction \nto the failure of this Congress to appropriately and timely reauthorize \nthe Ex-Im Bank has been to look for other ways to encourage their \nbusiness growth, and that encouragement has not been in this country. \nThey have had to look overseas.\n  So it is critically important we understand the idea of a supply \nchain. Everybody says: Well, this is a bank for big business. This is a \nbank for these people. That is just pure nonsense. In every one of \nthose deals that is done for one of these major manufacturers, inside \nthat deal are literally thousands of small businesses and hundreds of \nthousands of jobs created in those small businesses as they support the \nsupply chain.\n  I want to talk about a number of the export-import uses in my State \nand brag a bit about the work they do because they are on the cutting \nedge with a lot of their technologies. The first business I want to \ntalk about is Amity Technology. It is a 20-year-old family-owned \ncompany based in Fargo that sells farm manufacturing equipment to \ncompanies around the world. They began in August of 1977. They sold \ntheir first business to Case International and then built Amity in the \nwinter of 1996.\n  What I love to tell about this story is these brothers--one of whom I \nwent to college with--come from the family who actually created the \nBobcat. So they have been entrepreneurs, they have been inventors, they \nhave been innovators, and they have driven a lot of jobs in North \nDakota.\n  Amity is a big user of the Ex-Im Bank. It is the largest distributor \nof sugar beet equipment, working with some of the world's largest farm \nequipment companies around the world. With agriculture markets slowing \ndown, business is harder to come by and so it is particularly important \nthey have all the tools in their arsenal. Without the help of the \nExport-Import Bank, the company, which employs 70 North Dakotans, could \nquickly lose out on at least 10 percent of their business and face \ntough questions about the future of their exports.\n  The next business I want to talk about is WCCO Belting in Wahpeton. \nWahpeton is a small community in the far southeastern corner of our \nState. It is a 60-year-old, family-owned rubber supply company often \nused in farm equipment that is supplied to every major farm equipment \ncompany in the world.\n  For 12 years, the Export-Import Bank has allowed WCCO Belting to \ncontinue to export opportunities it had previously been ignoring. The \nBank has supported over $850,000 in exports from the belting company \nsince 2007. The company employs 200 employees who generate more than 60 \npercent of their annual revenue from customers that are located outside \nof the United States. That would not be possible if it were not for the \nEx-Im Bank; if that 60 percent of their business is driven by the \nopportunity that the Ex-Im Bank gives them.\n  I want to talk about JM Grain. That is a small grain company in \nGarrison. They are a young family-owned pea, lentil, and chickpea \ndistributing company that supplies their products to top packaging and \nfood companies around the world. When you look at their numbers, $15 \nmillion--in fact, 70 percent of the company's annual revenue for almost \na decade--has been backed by the Ex-Im Bank. It has allowed JM Grain to \npursue export opportunities to top manufacturing and packaging food \ningredient companies that demand buyers to provide financing for 90 to \n100 days--something they could not do on their own.\n  Incidentally, they could not find a private bank that would be \nwilling to do it. Without the Export-Import Bank, JM Grain would not \nhave been able to pursue exports to such high-quality, high-selling \ncompanies because it would have to significantly cut its price or risk \ngoing under.\n  The company now has doubled or tripled the pay of its workers, \nretaining its workforce throughout the oil boom, which has been awfully \ntough in North Dakota given high living costs, and has been able to \nhire top technological workers. It is incredible. It is an incredible \nstory, but it is a story that would not be possible without the Ex-Im \nBank. It is responsible for $10 million of the company's annual $15 \nmillion in revenue. Without the Export-Import Bank, the company would \nrisk losing sales to competitive exporting companies abroad, including \ncompanies from India, China, and South America.\n  The last company I want to talk about is Equipment Wholesalers based \nin Fargo, ND, and Sioux Falls, SD. They sell equipment such as John \nDeere tractors in the United States and abroad. Equipment wholesalers \ntold us if the Export-Import Bank is not reauthorized, it will have a \nnegative impact on the company's sales. How great is that? Well, it \nwill be a 35- to 40-percent impact on their sales. Imagine that. Just \nbecause of the inactivity of Congress, we have risked 35 to 40 percent \nof this company's business. The company acknowledges it has already \nlost business to companies in Germany that have access to Germany's \nexport-import agency. They say without the Export-Import Bank being \nreauthorized, Equipment Wholesalers will lose even more business.\n  While our businesses are left at a disadvantage because the Export-\nImport Bank expired, foreign--foreign--export-import banks, including \nthose in India and China and 60 other places around the world, are \nhugely benefiting. In fact, they are wondering what is going on in the \nUnited States, but we are not going to let any grass grow under our \nfeet as we run to daylight and a take advantage of the inaction in \nWashington, DC. They are already stepping in and filling our place.\n  If we do not reauthorize the Export-Import Bank to support American \nbusinesses and manufacturers, China and India will step in. There is no \ndoubt about it. They are already doing it. In fact, during the recent \ndownturn in both of those economies, the first investment they made was \nputting billions more in their export credit agencies. Do you know why? \nBecause it made business sense. It made sense to their balance of \ntrade. It made sense to their economy to support their manufacturers, \nespecially in an environment where we weren't supporting ours.\n  Last week my bipartisan bill with Senator Kirk, which would \nreauthorize this agency, passed with the support of more than 70 \npercent of the House. Just yesterday--again, I will repeat--the Export-\nImport Bank reauthorization was attached to the House Transportation \nbill. Despite efforts to once again derail the Export-Import Bank from \npeople who believed they could kill it altogether with amendments, over \ntwo-thirds--and in most cases those same House Members who tried to \nkill it--voted against those Export-Import Bank-killing amendments.\n  Doesn't that tell us something? Doesn't that tell us that the vast \nmajority of people here are not ideologues; that they look at the \nfacts? They say: In what world would you not support exports?\n  We used to do this in State government when I was attorney general \nand when I served on the Industrial Commission. We would talk about \nNorth Dakota's economy and we would say: What do we do to grow \neconomies? We say: We have new wealth creation. I am not picking on \nretail businesses. Retail businesses typically, unless we are inviting \nCanadians, which we do, to come\n\n[[Page S7809]]\n\ndown and spend money, they are not new wealth creation. It is those \nthings that bring new dollars to our State. If you look at new wealth \ncreation in this country and look at what creates wealth in this \ncountry, guess what it is. It is exports. It is having a favorable \nbalance of trade. It is making sure we are a country that believes in \nreaching out to the 95 percent of the consumers in this world and \nsaying to them: We produce the best quality agricultural products, we \nproduce the best quality manufacturing products, we are the top \nsupplier and the most trusted source of products in the world, but we \nneed the tools to make those sales, and the Ex-Im Bank is a critical \ntool. It is part of that structure of trade infrastructure that we need \nto make this work.\n  I hope, I sincerely hope--because I don't know whether I am going to \nbe here when we go through this again--I hope the lessons of the last 3 \nmonths have been learned. I hope the lessons we have been preaching \nsince really this spring--that we cannot let this Bank expire and there \nwill be dire consequences if we do--have been learned and that the Ex-\nIm Bank and the people at the Ex-Im Bank, but more importantly that our \nAmerican businesses that rely on the Export-Import Bank, our jobs that \nrely on the Export-Import Bank, and our opportunities created by the \nExport-Import Bank, are never forgotten; that they are never left \nbehind.\n  Once again we have cleared yet another hurdle. The light is at the \nend of the tunnel. We believe we are ready, willing, and excited about \nthe opportunity of once again opening the doors of the Export-Import \nBank and welcoming American business in and saying once again, \n``America is open for business'' to the rest of the world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to my friend from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota \nfor coming to the floor again to talk about the Export-Import Bank and \ntoday specifically outlining how this program of credit insurance helps \nfinance the sales of U.S. products in overseas markets, particularly \nfor small businesses.\n  She and I, obviously, are stalwarts on what are economic \nopportunities in a global economy. We want to make things in the United \nStates of America and we want to sell them to overseas markets. So we \nare here today to thank our House colleagues for standing up and \ndefeating amendments last night that would kill the Export-Import Bank \nas a part of a package in the transportation deal. We are proud of \nthose Senators who have supported this in the Senate, but we are \nespecially proud of those House Members who went to the extent of \ngetting a discharge petition to demonstrate that 313 Members of the \nHouse of Representatives support this policy.\n  My colleague and I are not giving up on trying to emphasize to people \nwe have waited way too long to get this done and now we should not wait \none moment longer. We should make sure this part of a transportation \nbill--while not necessarily our choice for how this gets done--finally \ngets over the finish line so we can put our small businesses back to \nwork.\n  As my colleague said, small businesses are the key to her State's \neconomy. Well, they are really the key to the U.S. economy. Fifty \npercent of all U.S. jobs are provided by small businesses. So that is \nwhy we have talked about this issue as it relates to those job \nproviders.\n  If you are in North Dakota and Washington State and you are growing \nan agricultural product, you show me the bank that is going to finance \nthat sale. I know maybe people don't think about agricultural products \nwhen it comes to Ex-Im Bank, but that is exactly what we have in mind \nbecause our States produce so many agricultural products.\n  The fact is small businesses need global customers. Why? Because if \nwe are just going to grow product for the United States of America, we \nare not going to be growing much job opportunity. Ninety-five percent \nof consumers live outside the United States, and we want to make sure \nwe are selling to them, but when we are selling to a country in Africa \nor we are selling to a country in Asia and you go to that bank in North \nDakota or even in Walla Walla, WA, or someplace, and you say: Listen, I \nwant you to help me do a deal with this buyer in a very small country, \nthey want to know, what the securitization is. The securitization of \nthat issue is usually all the capital of that company, which means they \nare not going to do the sale or they are going to try to find a bank \nthat is also not going to do it because they do not have the security \nto put behind that.\n  That is why credit insurance was created--to help those sales \nactually happen. That is why this is such an important issue to small \nbusinesses. People think, well, OK, we get it, you are concerned about \njobs. This is not just about the jobs in our State today, although we \ncare immensely about that; this is about the way the Senator from North \nDakota and I view the economy of the future. We view it as an economy \nthat is taking opportunity of what is happening with the growth of the \nmiddle class outside the United States, that and selling them U.S.-made \nand U.S.-grown products.\n\n  Less than 3 percent of small businesses today are exporters. How are \nwe going to get them to be exporters? We want them to take risks. How \nare we going to get them to take risks if they can't get financing for \ntheir products? If 95 percent of consumers live outside the United \nStates, that is where the rising growth is happening, that is where the \nbig opportunity is, and we want our small businesses to do something \nabout it. Yet we take away the one tool that has been there to help \nsmall businesses finance those. It was a big mistake. My colleague \ntalked about that.\n  There were more than 3,300 small business deals approved by the \nExport-Import Bank in 2014, so that was a lot of economic opportunity. \nI have met people from many of those companies. They warm my heart and \nmake me believe the United States of America can win at any economic \nopportunity it sets its mind to.\n  When I think about a Yakima company that makes music stands--\nManhasset has been in the music stand business for 40 years. They are \nselling music stands all over the United States of America. They get up \nevery morning, they go into that factory, and they try to figure out \nhow they are going to improve their processes, how they are going to \nimprove access. But if you say to them that every sale they make to an \noverseas market has to be backed with their own capital--from \nManhasset--how long will it take before someone comes in and competes \nwith them and basically knocks them off and defeats them? It is not \ngoing to take long.\n  What they have to do is constantly grow their market opportunities \nand stay ahead of technology investments, even with a music stand, the \nbest techniques, the best practices, and get your reputation as the \nbest product and advertise and continue to dominate in the marketplace. \nThat is what selling and exporting are all about.\n  The two of us come from export States, Washington State being a major \nexporter and North Dakota being an exporter. We know in our DNA that we \nhave to compete. We want our small businesses to compete, and that is \nwhy both of our States have been big users of the Export-Import Bank, \nand we want these deals.\n  In helping to support those small businesses, the Export-Import Bank \nhas done $10 billion worth of exports. Isn't this what we want? Isn't \nthis what we want in the United States of America, to help small \nbusinesses grow and become exporters? They are winning. They want their \nproducts to be purchased by overseas consumers.\n  When they don't support the Export-Import Bank, they are saying: I \nwant to make it really, really, really hard or impossible for you to \nmake that sale, because you are going to have to go find somebody to \nfinance it. And we all know that people would rather do a lot more \nfinancing of dark derivative markets than helping small businesses get \ntheir deals done.\n  We are so happy that our colleagues in the House of Representatives \nlast night defeated 10 amendments to kill the Export-Import Bank and \nthat it is now traveling over here as part of a transportation package \nthat will go to conference, and hopefully in the next 2 weeks we will \nbe able to rectify this issue and put our small businesses back to \nwork. This is so important not just\n\n[[Page S7810]]\n\nfor the companies using the Export-Import Bank today but because my \ncolleague and I know we have to grow our economy. We know we do great \nwork and we produce great products. We need to make sure that in the \ndeveloping world, we can access the opportunity to get our foot in the \ndoor and make the sale. Don't stop us from doing that. Let's finally \nget this Bank reauthorized and get on our way to growing a stronger \neconomy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I want to make one final point, along \nwith my colleague from Washington State. I don't know how many times \nthe Senator from Washington and I have been on the floor telling the \nstory of the Ex-Im Bank, about what the problems have been since we \nhave closed the Bank for business, talking about what this means for \nsmall business, trying to reflect the amazement we get from our small \nbusinesses: Why is this happening when we return money to the Treasury \nand this doesn't cost anything?\n  I find it curious that as many times as we have been down here, there \nhas been no one down here arguing the counterpoint. There has been no \none down here willing to ask us to yield for a question about why we \nbelieve what we believe about the Ex-Im Bank. There is no one down here \nchallenging what we are saying about the Ex-Im Bank. I find that \ninteresting, and I think it is a lesson maybe for the future--let's not \nmess around with jobs; let's not mess around with people.\n  I think everybody thinks they are picking on some kind of large \ncorporation, but the reality is that those large corporations in many \nways can wait this out or they can devise a business plan that gives \nthem a workaround from the Ex-Im Bank or they can assemble their \nmaterials someplace other than the United States. But my small \nbusinesses, the ones I just outlined, don't have that choice, and they \ndon't have a big line of credit they can use to just wait this out. \nThey don't have the ability to wait.\n  It is one thing to say we are all about small business and helping \nsmall business. We hear it every time. The two great lines that are \nused here: We care about the middle class and we care about small \nbusiness. But as it relates to the Ex-Im Bank, there has been no \nactivity here that would actually prove the point that we care about \nsmall business.\n  So I want to say I do find it extraordinarily curious that we have \ngone unchallenged in this whole discussion. No one really wants to take \nus on because at the end of the day there is no argument on the other \nside. Yet we have closed this Bank for over 3 months. We have closed \nthis Bank and this opportunity for America's manufacturers, America's \nsmall businesses, and all of the great people who work there.\n  Just know that I am so grateful for the work of my colleague from \nWashington. She has been an incredible leader. I thank her for \neverything she has done. She is an expert on the Export-Import Bank but \nalso a woman who has been in business most of her life and who \nunderstands the critical importance of the Ex-Im Bank.\n  So let's not unlearn this lesson. Let's make sure this never happens \nagain and that we never disrupt Americans' economic opportunity the way \nwe have by shutting down the Export-Import Bank for the last 3 or 4 \nmonths.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I ask to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Solutions to Deforestation\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I rise to talk about one of the solutions \nto one of the driving forces behind global climate change; that is, \ndeforestation. After fossil fuel combustion, deforestation is the \nsingle largest contributor to human-induced climate change, but the \nexciting thing is that we have proven cost-effective solutions at hand \nthat can go a long way in addressing this problem.\n  Forests in the United States and around the world provide important \nservices to people--services that are not adequately or appropriately \nvalued by the free market, creating a market failure. These services \ninclude many things that we all take for granted--clean air, clean \nwater, wildlife habitats, and long-term carbon sinks that absorb and \nsequester carbon pollution for years. Because these functions of a \nhealthy forest ecosystem don't have a dollar sign attached to them, \nthey are often not incorporated into decisions made by businesses, \nconsumers, and governments, but just because they don't have a pricetag \ndoes not mean they are without value. In fact, the 2008 study pegged \nthe cost of deforestation to the global economy at between $2 trillion \nand $5 trillion per year.\n  As the U.S. Forest Service put it, ``When our forests are \nundervalued, they are increasingly susceptible to development pressures \nand conversion. Recognizing forest ecosystems as natural assets with \neconomic and social value can help promote conservation and more \nresponsible decisionmaking.''\n  I agree. Adequately valuing forests, and the services they provide \noffers many benefits to local populations to the climate. Limiting \ndeforestation and forest degradation will not reduce global carbon \npollution and slow the pace of climate change. It will also help to \nsafeguard the livelihoods of the more than 1.6 billion people who the \nU.N. estimates depend on forest services.\n  What is more, tropical forests are the source of over one-quarter of \nall modern medicines. Forests impede the transmission of insect- and \nanimal-borne infectious diseases. So beyond the economic benefits, we \nknow that keeping our forests intact can improve the livelihoods of \nbillions of people while avoiding drastic increases in global \ntemperatures.\n  Thankfully there are good solutions available to address \ndeforestation. We can start by properly enforcing laws that are already \non the books. I plan on working with my colleagues to ensure that we \nfully fund the agencies charged with enforcing the ban on illegally \nsourced timber and paper included in the 2008 amendments to the Lacey \nAct.\n  When the leaders, environmental ministers, finance ministers, and \nclimate negotiators from all nations meet in Paris later this month, I \nhope they will keep in mind the many advantages of reducing forest loss \nin rainforest nations and other developing countries. I hope my \ncolleagues will recognize the crucial role that the United States can \nplay in sharing our best practices and helping to build capacity in \nthose countries so we will all be better stewards of our natural \nenvironment.\n  A changing climate brings with it a unique set of challenges, but it \nis not too late to take the necessary steps to avoid the worst impacts \nof climate change. There is good news to be had. We have at our \ndisposal a wide range of solutions for reining in our emissions of \ncarbon pollution. Addressing deforestation is one of the most effective \nand cost-effective ways to slow global warming, while enhancing the \nlives and livelihoods of the hundreds of millions of people who rely on \nforests and the services they provide.\n\n\n                            Clean Power Plan\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to talk about another aspect of climate change \nand another reason for hope. Two weeks ago the Clean Power Plan was \npublished in the Federal Register, meaning that it is now the law of \nthe land. This is the signature achievement of President Obama's \nefforts to reduce carbon pollution. It will reduce carbon emissions \nfrom the power sector by 32 percent by the year 2030. The power sector \nis the source of some of the most cost-effective emissions reductions, \nand the Clean Power Plan is the most critical and vital step toward \nputting the United States on a path to a low-carbon economy.\n  Powerplants are the largest single source of greenhouse gas emissions \nin the Nation, accounting for more than 30 percent of all U.S. carbon \npollution. There are currently no limits to the amount of carbon \npollution that can be emitted from powerplants. I want to repeat that. \nThere is no limit under the law before the Clean Power Plan to the\n\n[[Page S7811]]\n\namount of carbon pollution that can be put into the air.\n  This is despite having landmark legislation already in the books \ncalled the Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act requires the Federal \nGovernment to regulate airborne pollutants. It doesn't require or allow \nthe Federal Government to select from among a menu of airborne \npollutants and decide which ones will be most cost-effective or most \nimportant to regulate. It says the EPA is charged with taking airborne \npollutants and regulating them, to place limits on them. It is a \nmistake that over the last 20 years, even though we have recognized \nthat carbon is an airborne pollutant, that it is not regulated under \nthe Clean Air Act.\n  The Clean Power Plan fixes this problem. It is an innovative and \nflexible solution that gives States the right to develop their \nindividual plans. This is also an important point. The first iteration \nof the Clean Power Plan was a little more of a blunt instrument. It was \ngeographically constrained. It was powerplant constrained. Therefore, a \nlot of States, a lot of utility companies came back and said: Look, \nthere are going to be individual instances where it is going to be very \ndifficult to reduce carbon pollution at a particular site because it is \nrural, because it has already been capitalized, because we can't get \nthe financing to reduce the carbon pollution at a particular site, but \nif you allow us to work what they call outside of the fence and you \nallow us State by State to reduce in the aggregate the amount of carbon \npollution put into the air, then we can make this work. We can still \nhave what they call good power quality, which is to say you don't want \nundulations in power quality to the point where you have blackouts and \nbrownouts. That was industry. That was regulators. That was a public \nutilities commission. That was energy companies coming back and saying \nthis is not workable.\n  The EPA came up with a scenario where we are still regulating carbon \npollution under the Clean Air Act, but we are doing it in a way that is \ntotally workable for every State and every energy portfolio in every \nregion in every State. It gives States the rights to develop their own \nindividual plans to cut carbon pollution from the energy sector. The \nClean Power Plan has sent a signal to the rest of the world that the \nUnited States is serious about preventing catastrophic changes to our \nclimate.\n\n  The American public knows that climate change is a problem and large \nmajorities want us to act. A Stanford poll found 83 percent of \nAmericans, including 61 percent of Republicans, say that if nothing is \ndone to reduce emissions, global warming will be a serious problem in \nthe future. Now, 77 percent of Americans say the Federal Government \nshould be doing a substantial amount to combat climate change, and 67 \npercent of Americans support EPA action to curb carbon pollution.\n  In other words, 67 percent of Americans support the EPA action that \nis being undertaken right now. They support the Clean Power Plan. They \nmay not know the details, but they understand the basic premise which \nis that the Clean Air Act is the law of the land. It was passed a long \ntime ago with large bipartisan majorities. The basic idea that the \nFederal Government has some simple responsibilities, and one of them is \nto keep us safe from air and water pollution, is a bipartisan consensus \nnot in this Chamber, unfortunately, and not in the other Chamber, \nunfortunately, but across the country, everybody understands that \ncarbon is a pollutant, and we should try to reduce it over time as much \nas we possibly can.\n  I think it is time we acknowledge that the electricity industry is \nalready changing. We are rapidly moving away from fossil fuels as the \ndominant source of electricity generation. Soon even low-priced natural \ngas may not be able to compete with wind and solar energy. We should be \ncelebrating these advances and devoting ourselves to finding ways to \naccelerate this transition, not throwing up roadblocks.\n  The truth is the Clean Power Plan is merely accelerating market \ntrends that are already underway. Listen to this. Through the first 9 \nmonths of this year, over 60 percent of new U.S. capacity additions \nwere renewable energy. More than 60 percent of the new power generation \nin the United States over the last 9 months has been clean energy. That \nis the change that is happening. That is the clean energy revolution.\n  In 1998, when I was in the State legislature and I was helping to \nwork on net energy metering laws, solar tax credits, and a renewable \nportfolio standard, this was aspirational. This was something we hoped \nwe would eventually achieve, but 60 percent of new generation this year \nin the United States is clean energy. It is already happening.\n  As wind and solar prices fall, they are increasingly competitive with \nnew fossil generation in more and more places around the country. To my \ncolleagues who warn of massive price shocks from the transition to \nclean energy, I point out that we are already underway with our \ntransition, and the massive price shocks have not happened. The Clean \nPower Plan is the most important power tool that we have in our arsenal \nto fight climate change.\n  To my colleagues who are trying to stand in the way of making real \nprogress toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions, I say this: When you \nare ready to be constructive and work on a comprehensive energy policy, \nto work on a comprehensive climate policy, we are open.\n  I have continued to come to the floor of the Senate over the last \nseveral months, over the year of 2015, and have said this is an issue \nthat has unfortunately become incredibly partisan. This is an issue \nwhere we have Democrats coming to the floor offering constructive \nsolutions and an empty side of the Chamber on the other side, but this \nis the challenge of our generation. This is our obligation as the \nindispensable Nation. The United States has to lead. The Senate has to \nhave a real debate on climate and energy policy, and we need \nRepublicans to step up. This issue is crying for Republican leadership, \nand I am looking forward to the day--hopefully very soon--where we will \nhave it, where we will have a serious negotiation.\n  I understand that not all of my ideas will win out, not all of the \nprogressive perspectives will win out, but that is the legislative \nprocess. We need a dance partner. We look forward to that moment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I \nwould have voted yes.\n  Funding our military and keeping Americans safe used to be a point of \nbipartisan consensus in Washington.

It also includes funds for ongoing \noperations against ISIS, Al Qaeda, and terrorist organizations globally \nwho seek to do us harm.\n  As they have shown on issue after issue, President Obama, his \nadministration, and Washington Democrats are not serious about \nconfronting the challenges we face as a nation. We need\n\n[[Page S7812]]\n\nnew leadership in Washington that will restore American strength and \nkeep the American people safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/05/senate-section/article/S7812-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING THE USS ``PITTSBURGH''\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I wish to honor the skilled, brave, and \ndetermined sailors who served aboard the USS Pittsburgh.\n  The third of four naval vessels named after the Steel City, the USS \nPittsburgh was a Baltimore-class heavy cruiser that served 6 months in \nthe Pacific theatre during World War II. In that short time, the \ncruiser earned two battle stars. However, her greatest accomplishment \nwas assisting in the rescue of the crew of a disabled ship in enemy \nwaters.\n  In March 1945, Japanese bombers began an air raid on a task force \nassigned to the U.S. 5th Fleet. This attack severely damaged the \naircraft carrier USS Franklin and set it ablaze. The USS Franklin lost \n725 crew members, with another 264 injured in the bombing, and it was \nleft stranded in the water just 50 miles from the Japanese coast. The \nUSS Pittsburgh quickly came to the rescue, saving 34 men from the \nwater. Along with another ship, a light cruiser, the USS Santa Fe, the \nUSS Pittsburgh was able to tow the carrier to safety while fighting off \nenemy attacks.\n  The crew of the USS Franklin was highly decorated for their bravery \nduring the fight, but the crew of the USS Pittsburgh has never received \nany honors for their bravery. Today I rise to recognize and honor the \ncrew of the USS Pittsburgh for their heroism and bravery displayed \nrendering aid and assistance to the USS Franklin on March 19, 1945.\n  Along with this heroic action, the USS Pittsburgh faced another big \nfight against a different kind of enemy: Mother Nature. On June 5, \n1945, the ship encountered a typhoon and suffered extensive damage, \nincluding loss of its bow, but was kept afloat because of her skilled \ncrewmembers' damage control efforts. The USS Pittsburgh's captain \nmaneuvered the boat entirely by cleverly manipulating the ship's \nengines until the storm subsided, returning to Guam a few days later.\n  I would especially like to recognize three veterans of the USS \nPittsburgh who are still living in southwestern Pennsylvania. Their \nnames are: Robert McKnight, seaman 1st class, of Connellsville, Fayette \nCounty; George Jock, seamen 1st class, of Somerset, Somerset County; \nand Paul Gaudi, seaman 1st class, of Jeanette, Westmoreland County.\n  I thank them and their fellow USS Pittsburgh crew members for their \nvaliant heroism and service to our country. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the additional information that was obtained with the help of the \nCongressional Research Service and National Archives be printed in the \nRecord.\n  Lastly, I appreciate having the opportunity to provide my remarks \nabout the USS Pittsburgh and its crew's unique and extraordinary \ncontributions to our Nation's history in World War II. It is an honor \nto serve in the U.S. Senate on behalf of the great city for which this \ncruiser was named and represent those veterans who served aboard her.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       On the morning of 19 March, 1945, while a part of Fast \n     Carrier Task Group 58.2, the U.S.S. PITTSBURGH was ordered by \n     Commander Cruiser Division TEN to ``Proceed to FRANKLIN and \n     render all possible assistance''.\n       The PITTSBURGH cleared the formation and proceeded at 30 \n     knots to the vicinity of the burning carrier FRANKLIN, which \n     had been severely damaged, both by a Japanese bomb and by the \n     following internal explosions and fires which were still \n     raging.\n       After picking up 34 of her men from the water during the \n     approach, the carrier was taken in tow at 1402, 19 March, in \n     position Latitude 30 deg.-10' N., Longitude 133 deg.-50, E., \n     57 miles southeast of the southern tip of Shikoku, Japan; and \n     towed for 22\\1/2\\ hours away from the coast of Japan in \n     southwest, southeasterly and south directions, a distance of \n     approximately 120 miles, until the FRANKLIN could proceed \n     under her own power.\n       At the commencement of the towing operation the FRANKLIN \n     had a list to starboard of about 15 deg.; had no power, or \n     steering control, and her rudder was jammed right 3 deg.. The \n     list of the carrier away from the wind, which was blowing \n     from an easterly direction, caused her to sail up into the \n     wind, making towing on southerly courses most difficult and \n     prohibiting steering a given course away from Japan for any \n     continuous length of time.\n       At 1550 our speed by pitometer log was 6\\1/4\\ knots, \n     however speed varied from 1\\1/2\\ knots to 8 knots.\n       At about 2300 the FRANKLIN's starboard list was corrected \n     and became about 5 deg. to port. With the change in list to \n     port, the sail area of the carrier was reduced and it was \n     possible to keep a steady course of 155 deg. (T) and maintain \n     a fairly constant speed between 6 and 7 knots.\n       At 0245, 20 March, the FRANKLIN began to turn over her \n     engines, and by 0400 she was making turns for 4.5 knots, and \n     we were making 7.5 knots through the water.\n       At 0930, tha FRANKLIN gained steering control, and towing \n     speed was gradually increased to 13.7 knots with the FRANKLIN \n     engines assisting.\n       At 1233, in position 160 miles from Shikoku (Latitude \n     30 deg.-14'.5 N., Longitude 134 deg.-23'.2 E.) the tow was \n     cast off and the FRANKLIN proceeded under her own power.\n       The PITTSBURGH assisted in repelling two air attacks during \n     the towing operation. The first attack occurred while in \n     process of passing the tow wire, and the second attack after \n     the carrier had been taken in tow. Neither attack was \n     successful, and two Japanese planes were shot down by Combat \n     Air Patrol.\n       The FRANKLIN is of about 27,000 tons displacement, and so \n     far as I know this is the first large carrier to be towed any \n     from the scene of action to safety.\n       No damage was suffered by this vessel during the towing \n     operation.\n       Sufficient praise cannot be given the commanding officer of \n     the FRANKLIN and his heroic rescue crew, who, in spite of all \n     odds, fought fires, repaired machinery and righted the heavy \n     initial list. The cooperation of the FRANKLIN was complete, \n     and made bringing her to safety possible.\n       The SANTA FE went alongside the FRANKLIN, transferred \n     personnel, and assisted in line handling while ammunition was \n     exploding and fires were raging. The destroyer MILLER \n     (DE535), likewise, repeatedly and with great courage went \n     alongside the FRANKLIN and under her stern to put down fires \n     and cool her bulkhead with water.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/05/senate-section/article/S7812-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PETE GARDZINA\n\n Mr. DAINES.

Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Grady \nTarbutton on his retirement after over 8 years of service to Washoe \nCounty Senior Services. It gives me great pleasure to recognize his \nyears of hard work and dedication to this important community in \nnorthern Nevada.\n  Mr. Tarbutton first began his career working to aid seniors at the \nWashington County Department of Disability, Aging, and Veterans' \nServices in Oregon, as the senior program coordinator. In 2005, he \nmoved to Portland, OR, and served as the community services manager for \nMultnomah County Aging and Disability Services. He began his tenure as \ndirector for Washoe County Senior Services in November of 2007, \nsacrificing countless hours to build the department and offer an array \nof key resources to our senior community. His commitment to our seniors \nstands as a shining example of\n\n[[Page S7813]]\n\ntrue selflessness and empathy for those in need.\n  With the help of Mr. Tarbutton's leadership, Washoe County Senior \nServices offers a variety of assistance to help Nevada's seniors, \nincluding guidance on community senior centers, health programs, food \nservices, housing and care options, legal services, and Federal \nprograms such as Medicare, Medicaid, and veterans benefits. The \ndepartment also offers Meals on Wheels, which is an important program \nthat provides meals and support for seniors in need. This department \ntruly goes above and beyond, providing seniors with the tools necessary \nto create a higher quality of life through steadfast support and help.\n  Mr. Tarbutton's work has had a great impact on Washoe County's \nresidents. Through his unwavering commitment and tireless work ethic, \nNevada's seniors and their families have had an unparalleled support \nsystem, ready to assist in times of difficulty or uncertainty. I have \nvisited the Washoe County Senior Center and have witnessed firsthand \nthe positive impact Washoe County Senior Services has on this center's \nresidents. The strong foundation Mr. Tarbutton has built will be felt \nfor years to come.\n  As a member of both the Senate Special Committee on Aging and the \nSenate Committee on Finance, I understand the importance of assisting \nthe needs of Nevada's seniors and ensuring our communities are equipped \nto serve our State's aging population. Washoe County's seniors have \nbenefited greatly from the work of this organization. This community is \nfortunate to have had someone like Mr. Tarbutton there as an ally and \nfriend.\n  Today I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in thanking Mr. \nTarbutton for his dedication to Washoe County Senior Services. He \nexemplifies the highest standards of leadership and service and should \nbe proud of his long and meaningful career.

I am proud to recognize Ms. Napoles, \nwho has contributed so much to the success of this important entity in \nsouthern Nevada.\n  Throughout her 25 years of service to the Las Vegas Latin Chamber of \nCommerce, Ms. Napoles worked diligently to establish the chamber as a \ntireless force in helping Las Vegas' Hispanic business community. As \nsenior executive vice president to the chamber, she spent countless \nhours working to bring southern Nevada's entrepreneurs numerous \nnetworking opportunities and to establish positive relationships in all \ncorners of the Hispanic community. During her service, she was \nresponsible for coordinating events, luncheons, and galas, as well as \nleading the organization in the development of a leadership structure, \nstrategic planning, goal creation, and financial management. Her \ndetermination and resilience in gaining sponsors to support the chamber \ncontributed to making it the successful entity that it is today. Her \nefforts also established an important partnership with the Clark County \nSchool District, bringing Nevada's Hispanic youth positivity and \nsupport for their futures. I am proud to have attended multiple Latin \nChamber of Commerce events where I have spoken with the men and women \nwho participate in this chamber, and I can attest to the incredible \nrole they play within our community. The immense amount of work Ms. \nNapoles has done for the Las Vegas Latin Chamber of Commerce has not \ngone unnoticed.\n  Businesses across southern Nevada, both large and small, are \nfortunate to have had someone like Ms. Napoles working as an ally.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to coordinate \nFederal congenital heart disease research efforts and to improve public \neducation and awareness of congenital heart disease, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr President, every 15 minutes in America, a baby is born \nwith a congenital heart defect. Many of these congenital heart defects \nare simple and can be easily corrected. Others are complex; some can \nrequire a lifetime of specialized medical care.\n  If you want to know what fear and powerlessness feels like, imagine \nbeing a young parent, listening to a doctor tell you that your new \nbaby--who appears so perfect to you--has a threatening heart problem.\n  Fortunately, congenital heart defects aren't as deadly as they once \nwere. In the 1950s, only 20 percent of American babies with congenital \nheart defects survived infancy. Today, 90 percent survive. Many \nchildren born with serious heart defects grow up to be adults with \nactive, productive lives.\n  That progress didn't happen by accident. It happened because \nAmericans made a decision in the 1960s to reduce these mortality \nnumbers. We invested in research that led to better understanding and \nbetter treatments of the heart, from infancy to old age.\n  That investment in research has paid off in many ways. Some heart \nconditions that used to kill adults quickly often are managed now with \nmedications and life style changes. The number of Americans with \ncongenital heart disease living full, healthy lives increases by about \n5 percent every year. About 2 million Americans are living with \ncongenital heart disease today. We have come a long way--but there is \nmore that we can do.\n  We know that the sooner a baby with a congenital heart defect is \ndiagnosed and treated, the better the chances are to live a long and \nhealthy life. But, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nestimates that 30 percent of babies with critical congenital heart \ndefects aren't diagnosed in the first few days, when treatment is most \neffective; 1 in 200 babies die from complications that might have been \navoided if their heart disease had been detected.\n  In 2009, I introduced the Congenital Heart Futures Act to study \npeople of all ages with congenital heart disease and coordinate \nresearch. That bill expired this year.\n  Today I am introducing the Congenital Heart Futures Reauthorization \nAct of 2015. This bill will save lives by allowing us to build on the \nknowledge we have gained about congenital heart defects and the best \nways to treat them.\n  My bill directs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to \nstudy\n\n[[Page S7817]]\n\npeople of all ages with congenital heart disease. The CDC would make \nthe results of its research available to congenital heart disease \nresearchers and to Congress. We will enable some of the best scientific \nand medical minds in America to evaluate the best ways to diagnose and \ntreat congenital heart disease.\n  Many adults living with congenital heart disease are not aware they \nneed specialized care throughout their lives. And fewer than 10 percent \nof adults with complex congenital heart disease receive the care they \nneed.\n  The Congenital Heart Futures Reauthorization Act directs the CDC to \ncreate a public awareness campaign to educate both patients and doctors \nabout congenital heart disease and the need for lifelong specialized \ncare for those living with congenital heart defects.\n  Finally, my bill directs the National Institutes of Health to conduct \na review of ongoing research on congenital heart disease, identify \nareas of greatest need for research, and identify plans for future \nresearch.\n  We are not powerless when it comes to congenital heart challenges. We \nhave made tremendous progress in my lifetime. Millions of Americans \nwith congenital heart defects are living happy, healthy lives today \nbecause of that progress.\n  The Congenital Heart Futures Reauthorization Act bill will help us \nbetter understand what congenital heart disease looks like in the \nUnited States and what we can do to help those living with this disease \nlive longer. This bill will save lives and ultimately it will save \ntaxpayers money--a lifetime of specialized heart care is expensive.\n  I would like to thank Senator Casey for joining me in introducing \nthis bill, and Representatives Bilirakis from Florida and Adam Schiff \nfrom California in the House for introducing the companion bill. I look \nforward to working with them on this issue that affects so many \nfamilies.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2248\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to modify the requirements applicable to locatable \nminerals on public domain land, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Hardrock \nMining Reform and Reclamation Act of 2015.\n  First, I thank Senator Heinrich, who will be here with me in a \nmoment, for working with me on this bill. He is a dedicated \nconservation Senator from the West and really cares about this issue, \nand we have both been working together on this bill. I so much \nappreciate all of his hard work and his commitment to this important \nlegislation. I also thank Senator Bennet and Senator Wyden for their \nhard work and support on this bill. I also thank our New Mexico \ncolleague, Congressman Ben Ray Lujan, for his efforts on the House \nside.\n  We are proposing this bill for one reason: to reform the mining law \nof 1872. It is a matter of simple fairness, it is a matter of common \nsense, and it is a reform that is long overdue.\n  The 1872 mining law played a historic role in the settling of the \nWest. It encouraged mining for silver, gold, copper, uranium, and other \nminerals on public lands. It helped the West to grow, but there was a \nprice--one we are still paying. It did almost nothing to compensate the \npublic, it did nothing to protect the environment, and it did nothing \nto require mines to clean up the mess. It did nothing to require those \nmines to clean up the mess. The legacy is clear--thousands of abandoned \nmines, contaminated land, polluted streams, costly cleanup, and \ntaxpayers stuck with the bill. We have a 19th-century law which is \ntotally inadequate to 21st-century challenges.\n  The spill at the Gold King mine earlier this year tells the story. \nWith terrible damage in my State, in other States, and in the Navajo \nNation, this is a disaster on many levels--to our water, our economy, \nand to our culture.\n  Mistakes were made at the Gold King mine. We have to do all we can to \nmake sure they are not made again and to make sure our communities are \nfairly compensated for losses. That is why Senator Heinrich and I \nintroduced the Gold King Mine Spill Recovery Act of 2015.\n  The Gold King mine disaster is also a wakeup call. The mine is still \nthere; the owners are not. There are up to 500,000 abandoned mines in \nour country. They are a ticking timebomb. They are leaking toxins into \nour rivers and streams in the West and have been for decades. It will \ncost tens of billions of dollars to fix this. The estimates are \nanywhere from $20 billion to $54 billion, with a ``b''--billions. A \nmining royalty will bring fairness to taxpayers and help pay for the \ncleanup.\n\n[[Page S7818]]\n\n  I have pushed for--and will keep pushing for--mining reform, first in \nthe House and now in the Senate because I believe in the simple \nprinciple that the polluter pays. The polluter pays, but under current \nlaw the mining companies do not pay--not for the minerals they take, \nnot for the damage they have done. This cannot continue. They cannot \ncontinue to reap all the benefits and hundreds of millions of dollars \nwhile taxpayers continue to shoulder all the burden. This goes against \nevery notion of simple fairness. Working Americans know this, middle-\nclass families know this, and both sides of the aisle know this.\n  The 1872 mining law also basically gives away Federal land for $5. \nLess than what a working American pays for lunch, mining companies can \nbuy an acre of Federal land if they discover a valuable mineral \ndeposit. So there is no surprise here. Hard rock mining companies don't \nwant reform. They have had a free ride for a long time--no wonder they \nwant to keep it--but it is long past time for that ride to end.\n  Coal, oil, and gas companies have paid royalties for many decades. \nHard rock mining companies, including foreign mining companies, should \ndo the same. Our bill will require that they do that. It is not a \nradical idea. The oil industry pays a small fee on every barrel of oil, \nthe coal industry pays a small fee on each ton of coal, and the sky has \nnot fallen in. And when disasters happen, from oilspills to abandoned \ncoal mines, these industries bear some of the cost.\n  History may explain why the 1872 law was created, but it is hard to \nsee now why it should continue. What began as an effort to settle the \nWest has become a gravy train for multibillion-dollar companies and not \njust American companies but foreign ones as well. We know the taxpayers \nare getting shortchanged. We just don't know how much.\n  In 2011 I asked the General Accounting Office for the numbers. They \ncouldn't say. Not only do the hard rock mining companies not pay, they \ndo not disclose, and under current law they do not have to--not how \nmuch they extract from Federal lands, not where the minerals are sold, \nnot the overall value. Yet at the same time, oil, gas, and coal brought \nin $11.4 billion in Federal revenue.\n  We need to get this done. We can't keep asking working Americans and \nstruggling communities to foot the bill while mining companies reap the \nprofits. Let us be clear. The silver and gold on public lands are a \nnatural resource. They belong to the American people. They should be an \ninvestment for public good, not a giveaway for private gain.\n  After my father left office after 8 years as Secretary of the \nInterior, he was asked what were his big regrets, and he said mining \nreform was his greatest unfinished business. Fifty years later we still \nneed to do this and we still need to do it now. We have an outdated \nlaw. Special treatment for the profits of large hard rock mining \ncompanies is not a reason to keep it, at least not to the taxpayers of \nmy State.\n  It is time to stop giving away the store. It is time to reform the \nmining law of 1872. It is the right thing to do. It is the fair thing \nto do. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and let us get this \ndone.\n  Mr. President, I was just in a press conference with Senator Heinrich \nand Senator Bennet where we talked, and one of the questions that was \nasked was: How are you working at building bipartisan support and is \nthere bipartisan support? I want to say a word on that because we have \nseen very solid bills pass here in Washington with bipartisan support. \nOne of the ones I wanted to point out was in 2007 in the House. Nick \nRahall had a mining reform bill. He had Republican cosponsors by the \nnames of Wayne Gilchrest and Representative Christopher Shays--24 \nRepublicans in the House--and the bill was passed 244 to 166. Paul \nRyan, who was in my class when I came into Congress in 1998--we arrived \nat the same time and Paul is now the Speaker over in the House--voted \nyes for mining reform back in 2007 on this Rahall bill.\n  So I think if you look at the history, this is a bill where we need \nto work with both sides of the aisle, and I hope and wish Congressman \nRyan--Speaker Ryan--the best and I hope he will join us in this effort \nto reform this long outdated law.\n  With that, I see my good friend and partner in this, Senator \nHeinrich, is on the floor, so I yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I want to begin by thanking my colleague \nthe senior Senator from New Mexico Tom Udall for the incredible \nleadership he has shown on this issue. I know it is something near and \ndear to his heart and something he absolutely and truly cares about. We \nhave had a good team working on this over the course of the last couple \nof months. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado has been a great \ncontributor to this effort. Congressman Ben Ray Lujan of northern New \nMexico has taken a leadership effort on a similar effort in the House, \nand today we are joined by Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon on this \nlegislation as well.\n  As many folks know, in August a large plume of bright orange mine \nwaste spilled into the Animas River, which leads into the San Juan, and \npolluted the Four Corners region from Colorado to New Mexico and \nthrough the Navajo Nation.\n  If you take a look at this photo, which was shared with me by the \npresident and vice president of the Navajo Nation, this is not what you \nwant to see when you look at the river that you take your drinking \nwater from or the river that you use for irrigation or the place you go \nfishing or recreate and kayak on. This is not how our mountain streams \nin the Southwest are supposed to look. I think visually this got the \nattention of people all around the country as to the scope and scale of \nthis problem.\n  After the mine spill, I toured affected communities in New Mexico and \nthe Navajo Nation. I met with impacted residents, including farmers in \nAztec and Shiprock, San Juan County leaders, Navajo Nation President \nRussell Begaye, Vice President Jonathan Nez, and the attorney general, \nEthel Branch. In the Southwest, water is by far our most precious \nresource, so you can imagine the kind of impact this disaster had on \nour communities.\n  My colleagues in the Environment and Public Works Committee and the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs have now held hearings to investigate the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's actions which led to this spill and \nto seek to bring proper oversight to the Agency's response. Last week, \nthe Department of the Interior released a report of its independent \ntechnical evaluation of the EPA's action. The evaluation found that the \nEPA did not properly appreciate the engineering complexity of trying to \nclean up the Gold King mine and that it could in fact have prevented \nwhat we see here.\n  I share the anger and frustration that not only my colleagues but, \nmore importantly, our constituents have expressed over this terrible \naccident. It is why Senator Udall and I have introduced separate pieces \nof legislation specifically to make these communities whole. We need to \ncontinue to demand the EPA act with urgency to protect the health and \nthe safety of the affected communities and to repair the damage \ninflicted on this watershed. That is our first and top priority.\n  We are doing a disservice to the American people by not also taking \naction to address the thousands--thousands--of other similarly \ncontaminated abandoned mines that literally litter the West and are \nleaking toxins into our watersheds--into the watersheds that provide \ndrinking water and irrigation to our communities all across the West.\n  There are estimates that 40 percent of western watersheds have been \npolluted by toxic mining waste and that reclaiming and cleaning up \nabandoned mines to make this right is going to cost tens of billions of \ndollars.\n  This latest disaster was all too familiar for those of us from the \nFour Corners region and to many people around the West. Back in 1975, \nin an even larger accident than the Gold King blowout, a tailings pile \nnear Silverton, CO, spilled 50,000 tons of tailings laden with toxic \nheavy metals into the Animas River Watershed--the watershed that drains \nfrom Colorado into New Mexico, into the San Juan and through the Navajo \nNation in Arizona as well.\n  In 1979, a breached dam at a uranium mill tailings disposal pond near \nChurch\n\n[[Page S7819]]\n\nRock in New Mexico on the Navajo Nation sent more than 1,000 tons of \nsolid radioactive waste and 93 million gallons of acidic liquid into \nthe Rio Puerco.\n  Disastrous blowouts and spills like these are easy to see. They get \nthe media's attention, but the toxins leaking silently out of thousands \nof abandoned hard rock mines are doing even more damage to our \nwatersheds each and every day.\n  For decades before the spill, the Gold King mine actually leached \nwater laced with heavy metals and sulfuric acid into Cement Creek, \nwhich is a tributary of the Animas. Over the last 10 years, an average \nof 200 gallons of highly polluted water each and every minute, or more \nthan 100 million gallons per year, flowed out of this mine and into the \nAnimas River via Cement Creek. The Gold King and other abandoned mines \nin the San Juan Mountains in southwestern Colorado continue to pollute \nthe Animas and the San Juan Watershed as we speak.\n  Beyond the immediate cleanup of the Gold King spill, it is high time \nwe as a Congress overhaul our abandoned mine cleanup policies to make \nfuture disasters less likely and to address the thousands and thousands \nof abandoned mines that are polluting our watersheds.\n  The Navajo Nation, which was perhaps most affected by the Gold King \nmine blowout, has more than 500 abandoned uranium mines. Last month, I \nmet with officials at the Navajo Abandoned Mine Lands Reclamation and \nUranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action Office and learned about their \nefforts to clean up these literally hundreds of sites. I visited a \nlarge uranium tailings disposal pile in Shiprock--in the town of \nShiprock--that sits close to the San Juan River.\n  If you look at this map, this is the San Juan River. This is the \ncommunity of Shiprock. We have the high school, the fairgrounds, and \nthe residential area all around a permanent tailings disposal site--\nsomething that is going to require stewardship for literally hundreds, \nif not thousands, of years.\n  Melvin Yazzie, a senior reclamation specialist with the department, \nalso took me through an abandoned uranium mine site in the Red Valley \nChapter of the Northern Navajo Nation. Carrying a Geiger counter, he \nshowed me the abandoned mine and a nearby house that was constructed \nusing materials contaminated with radioactive materials.\n  Here we see Mr. Yazzie with his Geiger counter. This is obviously no \nlonger occupied, but it gives us a sense of the impact to members of \nthe Navajo Nation, some of whom literally have their homes built with \nthe spillover, the rock materials that came out of these mines, and \nlive with that irradiation each and every day.\n  The Navajo Government is doing its best to address this legacy of \nuranium mining and milling, but they do not have anywhere close to \nenough resources or funding necessary to clean up the waste from \ndecades and decades of uranium mining.\n  A large reason why the Navajo Nation lacks adequate resources and why \ncommunities all across Indian Country and the entire West are dealing \nwith pollution from abandoned mines and lack resources is that we have \nnot updated our Federal laws on hard rock mining in 143 years.\n  During the era of manifest destiny, the Federal Government encouraged \nAmericans to settle newly acquired lands in the West by passing laws--\nlaws like the Timber and Stone Act of 1878 and the Desert Land Act of \n1878, laws like the Homestead Act, which my grandparents took advantage \nof. Some of these laws gave away public lands and resources to private \nusers with no strings attached and often no price tag attached.\n  The General Mining Act of 1872 came along during this era of \nunrestrained western expansion. It allowed individuals and companies to \nclaim ownership of minerals in the public domain--minerals owned by us \nas a nation, such as gold, silver, copper, uranium, molybdenum, and \nothers--simply by locating a mineral source, staking a claim, and \npaying $5 for an acre of land. Miners did not have to consider \nenvironmental impacts or make any plans to clean up the waste, which \nhas created the pollution and contamination we confront today. This law \ndrew thousands of people to the West. My father and my mother's father \nboth made a living working in hard rock mining. But shortsighted policy \nalso left behind a scarred legacy on our lands.\n  Unlike other 19th-century western settlement laws which have long \nsince been reformed or replaced, the Mining Act of 1872 remains on the \nbooks today. While developers of resources such as oil, natural gas, \nand coal all pay royalties to return fair value to taxpayers for our \npublic resources, hard rock mining companies still mine publicly owned \nminerals for free--for free--and we still don't have a plan to address \na century of pollution from abandoned mines.\n  We desperately need to bring our mining laws out of the 19th century \nand into the 20th century. That is why I am joining my colleagues--\nSenator Udall of New Mexico, Senator Bennet of Colorado, and Senator \nWyden of Oregon--to introduce legislation to reform our outdated and \nineffective Federal policy on abandoned mines and on hard rock mining. \nOur legislation will require that reasonable royalties and fees from \nhard rock mining be used to create a dedicated funding stream for \ncleaning up mine waste. A reclamation program will allow States, \ntribes, and nonprofit organizations to collaborate on projects to \nrestore fish and wildlife habitat affected by past hard rock mining and \nto repair watersheds that are the very center of our economy in the \nWest, the source of our essential agricultural and drinking water \nsupply for western communities up and down the spine of the Rockies.\n  This legislation will also reform the permitting process for new \nmines. Hard rock mining companies will need to protect water and \nwildlife resources and provide financial assurance that they can \nactually fund reclamation cleanup and restoration efforts after their \nmines close so that in the future we don't have this legacy of \nabandoned hard rock mines.\n  These are simply, commonsense reforms--reforms that, frankly, \nCongress should have adopted decades ago.\n  I appreciate the value of the hard rock mining industry. My own \nfamily has benefited from it, and I recognize that the industry \ncontinues to provide good-paying jobs in States throughout the West. \nSome mining companies are already stepping up to help clean up old \nmining waste sites. I look forward to working with industry \nstakeholders to find practical ways to bring our policies into the 21st \ncentury. We cannot wait for more disasters like the Gold King mine \nspill for us to act. We cannot continue to do nothing while thousands \nof abandoned hard rock mines drain toxic metals into our rivers, water \nsupplies, and our drinking water each and every day. We must come \ntogether and press forward for pragmatic reforms to our outdated \nFederal hard rock mining laws.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KAINE (for himself and Mrs. Capito):\n  S. 2256. A bill to establish programs for health care provider \ntraining in Federal health care and medical facilities, to establish \nFederal co-prescribing guidelines, to establish a grant program with \nrespect to naloxone, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a bill I am introducing \ncalled the Co-prescribing Saves Lives Act.\n  All across the Nation, and certainly all across my Commonwealth, we \nare seeing the scourge of prescription drug abuse and a heroin \nepidemic. These opioids are having major impact in communities \neverywhere in Virginia, from the coal mines of Appalachia to rural \ncommunities in the Shenandoah Valley, to right here in suburban Fairfax \nCounty.\n  I have heard, as have my colleagues, stories from parents who have \nburied children, from companies that can't find employees who can pass \ndrug tests, and certainly from law enforcement officials, including \njudges, prosecutors, police officials, and sheriffs, who talk about the \ndramatic expansion of opioid addiction in this country. The numbers are \nkind of shocking. When I came to the Senate and started doing tours \naround the State in the spring of 2013, I really wasn't schooled about \nthis, and I started to hear stories.\n  Heroin and opioids now account for 25,000 American deaths a year. In \nVirginia, and in much of the United\n\n[[Page S7820]]\n\nStates, the deaths from opioid overdoses are now exceeding deaths from \nmotor vehicle accidents. According to the Centers for Disease Control, \nin the United States fatal opioid-related drug overdose rates have \nquadrupled since 1990 and have never been higher than they are right \nnow.\n  The question is, How do we address this crisis? Obviously, the answer \nis there is no single answer. There are a lot of things that have to be \ndone. The Federal Government, State and local communities, faith \ncommunities, nonprofit organizations, families, individuals educating \nthemselves--there are a lot of answers, but we have to move forward \nwith steps that we know can reduce overdose deaths.\n  There is some good news. There are advances that can help us do this, \nand one of the advances has been the development of a drug called \nnaloxone, which is a medicine that is safe and effective as an antidote \nto all opioid-related overdoses, including heroin, prescription \nopioids, and fentanyl. It is a critical tool--it has been proven to be \na critical tool since its development in preventing fatal opioid \noverdoses.\n  One of the neat things about naloxone is if you come across somebody \nwho is in respiratory failure from an overdose or for some other \nreason, you can administer naloxone to that individual, and if it is \nnot an overdose, it doesn't have any side effects. It can bring \nsomebody back from the overdose-caused respiratory failure, but it \ndoesn't have any negative side effects if it turns out the person is \nsuffering from something else.\n  In Virginia there is an organization called Project REVIVE! that \ntrains people to administer naloxone. In one of our communities in \nRussell County in Southwest Virginia, about a year ago I took the \ntraining with a lot of family members and others--just 2 hours of \ntraining--to learn how to do this.\n  Since naloxone has been developed and come into more common usage \nbeginning in the late 1990s, it has saved more than 26,000 people who \nhave been in the throes of an overdose. Naloxone has brought them back \nto life. I think a lot of professionals--public safety professionals \nand health care professionals around the country--have seen how \neffective it is.\n  One answer to our overdose problem is to co-prescribe naloxone when \nsomeone is getting a prescription for an opioid. Opioids have \nlegitimate uses, to manage pain. So when somebody is getting a \nprescription for that, co-prescribe naloxone so they have the antidote \nright there in case of an overdose.\n  There are overdoses from people who are using drugs inappropriately \nand grabbing somebody else's prescriptions and using opioids, but there \nare also quite a few overdoses where people who are legitimately \nprescribed the drug--and they are usually prescribed it for pain--they \ndevelop a tolerance to the drug. The package may say to take one pill \nevery 6 hours, but the pain is strong, and after 3 hours they start to \nfeel it again and somebody thinks, OK, the drug has worn off now so I \ncan take another one. So a person can start to take too many because of \npain symptoms, and they get into an overdose situation for that reason \ntoo. If a person has a naloxone co-prescribed, they can have the \nantidote right there that they can administer themselves, or someone \nelse can, if they get into an overdose situation.\n  Many communities, States, national organizations, and medical \norganizations have supported co-prescribing naloxone to patients who \nare taking opioids as a critical part of this overdose problem, and we \nhave guidelines. Not everybody who gets an opioid prescription needs \nnaloxone. My wife broke and dislocated her shoulder two Good Fridays \nago, and she was prescribed a powerful opioid pain killer. She used \nabout a day and a half's worth of it. It made her sick to her stomach \nso she quit using it. Not everybody who gets prescribed a prescription \nopioid needs naloxone, but there are certain warning signs--the medical \nprofession has developed the warning signs--and if you have the warning \nsigns, you should get the co-prescription. Developing these guidelines \nhelps physicians, pharmacists, and other providers determine who is at \nrisk and whom we should be proactive with regarding a co-prescription.\n  What this bill does is the following: It improves access to naloxone \nby encouraging physicians to co-prescribe in a couple of circumstances, \nto co-prescribe this lifesaving drug alongside opioid prescriptions and \nmake it more widely available in Federal health settings.\n  The Co-prescribing Saves Lives Act would require that the Secretaries \nof Health and Human Services, Defense, and Veterans Affairs would \nestablish physician education co-prescribing guidelines for all Federal \nhealth centers, including VA hospitals, DOD hospitals, the Indian \nHealth Service, and federally qualified health centers. So within \nFederal health care facilities, if there is going to be an opioid \nprescription to somebody in a high-risk situation, there would be a \nmandate that naloxone would be prescribed as well.\n  This bill is based upon work that has already been done in the \nFederal Government. The VA especially has been a real leader in setting \nup these co-prescription guidelines. In addition, the bill would \nprovide a program of grants through State departments of health that \nare interested in doing the co-prescribing guidelines for private \nphysicians not in Federal settings in their States. The funding would \nallow States to purchase naloxone, to provide copay assistance for \nuninsured patients, and to fund training for health professionals and \npatients. Grant funding could also support State innovation and provide \nfor community outreach. The kind of program where I trained last \nsummer, Project REVIVE!, is just a community program trying to battle \nopioid overdose deaths in the coalfields of Appalachia. That would be \nthe kind of program that if other States wanted to do that, could be \neligible for grant funding.\n  In closing, this is just one solution. Obviously, the real solutions, \nthe important ones, are still around prevention. Why do Americans get \nprescribed so many more opioids than folks in other nations? What do we \ndo about prescriptions when the quantities that are given are too big \nand then we end up with a lot of unused opioids that can be taken by \nyoung people or stolen and sold? There are a lot of issues we have to \nsolve, but there is this bit of good news; that naloxone saves lives \nand it is easy to administer. It doesn't have a negative effect. If we \ncan broaden access to naloxone for those who have been prescribed \nopioids--we have saved lives in the past and we are going to save a lot \nmore.\n  I will conclude by saying there is a dad in Northern Virginia--a guy \nby the name of Don Flattery--who has been very public about the loss of \nhis son, Kevin, who was a 26-year-old graduate of UVA in 2014. He \ntalked about his son, the family, the advantages they had, and his \neducational track record of success at UVA, but then he fell into the \njust bottomless pit of opioid prescription, opioid addiction, and he \nperished in 2014. What Don said is that ``I feel we need to keep \npersonalizing what is happening. We are not addressing shocking, obtuse \nstatistics--we are speaking about my son, your daughter, our neighbors \n. . . they are real people with real lives, and their losses are the \nface of the epidemic we must stop.''\n  That is what this bill intends to play a part in.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (by request):\n  S. 2257. A bill to prepare the National Park Service for its \nCentennial in 2016 and for a second century of protecting our national \nparks' natural, historic, and cultural resources for present and future \ngenerations and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, by request, \nthe Administration's legislative proposal the National Park Service \nCentennial Act.\n  The bill authorizes or expands several authorities to assist the \nNational Park Service in managing the over 400 units of the National \nPark System as it prepares for the centennial anniversary of the \nagency's establishment in 1916.\n  While I may not agree with every provision in the administration's \nproposed bill, I believe it is important for this legislative proposal \nto be considered in the Senate, which is why I agreed to introduce it \nby request. At the same time, I will continue to work with other \nSenators on both sides of the aisle to develop a bipartisan consensus \non a national park centennial\n\n[[Page S7821]]\n\nbill so that the Senate can consider and pass a bill before the \nNational Park Service's centennial anniversary next year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the administration's \nletter to the Senate transmitting the legislative proposal and a \nsection-by-section summary of the bill prepared by the Department of \nthe Interior be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                The Secretary of the Interior,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 31, 2015.\n     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President:  Enclosed is a draft of a bill \n     entitled, the ``National Park Service Centennial Act.'' Also \n     enclosed is a section-by-section analysis of the bill. We \n     recommend that the bill be introduced, referred to the \n     appropriate committee for consideration, and enacted.\n       The National Park Service (NPS) will celebrate its \n     centennial in 2016. As we look ahead to the next century, \n     there are a number of key authorities that need to be \n     authorized, clarified, or expanded to allow us to better \n     serve the American people.\n       Title I, the Centennial Declaration, would recognize that \n     the NPS has responsibility not only for administering the \n     units of the National Park System, but for programs that \n     provide financial and technical assistance to states, \n     communities, and individuals to protect our national \n     heritage. Title I would also direct the Secretary of the \n     Interior to utilize these financial and technical assistance \n     programs to further the conservation and enjoyment of the \n     natural and cultural heritage of the Nation for the benefit \n     and inspiration of the public.\n       Titles II-IV of the proposed legislation would implement \n     part of the President's Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Budget request \n     to Congress. Title II would establish a National Park \n     Centennial Challenge Fund of up to $100 million for FY 2016, \n     FY 2017, and 2018 to be used for signature projects that will \n     help prepare the national parks for another century of \n     conservation, preservation, and enjoyment.\n       Title III would provide a mandatory appropriation of $300 \n     million to the NPS Construction Account for FY 2016, FY 2017, \n     and FY 2018, to correct deficiencies in NPS infrastructure \n     and facilities.\n       Title IV would establish the Centennial Land Management \n     Investment Fund, consisting of a mandatory appropriation \n     equal to $100 million for FY 2016, FY 2017, and FY 2018 to \n     provide funding for the Secretaries of the Interior and \n     Agriculture to jointly establish a competitive program \n     available to the four Federal land management agencies for \n     projects that enhance visitor services and outdoor \n     recreational opportunities, restore lands and waters, repair \n     facilities or trails, or increase energy and water \n     efficiency.\n       Title V would direct the National Park Foundation (NPF) to \n     establish a special account known as the Second Century \n     Endowment for the NPS, consisting of gifts or bequests \n     provided for this purpose, for projects and activities that \n     further the mission of the NPS.\n       Title VI would establish the NPS Second Century Fund in the \n     Treasury, which would be funded through additional lodging or \n     camping fees and funds collected from purchases of the \n     lifetime pass for citizens 62 years of age or older.\n       Title VII would clarify or expand authorities for \n     activities that the NPS are already conducting to allow us to \n     better serve the American people. This includes providing \n     clear authority for the interpretation and education work of \n     the NPS by consolidating a number of disparate authorities \n     currently used, and directing the Secretary to ensure that \n     management of National Park System units and related areas is \n     enhanced by the availability and utilization of a broad \n     program of the highest quality interpretation and education. \n     Title VII would also raise the age limit for participation in \n     the Public Lands Corp from 25 to 30 and extend the direct-\n     hire authority from 120 days to 2 years, consistent with \n     Department of the Interior resource assistant direct-hire \n     authority. And, this title would remove the $3.5 million \n     authorization ceiling for the Volunteers in the Parks to \n     accommodate the funding needed to support this growing \n     program.\n       Title VIII would establish the NPS Visitor Services \n     Management Authority (VMSA), and authorize the Secretary to \n     establish a program to allow the VMSA to award and manage \n     contracts for the operation of commercial visitor services \n     programs and activities.\n       Title IX would authorize the Secretary to enter into \n     agreements for the creation of reproductions of a museum \n     object in which the object and its intellectual property \n     rights are under the control of the Secretary. The \n     Administration is developing additional language related to \n     the protection of NPS intellectual property, which we intend \n     to transmit under separate cover.\n       Title X would redesignate the Secretary of the Interior and \n     the Director of the NPS as ex officio members of the NPF \n     board. It also would authorize appropriations of $25 million \n     for each of FY 2016 through FY 2026 to NPF that would be used \n     to leverage additional non-federal funds to support our \n     national parks.\n       The effect of this draft bill on the deficit is:\n\n                                                                                          FISCAL YEARS\n                                                                                      [dollars in millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      2015             2016            2017            2018            2019            2020            2021            2022            2023            2024            2025            Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n           45              312             476             386              67             -71             -11             -52              81             -38             -92           1,103\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) Act of 2010 provides \n     that revenue and direct spending legislation cannot, in the \n     aggregate, increase the on-budget deficit. If such \n     legislation increases the on-budget deficit and that increase \n     is not offset by the end of the congressional session, a \n     sequestration must be ordered.
