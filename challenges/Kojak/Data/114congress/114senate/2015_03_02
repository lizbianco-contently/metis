Mr. President, this week promises to be a busy one. \nJust across the street, an important ObamaCare case will be argued \nbefore the Supreme Court, and tomorrow, here in the Capitol, Israeli \nPrime Minister Netanyahu will address a joint session of Congress. It \nis an important speech that comes at a very important time. Iran's \nlongstanding determination to develop nuclear capabilities poses a \nthreat to Israel, America, and the world. It is a threat Netanyahu is \nsingularly capable of explaining at such a critical moment in U.S.-\nIsraeli relations.\n  Meanwhile, the new Senate will continue to pursue good ideas for the \nmiddle class. On the floor and in committee, both this week and in the \nweeks to come, we expect to see more bipartisan action on behalf of the \nAmerican people on a range of issues, from human trafficking to the \nNLRB. For instance, we will offer Senators a chance to stand tall for \nbasic fairness in the workplace by overturning the administration's \nambush rule, which seeks to weaken workers' rights, and we will keep up \nthe fight for sensible, bipartisan ideas such as the Keystone jobs \nbill.\n  This positive approach stands in stark contrast to the partisan \nposture we have seen from our friends on the other side of the aisle.\n  The President's veto of the bipartisan Keystone bill represents a \nvictory for partisanship and for powerful special interests. The \nPresident's veto of the bipartisan Keystone bill represents a defeat \nfor jobs, for infrastructure, and for the middle class. That is why \nCongress needs to try and overturn it.\n  We had hoped to have that vote tomorrow, but for some reason \nDemocrats are actually filibustering that vote. It takes 67 votes to \novercome a veto, more than the 60 required to overcome a filibuster. So \nthere is no reason for a filibuster, other than to cause delay and \ngridlock simply for its own sake.\n  It is certainly disappointing. But the new Congress won't be deterred \nfrom fighting for jobs and the middle class. We will keep fighting for \nthis good idea, and we will keep fighting for other good ideas.\n  We will also keep up our fight to fund the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. The people watched Democrats filibuster Homeland Security \nfunding for weeks. On Friday they watched Democrats--including many who \nimplied they would actually do something about the President's \noverreach--filibuster a commonsense bill from Senator Collins. Now \nAmericans are learning that Democrats might even try and prevent the \nSenate and the House of Representatives from reconciling their bills to \nget the Department funded. It just doesn't make any sense, especially \nwhen we consider the words of the minority leader himself. He said that \ngoing to conference ``has been the custom in the Senate and the House \nof Representatives for more than 200 years.'' At 5:30 p.m. we will have \na vote to do just that. We invite the minority leader and his party to \njoin us in supporting this effort to go to conference.\n  It is interesting to see the distance between rhetoric and reality \nwith some of our good friends on the other side--not just on \nconferencing bills, not just on addressing the President's overreach, \nbut also with the use of the filibuster itself. Some of the folks who \nare now filibustering simply for the sake of delaying and causing \ngridlock are the same folks who used to denounce the use of the \nfilibuster. It is easy to see that they really weren't very serious.\n  The truth is that a better way is possible for our colleagues. I \ninvite our Democratic friends to drop all the negativity, drop all the \ngridlock, and join Republicans in advancing a positive agenda for the \nAmerican people instead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/02/senate-section/article/S1207-6", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1207-S1208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n            The Israeli Prime Minister's Speech To Congress\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, our strongest and most loyal ally in the \nMiddle East faces a growing existential threat under the specter of a \nnuclear Iran. I am deeply troubled that our President's solution won't \nwork. Rather than enforcing punitive measures that would stem Iran's \nnuclear progress, this administration has opted for a policy of \nconciliation that does nothing to curb this growing threat. All the \nwhile, the threat to Israel grows stronger every day.\n\n  Now more than ever the Congress and the American people must stand \nwith our Israeli allies to ensure the safety and security not only of \nour two nations, but the Middle East as a whole. Far from being a \npolitical stunt, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to \na joint session of Congress provides our Nation with a vital \nopportunity to demonstrate our unyielding resolve to stand with Israel \nand oppose Iran's development of nuclear weapons.\n  To demonstrate our solidarity with Israel, Congress should complement \nthe Prime Minister's address with the threat of sanctions that properly \nsecure both of our countries against the Iranian threat. We must \nachieve three commonsense objectives:\n  First, we must prevent Iran from developing or otherwise acquiring \nnuclear weapons.\n  Second, we should reaffirm that Iran does not have an inherent right \nto enrichment and reprocessing capabilities and technologies under the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n  Third, we must seek to reverse the development of Iran's illicit \nnuclear infrastructure and bring Iran into compliance with all United \nNations Security Council resolutions.\n  President Obama has failed to realize that Iran poses a serious \nthreat to the West, and our response to that threat must be equally \nserious. Prime Minister Netanyahu understands the precariousness of the \ncurrent situation, and he is doing his best to help us here in the \nUnited States understand. As the Prime Minister stated: ``I am going to \nthe United States not because I seek a confrontation with the \npresident, but because I must fulfill my obligation to speak up on a \nmatter that affects the very survival of my country.''\n  The Prime Minister has good reason to be concerned. According to the \nHeritage Foundation, since the Obama administration began to relax \nsanctions after an interim agreement was implemented, the Iranian \neconomy grew by an estimated 4.6 percent in the first quarter of Iran's \ncalendar year--the first time it has grown after shrinking for the last \n2 years under sanctions.\n  As we lose leverage by relaxing sanctions, we must not forget the \nmost likely reason Iran agreed to negotiations in the first place was \neconomic restrictions. When the Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is \nreported to have said after the announcement of the Joint Plan of \nAction that ``the centrifuges are spinning and will never stop,'' \nshould we curtail our efforts in the one area that appears to give Iran \npause?\n  Times such as these require strength of purpose, which is why we \nshould clearly lay out a series of sanctions that will be imposed on \nIran if negotiations fail. We should provide for short but reasonable \nperiods of time for Congress, and, therefore, the American people, to \nconsider if the Obama administration has succeeded in accomplishing the \nthree objectives necessary to prevent Iran from developing nuclear \nweapons.\n  Tomorrow, the Congress will hear from Prime Minister Netanyahu. In \nhis message, I believe, he will tell us how we together can confront \nthe growing Iranian threat. This is the time to rally as one Nation \nwith one of our strongest allies to ensure a safe and secure world.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, tomorrow we will gather in the House \nChamber to listen to an address from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin \nNetanyahu. I welcome Prime Minister Netanyahu to Capitol Hill and \neagerly await his speech. It is expected that he will paint a very \nvivid and very real picture of the danger a nuclear Iran poses not just \nto Israel but to the international community as a whole. This threat \nseems of little concern to the administration--so little, in fact, that \nthe President almost immediately dismissed the idea of meeting with \nPrime Minister Netanyahu while he is in Washington. This is \ndisappointing, to say the least.\n  Instead of taking the opportunity to join with us to reaffirm our \nsupport for the State of Israel, the administration has chosen to send \nthe wrong message to our strongest ally in the region. Unfortunately, \nthis has become a pattern. While the administration's official policy \nhas been supportive of Israel, actions speak louder than words, and \nregrettably this administration's actions are often too quiet. This has \nnot always been the case. During his first term, President Obama fought \nPalestinian efforts to delegitimize Israel at the U.N. He made clear \nthat such tactics were counterproductive to the peace process and that \nthe Palestinians would put their relationship with us in jeopardy if \nthey sought action against Israel at the International Criminal Court.\n  Many Israelis are rightfully concerned that we will not have their \nbacks when the Palestinian Authority becomes a full member of the \nInternational Criminal Court and follows through on this threat. I \nraised this issue with Secretary Kerry during an Appropriations \nCommittee hearing last week, reminding him that the law explicitly \nprohibits funding for the Palestinian Authority if they initiate or \nactively support an International Criminal Court investigation into \nalleged Israeli war crimes. The Secretary said that the Palestinian \nAuthority's actions amounted to a ``terrible exercise in judgment'' but \nstopped short of saying they have violated the law in a way that \ntriggers the cutoff of aid.\n  Three-quarters of this body--Republicans and Democrats alike--don't \nsee it that way. We sent the Israeli people a strong bipartisan message \nof support when we called on Secretary Kerry to suspend economic aid \nwhile the State Department reviews the Palestinian Authority's actions. \nAccording to Secretary Kerry's response at the hearing, the State \nDepartment will wait to see what the Palestinians do after the first of \nApril before making a decision on economic aid. By then it might be too \nlate.\n  This is exactly why the people of Israel are uneasy with the ongoing \nnuclear negotiations. The same administration that once spoke out \nforcefully against these types of tactics now plays a game of wait-and-\nsee with the Palestinians, somehow expecting them to be an honest \npartner this time around.\n  Israel's lack of confidence in the administration's support is \ncertainly understandable. Let's not forget that this same \nadministration employs high-level officials who publicly disrespect our \nally, including at least one willing\n\n[[Page S1209]]\n\nto use derogatory language to call Prime Minister Netanyahu names \nduring a media interview. Every time that happens, the administration \ncarries on as though these breaches of diplomatic protocol are \nirrelevant to the U.S.-Israeli relations. The administration sees these \nactions as having no bearing on the deteriorating state of relations \nbetween the two heads of state. Yet, if Prime Minister Netanyahu dares \nto speak up, the administration labels Israel a problem child--case in \npoint: the President's National Security Adviser calling this upcoming \naddress from Prime Minister Netanyahu ``destructive of the fabric of \nthe relationship.'' Accepting an invitation from the Speaker of the \nHouse to address Congress on the severity of the nuclear threat posed \nby the regime in Tehran is only destructive for U.S.-Israeli relations \nin the President's eyes because he wants to keep Congress in the dark \nabout the ongoing negotiations. This administration seems intent on \ndoing just that.\n  Not content with the message the Prime Minister is likely to deliver, \nthe administration has moved from actively trying to subvert his \naddress to Congress. According to the Associated Press, the Obama \nadministration is actively considering ways to undermine the Prime \nMinister's visit. Why is that? Could it be that the Prime Minister sees \nthe flaws of any agreement the Paris talks will yield, and does the \nadministration want to keep this from Congress?\n  As the talks extend on and Tehran engages in more delay tactics, it \nis apparent that the Obama administration is pursuing a weaker deal \nwith Iran that will allow the country to continue its illicit nuclear \nprogram. This agreement has become a must-win for President Obama, so \nhe is willing to concede key requirements that Congress and members of \nhis administration have previously outlined in order to get the \nIranians to sign on the dotted line. Any agreement will be a victory in \nthe Obama administration's eyes.\n  Our longstanding policy that the Iranian regime must abandon its \nnuclear ambitions is itself being abandoned. As former Secretary of \nState Henry Kissinger noted in his recent testimony to the Armed \nServices Committee, the Paris talks have long moved from eliminating \nIran's ability to enrich uranium to limiting and monitoring a smaller \nprogram that would be unable to produce the material for a warhead in \nless than a year's time. This is a far cry from the starting point \nSecretary Kerry once argued when he said: ``No deal is better than a \nbad deal'' with Iran. Now we seem to be moving the goalposts from the \ndismantling of Iran's nuclear program to containing it. That is not \nwhat the President told us these talks were going to accomplish. That \nis not what six U.N. resolutions intended to prevent. That is certainly \nnot something this Congress should allow to happen without our say.\n  Nothing short of full elimination of Iran's nuclear program could \nhonestly be considered a victory. If these talks fail to produce an \nagreement that requires that of Iran, Congress must have the authority \nto reject it.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, in an hour and a half the Senate will vote \non the House request to go to conference on the Department of Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill. This push by House Republicans to go to \nconference is the very definition of an exercise in futility. I have \nbeen very clear for days now that we will not go to conference. The \nmajority knows that, and the Speaker of the House knows that. Senate \nDemocrats will not support going to conference because it would be \ntotally counterproductive.\n  House Republicans have no intention of using that conference to craft \nlegislation that will pass both Houses of Congress, and in so doing \nthey would make sure we had a shutdown of Homeland Security, and that \nwould be very bad for the country.\n  House Republicans want to take a bill that they negotiated, a bill \nthat was written by House and Senate Republicans and Democrats last \nDecember--it was a bipartisan, bicameral bill, and now they want to \ntake that bill and turn it into something that cannot pass. That won't \nhappen. We will not be a party to yet another charade by House \nRepublicans because that would inevitably shut down Homeland Security \nand put our Nation at risk--and that is an understatement.\n  The Senate should reaffirm our bipartisan vote last Friday for a \nclean bill to prevent a shutdown. We had 68 votes. We can do it again, \nand we should do it again. That vote will happen at 5:30 p.m. this \nafternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            The Israeli Prime Minister's Speech To Congress\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, during the 2012 Presidential campaign, \nPresident Obama made a claim. His claim was: ``I have Israel's back.'' \nThis week President Obama and his administration are turning their back \non Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, and they are doing it \nright here during the Prime Minister's visit to Washington.\n  While he won't have a meeting in the White House, he will have a very \nsupportive audience right here on Capitol Hill. The Prime Minister will \nreceive a warm welcome from Members of Congress who are concerned about \nIsrael's security and the value of this very important relationship.\n  In his speech to Congress tomorrow, the Prime Minister is going to \naddress the ongoing negotiations with Iran over illicit nuclear \nprograms. If President Obama's past negotiations with our adversaries \nare any guide, Israel is right to be apprehensive. The Obama \nadministration started negotiating with Iran more than five years ago. \nA series of increasingly tough sanctions have damaged the Iranian \neconomy and have finally convinced them to discuss their nuclear \nprogram seriously. In 2013 the President announced his 6-month interim \nagreement. The United States would suspend enforcement of some of the \nsanctions that had brought Iran to the table. In exchange the Iranians \nwould freeze and reverse specific elements of their nuclear program. \nThis was supposed to provide time for a final agreement to be \nnegotiated within a year. That 6-month interim agreement has now \nextended to 17 months.\n  President Obama mishandled these negotiations from the very beginning\n\n[[Page S1210]]\n\nby conceding Iran's right to enrich uranium. In my opinion the \nPresident is compounding the problem as he chases the comprehensive \nagreement maybe to justify his Nobel Peace Prize. Information has \nleaked out occasionally about the negotiations. Each time there seems \nto be another point on which the United States has given in to the \nIranian position. Iran has gotten about $10 billion in much needed hard \ncurrency since signing the interim agreement. It has gotten additional \nincome from the suspension of other sanctions. We have no way to stop \nIran from using this money to support terrorists around the world or to \nprop up Bashar al-Assad in Syria.\n  What I heard, along with a number of Senators who went to Saudi \nArabia a little over a month ago to meet with some of the Free Syrian \nArmy, is that the freedom fighters from Syria who had come down to \nSaudi Arabia to meet with us said that this is exactly what Iran is \ndoing with some of the money gained from the relief of sanctions. They \nare using it to prop up al-Assad and also to fund Hezbollah and Hamas.\n  The Obama administration has said its goal is to keep Iran 1 year \naway from being able to construct a nuclear weapon. That is the same \nlevel the administration said Iran was at in 2013 when sanctions were \nstill fully in force. Apparently, the Obama administration is aiming \nfor a final deal that suspends sanctions on Iran and does not constrain \nits nuclear program any more than it was before the interim agreement.\n  Let me be clear. If the Obama administration allows Iran to continue \nwith its illicit nuclear program, the global community will be less \nsafe, less stable, and less secure. Any treaty that we sign with Iran \nmust be accountable, enforceable, and verifiable. So far, it doesn't \nappear to me that the Obama administration is negotiating a deal that \nwould meet that standard.\n  The administration has also undermined Israeli security in other \nareas as well, specifically, when it comes to Middle East peace \nnegotiations with the Palestinians. U.S. law prohibits sending any \nmoney to international organizations that admit the Palestinians as a \nstate. The idea was to support the peace talks by letting the two sides \nwork out their differences without others putting their thumb on the \nscale. So it was a problem when the Palestinians sought and received \nrecognition as a full member state in the United Nations group UNESCO. \nThis happened in 2012. That is the United Nations Educational, \nScientific, and Cultural Organization. The Palestinians triggered that \nlaw, and that stopped U.S. money from going to UNESCO. In every budget \nrequest since, President Obama has tried to restore the money in spite \nof the law. This would excuse the Palestinians and the United Nations \nfrom the consequences of their actions. It sends a signal that the \nUnited States does not, in fact, have Israel's back.\n  Vice President Biden said: ``Don't tell me what you value. Show me \nyour budget, and I'll tell you what you value.''\n  By that standard, it is obvious that President Obama does not value \nsupporting Israel in the international peace negotiations. National \nSecurity Advisor Susan Rice said just last week that Prime Minister \nNetanyahu's visit is too partisan and ``destructive of the fabric of \nthe relationship'' Israel has with the United States.\n  Members of Congress disagree. We welcome the Prime Minister. We are \neager to show our support, and Republicans will continue to push for \nadditional sanctions to keep the pressure on Iran. We intend to do all \nthat we can to ensure that the vital alliance between the United States \nand Israel remains strong.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time under the \nquorum calls this afternoon be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Wasteful Spending\n\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, last week I came to the floor to launch \nwhat I have called Waste of the Week. I will put my prop up here. Waste \nof the Week is designed to provide awareness in simple ways to our \ncolleagues here, how we can look at government spending that doesn't \nstack up in terms of something that is needed. Perhaps it was needed at \none particular time, or perhaps it is something the taxpayers shouldn't \nbe paying for in the first place.\n  I would like to raise awareness, and I am going to do that each week. \nThis is my second week. This evening I wish to present the second Waste \nof the Week. Last week we talked about the $6 billion that could be \nsaved if we simply fixed a program that was duplicating checks to \ntaxpayers who only qualified for payments from one of those programs, \nnot both. If you are disabled and can't work, you can qualify for \nSocial Security disability. Alternatively, you can qualify for \nunemployment insurance if you can work, but you are not able to find a \njob. You can qualify for unemployment insurance, but you can't get \nboth. You either can work, or you can't work. Here are two Federal \nprograms that shockingly cost the taxpayers $6 billion.\n  This is the second week of Waste of the Week, and I would like to \ntalk about duplication in government. While it is a little harder to \nput a specific fiscal number on the savings, clearly we can save the \ntaxpayer money and start this process. We can do this even in small \nways to reduce our debt and deficit and not load all this debt on our \nchildren and grandchildren. We have tried the big stuff for years, and \nI was directly engaged as much as I possibly could be the last 4 years, \nall to be rejected by the President. Let's at least look at the smaller \nstuff and do something to get started with this process of getting us \nback on track to fiscal health.\n  What we have found is there are 52 separate programs that provide \nworkplace training, financial instructions, and preparation for people \nso they can find a job--52 separate programs. You have to ask yourself, \nhow in the world did we ever get to 52? I think some stems from good \nintentions. They'll say let's get a training program put together \nthrough some agency in the government that can better prepare people \nfor employment and job opportunities.\n  The Small Business Administration puts one together, and the \nDepartment of Agriculture says we ought to have a training program, the \nDepartment of Commerce says we should have a training program, and then \na Member of Congress says, you know, that is a good idea, I would like \nto propose that, too.\n  Over the years we have come up to 52 programs that provide workforce \ntraining. Obviously, this is ripe for reform and there should be \nconsolidation for the benefit of the taxpayer.\n  I was pleasantly surprised to learn the President's 2016 budget \nincorporates a measure that doesn't deal with all 52, but it starts \nwith 6 major programs and recommends consolidation. I am not often \nstanding here on the Senate floor commending the President for taking a \npositive step in dealing with our debt and deficit. He refused to do \nthat on any kind of major basis in the last 4 years. But here is his \n2016 budget, we can start with six programs to consolidate that--\nprograms that primarily do business and trade--affect business and \ntrade agencies as well as other related programs.\n  I am quoting from the budget, ``integrating the Government's core \ntrade and competitiveness functions into one new Department.'' Well, \nsurprise of surprises, I am here promoting something the President has \nput in his budget.\n  Let me specifically state what these consolidations would affect. It \nincludes the Department of Commerce's core business and trade \nfunctions. It includes Small Business Administration programs, the \nOffice of U.S. Trade Representative, the Export-Import Bank, the \nOverseas Private Investment Corporation, and the U.S. Trade and \nDevelopment Agency. Each of these six, as outlined by the President's \nbudget, can be consolidated into one program.\n  What does that save? It means saving on all the rent or the purchase \nor the cost of the property for the government to house six different \nprograms\n\n[[Page S1211]]\n\nwith six different administrators, six different sets of employees and \nbureaucrats and personnel, computers, phone costs--on and on it goes. \nThey continue to metastasize and grow.\n  Now let's put a price on this so I can add this to my thermometer \nhere. We're in the process of trying to save the taxpayer $100 billion \nand last week we came up with $5.7 billion of savings. This week it is \nmuch smaller at $200 million, though it is not chump change. It is $200 \nmillion estimated savings by consolidating these 6 programs. Around \nhere that is deemed a small number. To the people I represent in \nIndiana, that is a lot of money. We say, well, the government is \nspending that? No, the government is spending taxpayer money to provide \nduplication of programs. We think it will ultimately save a lot more as \nwe go forward and define additional consolidations down the line.\n  We are going to put a little more red on the chart to represent \nsavings. This thermometer will keep rising and rising as I come down \nhere and present the Waste of the Week. Mr. President, $200 million in \nsavings can be achieved simply by consolidating programs that are \nduplicating each other in terms of what they are providing.\n  We can't solve all of our country's debt and deficit problems \novernight, but we can take needed steps to identify those that the \ngovernment's own accounting agencies--independent of Republicans and \nDemocrats--have identified as wasteful money. Let's get this money back \nto the taxpayer. Let's eliminate this money to reduce our debt so our \nchildren and grandchildren don't have to pony up more and let's end up \nwith a much more efficient and effective Federal Government.\n  With that, I finish this week's Waste of the Week and look forward to \nbeing here next week for another iteration.\n  I yield back my time, if there is any left.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Lynch Nomination\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, this weekend the United States will mark \nthe 50th anniversary of the march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. \nThose of us who are not old enough to remember 50 years ago have read \nthe history. Those of us who were old enough at that time saw what \nhappened at that historic march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge five \ndecades ago. Scores of courageous Americans refused to be silent about \nthe need for equal protection under the law. This was a case where \ntheir blood, sweat, and tears helped move our Nation toward a more \nperfect union. One of those who actually shed blood--in fact, nearly \ndied on that march for freedom and equality--is one of my closest \nfriends in Congress, Congressman John Lewis of Georgia.\n  Last Thursday I was so proud when Congressman Lewis came to the \nSenate Judiciary Committee room to see a vote on the historic \nnomination of Loretta Lynch to serve as our next Attorney General. He \nsaid he was compelled to come because this was no ordinary markup and \nthis is no ordinary confirmation. When the Senate finally confirms her, \nLoretta Lynch will be the first African-American woman to serve our \ncountry as Attorney General.\n  She is extraordinarily qualified for the job. The letters and \ntestimony I have received from law enforcement and both Republican and \nDemocratic prosecutors attesting to how good she is, are amazing. I \nurge the Senate to consider her nomination immediately and confirm her \nthis week. She has waited much longer than any modern nominee ever has \nfor this position.\n  But as I urge her confirmation, I cannot help but reflect on the fact \nthat Ms. Lynch's confirmation will be another step toward realizing Dr. \nMartin Luther King's dream that people in our country would be judged \nby the content of their character. Loretta Lynch's life epitomizes that \ndream.\n  She was born in Greensboro and was raised in Durham, NC. She is the \ndaughter of a fourth-generation Baptist preacher and a school \nlibrarian. I have met Reverend Lynch. He is an amazing and inspiring \nman. Her parents instilled in her the American values of fairness and \nequality, even when those around them were not living up to those \nvalues. Ms. Lynch has spoken about riding on her father's shoulders as \na child to their church, where students organized peaceful protests \nagainst racial segregation. The freedom songs and the church music that \nwent hand-in-hand with those protests undoubtedly made up the \nsoundtrack of her childhood. The Judiciary Committee was honored to \nhave her father, Reverend Lorenzo Lynch, with us not only at both days \nof her historic hearing in January but also with us last Thursday as \nthe Committee considered his daughter's nomination.\n  Throughout Loretta Lynch's life, those who encountered her \nintelligence and tenacity have not always been prepared to accept her \nand her impressive accomplishments. But each time they didn't accept \nit, the content of her character has shone through and led her to even \ngreater heights.\n  In elementary school, administrators did not believe that Loretta \nLynch could score as high has she did on a standardized test. They \ndemanded that she retake the test. She did, and she scored even higher \nthe second time. In high school she rose to the very top of her class, \nwhich would have made her the first African-American valedictorian. \nSchool administrators, however, decided that even though she had earned \nthe title, it would somehow be too controversial. So, they decided she \nmust share the honor with two other students, one of whom was white, \neven though she was the one who scored the highest. This didn't hold \nher back. She kept going forward. She went on to graduate with honors \nfrom Harvard College and then earned her law degree from Harvard Law \nSchool.\n  This has been the story of Loretta Lynch's life. While some are not \nready to embrace her distinction, she just marches forward with grace \nto prove that she is even stronger and more qualified than her \ndetractors can imagine. Even though she was required to be better than \nthose who were holding her back, she didn't let that stop her. She just \nkept going forward. She has dedicated the majority of her remarkable \ncareer to public service and we are fortunate as a nation that she \nwants to continue to serve.\n  The President of the United States announced that Loretta Lynch would \nbe nominated to be our Nation's chief law enforcement official on \nNovember 8th.\n  Right after this announcement, Senate Republicans made clear that \ndespite the urgent challenges facing this country, they would object to \neven begin consideration of her nomination during the lame duck period. \nSo Loretta Lynch's historic nomination waited. As she prepared for her \nconfirmation hearing, she stayed focused on her current position and \ncontinued to lead a dedicated team of prosecutors to bring terrorists \nand serious criminals to justice in New York.\n  Ms. Lynch was finally called before the Judiciary Committee at the \nend of January. She had more poise and credibility than any nominee I \nhave seen in my four decades in the Senate. Any reasonable observer of \nher hearing, which lasted almost 8 hours, would conclude that she was \nbeyond impressive and that she possesses the leadership, intellect, and \nwisdom needed to help keep our country safe. After the hearings, \nRepublicans submitted an unprecedented number of written questions to \nMs. Lynch, even though every member had been allowed ample time to ask \nlive questions at her hearing. Even members who had already publicly \ndeclared that they opposed her confirmation continued to submit scores \nof questions.\n  But now, 114 days have passed since Ms. Lynch was nominated. She has \nbeen made to wait longer than any one of the previous five Attorneys \nGeneral--five Attorneys General in both Democratic and Republican \nadministrations. And for what reason? So that those who have already \nsaid they oppose the nomination can try to score additional political \npoints? When Ms. Lynch is told she must continue to\n\n[[Page S1212]]\n\nwait longer than any of the modern Attorneys General, that she must \nwait for her confirmation vote, I am reminded that those dedicated to \nthe fight for civil rights have long heard their detractors tell them: \nJust be patient. We can't give you your rights yet. Just be patient. \nJust wait your turn.\n  Well, come on. No Member of this body--of either party--would ever \nstand for anyone saying: Notwithstanding your qualifications, wait your \nturn.\n  Ms. Lynch grew up hearing her family's stories about the Jim Crow \nSouth. She knows the meaning of injustice. She would never compare the \npartisan political games being played with her nomination to the epic \nstruggles her family faced.\n  But as we in this Chamber reflect this week to honor those Americans \nwho marched in Selma and the role our Department of Justice played in \nthe civil rights movement, it should not be too much to ask just how \nmuch longer Loretta Lynch has to wait. How much longer does this woman \nhave to wait before she can become the next U.S. Attorney General? In \nthese perilous times, our Nation deserves to have its chief law \nenforcement officer considered without further delay.\n  At the Judiciary Committee's markup last week, Senator Durbin spoke \npassionately about the ``solemn, important, and historic moment'' \nbefore us in considering Ms. Lynch's nomination. His comments were \nmoving, and they appealed to our responsibility as Senators to uphold \nthe Constitution and provide advice and consent on the President's \nnominees. We can do so this week by confirming Loretta Lynch.\n  We have played politics with too many things already in the young \ndays of this 114th Congress. From the spending bill the House \nRepublicans refused to take up to fund the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, to the nomination of this highly qualified woman to serve as \nthe Nation's chief law enforcement officer, we can no longer put \nnational security at risk just for the sake of a few talking points or \na second or two on a television program.\n  So I call on my friend, the majority leader, to simply set a date for \nher confirmation. Do not leave the American people wondering if this \nextremely qualified woman will get a timely vote. Treat her like every \nprevious Attorney General nominee. The Nation faces too many challenges \nto play politics with this important nomination.\n  Too long some in this body have told her: You have to wait. You have \nto wait your turn. You have to wait.\n  No, she has proven her qualifications. She shouldn't have to wait any \nmore than those who went before her. Set an up-or-down vote. Let's \nconfirm her nomination.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, here we are again where we were last \nMonday with about 5 days left before funding runs out for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. So if it feels like ``Groundhog Day,'' \nit is because it is ``Groundhog Day,'' and we just can't keep playing \nthose kinds of games with this agency's funding.\n  Those who are blocking action on the funding bill for the Department \nof Homeland Security have a clear choice: Are they going to prioritize \npolitics or are they going to prioritize national security?\n  Last Friday the Senate passed a bill with 68 bipartisan votes--a bill \nthat fully funds the Department of Homeland Security without any \ncontroversial riders attached to the bill. I am ever hopeful that the \nHouse will follow our lead and immediately take up that clean Senate \nbill. We cannot, we should not replay the chaos we saw last week. The \nbrinksmanship really needs to end. It is time for Congress to pass the \nDepartment of Homeland Security funding bill.\n  Whether it is threats to the Mall of America in Minnesota, plots \nfoiled by DHS and the FBI in New York City, attacks on our cyber \nnetworks, or threats at our Nation's borders, we live during a time \nwhen the safety and security of this country are at risk. We cannot \nplay politics with the agency that is tasked with keeping us safe, and \nwe shouldn't play politics with the funding that supports our first \nresponders--the very people who are there anytime something happens in \nour States and our local communities. What must our enemies think when \nthey see Congress fighting over whether to keep the Department of \nHomeland Security open?\n  Last week DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson wrote a letter to the \ncongressional leadership, and I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record the letter from Secretary Johnson.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                U.S. Department of\n\n\n                                            Homeland Security,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 26, 2015.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Boehner, Majority Leader McConnell, Minority \n     Leader Reid, and Minority Leader Pelosi: Thank you for your \n     leadership and efforts to pass a clean, full-year \n     appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security. \n     As you know, our funding expires tomorrow at midnight. I \n     write to explain to Members of Congress the real and \n     substantial consequences of a failure to pass a full-year \n     appropriations bill by that deadline.\n       As an initial matter, it must be noted that a potential \n     shutdown of the Department comes at a particularly \n     challenging time for homeland security. It is stunning that \n     we must even contemplate a shutdown of the Department in the \n     current global context. The global terrorist threat has \n     become more decentralized and complex. Terrorist \n     organizations are now openly calling for attacks on Western \n     targets. Yesterday's arrests in New York City highlight the \n     threat of independent actors in the homeland who support \n     overseas terrorist organizations and radical ideology. We are \n     working hard to stay one step ahead of potential threats to \n     aviation security. Last year at this time, the spike in \n     migrant children began to appear at our border; we are \n     deployed to prevent this situation from recurring, and to \n     address it aggressively if it does. The Nation is in the \n     midst of a very cold, harsh winter, and the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency is working with states impacted by record \n     snowfalls.\n       Here are just some of the consequences for homeland \n     security if the Department's funding lapses and we shut down:\n       First, about 170,000 employees will be required to work, \n     but will not get paid for that work during the period of a \n     shutdown. This includes our Coast Guard, Border Patrol \n     agents, Secret Service agents, Transportation Security \n     Administration officers, and others on the front lines of our \n     homeland security. These working men and women depend on \n     biweekly paychecks to make ends meet for themselves and their \n     families. For them, personally, work without pay is \n     disruptive and demoralizing. Even worse for our people are \n     the public statements by some that make light of a shutdown, \n     which disregards DHS employees' personal sacrifices and \n     dedication to our Nation's security.\n       Second, approximately 30,000 men and women of the \n     Department must be furloughed and sent home without pay. Our \n     financial management, human resources, procurement and \n     contracting, and information technology teams--the \n     institutional backbone of the Department--will be reduced by \n     90 percent, from over 2,000 to just 208 people. My own \n     immediate headquarters staff will be cut by about 87 percent. \n     Our Science and Technology team, which is intensely focused \n     on developing non-metallic explosive detection capabilities \n     as well as other technologies to counter threats to aviation, \n     will be cut 94 percent, from 448 to 26 people. Our Domestic \n     Nuclear Detection Office, which is our Nation's primary \n     research and development lead for development of advanced \n     nuclear detection technologies and technical forensic \n     capabilities, will also be cut 94 percent, from 121 to just 7 \n     people.\n       Third, contracting services across the Department, \n     including those for critical mission support activities, will \n     be disrupted and/or interrupted altogether. Depending upon \n     the length of a shutdown, contract awards and major \n     acquisitions could be impacted. In the event of a shutdown, \n     negotiations to construct the United States Coast Guard's 8th \n     National Security Cutter will be delayed, potentially leading \n     to an increase in costs.\n       Fourth, our $2.5 billion-a-year grant-making to state, \n     local, tribal, and territorial governments, to assist them in \n     preventing, responding to or recovering from terrorist \n     attacks, major disasters and other emergencies, remains at a \n     standstill (it has already stopped because the Department is \n     currently funded by a Continuing Resolution). Of particular \n     note, the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Emergency \n     Management Performance Grants, which\n\n[[Page S1213]]\n\n     contribute 50 percent of the salaries of state and local \n     emergency management personnel, cannot be funded.\n       Fifth, public assistance disaster recovery payments to \n     communities affected by previous disasters will grind to a \n     halt. Though these payments are funded with prior-year money, \n     the Federal Emergency Management Agency's staff that \n     processes them must be furloughed.\n       Sixth, depending upon the length of a shutdown, DHS will no \n     longer be able to support state and local authorities with \n     planning, safety, and security resources for special security \n     events such as the Boston and Chicago Marathons.\n       Seventh, depending upon the length of a shutdown, work to \n     complete construction of the National Bio and Agro-Defense \n     Facility in Kansas, which will replace the aging l950s-era \n     Plum Island facility in New York, could be disrupted.\n       Eighth, new hires across the Department must be halted, \n     disrupting critical missions to secure the border, protect \n     millions of daily airline passengers, strengthen security at \n     the White House, and deploy new ICE investigators. Routine \n     attrition hiring would cease across the Department, seriously \n     undermining our homeland security frontline staffing needs. \n     Our plans to increase CBP staffing at our ports of entry by \n     2,000 officers, and to maintain the Transportation Security \n     Administration's workforce of airport screeners and air \n     marshals will be undermined. Our plans to hire additional \n     Secret Service uniformed officers and special agents will \n     also be disrupted.\n       Ninth, without funding, all training at the Federal Law \n     Enforcement Training Centers will cease. Up to 2,000 local, \n     state, and federal law enforcement trainees from across the \n     country will be sent home.\n       Finally, as I have noted many times, mere extension of a \n     continuing resolution has many of the same negative impacts. \n     A short-term continuing resolution exacerbates the \n     uncertainty for my workforce and puts us back in the same \n     position, on the brink of a shutdown just days from now.\n       I urge Congress, as soon as possible, to pass a clean, \n     full-year Fiscal Year 2015 appropriations bill for the \n     Department of Homeland Security.\n       The American people are counting on us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Jeh Charles Johnson,\n                                                        Secretary.\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, the following is a quote from the letter \nthe Secretary wrote:\n\n       It is stunning that we must even contemplate a shutdown of \n     the Department in the current global context. The global \n     terrorist threat has become more decentralized and complex. \n     Terrorist organizations are now openly calling for attacks on \n     western targets.\n\n  The Secretary also noted how taxing the current funding crisis has \nbeen on the agency and the employees who put their lives on the line \nevery day to protect the Nation. He said the following in his letter:\n\n       These working men and women depend on biweekly paychecks to \n     make ends meet for themselves and their families. For them, \n     personally, work without pay is disruptive and demoralizing.\n\n  I can't imagine anyone here thinks people should be expected to go to \nwork--many of them putting their lives on the line--without getting \npaid. Last week DHS officials had to prepare shutdown plans. They had \nto give employees notice that they might be furloughed or they might \nnot get paid.\n  At a time when resources should be spent protecting the Nation, \nspending them dealing with a possible shutdown just doesn't make sense. \nNone of us would run our households that way. The private sector \ndoesn't run business that way. We shouldn't run government that way. \nInstead of focusing on critical missions such as securing the border, \ncounterterrorism efforts, and maritime security, DHS officials have \nbeen consumed with the threat of a shutdown of their agency. That is \nnot the way we should be doing business. It is making our Nation less \nsafe.\n  It is time for the House to end this brinksmanship. It is time for \nthe House to vote on the bipartisan bill the Senate passed last week. \nWe came together in the Senate under the leadership of Senator \nMcConnell and Senator Reid, and I applaud their working together across \nparty lines to pass a bill that funds DHS for the rest of the year. \nThat is what the American people expect of us. They expect us to work \ntogether to address the challenges facing this country. They want us to \nget things done, not to play politics and certainly not to jeopardize \nour country's safety and security.\n  I hope that the House will follow the Senate's lead, that they will \npass a bipartisan bill to keep the Department of Homeland Security on \nthe job for the remainder of this year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, this afternoon we will vote on whether to \ngo to conference on H.R. 240. For Senators who want to return to \nregular order, this is their chance. Regular order is the opportunity \nto offer, to have debate on, and to vote on amendments.\n  We have already established on earlier legislation that the majority \nparty is willing to return to regular order and to offer an open \namendment process. So part of establishing that regular order process \nis, as I say, the opportunity to offer amendments, to have a debate, \nand to vote. It is that process which should and has historically \nproduced the best legislation not only here in the Senate but in the \nHouse--in this Congress--on behalf of the American people.\n  Another part of regular order, though, is conference committees. When \nthe House passes a bill and the Senate passes a bill and there are \ndifferences in the bill, how do we resolve the differences in the bill? \nWe go to a conference committee. So that is what is before us right \nnow. This vote is simply to send H.R. 240 to a conference committee so \nthe House and the Senate can work on the legislation.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle filibustered H.R. 240. \nOnly when amendments were limited to one amendment did they allow us to \nproceed to the bill. That is unfortunate, but clearly it was done to \nprotect the President's Executive order on immigration.\n  The irony is that the President's overreach should not be a partisan \nissue. Our forefathers created a system of checks and balances in our \nConstitution to protect the rights of our citizens. The legislative, \nthe executive, and the judicial branches all have a role to play in \nthis system of checks and balances. When one branch exceeds its \nauthority, the others have an obligation to check that overreach, an \nobligation to protect the rights of our citizens.\n  That is exactly what has happened in this situation. The President's \nExecutive order on immigration exceeds his authority as the leader of \nthe executive branch. Now a Federal district court in Texas has issued \nan injunction to stay the President's action, and that stay is in place \nwhile the lawsuit against the President's action which has been filed \nby 26 States is adjudicated. That is our role too. Just like the States \nstepping up when the President has overreached his authority, just like \nthe Federal court stepping up when the President has exceeded his \nauthority, that is our role too--to protect the legislative power, \nwhich is solely the power of the legislative branch, solely the power \nof Congress.\n  So I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to send H.R. \n240 to conference to see if we can find common ground. That is, after \nall, regular order for the Congress.\n  I again remind our colleagues that this bill provides full funding \nfor the Department of Homeland Security. Let me once again summarize \nsome of that funding. The bill provides $10.7 billion for Customs and \nBorder Protection, CBP, including record levels of personnel, tactical \ninfrastructure, and technology in air and maritime assets. It provides \n$5.96 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, and \nmaintains a record 34,000 adult detention beds and 3,828 family \ndetention beds. The bill strongly supports the vital missions of the \nSecret Service and provides for cyber security efforts. It provides \nmore than $10 billion for the Coast Guard for its many missions, \nincluding search and rescue. Since homeland security is a national \neffort, the bill continues critical funding for grant programs to State \nand local firefighters, emergency managers, and law enforcement. The \nbill also provides for research and development, TSA's aviation \nsecurity screening operations, the Federal law enforcement training \ncenters, and E-Verify, which supports businesses across the United \nStates in hiring legal workers.\n  But in addition to that funding, we also need to check the Executive \naction of the President on immigration. That is what our system of \nchecks and balances under our Constitution is all about. That is the \nopportunity we have--to send this bill to conference with the House to \nfind a solution. Let's\n\n[[Page S1214]]\n\ndo that. Let's find a solution. Let's return to regular order in the \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I encourage the Senate to vote to send \nthe Homeland Security appropriations bill to conference with the House. \nThat should be the order of business. We have been wrangling over this \nbill for 3 months now. The legislative maneuvering has crowded out all \nof the real issues before the Senate on this legislation.\n  We should have debated and voted on the President's actions, the \nExecutive orders which provoked this entire situation. On multiple \noccasions Members on the other side of the aisle have voted unanimously \nto avoid having that debate. First, four times they voted over the \ncourse of 3 weeks to refuse to even consider House-passed funding bill \nlegislation. Their bill was passed by the other body in plenty of time \nto avoid the shutdown that currently consumes the Senate.\n  This won't be the last time during this Congress that the House and \nSenate disagree on an appropriations bill, but it should not be the \nlast time the legislative branch disagrees with the executive branch \nand vice versa. Soon we will begin consideration of the fiscal year \n2016 appropriations bills. Each of these bills will prompt differences, \nbut we should have opportunities for robust debates on these \ndifferences. That is all I am suggesting. We can proceed to conference \nwith the House in a timely manner on the bills. Doing so will help \nprovide opportunities for orderly and direct resolution of differences \nas reported by the various committees. We have done too little of that \nin recent years, and it has been detrimental to the legislative \nprocess.\n  I urge the Senate to support the motion to accept the request for a \nconference committee on the Homeland Security appropriations bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 27 years Gale \nFraser has devoted to the Clark County Regional Flood Control District \nand his work as general manager and chief engineer for the past 22 \nyears.\n  Southern Nevada is known for its dry heat and arid environment, but \nour rare and intense thunderstorms can create dangerous flash floods. \nThese flash floods can cause millions of dollars in property damage and \ntake lives in a matter of seconds. The demand to address this issue \ngrew as the Las Vegas Valley experienced unprecedented development and \npopulation growth for more than three decades. The latest statistics \nshow that more than 2 million people currently live in Clark County, \nand at one point in the 1990s, more than 5,000 people were relocating \nto the area every month of the year.\n  In an effort to address the risks associated with flood waters and \naccommodate the demands of a growing population, the Nevada Legislature \nauthorized the creation of a flood control district in Clark County in \n1985. The Army Corps of Engineers completed a feasibility report in \n1992 on the flood control improvements necessary for the Las Vegas Wash \nand Tributaries, otherwise known as the Tropicana and Flamingo Washes. \nThis massive project included debris basins, detention basins, miles of \nprimary channels, and a network of lateral collector channels. Few \ncould have shouldered such a daunting project, but Gale rose to the \nchallenge.\n  The support and expertise that Gale Fraser and the regional flood \ncontrol district brought to the Tropicana and Flamingo Washes projects \nwas critical to it being authorized by Congress in the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act of 1992. The first Federal appropriations to initiate \nthe construction of the project became available through the Energy and \nWater Resources Development appropriations bill in October 1993. These \nimportant steps and strong partnerships contributed to the completion \nof the Project Cooperation Agreement, which was fully executed in \nFebruary 1995.\n  The Clark County Regional Flood Control District and the Clark County \nPublic Works Department were the local sponsors of the Tropicana and \nFlamingo Washes. Gale, as the head of the Regional Flood Control \nDistrict, was instrumental in shepherding this project through the \nprocess, which has brought safety, security, and peace of mind to the \nresidents of the Las Vegas Valley. Gale's impressive leadership has \npersisted. He further developed plans to improve Clark County's water \ninfrastructure to manage destructive flood waters. To date, under \nGale's leadership, 90 detention basins and approximately 590 miles of \nchannels and underground storm drains have been constructed in Clark \nCounty.\n  On behalf of a grateful community, I thank Mr. Fraser for his years \nof dedicated service to Clark County and his work to ensure responsible \nflood management and public safety in southern Nevada.\n  Gale has also been an active member of the National Association of \nFlood and Stormwater Management Agencies and served as the president of \nthe organization from August 2008 to August 2010. This organization \nincludes many flood control districts and public works agencies across \nthe country that are charged with working with Federal partners, such \nas the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Environmental \nProtection Agency, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to help develop \nand implement public policies regarding storm water quality and flood \nplain management.\n  Although Mr. Fraser will be missed, his legacy will continue to \nbenefit Nevadans and our visitors for generations to come. I \ncongratulate Gale Fraser on his retirement and wish him the best in his \nfuture endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/02/senate-section/article/S1215-3", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1215-S1216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO FRANCIS BROOKS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week marked the end of Francis Brooks' \ntenure as the sergeant-at-arms of the Vermont State House. The position \nof sergeant-at-arms is one of great importance, playing a pivotal role \nin maintaining the order and decorum that Vermonters have come to \nexpect of their State government. It is a job that demands a \ncomprehensive understanding of the people who conduct the important \nwork within the building, and the building itself.\n  Francis Brooks has served the people of the city of Montpelier in a \nnumber of roles. He taught chemistry and physics at Montpelier High \nSchool for 32 years; he was a State legislator for 25 years; and he has \nvolunteered with the Montpelier Fire Department for 40 years. This \nlevel of dedication alone is worthy of appreciation and respect, but \nFrancis's service did not stop there. For the last 7 years, Francis has \nserved his State as sergeant-at-arms.\n  I have fond memories of the Vermont State House. My parents owned the \nLeahy Press, located just across the street, and now home to the \nVermont Arts Council. From our early years and onward, my brother and \nsister and I were always encouraged by our parents to pay attention to \nwhat happened within those walls and to respect the building for what \nit represented. As a young boy I rode my bicycle through the halls of \nthe capitol in Montpelier, sometimes wandering into the private office \nof the Governor, where he sat from behind his desk peering down at me. \nFrancis upheld what I treasure most about our State's capitol--an open \nand welcoming building for all Vermonters. He has not only overseen\n\n[[Page S1216]]\n\nthe preservation and safety of the Vermont State House, but he has \nencouraged the public to use the space to enhance our community through \nevents like the Farmers Night Concert Series, the U.S. Academy \nNominations Ceremony, public discussion forums like the Opiate \nConference, statewide high school debate competitions, and the \ncontinued involvement of young people in our State's political system \nthrough the legislative page program. Every year, Francis chose 30 \neighth graders to serve at the Vermont State House in 6-week periods. \nUpon these students' successful completion of the program, Francis \nwould send them to apply for the U.S. Senate page program--and I was \nalways impressed by the quality of students who represented Vermont in \nthe Nation's Capital.\n  Marcelle and I thank Francis Brooks for the several decades of \nselfless loyalty he has shown to Montpelier and to the State of \nVermont. In a 2011 interview with a Vermont newspaper Seven Days, \nFrancis described the role of the sergeant-at-arms by saying, ``If the \ninside of the [State House] is considered a town, then I'm the town \nmanager.'' Vermont is lucky to have such an inspiring, well-grounded \nand selfless public servant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/02/senate-section/article/S1216-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CONGRATULATING LAURA HARRIS AND TRINITY RICH\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to \nonce again acknowledge the youth volunteers of my home State. I am \nnever surprised but always impressed by what they can achieve--from \nreaching the rank of Eagle Scout to earning Gold Medals from the \nCongressional Awards program and so much more. Today I would like to \nshare the achievements of those who are being recognized by the 20th \nAnnual Prudential Spirit of Community Awards. I couldn't be more proud \nof them all for their heartfelt commitment to the future of Wyoming, \nthe West and our Nation.\n  For the past 20 years, the Prudential Spirit of Community Awards has \nbeen our Nation's largest youth recognition program for volunteer \nservice. Each year, the Prudential Spirit of Community Awards selects \ntwo volunteers who have achieved extraordinary results in their work to \nhelp those in their neighborhoods who need their support. Nominations \ncan be made by school or community organizations or any one of several \nother groups. Nominees then have their accomplishments judged by a \npanel which is tasked with the tremendously difficult job of selecting \nthe winners.\n  This year, Wyoming's two youth volunteers who are receiving this \nspecial honor are Laura Harris, 17, of Green River and Trinity Rich, \n11, of Douglas. They will each receive an award, an engraved medallion \nand a trip to Washington, D.C.\n  Laura has quite a remarkable story to tell. When she was born she was \ndiagnosed with a heart defect. Her doctors didn't expect her to see her \nteens, but they didn't know Laura. She dealt with her personal \nobstacles by showing others how precious each day and every moment of \ntheir life is. In her words, ``I express my gratitude by providing hope \nto others.''\n  The results she has been able to achieve speak for themselves. She \nhas uplifted the spirits of dozens of sick children, kept newborn \ninfants in foster care warm with the blankets she made for them, and \nprovided support to the veterans in her neighborhood who need help with \nchores around their homes. Simply put, Laura is always there with a \nhelping hand to assure those in need that someone cares. While so many \nyoung men and women are busy looking for ways to have fun, Laura keeps \nbusy looking for ways to be of service.\n  Our other volunteer champion, Trinity Rich, is in the fifth grade. \nShe learned about the importance of reaching out to help others in need \nduring a visit to her grandmother's apartment building. She saw that \nher grandmother wasn't the only one who needed a little help so that's \nwhat she began to do.\n  It wasn't long before Trinity's willingness to be of help and share \nthe tremendous gift of her time and talents were making a difference \nall around her neighborhood. Whatever the need was, Trinity was there, \ngiving her all to make things better.\n  In the process both Laura and Trinity have learned an important \nlesson--the more you give of yourself to help others the more you \nreceive in the satisfaction of knowing you have made someone else's \nlife better. It's a blessing that will stay with them as they continue \nto observe the changes in their town, their neighborhood and their own \nbackyard.\n  Two other young Wyomingites are also being recognized as \nDistinguished Finalists this year and will receive engraved bronze \nmedallions honoring them for their work. One is Adam Jones, 18, of \nOtto, Wyoming. Adam led the effort to complete the roofing and siding \non an important facility at his local park. He was able to do so well \nin part because he was able to recruit 20 fellow Boy Scouts for the \ntask at hand. I am a big supporter of Scouting because Scouts have been \nmaking a difference in their communities for 105 years with much more \nto come. This is just more proof of their determination to make their \npart of the world a better place to live.\n  Our other finalist, Hannah Nieslanik, is a 17 year old from Cokeville \nwho has also been getting involved in her community. She is now a \ncertified emergency medical responder who helps the emergency medical \nresponse team care for those facing a medical crisis.\n  All of these young people are winners in the important task of \nhelping to inspire others to get more active and involved. We all have \na gift to share with those who need our help. If we don't take action \nthe change we could bring to our community will never happen. The four \nyouth volunteers I have named here are all leaders who lead the best \nway--by example.\n  Recognition by this prestigious Community Awards program means a \ngreat deal to all those who earned their awards this year. What means \neven more, I am sure, is the difference these individuals have made. \nThe renewed sense of hope they have helped to instill in those they \nhave helped and the smiles of appreciation they have received has made \nit clear how important their work is.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nensure the safety and effectiveness of medically important \nantimicrobials approved for use in the prevention and control of animal \ndiseases, in order to minimize the development of antibiotic-resistant \nbacteria; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the \nPrevention of Antibiotic Resistance Act, along with my colleague \nSenator Susan Collins. This bill will help to prevent the rise of \nantibiotic resistant pathogens by ensuring that antibiotics are used \nprudently and judiciously in the agriculture industry.\n  Antibiotic resistance is a growing public health threat. The Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, estimate that antibiotic-\nresistant bacteria cause at least 23,000 deaths and 2 million \ninfections each year in the United States. The CDC also estimates that \nantibiotic resistance costs the United States $20 billion in excess \nhealth costs each year. These statistics will only worsen if we do not \ntake meaningful steps to reduce inappropriate and unnecessary \nantibiotic use.\n  The agriculture industry has long used antibiotics to increase and \nmaintain animal weight gain and feed efficiency. The industry has also \nrelied on administering antibiotics to stave off infections associated \nwith poor biosecurity or sanitation in barns and feedlots. However, \nbased on what we know now about antibiotic resistance, these practices \nno longer make sense.\n  I am particularly concerned about the rise of antibiotic resistance \nin foodborne pathogens. Foodborne illness is already a pressing public \nhealth problem, and the United States must ensure that agricultural \nantibiotic use practices do not lead to antibiotic resistance in \nfoodborne bacteria.\n  Already, the CDC estimates that 410,000 antibiotic resistant \nSalmonella and Campylobacter infections occur each year. In fact, \nnearly 1 in 4 Campylobacter infections analyzed by the CDC is drug-\nresistant.\n  The CDC has also discovered that multidrug-resistant Salmonella \nresults in more virulent infections, causing higher rates of \nhospitalization and bloodstream infections than normally expected with \nSalmonella infections. Clearly, more needs to be done to fight \nantibiotic resistance. This legislation will ensure that all medically \nimportant antibiotics approved for use in livestock feed and water pose \nno risk to human health due to the development of antibiotic \nresistance.\n  In 2013, the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, took a critically \nimportant first step by issuing Guidance for Industry 213, a policy \nthat will eliminate the use of antibiotics for feed efficiency or \nweight gain uses in food-animal production. I am glad that the \npharmaceutical and agriculture industries plan to adopt FDA's policy. \nThis is a victory for public health, and I am eager to see this policy \nfully implemented.\n  However, FDA's judicious antibiotic use policy has a gap that must be \naddressed in order to fully protect public health. You see, many of the \nantibiotics previously approved for disease prevention and control are \nat high risk of abuse or misuse.\n  Some of these approved uses are at similar low doses as the \nproduction uses being phased out by FDA judicious use policies. Other \nuses do not have a defined duration of use or aren't approved at a \ntherapeutic dose expected to treat a specific bacterial pathogen.\n  In fact, the FDA has informed my staff that there are likely 107 \nantibiotics approved for disease prevention or control that fall into \nthese categories. This is a problem as some producers may rely on these \ndrugs far too often as a way to maintain animal production or to \nprevent recurrent infections when these important issues could be \nsolved with better sanitation, biosecurity, and animal husbandry.\n  This legislation would require pharmaceutical companies to submit \nadditional information to the FDA to demonstrate that a disease \nprevention or control use of the drug does not pose a risk to human \nhealth due to the development of antibiotic resistance. It would apply \nonly to antibiotics approved for disease prevention or control that are \nat high risk of overuse.\n  If there is no risk to human health, the drug sponsor would also have \nto provide evidence to revise the conditions of using an antibiotic for \ndisease prevention or control to ensure the drug is only used \njudiciously and sparingly. These revised drug approvals would be \nrequired to specify a therapeutic dose, be shown to control a specific \nbacterial infection, be targeted only to the group of animals at risk \nof developing a specific infection, and specify a defined duration of \nuse.\n  The bill also includes a sense of the Senate that all medically \nimportant antibiotics should be used only on the order of a licensed \nveterinarian who has a valid veterinarian-client-patient relationship \nwith a producer.\n  This means that the veterinarian is familiar with the animals to \nwhich he or she is prescribing an antibiotic. Veterinary oversight is a \nkey component of ensuring that antibiotics are not used inappropriately \nor unnecessarily.\n  This legislation, therefore, would allow for medically important \nantibiotics to be used to prevent or control infections when absolutely \nnecessary and when it does not pose a risk to human health. In addition \nto protecting human health, this legislation will help to preserve the \nefficacy of antibiotic for veterinarians, so that the drugs will \ncontinue to be effective for treating livestock and poultry when no \nother alternatives to these drugs exist.\n  Antibiotic resistance is a growing public health threat. If we do not \nact now, many more Americans will suffer and, in some cases, die from \ninfections that are no longer treatable. This legislation will protect \npublic health while\n\n[[Page S1219]]\n\nallowing the agriculture sector to use antibiotics when absolutely \nnecessary to preserve animal health. I ask my colleagues to work with \nme to enact this important bipartisan bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Coons, and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 622. A bill to strengthen families' engagement in the education of \ntheir children; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce the Family Engagement in \nEducation Act with my colleagues Senator Coons and Senator Whitehouse. \nI thank Representatives Thompson and DeSaulnier for introducing the \nHouse companion of this bipartisan bill.\n  Research demonstrates that family engagement in a child's education \nincreases student achievement, improves attendance, and reduces dropout \nrates. A study by Anne Seitsinger and Steven Brand at the University of \nRhode Island's Center for School Improvement and Educational Policy \nfound that students whose parents support their education through \nlearning activities at home and discuss the importance of education \nperform better in school. The importance of family engagement begins \neven before a child enters school. For example, Scholastic's recent \nKids and Family Reading Report found that among children ages 6-11, 60 \npercent of frequent readers, those who read 5-7 days per week for fun, \nwere read to aloud by a parent 5-7 times per week before they entered \nkindergarten.\n  Too often, however, family engagement is not built into our school \nimprovement efforts in a systematic way. The Family Engagement in \nEducation Act will promote and strengthen meaningful family engagement \npolicies and programs at the national, State, and local levels to \nensure that all students are on track to be career and college-ready.\n  Our legislation will empower parents by increasing school district \nresources dedicated to family engagement activities from one percent to \n2 percent of the district's Title I allocation. It will also improve \nthe quality of family engagement practices at the school level by \nrequiring school districts to develop and implement standards-based \npolicies and practices for family-school partnerships. It will build \nState and local capacity for effective family engagement in education \nby setting aside at least 0.3 percent of the State Title I allocation \nfor statewide family engagement in education activities, such as \nestablishing statewide family engagement centers to continue and \nenhance the work that had been supported through the Parent Information \nResource Centers. For States with Title I-A allocations above $60 \nmillion, grants will be provided to at least one local family \nengagement in education center to provide innovative programming and \nservices, such as leadership training and family literacy, to local \nfamilies and to remove barriers to family engagement, and to support \nactivities in the highest need areas of the State. Finally, at the \nnational level, our legislation will require the Secretary of Education \nto convene practitioners, researchers, and other experts in the field \nof family engagement in education to develop recommended metrics for \nmeasuring the quality and outcomes of family engagement in a child's \neducation.\n  This legislation builds on my successful efforts in the last \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, ESEA, \nthe 2001 No Child Left Behind Act, to incorporate provisions throughout \nthe law to strengthen and boost parental involvement. Developed with \nthe National Family, School, and Community Engagement Working Group, \nwhich includes organizations such as National PTA, United Way \nWorldwide, Harvard Family Research Project, and National Council of La \nRaza, and endorsed by hundreds of local, State, and national \norganizations, this legislation represents the broad consensus that we \nmust do a better job of engaging families in all aspects of their \nchildren's education.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the Family Engagement in Education \nAct, and to work for its inclusion in forthcoming legislation to \nreauthorize and renew the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/02/senate-section/article/S1219-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1219-S1220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 93--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n COURAGEOUS WORK AND LIFE OF RUSSIAN OPPOSITION LEADER BORIS NEMTSOV, \n AND CALLING FOR A SWIFT AND TRANSPARENT INVESTIGATION INTO HIS TRAGIC \n                 MURDER IN MOSCOW ON FEBRUARY 27, 2015\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON (for himself, Mrs. Shaheen, Ms. Ayotte, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \nDurbin, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Cotton, Mr. Kaine, Mr. Kirk, Mr. \nCardin, Mr. Corker, Mr. Risch, Mr. Markey, Mr. Coons, Mr. Murphy, Mr. \nBlumenthal, Mr. Gardner, Mr. Wicker, and Mr. Isakson) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                               S. Res. 93\n\n       Whereas, on February 27, 2015, former deputy prime minister \n     Boris Nemtsov was shot four times in the back within view of \n     the Kremlin and a few short blocks from FSB headquarters in \n     Russia's capital city Moscow;\n       Whereas Mr. Nemtsov dedicated his life to the cause of \n     freedom and human rights for the Russian people and sought to \n     rid Russia's government of the corruption that fuels \n     authoritarianism;\n       Whereas President Barack Obama called Mr. Nemtsov a \n     ``tireless advocate'' for the rights of Russian citizens;\n       Whereas Prime Minister David Cameron said Mr. Nemtsov's \n     ``life was dedicated to speaking up tirelessly for the \n     Russian people, to demanding their right to democracy and \n     liberty under the rule of law, and to an end to corruption. \n     He did so without fear, and never gave in to intimidation'';\n       Whereas, on March 1, 2015, over 50,000 people representing \n     a wide range of political parties and movements marched \n     solemnly through Moscow to honor Mr. Nemtsov's life, many \n     holding signs saying ``I am not afraid'';\n       Whereas, before his death, Mr. Nemtsov planned to lead a \n     Spring March on March 1, 2015, against the Russian military's \n     presence in Ukraine;\n       Whereas, in the weeks prior to his death, Mr. Nemtsov had \n     reportedly been meeting with the families of Russian soldiers \n     killed during Russia's military operations in Ukraine;\n       Whereas Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said Mr. \n     Nemtsov planned to release an investigative report showing \n     proof of Russia's role in the Ukraine crisis;\n       Whereas, two years ago, Mr. Nemtsov led the release of a \n     report titled, ``Winter Olympics in the Sub-Tropics: \n     Corruption and Abuse in Sochi'', which implicated Russian \n     President Vladimir Putin in the estimated $26,000,000,000 \n     frittered away in ``embezzlement and kickbacks'';\n       Whereas Mr. Nemtsov said on Ekho Moskvy radio hours before \n     his murder that President Putin was inserting Russia into the \n     ongoing conflict by his ``mad, aggressive and deadly policy \n     of war against Ukraine,'' and asserted ``when power is \n     concentrated in the hands of one person and this person rules \n     forever, this will lead to absolute catastrophe, absolute'';\n       Whereas, according to Mr. Nemtsov's lawyer, Vadim \n     Prokhorov, the activist reported threats to his safety to \n     police authorities who failed to provide him with protection;\n       Whereas Mr. Nemtsov's associates, such as leading \n     opposition figure Alexei Navalny, stated that Mr. Nemtsov \n     would have been under clear state surveillance as he walked \n     toward the Kremlin shortly before his murder;\n       Whereas Mr. Nemtsov was murdered in one of the most \n     heavily-secured areas of Moscow;\n       Whereas opposition activist Ilya Yashin, commenting on the \n     murder of Nemtsov, stated that ``the atmosphere of hatred \n     toward alternative thinkers that has formed over the past \n     year, since the annexation of Crimea, may have played its \n     role,'' referring to the surge of intense and officially \n     endorsed nationalist discourse in Russia since it annexed \n     Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula;\n       Whereas President Putin called critics of his government \n     policy ``a fifth column'' and ``national traitors,'' inviting \n     violent attacks upon them;\n       Whereas President Putin warned publically in 2012, shortly \n     after returning to the Presidency, that his opponents were \n     planning to stage a murder of their own as a ``provocation'';\n       Whereas several prominent critics of President Putin and \n     his government have died gruesomely since he came to power as \n     head of the Russian National Security Service and through his \n     current office of President;\n       Whereas, on September 21, 2000, Iskandar Khatloni, a \n     reporter for the Tajik-language service of Radio Free Europe/\n     Radio Liberty who had been working on stories about human \n     rights abuses in Chechnya, was killed in his apartment by an \n     ax-wielding assailant;\n       Whereas, on August 21, 2002, Vladimir Golovlyov, leader of \n     the Liberal Russia faction in the lower house of parliament, \n     was shot to death in a Moscow park while walking his dog \n     after accusing President Putin of autocratic governance;\n\n[[Page S1220]]\n\n       Whereas, on July 3, 2003, Yuri Shchekochikhin, a vocal \n     opposition journalist and member of the Russian Duma \n     investigating the 1999 apartment bombings that killed nearly \n     300 people, died 12 days after being hospitalized for a \n     mysterious illness, believed to be poison, before he could \n     travel to the United States to discuss Russian corruption \n     cases with the Federal Bureau of Investigation;\n       Whereas, on October 7, 2006, journalist and human-rights \n     activist Anna Politkovskaya, an outspoken critic of the \n     Kremlin, was shot and killed in her Moscow apartment \n     building;\n       Whereas, on November 3, 2006, Alexander Litvinenko, a \n     former KGB officer and vocal critic of President Putin, was \n     poisoned when radioactive polonium-210 was allegedly slipped \n     into his tea as he met with two former Russian security \n     services men in a restaurant in a London hotel, and British \n     investigators have said they have evidence of Russian \n     involvement in the murder of Litvinenko;\n       Whereas, on August 31, 2008, Magomed Yevloyev, owner of a \n     news site called Ingushetiya, popular for its human rights \n     and press freedom stories, died from a gunshot wound to the \n     head sustained while being transported by regional Ingushetia \n     police following his arrest at the airport in the regional \n     capital;\n       Whereas, on January 19, 2009, human rights lawyer Stanslav \n     Markelov, who defended opponents of the Government of the \n     Russian Federation, was shot dead by a man using a pistol in \n     the middle of the afternoon on a busy street in Moscow;\n       Whereas, on July 15, 2009, Russian human rights journalist \n     and activist Natalia Estemirova was abducted in front of her \n     home in Grozny, Chechnya, taken across the border into \n     Ingushetia, shot, and dumped in a roadside gutter;\n       Whereas, on November 16, 2009, after human rights lawyer \n     Sergei Magnitsky was jailed for uncovering $230,000,000 in \n     tax fraud perpetuated by Russian officials, died in prison \n     after being beaten and enduring horrible conditions and \n     suffering from pancreatitis that did not receive adequate \n     medical care;\n       Whereas President Obama called for a ``prompt, impartial, \n     and transparent'' investigation to bring the perpetrators of \n     Mr. Nemtsov's murder to justice;\n       Whereas Secretary of State John Kerry stated ``We hope the \n     authorities will join the world in producing the credible, \n     transparent investigation necessary to find out who did--who \n     was behind this and who did it.'';\n       Whereas Prime Minister Cameron stated that the callous \n     murder must be ``fully, rapidly and transparently \n     investigated, and those responsible brought to justice'';\n       Whereas suspicion of Russian authorities in Mr. Nemtsov's \n     murder cannot be ruled out given his criticism of the regime;\n       Whereas far too few of those responsible in the killings \n     cited above have been brought to justice, raising serious \n     questions about the ability of Russian authorities to conduct \n     a credible investigation into Mr. Nemtsov's murder;\n       Whereas impunity and lack of accountability prevail in the \n     Russian Federation;\n       Whereas law enforcement, judicial, and investigative bodies \n     are often used to target political opponents and civil \n     society in the Russian Federation and thus lack the \n     credibility to conduct an investigation themselves; and\n       Whereas the Russian Federation is a member of both the \n     Organization for the Security and Cooperation in Europe and \n     the Council of Europe, and these independent groups should be \n     considered for investigation into Mr. Nemtsov's murder in \n     order to lend the investigation credibility: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the courageous work of Russian opposition \n     leader Boris Nemstov, who dedicated his life to the fight \n     against corruption and in support of the universal and \n     inalienable rights of the Russian people to freely choose \n     their leaders and live according to democratic standards;\n       (2) calls for a swift and transparent investigation into \n     his tragic murder using mechanisms from either the \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) or \n     the Council of Europe, including allowing willing OSCE member \n     states to invoke the Moscow Mechanism, as was done with \n     Belarus in 2011;\n       (3) encourages the public release of all surveillance tapes \n     in the area surrounding the crime scene from different \n     sources and angles to aid in the investigation;\n       (4) urges the President to add the names of persons that \n     Mr. Nemtsov requested be added to the visa ban list as \n     provided for by the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law \n     Accountability Act of 2012 (title IV of Public Law 112-208; \n     126 Stat. 1502) and continue to sanction human rights \n     violators;\n       (5) encourages the President to send a high level United \n     States delegation to Mr. Nemtsov's funeral service; and\n       (6) calls on the President to significantly increase United \n     Sates Government support for like-minded partners in the \n     Russian Federation and the region to combat the flow of \n     propaganda and the climate of hatred created by President \n     Putin in the Russian Federation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day":

Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate a very special \nday in history, particularly in Texas history, a day that inspires \npride and gratitude in the hearts of all the people who call Texas \nhome.\n  I rise today to commemorate Texas Independence Day, which is today. I \nwill in a moment read a letter written 179 years ago from behind the \nwalls of an old Spanish mission called the Alamo in my hometown of San \nAntonio, a letter written by a 26-year-old lieutenant colonel in the \nTexas Army, William Barret Travis. In doing so, I carry on a tradition \nstarted by the late Senator John Tower, who represented Texas in this \nbody for over two decades. This tradition was upheld by his successor, \nSenator Phil Gramm, and by his second successor, Senator Kay Bailey \nHutchison, after him. It is a tremendous honor that this privilege has \nnow fallen to me.\n  On February 24, 1836, with his position under siege and outnumbered\n\n[[Page S1221]]\n\nnearly 10 to 1 by the forces of the Mexican dictator Antonio Lopez de \nSanta Anna, Travis penned the following letter:\n  To the People of Texas and All Americans in the World:\n\n       Fellow citizens & compatriots--\n       I am besieged by a thousand or more of the Mexicans under \n     Santa Anna.\n       I have sustained a continual Bombardment and cannonade for \n     24 hours and have not lost a man.\n       The enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion. \n     Otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the sword, if the \n     fort is taken.\n       I have answered the demand with a cannon shot, and our flag \n     still waves proudly from the walls.\n       I shall never surrender or retreat.\n       Then, I call on you in the name of Liberty, of patriotism \n     and everything dear to the American character, to come to our \n     aid, with all dispatch.\n       The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily and will no \n     doubt increase to three or four thousand in four or five \n     days.\n       If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain \n     myself as long as possible and die like a soldier who never \n     forgets what is due to his own honor and that of his country.\n       Victory or Death.\n\n  Signed: ``William Barret Travis.''\n  As history reveals, in the battle that ensued all 189 defenders of \nthe Alamo lost their lives, but they did not die in vain. The Battle of \nthe Alamo actually brought precious time for the Texas revolutionaries, \nunder the leadership of GEN Sam Houston, to maneuver his army into \nposition for a decisive victory in the Battle of San Jacinto.\n  With this victory--the Battle of San Jacinto--Texas became a \nsovereign and independent republic. For 9 years the Republic of Texas \nthrived as an independent nation, and then in 1845 it agreed to join \nthe United States as the 28th State. Many of the Texas patriots who \nfought in the revolution went on to serve in the U.S. Congress.\n  I am honored to hold the seat once occupied by Sam Houston, one of \nthe first two U.S. Senators to the new State of Texas, and more broadly \nI am honored to have the opportunity to serve almost 27 million Texans \nbecause of the sacrifices made by these brave men 179 years ago.\n  May we always remember the Alamo, and may God continue to bless Texas \nand these United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/02/senate-section/article/S1221-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:45 A.M.
